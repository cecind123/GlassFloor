rating,review
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"if you like being constantly watched chained to your desk this company is for you management is not to be trusted.  unfair , no one has your back not a place to work"
bad,"Opposite of what they are claiming. They keep on bragging about being a FORTUNE 5 Company but they're nothing but a bad company when it comes to managing their employees."
bad,Managers and team leads play favorites. This place needs to have an internal investigation in regards to the management team and their unethical practices. Worst work experience of my life. This is specific the Shelton CT location.
bad,"A empresa Amil não é uma empresa ruim para se trabalhar, porém após ser vendida aos americanos sofreu algumas mudanças radicais de gestão."
bad,I would not work for this company again. They do not appreciate there employees and the pay rate Is low and they care more about the customers then the employees.
bad,It was very unorganized. They pay was a joke. Management was horrible. Too much work for such little pay. The schedule was the only thing that was great.
bad,"Their values are lies. It’s all smoking mirrors. Very disorganized, poorly managed, they don’t value clinical assessments only the bottom line. They don’t care"
bad,"For a healthcare company, they do not care about the health of their employees at all.  They demand ""Mandatory Overtime"" on holidays and weekends with threat of job loss if you don't comply or actually have a life outside of the place.  The facility had two small restrooms for 300 people and the toilets were out of order most of the time.  The electrical system was out of code and dangerous to the employees.  They stuff you into tiny cubicles and do not allow you to leave your box without permission.  The place sucks to work at.  If you value your health, don't work there."
bad,"They chew people up and spit them out like peanuts, some will succeed but most will not. They don't have much patience and constantly threaten you with termination. Not very employee friendly."
bad,My job was outsourced. They led by fear based management. They do not care about their employees only the bottom line. I do not recommend this employer at all.
bad,"Job switches you when you don't want to be. Supervisors are rude and messy and so is the director. The old director and manager were great, but left. Another manager was also good. I hated working there once they switched me from my old supervisor to a rude one and once the old director and manager left it wasn't the same. I left 08/2019"
bad,I would not recommend working at United Healthcare. They do not care about their employees and they do not keep their word. Management is unprofessional.
bad,"I did not like working for this company. I cannot describe the culture, it depends on what department and who you worked for. fire drills galore. unsupportive management and confusing direction/vision"
bad,Everything from the interview to the actual job itself was awful. The interview process is excessively long for no good reason. Many of my colleagues were incompetent. I actually feared for patients under their care. Micromanagement is rampant. I really wanted to love this job with such a great company but I would run. I'd rather go back to working 12 back breaking hours hours in the hospital.
bad,"Awful management, ran by nasty, ghetto people they treat you bad and just a bad job overall, they treat you like a prisoner, micromanage you and count your minutes to a tee. You can't even be a minute late or they will raise... In this day and age, jobs like that are not what people are searching for."
bad,"The training was all over the place,  there were physical fights with staff and trainee's inside classroom,  the training hours were not ok, didn't get a clear understanding of my role once training was complete."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The Memphis office is fraud! The supervisors are incompetent and the manager spends her day looking in the mirror! There's nothing to motivate agents.
bad,"supervisors are not well trained on hr administration of policies and procedures and due process no wonder UHG has a lot of labor cases, They can be power tripping."
bad,Trainings need to be revamped and more efficient as well as organized and communication needs to be better across the board. Need better support for their employees. The company should learn to follow their own values.
bad,"Low pay, health benefits costs are outrageous,  poor training for remote workers, micro management for remote workers. Beware they record every keystroke and have a clock running on every task you do. If your production isn't over 100% you get written up. Crappiest healthcare employer in America."
bad,"Me sentir trabalhando em manicômio ,chefia louca 24 horas mandando mensagem no WhatsApp em um grupo que a mesma criou e ainda ameaça os colaboradores de advertências caso saia do grupo . coagindo os funcionários a fazer vídeos de treinamento de equipamentos ,provas de áreas específico quando o movimento fica franco e alega que é regra da instituição ."
bad,"I was a supervisor at the Stockton facility for two years. It was awful, poor leadership, no mentorship, no trust between upper management and supervisors. You have no say so in the decision making. And they commit illegal job practices that will eventually have everybody out of a job, fines and possible jail time. The staff has NO RESPECT for leadership, on call WAY TOO MUCH and call outs are so bad that's it's disrespecful. DON'T waste your time. YOU WILL REGRET IT!"
bad,"Horrible, Don’t even hope for crumbs off the table of the billionaires that own and operate this nut house. Call center BS and no compassion for the elderly clients that overpay for this S"
bad,"Every year after making the financial goals, the employees do not get hardly any raises. The performance goals are unattainable and force shortcuts. Then if you are on a medical leave of absence, they fire you and do not care about the EDD fines."
bad,"You would be WRONG if you thought UHC, a health insurance company gives their employees good health benefits. Micromanaging is the management style. Remember the only opinion appreciated is the one UHC gives you. Most people in this job are told they are in constant threat of being fired. A successful person in this job is able to stomach the nonstop cheerleading about this company."
bad,"This job and management are structured perfectly for running their employees straight into the ground. Days were long due to required travel. Morning meetings were pointless. Providers were unaccepting of instituted changes, and they often pushed back against assessors, even though we were not in a position to effect change. It was the most thankless job I have ever worked. I would not recommend this employer to my worst enemy."
bad,Company is a great place to work at if you have no career goal.  They do not cultivate or empower their employees to climb the ladder or success. If you are not in a certain pay raise you will be stifled.
bad,"This company does not care for its employees, management was horrific and ever changing. If you were not in the “ favorite group” you were passed over for any advancement opportunities."
bad,"Management was poor, which brought down the work environment.  They did not support the work force.  They looked down on team members who took time off, such as sick time and FMLA.  They would advise you that you had the time to take but would punish you when you used your time.  They treated the team members as though they were children, micro managed them.  They were not sensitive to team member personal matters such as:  deaths of family member, divorce, etc.  These types of events are often requiring time off for people.  United Healthcare does acknowledge these events for workforce.  These matters were only acknowledge for management.  "
bad,They are horrible.  Lay off and then rehire others that are less qualified.  They don't even look at  who they are laying off and then wonder why they are losing money
bad,"hard work isn't the problem.  It how little respect they have for employees.  They always fire the most experienced so they can pay slave wages."
bad,"Poor work- life balance. This location was acquired by United as I was leaving, unfortunately they haven't cleared out the previous staff that creates a toxic work environment. New managers are good, but I doubt they will stay. Poor communication skills, borderline intimidation, nskills each individual brings to the table. This place has so much potential to tap into, but lacks the"
bad,Great training however the job itself was Stress full. I’m not really sure what else to write as this job was 5 years ago. I do apologize for this terrible review

bad,it was an ok place to work and it was fun the ours was ok and i like the challenge at the job. a great place to work. Having the challenge a day to work
bad,Managers and supervisors use bullying tactics and threats to employees to keep them in line. Managers have their favorites and those employees are promoted and given the best raises. Promise everything and deliver nothing. WORST place I ever worked at. Supervisor has been taken to HR several times  Still has her job!!
bad,"Do not work here.  not a good company.  no opportunity for advancement  low pay.  HR is remote and impossible to work with. Since it’s so large, each manager runs their team different.  impossible to get a raise or promotion. Lacking diversity."
bad,They keep you through your first raise and lay off just prior to your second. Very unrealistic and unprofessional. They promise you the world to start but then treat you as the black sheep of the company. Run Forest Run
bad,"They have customers take surveys and hold it against you. If the cutomer calls back with in 2 days they hold it against you."
bad,"Very slow pay and not enough leads or money to sustain a person for as much work as they expect in one month I signed 10 people and got paid 1,000 at the most used my own car gas and money to do the job meetings were everyday and managers are always on your case at odd night hours"
bad,For a health insurance company I would have expected better benefits. This company had the worst health benefits I've ever encountered. In addition to that they were very stingy on raises as well as bonuses. The diversity in the company is basically non existent in MN.
bad,"Absolutely nothing to say about United Healthcare. I worked here for 11 years. Its a place to work.  They specialize in insurance. Again, United Healthcare is a place to work."
bad,"I hated working here! They make it nearly impossible for you to meet your numbers while maintaining good customer service. You are driven to choose between delivering good customer service in order to meet number expectations and not get written up, or provide great customer service and get written up because you took too long on a call. Horrible company to work for. Don't even get me started on management."
bad,This place is terrible. The work is terrible. Everyone is miserable. Great place to get call center experience and then bounce. If you can go to BCBS they are much better. Any insurance place is better than UHG. I'd rather have open heart surgery with no anesthetic before I work here again. This place is a plantation but instead of picking cotton you are picking keys on your keyboard. Terrible place.
bad,"no support from management.poor benefits. company likes to think they care about employees far from it.more concerned with their reputation. more concerned about giving back to the community(making sure publicity knows it) than giving a little to the employees.no consistency when paying providers, when asked why claims were not paid never got a straight answer. make sure you are up for a lot of abuse when taking this position."
bad,Very unprofessional and have an high turnover. They need better management. Longer training classes. Employees should dress as if they are meeting clients/customers as if they're going see them in person. More phone training for the employees. Have assessments to see how well the employees are doing when on a call with clients.
bad,The managers don't seem to know anything about what is going on in their departments. The pay and raises are next to nothing. The work environment is like being back in high school. The insurance plan doesn't cover much  and your cost are high.
bad,Perfect place to work if you want to be micromanged and have all your customer interactions recorded and being nitpicked to death for the most minor of mistakes. Supervisors are wishy-washy and two-faced and only care about if a live body is able to answer phones. Also not able to take time off when needed sucks. Scary place to work.
bad,"This company expects quantity over quality.  This company has the appearance of a great place to work and core values, however behind the scenes they are quantity driven over quality driven at their employees expense."
bad,"Very stressful environment with management listening in on everything. Your restroom breaks are timed and on your schedule. If you need to use the restroom before your scheduled time management will give you verbals. Phone calls are timed, managed and you are expected to allow one caller who is known to the company to pleasure herself and if you hang up on her you will also be warned and considered a verbal"
bad,"I loved the position I held as a nurse with United Healthcare, however, poor management, lack of direction, and promotion tactics made the job less enjoyable. The benefits with this company are basically non-existent. Medical and dental are very costly and cover very little. If you are looking for stability, this is not the place for you."
bad,Management gets away with being very unprofessional and very disrespectful.  despite HR recommendations VP will disregard what needs to be corrected within their leadership
bad,"The atmosphere was not pleasant and the Managers micromanaged everyone.   It was a great learning experience, but not a pleasant place to work.  The people were nice, but that's about all."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"PROS"
bad,"Very Bad experience with UHG. I was working on contract, I was not paid my salary. I have written many emails but not get any response. I have given my best to UHG, but I have received negative response from them."
bad,"Poor training, need more individual ongoing training, poor management, poor pay, too many systems password and access issues, supervisors are not knowledgeable, etc."
bad,Management is horrible. Favoritism is at play. Unprofessional environment. No growth. The management hired there friends and are getting rid of good employees
bad,Don’t waste your time working for United healthcare. This place is stressful. My supervisor was an idiot. The pay sucks. This is a company with no direction.
bad,Terrible Supervisors and company. do not follow own mission statement has no integrity or respect for others. Try to keep you in one position. no advancement
bad,"There is not a lot of positives that I have to say about working for UHG."
bad,"This company in 09/16/2019. Fire them 145 reps from medicaid program. The excuse for close all these positions, was; SEVERANCE personal reduction. The manager contact all rep.(including me) by phone. He just only said; Hi, your last day in the company (united healthcare) is today 09/17/2019, the reason your position is closed. Is by severance job position. That’s all."
bad,"The company is too big where it will make money no matter what.  That means, middle management can completely sink a department to the bottom of the sea with horrid decisions, constant problems, stress, etc, and they will never experience any accountability.  My life was terrible here.  There are a number of departments, so your luck may vary.  But the incompetence, emotional manipulation, and managers having a meltdown were way way way too much."
bad,"I worked for United Healthcare through Optum. It was a nightmare. Management did not express expectations and when something was needed to get done, management used fear tactics to keep co-workers working."
bad,"$15-Per enrollment for med advantage plans...8 Tiered payplan...$5- For pdp enrollments?????? Lol  what a joke..."
bad,"Getto. Disgusting. Ruins you resume for the next job. Dont bother.  For the little money youre paid, you have to check the hours you paid,  they will rob you. English is barely spoken off the phone. And I do speak another language"
bad,They missed treated me and my education level. The staff was self-centered and did not want to acknowledge new employees. They lied about needing help with work and when they were in trouble then management would ask me to help and ask again and again if they need help. So unprofessional and employees were aloud to car pool with me and smoke to offices at anytime in scrubbs. Not good management and this location will make sure that you feel worthless. I was told to sue them by Human Resources because they were making false accusations on days that I had already resigned from weeks prior to my last day.
bad,"I applied at UnitedHealth Group as a telesales agent. I have been licensed for 14 years and I am licensed in 41 States. I thought that I would be a good fit as I used to sell their product in the field, as well as in a call center for a third party. So I know their product extremely well. To my surprise, I was surprised when they sent me a rejection email saying that I did not meet the qualifications for the job. Anyhow, I got a good laugh because I guess they do not know how to hire, Prospect, or look for good recruits. So sad that such a company is this does not know how to deal with the public or recruit properly. Looks like I dodged a bullet folks!"
bad,"eewww, do not work here, they do not care about employees at all, you will be less than a number to them. no job security, no work-life balance-management is horrible, no advancement opportunity, job culture sucks, pay sucks, benefits suck, overall horrible employer."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it. Micromanaging and no care for employees."
bad,"Leadership HAS TO GO!! "
bad,Worst place to work. Very stressful. Unorganized. Orientation done on your own. I would not recommend any one to work there. HR does not know what they are doing.
bad,Production based. Outbound sales only . You have to buy your own vacation time which is only 1 week. If you need a entry level job this is for you. Great Volunteer programs only POSITIVE about this job.Impossible metrics
bad,If you want to be consistantly striving to try and reach unobtainable goals along with a manager that pings you daily on your metrics and you recieve a 1% raise this is the place for you.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Not good upper management,  was not helpful at all, benefits and hourly wage was not good. Not a good fit if you're looking to move up into another position"
bad,"Kingston UHC excells in these areas:"
bad,If you are ok with the kid handing you your food through the window making more money then you it's probably fine.   The benefits are a joke.  The pay is embarrassing for what is expected of you.  They assume they can get away with paying you so little simply because you are suppose to feel proud to have a career vs at job.  The training is inadequate and the support is questionable. T
bad,"I worked for United Health for three years as a Advocate 4me. When I first came on to the company, I was very excited and they promoted growth and opportunities within the company. Once I got on the floor, everything changed within a blink of an eye. The managers, and business managers are very unprofessional and they speak to their employees in a very rude manner. Some of the management get excited if they discover errors on the agents call and the rejoice about it. They promoted many people and not even a year they laid the entire department off. From my observations they only promote those who kiss up to them. After witnessing some much at this company I lost faith in them and at that point I did not see myself wanting to build a career with them any longer. i am a very professional, educated individual and I knew my time was up. Recently they just did another huge lay off, and I was included in the lay off. I am disappointed in how they approached it but i'm not disappointed on the layoff because the job was super stressful and caused me and others to go into great depression. I do not recommend this job to anyone because they make excuses as to why you can not be promoted from the phone. Now i don't believe that the entire United Healthcare company is a terrible place to work, but the depart I worked in which is the Customer Service department is terrible, working under terrible people. Also the amount of work we do as advocates, they really should pay more."
bad,Culture of fear and abysmal communication. Worked on line for a HEDIS project.  Stupidity in motion.  Change in managers times 2 and that is just a stupid way to do business.  Minimal on line support and not enough work to do and then they blame you for not doing enough work.  Tell you the rules of the project and then changed the rules and give you a statistic of how you didn't do something correctly.  UHG is so unprofessional and typical corporate where the highest persons get paid millions and the people who do all the work are getting paid pennies.
bad,"Working for UHG was a very stressful work environment, supervisors micro-managed employees, there were unreasonable goals and time limits, and they paid the lowest pay in the industry.  While there I also experienced extreme favoritism."
bad,"They mention that they have the option to work from home when interviewing, but there are so many meetings that require in person attendance that it becomes just a struggle just to get a desk. When the weather is extremely bad they will still require meetings in person. They let you know how low valued you are. Upper management is demanding & it won’t be a good fit unless you’re a work addict. They hire quickly then realize they’ve spent too much and start firing or outsourcing. Not a very stable work environment and not very friendly coworkers."
bad,Basically major medical for medical insurance. No real opportunity to move up. Really don’t care about the employees. It’s all about the numbers. And the shareholders.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work there. Very unorganized. Mangers did not work well with there employees, Questions were not answered in a timely matter when help was needed."
bad,"Underpaid overworked, don’t promote based on fit for job but who that like and golf with or happy hours after work. True good ol boy system in play in the IT department."
bad,"This was the worst job I ever had, micro management . Very poor management they were worried about their bonuses that it. Unethical business practices. Turn around is awful. Had 7 managers in 4 years layoff threats . Worst place ever. Longest 4 years of my life!"
bad,"Awful company stay away. Management micro manages, job security poor. They put you down never build you up. Run fas. Worst company  I have worked fort"
bad,"Poor Management, No HR presence, they hire a bunch of young kids to allow them to play games all day and lay off anyone over the age of 30 that has experience and skills, it's a joke to work there and then they do a ton of hiring to just lay people off"
bad,There is no work life balance. It is all about the bottom line and saving the company money. It isn’t about caring for patients anymore. It is about spending 8 hours of your ten hour day documenting and spending about two hours total per day with patients and families..
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here I've been employed 7 + years and every year gets worse, they dont care about their employees as individuals. You will be looked at like a number not a person."
bad,I worked in Medicare and it was great. I then moved to Medicaid and it was poorly managed. They treated you like a elementary student. The training was horrible. No good benefits in this dept.
bad,Pay is very less. Good for freshers . Transport's team should arrange proper nodal points as per the employees requirements and not as per their convenience.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"UHC talks about culture a lot, but does not follow through. If you do not fit their very narrow idea of ""correct behavior."" Overall, the group of managers I worked with, my peers, were the least intelligent group of people it has ever been my sorry lot to work with."
bad,Needs  new management someone's needs to go in there uncovered and see ... Same got fired cause he tb from work the whole company did not want us to know it's bugs in there you itcb the bathrooms ohh my God terrible
bad,This company is unfair. They hired a lot of people changed the expectations of the job and fired people after they weeded out who they wanted! They try to condition you. I worked there 2 months and never made it out of training!
bad,"Stay away from this company.  if you don't mind being stressed out all the time and work far from home and mandatory hours. Poor pay.  The insurance is very expensive, you would think you would get a discount. but no."
bad,"The company changes daily. You're never sure if you are doing your job correctly until there's a problem. Unrealistic expectations, your job is to contact medical providers to obtain medical records, but the records are retrieved through a third party company. This is a production based job, and your production numbers are dependent on the third party company. If they do not retrieve the medical charts within a certain timeframe, you are penalized for it even though you're only job was to contact the provider to have them send the charts in."
bad,"Horrible work place no work life balance, micromanaged , poor pay poor benefits ..too many responsibilities not enough pay..runnnn if you have an interview no room for growth and they additional job functions without your knowledge, management is constantly changing, company is not stable and will soon go down the drain, yearly raises are less than 0.50 even when meeting metrics !"
bad,Explaining claims and benefits to callers. There were providers and memeber that we would go over the bills they received and needed explanation. Went over what benefits they had on their plans. We’re told when breaks and lunches were. Bathroom time limited
bad,"Typical day at work was walking to your desk, sitting down pulling up all software's, and having back to back phone calls helping members & providers."
bad,"sweat shop for the low grade workers. workplace culture is against elderly workers and of white origin. "
bad,"Training was by computer and not very helpful. Once I finished that, I was thrown to the wolves. Mgr was micromanaging us and they can't seem to keep any employees."
bad,"Wages are poor, and hours are long.  Management will ignore you, and leave you with problems.  There is considerable nepotism, and some staff are sleeping with other staff.  The whole environment is pretty toxic.  Workplace culture is non-existent.  No one will speak to you on an average day.  Environment does not feel safe at times."
bad,"You'll be worked like a human robot, pressured to increase sales, forced to adhere to an inhumane work schedule, watched and monitored like a hospital patient, encouraged to participate in corporate groupthink, etc."
bad,This was not what I had expected... I applied in 2015 to get my foot in the door. It seems a little hard to advance in this company. I believe it depends on what business unit you're in too! The pay/compensation definitely did not match the skills I had... it was like starting all over again in this field.
bad,I was not satisfied the way they handled the lay off. The management does not follow the company's mission. They misguide employee. There is no clear directions from the management.
bad,If the above doesn’t sum it up then you are desperate for a job. You are worth MORE!!! Give yourself credit and avoid this toxic environment that will demand your soul and give nothing in return. Work life balance? NO LIFE ALLOWED is more like it. BENEFITS? Ha!!!!
bad,There is a uncalled for level of drama in this work place. I worked very hard and was only met with drama in return from management and from other co workers
bad,Miss working there.  Great co-workers.  Friendly work environment.  Fantastic training.  Really had a wonderful commute in regards that I did not have to experience to much time in rush hour.
bad,"horrible place to work. would not recommend unless you love selling to people who can't afford things, and unless you like conning people out of their good hard earned money."
bad,"The behavioral health department has a high turnover.  We worked through Hurricane Harvey.  Many houses and cars were damaged while working. There is a block out the month in January where you cannot take off. Paid time off is based on favoritism and paid time off is submitted the first week of February or whenever system work.  Pay raises are based on favoritism.  Talking to the Human Resource, Employee Relations and Supervisors in confidentiality doesn't exist it will come right back to you.  Retaliation and hostile work environment is a result. Compassion, integrity, innovation, relationships and performance are based on their standards. They are on Windows 2010 and it 2019 so the system runs slow. Frequently phone drops call, constant distraction from instant messaging while on mental health calls. Supervisor have too much control over systems,  KPI’s, quality standards, customer surveys reported and call control."

bad,"I would not recommend employment at this facility. I was mistreated, as well as misinformed as to what the position would entail. I did not enjoy working here."
bad,Very poor management. Very unorganized. Too many cliques. Unfair bonus structure. Too unprofessional. No room for advancement. Unfair pay. They really need to invest in quality technology.
bad,"There is nothing to say about this company this was a temp position,there was never the advantage to grow with this company & it was a waste of time. w"
bad,At UHC there is no life work balance.  They are interested in outsourcing to other countries.  Management is ever changing and inconsistent.  There are no advancement opportunities with UHC they prefer to hire and outside the company rather than promote within.  The goals are kept just out of reach of all of the employees.
bad,I really rather not comment on working with this company at all I didn't see any advancement or fair salary for the work you was required to do with this company!
bad,I can not express in words how bad this company is.  I felt dirty working for this evil place.  That is company is allowed to operate in the United States is shocking.
bad,Company's views are very unethical.  No balance between work and personal life.  Constantly changes every employees schedule where they had to cancel anything outside of work.  Fires employees every week with no good reason at all.
bad,I really do not know what you would like for me to say.  The typical work day was repetitive. Management is unfriendly.  The hardest part about the job is no confidentiality.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working from home.
bad,"You have to kiss butt to move up in this company managers gossip with everyone about personal stuff teams aren’t teams it’s each man for themselves and the systems they use are very dated. Stressful"
bad,"work/life balance is poor. New hires get offered more than tenured employees. Barely any yearly raises if any at all, they blame it on the budget but are a fortune 500 company. No advancement based on skill only favoritism. Management very poor and always changing. They do not follow their own cultural values or treat employees fair or with respect. The benefits offered are horrible with very high deductibles. Micromanaged to ""metrics"" but their rating system is outdated, poor and unfair. if you speak up about unfair practices, you are frowned upon or ""blacklisted""."
bad,"Very fast paced call center. Not enough resources to manage your calls, confusing system to locate members benefits. Co-Workers are good support system but not management. Very few get the opportunity to advance up the ladder unless you know someone or suck up. New hires are offered more money that what tenured reps are currently making. Management wont even address it beside stating be grateful you have a job. No room for errors, quick to write you up, no matter how good you are at your job and an asset to the company. They are too concerned about making their numbers and looking good to upper management. Work/Life balance is limited. Very difficult to take time off and needs to be well in advance or it will be an occurrence. The benefits are terrible, most of our members have a better package than they offer the employees, yet we are supposed to be empathetic to their needs and concerns."
bad,"They will replace you just as fast as you were hired. There’s no compassion. No consideration or accommodations. Management is a big gang! They bully and drive employees to mental breakdowns and hr yells it’s policy! Many managers talk down on others who were trained a certain way. Instead of educating! Your punished and threatened with corrective action write up. The cafeteria food is horrible and extremely expensive,  very hard to move to different positions. The Insurance packages are expensive."
bad,"it was alright, i guess,  not the worst place to work at.  it had its charm. not a place for advancement, from what i experienced. too many favorites chosen by the management."
bad,"Worked her for 6 months, training was wonderful, when you hit the floor it was a different experience. I excelled at my job as a scheduling coordinator, it was very easy, when your not being hung up on or told your scamming. Worst part of the job was supervision and management. They never knew answers to questions and told you until you own your own company do as your told or find another job. So that’s what I did."
bad,"Was a loyal hardworking employee for almost 17 years and terminated for something I was instructed to do by my supervisor. No warning, no training opportunity, just there's the door, don't let it hit you on the way out. Real reason, claims was suffering, automation taking over, lost major contract & they didn't want to pay severance pay. Don't waste your time, you WON'T be appreciated!!"
bad,"I would never refer anyone here. "
bad,"Horrible place to work MANAGERS are derived by numbers , workplace harassment, they set you up for failure, RAISE IS BASED ON SURVEYS people have been there for 10 Tre with a .15 cent raise. Upper management always on business trips , they have favoritism if they dnt like you or you are a challenge the will harass and pick till you are gone, and will stop you from advancing."
bad,"if i could give 0 stars i would. terrible place to work for, kim caballero is s a t a n in a tiny body that walks the earth.i would never recommend to work here, everything sucks."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The company of UHC and Tele performance was unorganized and extremely unprofessional . There had been time of checks were not paid on time. Funds were incorrect.
bad,"Poorly managed company that employs temps with the promise of full-time employment and remote work but just strings them along and tries to control time off even though temp agency has that domain. Just a poor experience, treated poorly. Made quotas and then some, never missed a day, but didn't matter."
bad,"Working for UHG in the Houston location was an horrible experience. The blatant unprofessionalism was unbearable for me but permitted by management. You would honestly think you're in high-school with all the cattiness, rudeness, and gossip going on. (not that i was involved in) On top of that the pay isn't great for what you would have to deal with. Large incoming calls from rude physicians etc, then you have rude co workers. You will not enjoy it here. Well at least at the Houston location. I recommend that you RUN!"
bad,I did not enjoy my typical day at work.  I learned under bad management and I found the workplace culture to be stressful.  There were quotas thet were unrealistic.
bad,like every other call center you are just a number.  Constantly monitored to make sure you are always working.  Absolutely no power to help others just route forms up
bad,this was one of the worst places I've ever worked in. the managers are phony and only treat you with respect if you know them outside of work. the business manager of the Empire plan also sleeps with male employees
bad,"This job sucks. First the job description makes it seem really laid back and nice. Then the guy who hired me lied and said it would only be inbound calls and that it was not a sales job. This job is exactly like sales. Calling out trying to schedule housecalls visits for members who literally don’t want the visit at all and get angry at you for calling them 20 times AFTER they said they DONT want the visit. The department is so new and management knows nothing. They read off of the computer screen and don’t have any real feedback for you. Their attendance flexibility is not good at all your occurrences stay with you for a whole year. This job is not for anyone with lives, families or children. They have no sick days and tried to cover it up with “Kin Care” but that’s unrealistic because you have to PTO to use it...don’t do it guys please"
bad,"Terrible place to work. They are not interested in their employees. They discriminate against people with medical issues. Team leads and Supervisors do not perform their jobs correctly. They are ""Do as I say Not as I Do"". They promise pay raises but never give you one."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. Salary is low, Claims department is only about numbers, not quality of work. Operational areas (claims, member services) were not appreciated."
bad,This company could be better if you need a not from a doctor to let you go to the restroom when ever you wanted too. They don't care to tell you that there is mandatory overtime before you get hired.
bad,United Healthcare is a well established company with a hi turn over because of the stress level of the calls that you have to take and management does not work with their employees very well and training is intense
bad,"The only job where they do the LEAST for their employees. Management clearly has not had enough training on communication. They have been letting a lot of people go lately looking like the department is shutting down but no word which is terrible for people who, i don’t know, need to find a new job first!"
bad,Here is full politics technology offshore team my Senior managers and management is payings games on team members. I hope his not able to manage team. If any issues came out with his bin he has to resolve.
bad,"Terrible place to work, would never tell anyone to work there, I only liked 2 managers, one left & the other one was bullied & made her cry, they did the same to me"
bad,During the entire process starting from the interview i told them i was a college student and asked if they would work with my schedule. They said yes and i accepted the position. i did 8 weeks of intensive training and when it was time for me to start on the job floor they said they wouldnt be able to work with my schedule. I told them from the start and they kept saying yes well work with your schedule. So i mean i had already paid my $8k in school tuition so I couldnt not go to class. So I had to quite. what a waste of time. I couldve been training for an actual job that wouldve worked with my schedule.
bad,"I guess I would have to say uhg had its good and bad as with any job but it did help me become more tech savy. However, management could be improved on as they do not always promote within"
bad,"There is no advancement. The work is very repetitive; ""production oriented"". The company gives no OT and no possibility to make more money. Volunteering is a no..no! I whole-heartedly HATED this job! Management does not care about any employees... just work!"
bad,"My experience working here has been awful. I have been lied to about many things.(Including what I would get paid.) There is also a serious lack of communication thru out the entire company. Making it impossible to know anything or to do your job properly.  Plus they show major favoritism, only promoting their friends or people who brown nose."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,it depends on what Department you work for. Medicare is GREAT !! Oxford was horrible. Our Assistant director was not good at managing nor was she supportive you could hear her yelling across the flood at other supervisors. No one knows what direction our team was to go. So UHC is a great place as long as you work for any other department other than OXFORD.
bad,"Very stressful, management doesn't listen or care about their employees.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.  Offered vacation, but could take my time.  I was forced to loose 40 hours of vacation time."
bad,"Managers that didn't care, managers hitting on employees when they were married. Poor work environment. No raises, they would give small bonuses but put them in your paycheck"
bad,"good company hard working people billing, assisting customers , answering multi-lines,call center,easy work , have patients and build a re-poor with c"
bad,"Before the Company got brought out by Optum and was Catamaran, it was a WONDERFUL company. their only client was a major health insurance provider and there was both room for advancement AND overtime. Let me tell you the truth about working for UHG/Optum. These people are racist and sexist. They will not and do not promote women and people of color to higher positions. Management knows NOTHING! You know why? because they hire people from the outside that know NOTHING and they can control, manipulate, and teach to LIE. They give them the bare minimum of training and teach them to look for the smallest reasons to FIRE people. They constantly break federal Medicare and Medicaid laws. they claim to be a performance based company but lets be honest, their performance goals are unrealistic. they want you to do multiple jobs, juggle all types of tasks and expect you to make NO MISTAKES. they are evil and cut throat. there is no such thing as merit increases or bonus. they will constantly write you up or find reasons to write you up so that they following year they don't have to give you merit increase. i could go on and on with the negative. you want a job, keep looking. don't work for this company!"
bad,"Poor leaders who lead by intimidation. Show favoritism and only make select few work. Disorganized, and don't follow own guidelines. When bring ideas to table or disagree, suffer negative consequences"
bad,I worked in the Insurance Administration department at the Indianapolis location. The supervisors have stank attitudes and are ghetto and rude. DW with the cotton mouth and fat ML. Unfortunately I can't state their names  Those two are rude and stuck up and only speak to you when its time to be negative. They never give you a good job or a thumbs up. That place is boring the workload is crazy the call volume is ridiculous. The pay doesn't match the work that the company expects of you. I understand change is going to happen but this company has so many changes that no one knows what is gong on. The turn over rate is sky high and I see why.  This place micromanages you to a T. Steer clear from this company in the Insurance Administration department in the Indianapolis area. This company doesn't appreciate their employees and the training is terrible. I'm so glad I quit and began working for IU where I am appreciated and make way more money and not in a stressful environment with rude nasty people and unrealistic work demands. Do not go to this company. You've been warned!!!!
bad,"Overall, I think the company is a great company.  I believe the recruiters and the people doing the hiring are very professional and they get back with you in a timely manner.  Before taking a job at this company, I would encourage a person to do a great deal of informational interviews."
bad,"It was not as I expected, the lack of care if you needed time off was made into an occurrence even if you requested it in advance.  Far less if you had an emergency they still put it as an occurrence.  So it seemed not matter what you’d be written up either way."
bad,"managers leaders are incompetent.  They look down to employees, treat them like garbage.  They think they are superior to everyone else. They say they care about employees but that is far from the truth. This place is a joke"
bad,"Management was the downside of working for UHC. If you aren't a ""favorite"" or a part of some clique, they barely notice you. Seasoned processors were constantly allowed to not only berate other employees but they were allowed to talk over everyone at team meetings, including management. There was no order or organization. New employees would be hired and employees who were working hard for years would be overlooked and passed over for advancement and opportunities. If you have advancement aspirations but you aren't ""the life of the party"" where everyone will know your name, look elsewhere, this isn't the place for you."
bad,you get let go if you get pregnant and have complications that lead to bed rest. The doctors note is not good enough for them. The managers will tell you if you can not make it in then they are letting you go.
bad,"Not a great company to work for. Their training program is 3 months long and slow, expect you to work overtime without question and expect you to work odd hours without any choice."
bad,Once they get you in this department it is very hard to move around to other opportunities. Most if not all “promotions” are lateral moves. The pay is
bad,"Worst Company to work for, Supervisor dont care about employee they look at  you as number not a person .  Never get raised , fired without warning, dont get confortable while working their Poor Management "
bad,"It was worst place to work .. and current  supervisor  is so rude and mean  , not friendly at all , bias to her  ppl .. she talk to her  people with big smile but not with other employee.."
bad,"The company located in Minnesota.It buys a lot of smaller companies and fires people from these small companies. Its management only recognizes people who are located in the headquarters located in Minnesota, very politicized lie to people about what is going to happen to them promising opportunities and then fire them.  I would never work for them again."
bad,"I worked in the Brentwood, Tn office as an clinical administrative coordinator. It started off pretty weird. There’s no formal training. I came in on my first day. They sat me down at my desk. Gave me login info and its number and left me for dead... they didn’t even know i existed for weeks! I would sit there for hours with no work no communication, nothing. After a year of noanagment basically the roles reversed. They then started to micromanage and become Very overbearing. Management is terrible. They lack leadership skills, communication skills and aren’t personable at all. We rarely had team meetings, potlucks or anything. Or was basically Everyman for themselves. So much happened there I could type for days.. however i don’t have that type of time. Don’t allow them to lie and well you a dresm. The benefits are terrible and so is management. The easiest job in the world became the most stressful ever"
bad,"It was stressful, there was little to no work/life balance and overtime was mandatory no matter what your situation was. I will never work at OptumRx ever again. They have unrealistic expectations of their employees  and the compensation is not adequate for the job."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,I have very few positive things to say about this company. Leadership does not even pretend to support a mission of helping people and their lack of concern trickles down to employees. Staff members in similar roles are pitted against each other and praise is doled out in public to the favorite of the day while others are scapegoated in front of their teams. The norm seems to be management by intimidation and the threat of being put on a performance improvement plan is constantly hanging over your head. Management is not interested in helping employees to succeed and success is measured only by how much money you bring in.
bad,Working at UnitedHealth Group was not a good experience. In the first six months of my job there I witnessed a 90% turnover rate. I could provide specific observations however the turnover rate speaks for itself.
bad,UHG was not a great place to work. There was no room for upper mobility if you are a minority. I believe the company is racist. I would never advised anyone I know to apply there.
bad,"this is a terrible place to work, micro managing too much favoritism very toxic and unhealthy environment, the actual memebrs suffer because most providers do not accept the insurance and the mental health componenet is terrible these people are under served"
bad,Was not a great experience working for this company at all was greatly disappointed in the lack of viable supervisors and the overall structure of the company
bad,Very cut throat. Work standards set so high they are unattainable.Keeps you from moving forward and getting a raise.Have to ask for permission to get off the phone and use the restroom. Terrible place they treat you like kids in a daycare.
bad,"didn't like the environment...."
bad,"Does matter if you work harder and better than other employees, how long you've been with company, or how many amazing reviews you've had. They don't care about you at all - they will lay you off without giving it a second thought."
bad,"If you want to be stressed out and confused, apply to work at the Sugarland location. There are some incompetent  Bm and supervisors. You might end up on high blood pressure pills or psych medication."
bad,I don't have any information to give regarding this company. It was a stepping stone in my work life and I don't feel it added any value to my skill set.
bad,"After working for this company for 11 years, my entire department was laid off. Apparently they decided to hire people from temp agencies for less, as soon as UHC took over, the whole place changed for the worst."
bad,This is not a place that cares about their employees. They make a great sales pitch and depending on your manager it may be true. Pettiness and childish things like disliking people are the alternative.
bad,The company was not helpful when I had family issues. if you brought up an issue you were having they basically told you to deal and not let it effect your production.
bad,"The PDN job is impossible. Not only are the 5 private duty nurses expected to do the field visits on 430 medicaid members state-wide, they are also responsible for their case management AND utilization management. In my opinion, this is unethical. I work 12 hours daily, M-F, and am paid for 8."
bad,"For this to be a healthcare company, they treat employees horribly. I was discriminated against while I was pregnant. The management has no idea what they are doing."
bad,"Best thing I could have ever done was leave. I did not feel valued as an employee. We were expected to process appeals in an unreasonable timeframe which we worked countless overtime to keep in compliance including well into the late hours of the night and weekend. Management was more concerned with production that the health and well-being of their staff. It's been years since I was employed here, but I certainly wouldn't go back."
bad,Not a good place to work long hours no advancement horrible management it is like a daycare  the management is terrible they let workers get away with not showing up but won’t fire them
bad,"If you work through a Agency, be double on guard.  Trust no one, especially your Front Lime Manager, Anyone who says they are your Coach or Instructor.  Because all information is second hand and is not valid.  Which will lead to your termination w/o your knowledge that you did something wrong."
bad,A typical work day would be hard. There was little direction and the system would crash a lot. There was always new procedures put into play everyday as to how to process claims which at times became confusing and caused a lot of stress.
bad,"Since they are so micromanaging, I am sure this post will never show up.  This place is so bad that it actually has a reputation in Chico for chewing up and spitting out ""employees"".  If you enjoy being literally watched every second you are there, working as hard as you can to meet impossible quotas, mistakes constantly pointed out, held against you and you are fired for any reason, no one knowing what they are doing, especially management (asking the same question and getting 2 different answers just about every time) then this is the place for you.  UHC is the poster child for Toxic Work Environment, so if you enjoy that sort of thing, feel free to apply."
bad,They don't care about you. They will replace you with a lower paid person. There was unlimited overtime however. Also management will be absent and only speak to you if something is wrong
bad,"Management is horrible! They claim work life balance but dont care if you have kids. No support for irate customers you can fail a call for the stupidest things which put you on a corrective plan leading to termination. Occurrences are the worst...so if you or your kids are sick you will be penalized. After too many occurrences, you are terminated. Had a health issue earlier in the year that was made worse by the stress of the job landing me in the hospital. Dont worry you will be bullied for that too. If you work from home you are chained to your desk...why would you work from home to just pay for childcare? Oh dont worry about that your paycheck wont cover childcare. It's a sad environment everyone hired with me has quit. I stayed because I believed I was helping people but it was a lie. Also, after 30 job applications internally I gave up trying. Be warned."
bad,Billing and supervision of client care monitored by United Health.  Never met the case worker/supervisor she would try to schedule visits during client hospitalizations. Could never reach her by phone. Case manager changed twice in the three months client still lived at home.
bad,"UHC was the most cut throat place I ever worked. The stress from it caused me extreme duress and frustration. The ""leadership"" was inconsistent and upper-management does little to nothing to correct issues with the department.  All my reports of harassment and discrimination feel on deaf eyes."
bad,"Their expectations are that you are able to do any and all things for all departments, at all times. Whether the expectations are reasonable or not. They will throw you into situations that are highly stressful, with little to no training, and expect perfection. The job is so highly demanding, and management is not there for support. No one there truly cares about their jobs or anyone else. Do not work here, they do not value good employees."
bad,"Horrible."
bad,"Every year, from September through December, the company does massive layoffs and the axe falls hard. Whether they drop a single person or an entire team, the process and reasoning stays the same. All the while, the company posts massive, multi-billion dollar profits year after year. What better way to celebrate the holiday season with your family than with apologies that you couldn't afford gifts, or, looking around your home deciding which possessions to sell off and in what order so you don't become homeless during the winter."
bad,"I have never worked for such a horrible company from the management on down. Each day going in was such a weight and stress, you are constantly told there is an issue with your stats but never any direction on how to correct your stats ."
bad,Very bad management very POOR MANAGEMENT never told me about anything that I needed to know to do my job in a good way  lied about the production numbers
bad,"horrible management, no room for advancement, management only cares about numbers and no support. you are your own IT helpdesk for you are a telecommuter. Huge workloads and speaking up to the management about it, ends you in the hot water and being bullied."
bad,I do not have anything to say about this organization that is worth while to read. I did not enjoy working there and they are not good to their employees.
bad,"I worked UHG/Optum.  Management staff very, very unprofessional. ""Training"" was a JOKE.  If you were not experienced as I am you didn't have a chance."
bad,"A horrible environment for anyone in the coding business.  Mandatory overtime, no flexibility, horrible pay, no benefits.   Managers didn't know how to talk with any amount of respect to the employees."
bad,"They are misusing name of UHG, in India it's not UHG, it is Optum.  Very poor company, not employee friendly at all. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Good for experience and certifications."
bad,Supervisor provide incorrect information that may lead to termination. There are no clear policies put in place to protect employees. Lack of professionalism with mana.
bad,I advise no one to apply or work here. Horrible company and needs to lose their contract immediately. They will fire you for anything. BEWARE!!! You will regret working here. I wouldn’t lie I’m so serious not a good place at all
bad,"In high school I worked in fast food, I also was in the Army and UHG is the worst place I have ever worked. back stabbing, no raises, bad mouthing people, hostel environment. My location had over 1000 people and no one was happy. I would never recomend working for UHG or Optum."
bad,"I warn you, never work here. Management is not useful and avoids doing any work. 6 weeks of training is a joke and doesn't prepair you for being on the phones."
bad,"Revolving door for case managers. They do anything now to lure you in. Work culture that consists of completely changing the job of RN case manager to Customer Service Rep., with no explanation, or consideration. You must work like a robot because ""leadership"" said so and call more people until your voice gives out. No change in pay, 1% merit increases, all around chap organization unless you're in management."
bad,"Optum 360 does the customer service for Quest Diagnostics."
bad,"Current employee, I hate it ! Plan on getting something new before AEP 2018 comes. Management is terrible, I’m a tellecommuter and it’s so hard to actually get help or speak with your supervisor. The pay sucks , I’ve been working here for 2 years with no raise or room for advancement. You have to bid for the shift you want and if you get a shift that you can’t accommodate then it sucks for you. They will not care , if you can’t find someone with your same skill set to swap schedules then you have no other choice but to do the shift or quit. They do not care about your family or life outside of work. They don’t not value employees. Basically a dead end job. Nice if you need something for the time being but not if your looking for longevity."
bad,They are cheap. They expect you to go above and beyond but this company does not care for their employees at all. you are another number and can easily be replaced.
bad,This position was completely different than what was pitched to me in my interview. I worked there for two years and was routinely denied for advancement. I was also told that I would be getting a telecommute position for over a year that I never received.
bad,"With the various and amount of calls we take, the help that is needed to answer customers questions accurately, the help is not always there. They rather punish you for every little thing even though they never trained you on half of this stuff, rather than helping you to succeed. They lie about growing in the company, they actually let you know that we can be replaced."
bad,"Work/life balance is ridiculous "
bad,I learned they are slave drivers.  You had to not only work your regular schedule of 40 hours but overtime was mandatory daily and weekends.  You had to eat lunch at your desk and was not allowed to leave work space unless break time.  There was really no enjoyable part to the job.  Was told to get paid extra for working the extra hours and never received it.  I went to a different position after that.  Supervisors were slave drivers and out to weed thru the employees to rid of as many people not willing to be a slave.
bad,"not interested in writing a review"
bad,"Very unfair expectations.Too much travel, pick up rental car on our private time and drop off without pay, etc. Those with large territories are expected to drive, sometimes 3 hours without pay."
bad,My supervisor and the company felt like if I couldnt come back to work after losing my baby then I could seek employment elsewhere. I was out on fmla waiting on my approval for std so I could get some professional help and my at the time supervisor called and mailed me threating me that if I didnt call them or come back to work I would be terminated and it would be considered voluntary
bad,"Stress, stress, stress. Employer sets unrealistic goals. Training was inadequate. UnitedHealthcare is dishonest to employees, promises are made but not kept. The management is unqualified."
bad,"I worked at UHC as a claims analyst for four years.  There were several reasons which made my decision to leave. During the time there, they have lost several major contracts leaving employees to doubt their job security.  The department is overloaded with incompetent managers whose only purpose is to micromanage rather than encourage their department to excel.  They seem to enjoy when their employees fail."
bad,Dont go to claims. You have to pass training to actually become permanent. Training environment was very Hostile. Computers cpnsistently had technical issues that could not be tesolved. Arguments in class between instructors and trainee.
bad,Company and Teams were poorly managed. Contract I worked on was mismanaged. The concerns and suggestions of the employees were  not taken into consideration.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Terrible place. They lie about everthing to how long you have in between calls to balancing work and family life . They talk about incentives but they are unacheivable. If you are not accepted by one of the clique you will targeted and be a source of baseless lies/ gossip and you will not get promoted. If your supervisor is MJ , your screwed and will never go anywhere.  They make it sound soooo great during training , that y5oy will have support. You don't.  Your peers have no clue and their is a huge disconnect between what is going on verses what should be as far as policies. Worst place I ever worked for!"
bad,They were the worst place I have ever worked!! I would not recommend this job to anyone else. They do not train you for the position they put you in. You are trained for 6 weeks and then in the end they let managers from all over the building pick the people they want and alot of positions you have no clue what you are doing!
bad,management was undesirable-micromanaged-work in small cubicles-just did not enjoy this position-demand so many cases be done in a day-very stressful to say the least
bad,"Doesn't matter your years of experience, level of education, skills you bring to the table...if you aren't management at UHC, you are just another number. "
bad,"never offered raises, schedule based on shift bid doing the same thing everydayokay for first time call center paid every week 30 min lunches simple place"
bad,Turn over rate is through the roof. You are not valued as an employee. They do not support your home/work balance at all. Not willing to work with schedule and they do not take into consideration your request. Do not tell you you could work 4 10 hour days and schedule is not Monday thru Friday as advertised.
bad,This was one of the worse jobs I have ever had. The manager was a micro manager and the company does not care about it's employees. Everyone was very uptight and difficult to work with. They have an extremely high turnover rate and the pay does not match the expectations of the job.
bad,It was a nightmare!! Our manager at our location quit the supervisors were mean and not very knowledgeable nor on the same page about changes in order to do our job. There was only room for advancement if they liked you. The atmosphere lacked morale. It was like a big high school full of women who couldn’t stand each other. I would not recommend working at this site .  You had to request time off 2 weeks in advance and workforce would go in a remove your day you requested off that was already approved and change it to another day without your knowledge. Supervisors would go in and tamper with the amount of occurrences you had which determine if you are termed.  They would make us be mean and short to certain members who would call everyday as well which I thought was harsh.
bad,"I work for a branch of UHG called optum which is single handledly the worst position I've been in. Some days there is work others there isn't. They hire anyone, you're just a number here. Replaceable because ""there are too many people willing to work for less."""
bad,Managed healthcare companies are some of the worst companies to work for.  That is why they are are constantly hiring.  Stay way unless you have exhausted all of your options.
bad,I was glad to have given them the boot! this company was the worse to work for. I may have been without for a while but it was worth it. I never have to be bothered with this poor excuse of an insurance company ever again.
bad,I really wanted to like work here. Since I moved to Greensboro I imaged myself working there because I was interested in Medical Billing and Coding. EVERYTHING about working there was horrible for me personally.
bad,"Detrimental to mental health, racist, hostile work environment, horrible place to work. Treatment of employees horrible, don't work at United health care."
bad,"Stressful, no advancement, inadequate managing, no available paid time off, sick leave, vacation time, salary does not meet the current cost of living."
bad,"UHC is not the good environment.  If you just want a job yes, but if you are looking for a career they have nothing to offer."
bad,"Gestão de modo geral é ruim, supervisores mal preparados, não sabem lidar com colaboradores, não repassam informações atualizadas. Comunicação em geral é ruim. "
bad,"This was not a good work environment. poor management, poor quality control and poor time management. management would pick favorite employees and those were the only ones that would be accommodated in this facility."
bad,Prejudice Management! If you are not caucasian then you are laid off quickly or overlooked for job promotions. If you question their decision you will be terminated. The underlying thought it know your place.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"I loved my role as a benefit advocate. I enjoyed helping people. Management had their favorite employee’s who they worked with if they needed time off. Micro management was horrible and if you needed to use the restroom when not on a break, you rack up personal time. If you use more than your 20 minutes of personal time you are allowed per month, you may go on a corrective action plan. If you enjoy kissing up to management and you have no problem working while sick, this is the job for you."
bad,"They have a very high turn over at the frederick location and they micro manage.  Good luck if you have to use the bathroom if you are a call center rep! Also, you would  think there medical benefits would be good but they are not."
bad,"Big company..hard to advance. If your looking to work in the same position forever, this job is for you. I have been with the company 4 years now and I am stagnant. I feel like there is not enough opportunity for advancement unless you are ""in"" with management."
bad,"ron aaron is not a good manager, did not get to do the work i was hired for. had to teach myself something i did not know , had no training. was left alone to figure things out"
bad,"The worst job I’ve ever had by far ! Constantly changing things,horrible computer system  applications not working, system always down or frozen and these idiots act like they don’t know what’s going on and then when they do they don’t care they only are concerned about numbers no matter what’s going on they don’t care and they hold it against you. Believe me it’s not worth your time management is the worst they are lazy sitting at home doing nothing ! they act like they are listening to you but they are not ! I complained many times with proof and they didn’t care they only care about numbers !!! I wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,I did not enjoy this position. It was not a good environment to work in. Management was difficult to work with. Coworkers were great and made the job bearable.
bad,"Even Racist comments by employees are not handled by HR or management. Worst place to work for."
bad,"The claims manager needs to be fire in Miami, Florida. The manager doesn't know their job at all.  I hate this place. The manager is very cut throat. I HATE THIS PLACE!"
bad,"There is a lot of politics. Management is unethical & all in bed together; impossible to get promoted, must apply with a different department completely."
bad,"Company was very unorganized in its practices. Turn over rate was astronomical. Regular mandatory overtime, horrible working hours, and poor management"
bad,"No ones career with UHC goes over 2 years, I always wondered this in training, why I haven't I met anyone with a career over 2 years. Well it is because they weed you out if you have a bad month. Recently, they've became over staffed and have been letting people go like crazy, so here I am in fear of my job being terminated so getting prepared to find a better stable company. "
bad,"Customer service position:"
bad,I was a temp and I earned several awards there nationally with UHG and after 2 years as a temp I was let go and tol dto come back in the following april be a temp again and get hired on.. I refused because I needed benefits and they were not offering that.
bad,Very poor management. Things were run between co-workers as competition to put one another down. Management was unfair when it came to assignments and achievements.
bad,"They constantly are hiring because they are constantly losing people to the insufferable conditions. They have even had to hire staffing companies because the word is out that UHC is a lousy employer. Management is poorly trained except in firing people after giving them glowing reviews, in the same 5 minute period! There is no work life balance, any time off even if approved is counted against you.People toady up to management because they are in fear of losing their jobs. Even the health insurance, for a health insurance company stinks and pays for little. Do not work here unless you are willing to be treated as a slave."
bad,"Lugar péssimo para trabalhar. Fazem muitas cobranças para um salário que não condiz. É uma ligação atrás da outra, você nunca vê o fim. Os clientes todos irritados por que a amil não está nem aí para seu cliente. Tudo desatualizado e desorganizado. O cliente reclama e temos que fingir que a empresa se importa, sabendo que nada vai ser resolvido. É deprimente e estressante. Fazem um monte de cobranças e ficam dando desculpinha sobre variável ou aumento de salário. Você ser bom ou não é indiferente. Todo mundo ganha a mesma coisa. É um descaso com os funcionários. Nos tratam como idiotas. Me sinto um fracasso em trabalhar nesse lugar."
bad,"Terrible management"
bad,worst place to work did nothing for the company would con old people to transfer there medications over to the company in order to get compensated horrible place
bad,"Not employee friendly, lot of politics and management is one sided. Also this entire review depends on each team, my first team is great and will encourage to learn and enhance in career. Second team, lead doesn't even have leadership skills. Need better training to leads and first time managers when they get promoted."
bad,"They do not keep inside people. I was let go due to ""downsizing"" but why are they hiring cheaper labor overseas? Very unprofessional company; did not even get a warning."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Worked in Optum Recovery Unit. Very stressful department, to much work to be completed in a 8 hour day. Compensation is horrible. Expectations are unrealistic. Teammates are great.  Turn around in managers is 1 per year.  Managers always say thank you for your hard work, but they don't men it."
bad,"One step up from working in a prison. This company works on fear, intimidation. Hates and wants no one with education, experience."
bad,The job was terrible the management was terrible. I was just thrown to the wolves to figure it all out after a few weeks of poor training with a very rude trainer
bad,"Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
bad,"Not enough training for senior employees when changes were made ""without"" input from them. Had NO choice about company policies, procedures or locations, when these changes occurred."
bad,Exigem demais muitas ligaçôes e salario baixo. Nao valorizam os funcionarios e ha muita cobrança de metas sem pagamento de comissao.
bad,"I worked here almost 5 years. The job was great sometimes and terrible other. The Direct Manager you report to will decide if you have a happy, healthy workplace or micro managing bad place to work."
bad,Good for easy work life balance. No scope of career enhancement. They call themselves a Fortune 6 but the culture they practice is much lower than any startup now a days. Management is of very poor quality. Still they are blank when people talk about Bigdata and latest technologies.
bad,"UHG is only good to be use as a stepping stone.  People who advance are typically butt kisser not hard workers.  Leadership are lack the knowledge or the basic leadership skill such as constructive feedback, managing meetings, promoting team spirit, etc.  The pay is very biased.  If you butter up the the manager, you are likely to get a higher pay.  It is not uncommon to be licensed, have twice as many years of experience, do twice as much work, have more responsibilities and still get paid less then a new hire that isn't license nor have the save level of experience."
bad,"They plan their short comings on you. This job is a scam, do not do it, apply for something else with the company not this job, you will regret. run run run."
bad,very poorly managed and run. no support from management. all departments weren't available on opening day. Denying benefits.to military families of deployed soldiers and retired veterans.
bad,Management didn't care about there employees or life outside of work. Lower vital signs over our area caused a lot of coworkers to quite or go find work elsewhere.
bad,"non flexible, salary below market value, they proudly say how well the company is doing but will not give you salary increase at all or  any bonus. You are required to work variety of hours to fit US customers but will not be given anything in return."
bad,"Don't do it, total Mistake! they don't care about anyone, the culture is horrible, high turnover, management sexually harassed employees, nepotism at an all time high, completely ridiculous"
bad,Mantitory Overtime and if you dont complete the OT hours then you are penalized for it & written up.  No work/life balance at all.  They would rather you come to work sick than be gone.  We had to come in to work when a really bad blizzard was happening even though there was a State of Emergency issued & the remainder of the city was closed.
bad,"Terrible place to work, I have never been so micro managed at a company. The turn around is terrible, that should tell someone something at that company, why people don't stay"
bad,"Rules changing daily"
bad,"Horrible place to work, bad benefits, poor management, They do not care about employees, low pay, horrible environment, Treated like second rate employee,"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"I'm on a phone queue, so getting time off is incredibly difficult. working for insurance company you would think it's great healthcare, but i have no HMO option and forced on a high deductible plan."
bad,They do not practice what they preach.There is weak leadership that they continue to promote; the hours of work are ridiculous; they do not offer any type of rewards to employees for going the extra mile.
bad,"This company will tell you its about the culture, and how much they value you, until you maintain your integrity and speak out against a manager. You will then be set up to be terminated."
bad,This place was a nice place to go to looking for help to take care of your love ones. But however due to many Federal violations it was shut down never to be reopened again.
bad,This company picks its favorite right off the bat. Once you get targeted they make your life miserable. They expect you to do the impossible sometimes with times on the phones.  You have to have a low average of time on the phone with members which is not fair to the customer because it causes us to miss information and have to push people off the phone as quickly as possible.
bad,I have no review to write other than I was not treated fairly. I was asked to travel and train new vendor sites and was told I would get a raise well 15 cents an hour is not gonna cover the sitter costs when I had to be away from my son for over a month at a time.
bad,"I have never recounted as many instances of members threatening to cause harm due to the services UHG offered than any other health care company I've worked for. Granted, more than 95% of the members and people I spoke with seemed to be older (50+) with dependencies towards their medication, which made working one of the least enjoyable aspects of life. Mandatory overtime might seem worth the money, but when you have to choose between quality of life or 22.50 /hr for overtime, it's really not hard to figure out which one is more worth the stress."
bad,A huge company with pretty good benefits but no flexibility and tons of rules and metrics to meet.  Some good people of course but lots of turn over.  Other areas of the company may not have all the same issues as it is a huge company but movement within the company was just impossible so I would know if it was limited to the department I worked in.
bad,I would not ever recomend this company its horrible and they will fire u when ur just doing ur job ..you are a number that will be replaced and tgis is why they are always hiring people
bad,OPTUM department really has an issue with higher management. Higher management really needs to be changed and reassigned. They need to show their employees that they care and not favor-tize who they like and dislike.
bad,"I love the work, but the management is not someone I want to keep working with they mistreat their employees and when you talk to someone they retaliate against you by either not approving your PTO and things like those"
bad,"If you start with a low salary in the company, you will always be low. I have had no less than 3 managers tell me I would be better off if I left the company and then came back. There is abusive treatment that is tolorated and swept under the rug, the overall culture is toxic, and the health benefits are some of the highest deductibles I have ever heard of."
bad,never worked for this company so I cant not give a review of a typical day at work or what I have learned. and my experiencing within management and their work place culture.
bad,I would not recommend that anyone go and work for UHC. Their turn over rate is high. They do not value their employees and management is extremely unprofessional.
bad,"UHC and Optum pride themselves on their ""culture"", but it is all lip service. You are treated like a product, not a person.  Do not accept the first offer, counter by 7k and they will come back with 3-5k from the original offer."
bad,"Awful place no support from management even if put in dangerous positions. Also staff are treated like garbage and if your face don't fit you will be in and out the office from other staff being two faced. "
bad,"The management and honesty with this company is non-existent. They over work their employees with very little incentive nor appreciation. They are not open about possible mandated overtime, they strictly claim there will be overtime available as an option. As employees there is constant stress over attendance and very little room for a work/life balance. The training is minimal and there is very little communication."
bad,This place does not have a good work / life balance. The supervisors are all in the jobs for themselves. They don't care if you succeed or not. This was not a good place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"The salary is good but the job and management were really poor and stressing. It feels like someone is always watching your work and everything is timed. If you make simple mistake, you're screwed. People in this company are just going to use you because of the busy season, and when they don't need you anymore, there just going to fire you without any early notice nor reasonable reason. They fired out a lot of people in my workplace, them not caring it was hard to find a replacement job right away. They didn't even care, very unprofessional company. This is the worst company I've ever worked for."
bad,"Not available, I don't have a lot to say where I work there. When my department close and I was moved to another department the manager was racist. He treated black people like it was 1965."
bad,don't recommend at all . The management is very poor! The pay is not worth the stress that you endure!! Retaliation is very real here! Please do not apply!
bad,"UHG has such as high turnover rate because staff resign by the boat loads everyday!  Management is horrendous & do not care about staff!  This goes for maternal child, adult medicine & specialties!  Staff is overworked & under paid!  Some managers allow all kinds of unacceptable, unprofessional, & unethical behaviors to go on!  If you are one of the few employees who speak out on such issues be prepared  into resigning prepared to be harassed into resignation!  Bottom line is you need to either be a “sun don’t shine kisser” or a “doormat” to make it with this company!  👎🏼"
bad,"-Service customers via telephone"
bad,"Was awful , management didn't listen or respect you as a person.  Micro managed, low office moral. No employee rewards, low pay. Not alot if growth opportunity."
bad,it was ok job. If you don't mind taking over 100 calls a day from extremely rude customers then the job is ok. I was stress every day dealing the customers cursing at me.
bad,They made you feel terrible about having a family. I learned a lot about insurances and the benefits and thankfully that helped me with my new jobs. I would never go back there
bad,"Poor management, low pay, mandatory overtime. Laid off when job sent overseas. Let everyone go via powerpoint presentation on April Fool's day, though no one was fooling."
bad,"do not plant to work with uhc if you cant handle stress. its not the member, its the organization that is unorganized. They train you for 3 Mons, tell you that you will do one job a certain way then out the blue you are cross trained for something more stressful that you did not sign up for. The benefits suck, UHC do not show compassion to the employees. We all suffer, if we do the job right, they nag on us doing another job and if that's wrong we get in trouble. The Maryland heights location needs more work. You don't get your raise yearly. instead you have to wait until the company itself will give you a raise for all employees. Hopefully you do well because it goes off of your metrics."
bad,Ok place to work that is really all I have to say about the organization. For the time being as I really didn't work there long enough to have an overall.
bad,"I Was mislead the entire interview...advised one thing...got there and it was an entire different story. There is poor management, micro management and although it is stated that you will not be on the phone for this job that is a lie! Management is cut throat and it's poor training! United and optum as a whole is a good company but for this position...RUN!"
bad,Great place to work if you are in perfect health.  HR will tell you that they will help you with any issues you have and then not follow through.  Great stocked (for purchase) break room.
bad,"Management is only out for themselves and are willing to bend rules or blatantly lie in order to get rid of agents they do not like. Discrimination runs rampant. Having even intermittent FMLA will stop you from advancing even though, according to the Department of Labor, it is against the law. Pay is unequal to the amount of work you are made to do and they will pile you high with so many responsibilities but snap at you for asking for more money. Company swears by their values but apparently those values don't apply to upper management. Benefits are garbage. Have fun with your high deductible plans and only 80/20 split. They swear to care so much about their clients and members but caring about the agents is nonexistent."
bad,people tend to overrate the company. not a good idea to work here. I have been blinded by the ideology that the company promotes during my stay I experienced some newly hired bridge manager who ONLY cares about the metrics and numbers NEVER any welfare of the employee
bad,terrible work environment. no advancement. management not professional. Old equipment. Culture was non existent. I learned absolutely nothing. Would never work there again.
bad,I just didn't like the fact that they worked  us so hard but things were always changing up without warning . As dedicated as I was I feel like the pay wasint enough.
bad,This was the most worst place to work. the deadlines were ridiculous and the supervisors were very rude and did not know how to speak to their employees.
bad,Stressful place to work; management doesn't care about employees; constant turnover. Constant degrading or morale; no encouragement of employees; degrading of employees in front of other employees
bad,They  let you think that you are doing great the not of no where its one thing after another I guess on perk is most of the people get to work from home downside is when their equipment fails don't think your going to get paid I waited almost 3 weeks before I got my stuff straightened out  to only be told I'm only get 4 days pay of of 15
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,They do not care about you they only care about the phones and management lies on you. My spouse passed away and they questioned how I chose to grieve and called me a liar. I do not recommend this company at all. They bought out Quest billing Department
bad,"THE MOST RIDICULOUS environment you could ever imagine. People showed up and left when they wanted,  were on their cell phones for entire shifts, logged in remotely if they were going to be late all with  no repercussions. Management had switched hands and everything went down the drain - lost 3/4 of the team to other companies, myself included."
bad,It was a good company but tha carebean management staff drove the company to a bankruptcy. The General manager tried to improve the billing computer system by Implementing his own billing software hiring people that never reached the software goals. Eventually they end by closing the facilities in the Carebean area.
bad,Our training class was lied to regarding our employment status and then we were ALL let go by the company without notice or explanation.  No other positions were offered to us.
bad,"Yes you may think this is an easy position.......Not ! What they don't tell you is that after so many minor defects you will be fired, the health plan sucks (they barely pay for anything), if you don't get all you need in training you have to catch on the best way you know how, theres daily changes on scripts and rules so you will always get defects, the pay is definitely not worth the stress. The providers never have time to talk to you, they either hang up, curse you out or just don't answer. Save yourself a headache and do not apply to this call center!!!"
bad,"-Mgmt is awful"
bad,"Stressful place . .........Not even worth the time.................discrimmated for medical history,  harrassed in this a company. Site director agrues with you stating if there are continous issues you have no right to keep addressing human resources."
bad,call center environment. No rule are the same day to day. Management had their favorites. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid every week. The initial pay was $9.50...ending pay was $10.50/hr. That was 4 years ago.
bad,"United health care has the absolute worst promoting system. They only promote their friends whom they help get hired on. I have never seen such unprofessional management. If you are not on their ""crew"" you get a higher work load and are not treated as an equal."
bad,"Poor management, no feedback on performance, would never recommend people to work here. The training for the job is spotty and inconsistent. The trainers don't care if you grasp what they teach you."
bad,"It was an okay place to work. If you like sitting in a chair all day repeating yourself, then this is the place for you. Everyone was really nice but the job was not for me."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at UHC if that are looking for career advancement. It is very hard to move from certain departments. Managers will hold you back to suit their department needs
bad,"Don't really have a review. People are being laid off because we were bought out by another company. There is nothing really to say, just that we're being laid off."
bad,"I was not comfortable with leadership individuals such as the Quality and Appeals&Grievances Team deliberately ignoring others asking for help. The language and tone used on production floor was unacceptable and the management for UHC seemed to be distracted with other agendas other than assisting agents with dissatisfied members, locating information and addressing the team members not actively doing their job, which was to assist Member Advocates during a ""submission"" process."
bad,"They basically want you to sit at your computer and do applications back to back to back. The only time they really want you getting up is when its break/lunch time. They truly treat their employers like trash and it's like being in high school all over again. They claim to be a Fortune 500 company but they are extremely cheap, even their supervisors agree."
bad,"Management is LAZY! So much gossip and rumors. Everyone back stabs everyone. No loyalty and no support from management. Most of the managers were grandfathered in from Sierra Nevada and they all lack management skills. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"You have to know someone to get ahead in the company. The pay wasn't good. "
bad,"terrible pay, terrible conditions, bad benefits. No advancement opportunity. Management was wickedly terrible - it's not what you know, it's who you know. If you work hard, they don't advance you at all."
bad,"United Healthcare does not care about you. You are a faceless cog in an impersonal machine and you will be eliminated with no notice. I invested seven years into this company and they eliminated my position with no notice and despite me receiving fives on all my reviews I was not offered a replacement position. Totally impersonal, totally unfair. Don't work here unless you want to be treated like a number."
bad,This company is worst company to work for considering you hired by temp agency who tells you false info to get hired and then you find out that was all incorrect.
bad,"Little to no training beyond systems, asked to take phone calls for plans not trained on, number/stats driven performance incentives versus an emphasis on quality and customer service. extremely poor benefits package, and poor systems."
bad,Company was in a lot of flux when I worked there and mgmt. was not fully engaged in the projects. A lot of internal constant change in mgmt. with was difficult
bad,"The management was never on your side. They always rescheduled coaching or they just never did it. Management is the reason for their downfall. Callers were rude and disrespectful, treated you like you were less than dirt, and nothing was ever done about how they treated the agents. The benefits are horrible for working for an insurance company. Overall the worst job that I've had."
bad,No advancement. Company started laying off long term employees and they did not give out annual raises. The atmosphere was stressful and they was no compensation for the amount of work we had to do
bad,Everyday management do not apply the company values in my department thus leaving a total void in everyday production needs .self centered managers only interested in themselves instead of the teams that they are leading this has been ratified by numerous vital sign results and still nothing is done our results are the worst in the company
bad,"A typical call center work day. "
bad,Management was cutthroat.  Trainer had serious bad breath.  Management was always hostile and distrustful towards me.  I did not understand why they would always give me the stink eye.  Scum suckers.
bad,This company provides everyone hired with an excellent opportunity learn and grow. The experience is outstanding for buidling your resume. Paid time off is at an abundance.
bad,"Inconsistencies with regard to handling bad behaviors, especially enforcement of rules.  Staff won't come to your aid if they don't like you.  Older employees not valued."
bad,They pride their self on their core values but do not show any of their core values towards their own employees. The management is horrid and will move you consistently not allowing you to build up the skills you desire. They will also flat out lie to your face. Also for working for a health care company they do not offer their employees good health care coverage.
bad,"A typical day at work included answering incoming calls to assist members with benefits and claims assistance. "
bad,"Minimal maternity leave and no paid paternity leave, despite being a healthcare company. Also minimal pay compared to other similar companies in healthcare and other industries."
bad,united health group was great when I first started and then I asked to relocate to a different office that was closer to my living area when I went to the new office the management there was horrible I was harassed and placed on caps for no reason when going to hr to report the incidents happening nothing was ever done. it  became such a hostile environment that I was forced to resign.
bad,"Very stressful, Hired as a Direct Hire, completed 90 day probation and still no benefits. "
bad,A terrible place to work. Management was absolutely horrible and HR was no help. This was the worst job of my entire life. I wish that I was able to get back the years that I dedicated to this company. I have nothing positive to say about my two years with this company.
bad,The pay is terrible. Health coverage is even worse. If you like people cursing at you than go for it. Management only care how many calls you take and not how you take care of the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"The benefits were awful, management was prone to reneg on their promises to employees. Apply if you want to be a drone. They do not value the employees and everything is metric driven with few opportunities to advance. Low pay scale for industry and non competitive coverage."
bad,not a productive place to work at. the management were not there to always assist you with any questions and any of your concerns that you may have had.
bad,Management and/or Leadership are not concerned about work/life balance.  A great deal of inconsistency when it comes to training.  Would not recommend...
bad,A typical work day at United Healthcare is filled with hair-pulling stress!!! Management is a joke!!! Very unprofessional but will write you up for anything.  The hardest part of the job is being here.  The most enjoyable part would be your team members because they are the only ones that can fill your pain.
bad,"-horrible place to work."
bad,The most unorganized company I have ever worked for. HR and recruiting team are real bad and no one knows how to answer any HR questions. the pay is so low.
bad,"poor management, strict attendance policy- no flexibility with employee's personal life issues/ responsibilities.  Very corporate attitude.  do not recommend this job."
bad,"Company is extremely micro-managed. Management has no clue. They can break every rule possible with no repercussions. Look only at numbers without looking. Refuse to listen to their employees. When you bring up a concern to upper management and... next thing you know, you're terminated."
bad,They are not very good with balancing life and work this job was very hard on the employees mind and emotions. This company only cares about the company needs they do not care about the toll it takes on a person.
bad,"One of the worst companies I ever worked for, the hiring process was terrible. No benefits until you became permanent, which I never did. The pay was low which is sad for a supposedly great company and very telling thing. Training was 6 weeks of continually being bombarded new information and not being able to study it at home. Worst part is they put us on the phones and most of us were not ready. Scary really. Once on the floor had to set up your own computer."
bad,The management in this office is the most unprofessional that I have ever experienced in my work history.  Horrible.  I believe that some of the management staff needs mental counsiling and should not be over anyone.
bad,"This company was really ""green"" and new so the management was not really aware of what it took to run the business and was not really familiar with the systems or the culture"
bad,"Company let me drive myself to seek medical attention, when I told a supervisor I felt like I was having a heart attack. She never offered me any assistance, left for surgery, came back and they fired me"
bad,"Typical work day is like any other one that is in customer service, you take call and show compassion and empathy and help the member with a one call resolution. Been having ongoing issues with management."
bad,"On my first day on the job. One of my coworkers didn't want me there. On my second mouth I didn't want to come to work. I was picked on and bullied. I have told the managers and they didn't do anything. The training was so bad. I would ask questions and they will be rude. They are not nice to employees that have a learning disability. When i reported a problem, they never took care of it. Until i told them i will get HR into this mess. They did something about it. The second manager is very rude and rolls her eyes. The doctors are nice and all. The head manager always comes to work messy. It looks like she got out of bed. The office managers always talk about personal stuff. Like whats going on with there families and marriages. The clinic lies to each other and they can handle when the EMR is down they freak out."
bad,this place will nitpick every aspect of what you do down to the second making the day having to be perfect or risk not getting hired on and when you do get hired on your pay barely increases from the contact
bad,"Start the day off with inventory "
bad,This place was the worst! Every day of your life was micromanaged. You would be questioned if you took too long of a bathroom break. You were being recored the whole day. Every two weeks they would sit you down and review your performance and give you a critique. Total Big Brother culture.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Expected even more after reaching your status. Wanted 60+ more hours. Hard to get any time off. Have to put in a year in advance. Managers get away with murder. They leave up to very young people that don't do anything and are the ones to train others. Just unreal  place.  Also top performers loose their job after a year. They expected way to much from people that are willing to work.
bad,"Empresa que exige demais, quer simplesmente transformar o atendente de robô, mais de 100 ligações no período de 6 horas,  praticamento semana toda, acho que só o pessoal noturno tem um pouco de sossego, mas tudo bem o atendente foi contratado pra isso a final, mas o funcionário tem que ser robotizado o tempo todo, são ligações intermináveis, só bucha o tempo todo e você se sente imponente diante dá situação e não são casos isolados, sempre tem beneficiários descontente, reclamando do pouco caso que Amil tem com eles, raramente são agendamentos, trabalhei nessa empresa, agradeço pela a oportunidade, mas durante o período de atendimento você não é você, você é o robô dá empresa, por que a cada segundo você é monitorada, telas do computador gravadas, suas pausas 10 segundos de atraso vc é chamado atenção aff,muita exigência pra pouco reconhecimento"
bad,this place is not what i would call home. stay away. they like to make you feel like everything is your fault. you get written up for things that you did not do and they say you did.
bad,"The worst job I have ever worked for. If you miss one minute of work not matter the reason, they do not care-- it counts against you. Another company that you're just a person in a seat."
bad,"Overall, I loved my job but hated the company.  100 other employees and I were all blindsided by being laid off.  Management doesn't know how to communicate with you. They never had the answer to anything there answer to everything was ""I don't know"".  I slaved my butt off for them selling health insurance. Working 12 hours.  Oh and they purposely write you up just so you wont receive your commission. So the best thing to do is to MILK them for their overtime."
bad,"not good to work, management is worst and employ benefits are very bad. management look for their own benefits. they make employees to work long hours and do not pay for the work."
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for! Managers do not listen to the employees! No one knows anything in regards to the culture of united healthcare
bad,they treated me like dirt and did not give a dam about me or my family this is not a place of business for my worst emenies I would not recommend this place to no one to work with
bad,"Funcionários entram como agendamento, depois mudam para PJ ou serviços, esse aumento de demanda não é reconhecido um centavo de aumento. Benefício lixo, plano de saúde só para o trabalhador não extensivo a família, descontos e mais descontos. Serviço é facil, porém não existe atualização na planilha de credenciados o que gera enorme insatisfação dos beneficiários que recebem números de telefone errado e clínicas que não atendem mais. A empresa não está nem aí a quase um ano vejo isso é nada muda. Isso estressa o funcionário e desmotiva. Sem falar que não existe variável o melhor é o pior ganham a mesma coisa."
bad,did not enjoy working there as they were not employee friendly and did not value their employees as people. would not recommend as an employer
bad,"Terrible work environment everyone is for themselves leads, trainers do not like to help they want to see you fail. Job is based off a survey! If members are mad they fail you but they are not really mad at the representative they hate the insurance plan!! This place is very unprofessional and they don't care about family needs like working nights and weekends!! This place NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN"
bad,"they will not give commission when you have earned it, will say you will be hired full time employee and it will not happen, poor management no one to go to if you have problems or concerned, no benefits offered, I was working with optium as company that United Health Group works with I would hope that the main company is a better one then their sister companies."
bad,I was contracted for 6 months to reach out to members to assess their medical needs. I was required to obtain all necessary lab results from the members themselves and often they did not have the information and would require further contact. The calls were also recorded. I was let from this position due to illness which later required surgery.
bad,The environment is not a comfortable place to work in. It is really quite and they are not at all flexible with the work scheduling. It is also very difficult to move up into a higher position.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work here. They're so desperate for people that they'll hire just about anyone because the turn over rate is ridiculously high. The job is stressful, the overtime is crazy, and the benefits HORRIBLE! I am thousands of dollars in debt now because of their awful benefits, which made it difficult for me to be a good customer service rep because I knew just how bad the insurance was!!!! Management   likes to play favorites, and the stats yout have to maintain are impossible. United Healthcare does not care about its customers or employees; that was made abundantly clear with how bad the training was. Calls are literally back-to-back, and if you're not one of the favorites, you're going to get the worst  calls all day, every day. Bottom line: the pay is NOT worth the amount of stress this job causes."
bad,So far this is not legit Co. They post thousands of jobs which are active for 3/4 years. Never heard back after applying here more than 10 times. This is one of the companies who don't really care about your time when you spend an hour to 90 minutes to fill out application.
bad,"do not remember much about this company. it was a long time ago."
bad,Then none of the perks or benefits are true. unable to leave your seat for restroom breaks. There is no breaks between calls. You email doctors for help or refill request with no replies ever.
bad,"This is the absolute worst place to work! They get you by stating they are big on COMPASSION.... The Morrisville location is off the chain. Trainers seating in trainees laps in class, supervisors discuss other agents personal business on the production floor. Management is the worst I have every seen. The only thing descent about this company is absolute nothing. They don't give the customers what they need they push the responsibility off on to the providers.So therefore how can they honestly say they have COMPASSION when the customers don't receive it!!!!"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"one of the worst places to work they hire and fire at will,management does not care about people,trainers are poor trainers don't know how to train management rules by fear if you want to get hired so that you are fired tomorrow well join this company,i worked at Optum in Frederick and there is a conspicuous lack of male managers 90% of the managers are women if men dominated management like they do here there will be an outcry our team started at 15 and by the time i was leaving we were down to 4 another team they were 22 and down to seven ,they do that cause they can get a pool of applicants from recruiting agencies,they keep on telling you it is a great place to work all the time but in reality it is not,the pay is just a little above minimum wage,no one is sure how long they will last always under constant fear of being fired........people get fired all the time it is ridiculous .......so many empty cubicles you turn around and you remember all those who sat next to you who have been fired  and wonder if you are next ,when you get called to the office there is an 80 % you are being let go ,no warnings no nothing just like that and they give you this speech that they will try and help you with whatever you want to move your career forward,i thought it was a great company but it is not in reality this company cares less about its employees but just about making money.........."
bad,"I learned a lot , was loyal to company , gave 100 percent to ensuring Organizational objectives were met. "
bad,the training is just a big set up for failure. management is unprofessional and not knowledgeable at all.  They tell u incorrect information and penalize you for following their directions.  Only high deductible insurance/pharmacy plans or offered to employees.  They don't pay a liveable wage. Everything about this job is a 'No'.  Its just not worth the trouble.
bad,"This company does not care about there employees. They are too busy buying up small companies and destroying the small family culture, everyday there are changes, they close our Cash Posting department and everyone loses there job, the next day they let our Patient Pay Collectors go, people that have been with our company for over 20 years is now unemployed. We use to have company parties and events and UHC has taken that away bringing our moral down so low people hate coming to work. They also offer ZERO advancement opportunities,  I have applied for more than 10 different positions all of which I am qualified for and are entry level and I am turned down within 24 hours of submitting my application. A company that does not promote from within is a s**** company."
bad,"Money is great, but you'll end up spending it on psychiatrists and medication. It is a very hostile work environment, which is awful because the clients deserve better."
bad,A day is always different unhappy members regarding mail order services.  Training not typical as the job will be once your on the floor.
bad,This is a company with potential but they like to recruit younger or military people with no experience.  Still this is a good place for military
bad,"run for your life. This place does not care about employees, you are just another number at another call center. The turn over is high- hint - hint! run!"
bad,"United Healthcare is under investigation for wire fraud and human trafficking.  UHG satellite flesh peddlers contracted US citizens then dumped them in favor of low-paid foreigners in Ireland (tax free), India and The Philippines.  The foreigners will split the job & paycheck up between 2-3 people.  Keep away!  No health insurance (scam), bad equipment, poor training that leaves you not knowing how to do your job and then you're fired for not meeting goals.  The ""supervisors"" are not coders themselves so they're no help.  It is a sick criminal cult driven by corporate greed.  Break them up!  Make them pay corporate taxes on US taxpayer funded Medicare reimbursements wired to Dublin, laundered in Amsterdam and deposited offshore in Caribbean tax havens to the shareholders delight.  Shame on the US Congress!"
bad,"Answering calls about callers health care benefits and quoting them the cost of the services asked about. If you quote it wrong, you could cause irreparable harm to that person's health and finances.They don't train you fully either, four weeks in they throw you on the phones without being fully trained and you can't tell the caller your training. They are a no excuses, no lee way type of company. If you have children or have any health issues that cause you to visit the doctors a bit, they will not excuse you to go to the doctors. Even that counts against you. Even if you tell them ahead of the time; Any time you can't show up, its one ding on your record and they only allow 7 before your fried. Also, with the call center being in NH, if we have get bad snow storm and you can't get there, too bad. They never close for any weather related reasons."
bad,"This company had potential, but their focus was always being number one and lacked true support of their dedicated staff"
bad,"They run this place like a sweat house.  there's always mandatory overtime, but not enough pay.  You're working behind gates with jumpsuits on...it's almost like you're a prisoner."
bad,"The claims processing department of this company is poorly managed, spectacularly overworked, and under appreciated. I have worked at the TN site for over a year, during which time we have had about 5 or 6 weeks where their overtime was voluntary or less than eight hours a week. The REQUIRED overtime is usually 8 to 15 hours a week, and it has been continual since May of 2014. "
bad,"No a company you would want to work for if u have a family. Not family oriented at all. Shows a lot of favoritism, promote unqualified employees, Seniority doesn't count with this company at all, you are just a number here. Very stressful company, if u are healthy, count on having a health condition before leaving."
bad,They always laying off people accounts always closing . They don't get your pay right management sucks DO NOT WORK HERE !!! Your job isn't secured
bad,"This company (my experience was with The Vines in Ocala) has the worst company morale and management I have ever seen. I truly do not know how they continue to remain open. They have such a high staff turnover that they give massive new employee orientations with excessive new staff because they are aware the majority of the new employees will not stay. Pay is low. Management meets daily in the a.m. and talks about what employees they think are deficient in their duties. They do not give you a 3-month then 6-month evaluation, they will keep you there until a new employee is hired then let you go abruptly. They treat the patients like cattle, herding them around from unit to eat.  There is no ""therapy"" there, just a lot of patients milling around and asking about their rights (with regards to involuntary commitments) and medications, but getting no responses from anybody. The management staff is the worst I have ever seen in 20 years. They believe they are above reproach, do not want to provide training, expect other line employees to train you, and their only concern is with keeping a high census of patients at the hospital because then they get huge bonuses. Don't walk, RUN!!!!!!!"
bad,They under pay their employees...not a good work place for mother's...unfair employee treatment....unprofessional...and the benefits are the worst...i've never worked for a company that simply did not care one bit about their employees. they mistreat their employees and all they do is lie...they talk about intergrity and expect you to have intergrity but they themselves do not have any at all. they need to practice what they preach.
bad,If you are not in the circle then you will not get promoted or your performance will not be rewarded in form of the annual bonus
bad,"Again, UHC was not a good fit for me. I did not have a very good experience."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Responsible for the processing of complex medical claims. Answered provider and member question pertaining to dates of service, claim and benefit inquiries. Excelled in call metrics and processing quality. Various awards and accolades received"
bad,Worst company EVER!!!! The team is unorganized. Admin are easily intimidated and are one uppers. Antiquated systems. No cohesiveness. Management sucks.
bad,"Very controlling.  If you don't agree you are marked for termination."
bad,"the stepping stone into the sales world as well as showing me how to provide a great customer experience. However, they do not provide the best of benefits. This company is also small so it would be hard to make advancements in regards to a career opportunity."
bad,"Supposed to pay claims (correctly) at 43 claims per hour.  This includes seeing the claim, researching the benefits of the customer and forcing the system to pay it correctly."
bad,"You receive no hands on training on the program's you will be working in. Training done over the phone by someone in another state. You are taking tests that have nothing to do with the program's you will have to work in. You have no assistance while on the phones. You feel so lost and alone no one to help or mentor you. Also felt disrespect from others in the office, often the others would make fun of veterans and people after they got off the phones. Do not apply for Customer Service Representative. You will be miserable in the job."
bad,There was a good variety of tools that rotated through my department when I was there.  The long hours I saw people working was rather shocking.  Lots of turnover and frustration because they run very lean.
bad,"Horrible horrible horrible.  "
bad,A typical day would begin by logging into your systems and phone and then get ready for non-stop calls back to back. Ever-changing policies that you are not always made aware of until it's too late and Quality has already deducted you 20 points. Hardest part of the job were the rude people on the phones and trying to get your supervisor to take a sup call. The most enjoyable part of the day was driving off that parking lot after my shift.
bad,"The managers in the Elkridge office for ""Team Care"" created an environment with very low morale and an awful job culture."
bad,Lack of work/life balance and high turnover rates.  Poor morale and lack of teamwork among managers and staff. Lots of manual/ archaic processes.  Lack of training and historical knowledge. Few opportunities for employee growth and development.
bad,"I have worked in claims processing for a year. The MANDATORY overtime is 5-15 hours a week and has not ended since I have been employed here. There is no work/life balance. The management is horrendous and changes constantly (two operations managers, two out of three supervisors, and even the division directors in the year I have been here.). The claims processing itself is something I actually like, but the metrics are confusing and difficult to meet. The sops (standard operations protocols for processing) are dreadfully written and difficult to follow. Questions and interactions with fellow employees are strongly discouraged. I have not had a ""one on one"" meeting with my supervisor since I have been here. The company ""culture"" is basically the banal pap spouted by many other large corporations. "
bad,"I have over 20 yrs experience in work place in customer relation and administration support and working for UHC was like being in grade school , they treat their employees like there stupid and it was a horrible working environment , I don't recommend anyone to apply unless your still required to ask your mommy for permission to  go to restroom"
bad,"And don't mind not having support from management, a culture that is both stressful and low pay. This is the place for you."
bad,"At first it sounds great cause its a day shift, no weekends position. "
bad,"I was not afn of United HC. I found the site to be unprofessional, poorly managed as well as dirty. Poor pto balance as well as pay."
bad,The supervisors and upper management do not care about at all! Let this job be your last resort. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy.
bad,I was data entry and customer service representative for United Healthcare/Optum RX. I would review prescriptions online made sure all insurance information was on file in order to process orders on a timely manner to members.
bad,"Not  Organized and communication is not at its best. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication of changes and whats new, whats no longer used and the rude providers."
bad,"Typical day consisted on working appeals accounts for Texas, Maryland, and New York while also providing data entry of accounts for Triage."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Speak to members regarding their benefits.  Work 10 hours a day, 5 days a week."
bad,"I worked for united Health care worst company."
bad,This is a fast paced environment; telecommuting was great--less office politics. Management could care less about you as a worker and my team was very clicky. Poor management. This corporation cares more about profit versus providing quality of care to its customers.
bad,Never being able to give helpful advice/information to customers calling in about their health insurance which is vital to their lives!!  Supervisors never having the information when asked for the their help and would pass it on to other departments or other agencies that didn't have nay better information either!!!
bad,"assist Providers and patients with benefits, claims, DDS locations. The team members are friendly to each other as for the company as a whole its not a friendly place to work, the supervisors are rude and not ever available.  The hardest part of the job is the system is always freezing up and not reliable.  The best part of the job is the people on the phone when you get that one person that just makes your day."
bad,"Auditing calls in a fast paced environment, assist representatives with challenged calls. Assist representatives with calls as well monitor and give feedback to representatives... Most challenging was providing feedback to multiple personalities."
bad,Awful experience.  Worked at the company for 2 years and it was not an enjoyable experience.  Management and Team Leaders are bullies.
bad,"The job was stressful not a good fit for myself. It was like taking dictation in a courtroom, when you are trainned they don't let you know all that you are coming in to."
bad,A typical day consists of phone (recorded) sales. I am a top sales person and the pay/bonuses in insufficient to meet my life style needs.
bad,"If you want you payments managed by a drug addict and a director with no back bone, then this is the place for you. The ""manager"" of EDI smoked pot in the parking lot, and belittled her employees everyday. The director has no backbone and can't stand up for his employees. Worst company to date to associate yourself with. If you choose a clearinghouse, avoid this one. They currently employee incompetent staff who would rather gossip than work. You'd be better off hiring offshore than them. Top that off with an employee being abusive, and once reported he got a raise. Shame on you and the poo lords you are."
bad,"Co workers are great, Supervisors act like teenagers. A typical day includes about 80 calls from members answering questions about benefits or claims, if a situation escalates to a supervisor you can bet that supervisor ends up having a regular employee do the work or just drops the ball. The best part about the job is the bonds you make with the other employees you work with but the worst part is that you are treated like a disposable employee and if you get into the customer service told they will never let you advance. when you are hired they tell you that after a year you can transfer anywhere in the company and they want to help you advance, however because their turnover rate is so high they are always desperate for employees in the customer service dept they will put a block on internal transfers so you are stuck in a dead end job."
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for in my life it has actually made me want to leave the medical field completely. If you are lucky enough to get into a good clinic the managers are not supportive and if you have a good manager then the doctors are uncaring if you get a good manager and doctor then the upper management does not support the clinic and it's needs. Just an all around bad company to work for.
bad,"No matter how much you go above and beyond on a daily basis, you are not recognized or rewarded. The only recognition you will receive is when you do wrong and you are pulled into a conference room and berated condescendingly by management. Multiple ethics complaints by multiple employees on treatment by management, go ignored.  This in turn causes high turnover among employees, either quitting looking for a better job or being fired for random reasons. "
bad,"1. Worthless trainers!!!! Rude, Incompetent, Used excessive profanity, Blasted music while in training and dared you to object to it!!!!"
bad,I have never disliked a company I work for as much as I did Global. The only good thing about the company is the pay. Nobody there knows what they are doing when it comes to billing.
bad,Learned many different tasks while employed there.  This job needs to have a lead pharmacy technician who can relate the job requirements and be a go between the other technicians and the pharmacists.
bad,"There are some impressive things happening in there prior authorization team mainly because they hired a site leader last year who really knows how to manage the group and the supervisors and team leaders. I think they will probably lose him because he seems way over qualified for the job and seems like he should be way higher in the company then he is. He is doing some incredible changes and his team likes his management style and his supervisors are finally working on the right things like they should. "
bad,"Corporate mind set and unyielding playbook. There are no exceptions to there rule book, you either conform and fit in or you are out! Not understanding of human needs."
bad,"was only a temp position would have like to stay there, nice place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,They make you work 10 + hours a day and pay is horrible. Would not recommend working here to anyone!
bad,"No one rewards hard work.  Overtime never stops.  Unprofessional managers and supervisors who don't know anything - includes the vice presidents who make the rules but have no idea how they should work in the dept!  Fire people for no reason and the appeal process is a joke.  No support from HR.  All the good people find other jobs before they get fired and the ones left could care less.  Its all about money and not the patients.  Tried over 30 times to move up in the company and never got a chance - they ""red flag"" your file so you can't go any where else - over 5 years I tried!  False info given at termination - lots of age discrimination here in Cypress.  They don't even let you come back to the company as a ""temp"" !  Agencies tried to place me in other departments and always turned down for no reason.  HR knows how to get around laws - can't see what is in your file or get paid the day you leave!!  They don't care because they have the money to fight you and win.  They deserve a less than zero overall rating."
bad,"I worked for this company over 5 years "
bad,they work you hard and never work with you when it comes to being sick or your child being sick . Cant make dr appointments etc very unreasonable place and environment to work in.
bad,It was a learning experience. It was one I hope to not experience again.
bad,I had 40 hours of vacation time on the books that they refused to pay because paying the vacation pay upon resignation was not required by law in the state of TN.
bad,"I had the worst experience working for this company. The management was horrible, messy, cut-throat, and cold hearted. The training unorganized an insignificant. No job security. If you had a personal issue with management, or even breathed the wrong way they would fire you.  Management play favoritism and the people who knew the least were promoted. I never missed a day and was never late, knew my job and had a plesent attitude but I was fired. They sent me an email telling me not to come back to the premises. I still don't know why I was released from the position. Oh yeah did I mention unorganized. Worst job ever. On top of every thing else no benefits. Management created an environment of chaos as opposed to harmony. They played workers  against one another. We were made to feel that we were in a life and death competition and in the end no one was a winner. They let us all go without warning. Run fast away from this company."
bad,United does not care about the employee.  They are numbers driven and keep people for wrong reasons
bad,"I worked here as a seasonal worker and was treated poorly. Management talks bad about everyone and their unreachable goals become a competitive circus for the employees.  You will have your every move tracked and recorded. Despite not missing a day of work and being a top performer, you will be lied to about getting a permanent job there."
bad,"This Kingston NY/NYS Empire company is horrible to work for."
bad,"hated it: absolutley unfairly terminated"
bad,"I went to work everyday wishing I were dead.  This place must be run by the devil himself.  Threats of being fired came with every email.  Work environment was onimous, rude, and condenscending.  Mandatory overtime with no regard for when day care closes.  No room for advancement for anyone with a brain.  This is a health insurance company that had health insurance for its employees with a $5,000 deductible!!  20% of my entire salaray...not to mention dependant coverage!!  This is the worst place to work...a little piece of me died every time I walked through those doors."
bad,"avoid this job at all cost, if you want to work 50 hours a week, low pay, horrible benefits, including medical, then this job maybe for you.  Management sets unrealistic expectations, and they will try all they can for you not to qualify for a bonus or yearly raise."
bad,High turn over in management with no consistent focus of direction. Benefits are awful and nothing compared to what UHG offers to other companies for their employees.  Example: $2500 deductible for single person at UHG and a competitor with only 800 employees is given $750 deductible for $36/month or $250 deductible for $16/month.  Micro-manager is why I left.  She had no management experience and both her and the director were not interested in hearing about any issues or solutions that actually made sense.
bad,"This company has no training skills, it was terrible!  Out dated learning material.  Taught the 'basics' and expected to take it from there.  Extremely stressful job."
bad,This company is a horrible place to work. The management  is changing constantly. It's very unorganized.  The benefits are a joke and they are outsourcing jobs left and right to India. The bonuses are horrible and pay not so great.
bad,"This job is like being on a slave ship.  You will be micro managed and constantly watched.  They treat their employees like children. They show favoritism.  They spend too much time watching and criticizing employees,  instead of properly paying claims, having functioning systems etc.  The sups and managers are very unprofessional,  sarcastic,  condescending and disrespectful.  they are everything to u, they would not want u to be to a provider. The turn over rate is high because people are unhappy there.  Most dont even make it out of training before they find better jobs.  So many people call off or take stress leaves there because that job is stressful and mentally draining.  The pay sucks and they lie to you about your job responsibilities upon hiring you.  They are constantly asking for money to donate without u having a say in the charities. Newsflash you don't pay enough to be able to afford to donate. They claim they are built on ethics,  integrity, etc. But the sups and managers lie to you and the providers.  They constantly add responsibility with no compensation for it. Its a very dreary, negative,  unhappy, phony environment.  RUN!!!"
bad,"scoring sleep studies,I learned not to trust anything that is not in writing.My co worker were good .the most enjoyable part was leaving."
bad,"tive bons conhecimentos"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"You see the essence of corporate greed every day. You're worked to death, and never complimented. It's a CYA environment. Your coworkers will stab you in the back at the very first opportunity to save their own butts. People are let go for sneezing too loudly. Do not apply to work here."
bad,This company doesn't really focus on the advancement of individuals. It's more so a numbers game.
bad,"I received wonderful reviews re:Unitedhealth Group but once employed with the company, I experienced differently."
bad,"Impossible standards to meet for quality.  Treats their retirement and medicare members horribly.  Mandatory overtime. Terrible trainer. Chained to desk. Unreachable goals set by management so that they don't have to give bonus' or raises. The company always has their hands out to the employees for something. You have to pay them 2.00 a day or 20.00 a month to wear jeans. They are always asking for donations for something. For a health care company, they have the worst insurance for employees I have ever seen in my 32 years of work."
bad,"Respond to complex customer calls "
bad,"...better to be a man at UHC.  Lack of management support, bad health benefits, and no work/life balance."
bad,"Answer incoming calls from member's of our various pharmacy benefit plans we manage. Assist pharmacies with claim processing for Medicare,Medicaid & Commercial insurances. Explain how pharmacy benefit work, assist with plan drug formularies and drug coverage."
bad,Horrible Management. No consistency. No growth No professionalism
bad,they are great to their employees - overall a very positive workplace.
bad,"not a good experience with this company had to quit, the training class was rude, the trainers did not have control over the class. overall it was a horrible employment experience and I will not apply to them again."
bad,"Bad medical insurance benefits, the deductibles and premiums were ridiculous."
bad,"Management is horrible, they have no compassion for employees nor do they know how to follow policy and procedure."
bad,This was a great company to work for before they were sold to United heatlhcare. United Healthcare does not take care of their employees.  You are just a number and a warm body sitting at a desk doing the work they need done.
bad,Temp agency requirement makes it very difficult to enjoy working for this company
bad,"just a bad place to work; better off steering clear of it tbh, place is in the middle of shipping everyone to TX and getting rid of our jobs."
bad,run don't walk.  from co-workers to supervisors to HR when I asked for help I was violently bullied demeaned neglected and insulted during my employment.  I received excellent performance reviews and comments despite the bullying.  speaks to my integrity and my committment to fullfill my part of the contract.
bad,"Typical day at work would handling busy phone calls for providers, assisting with benefits, eligibility, and various other duties. "

bad,"Unrealistic metrics! Lied about metrics. 150 max at first then 150 was the minimum. Didn't care about clients welfare only about profit. Great time off only it wasn't really time off . Example if you wanted off a week and you called 30 people per day. All of those people still had to be called. So the week before you wanted off you had to call 60 per day. So you really were not getting the time off because you had to do all the work still. Was told you would get spot bonuses really never happened. Then they said quarterly bonuses. That was changed to yearly. Half of the equipment didn't work that was sent to clients."
bad,"Depending on the department/operation management, employees are not supported, trusted, or encouraged to continue education.  Employees that are exempt professionals are treated like they are not exempt in any way. If you want to take a few hours off (exempt level), you must take PTO to get the time.  Managers are narcissistic, condescending, patronizing and lack professionalism. Management is very weak, they are not chosen to be managers of people, they are very excellent at micro-managing each professional's work. In the area I worked in, one of the managers blatantly singled out an employee, stated things to the employee several times in front of other team members for having a disability and turned around an fired them. Really glad they were not my manager."
bad,"i would  assist with bathing and changing residents"
bad,"Right now they're listing a job (that I worked in for 3.5 years) as ""Why work weekends when you can work wonders?""  Well guess what, in those 3.5 years I spent roughly 3 of them working every Sunday because they refused to hire the necessary work force to handle the amount of work so they required everyone to work 10 hrs overtime each week.  Also, not terrific was replacing us with a team from India."
bad,"not a great work environment, managers were also not very smart"
bad,Great Company... Better employment education needed as some employees are not familiar with specified job duties
bad,Did not enjoy working here pay was average but the atmosphere was very competitive and very mundane and rude place to work
bad,"When I first started with Optum Rx (formally know as Prescription Solutions) it was more of a family environment. Once we merged with other United Healthcarepartners the morale was out the door. We didnt receive a raise in years, although we were told to be blessed to have employment ..ughhhh, what! Advancement within wasnt an option unless you kissed you Supervisor bumm....(im not that type). The only perk was the telecommunications opportunity. That still wasnt enough! The micromanagement is unreal, you have to meet your monthly merits,  aht 15 seconds, att 5:00, acw 2:00 and quality 92%. i did exceed this expectations monthly. That still wasnt enough for management to cut you some slack! Sometimes you just have to cut ties, for your own piece of mind!"
bad,"Health Care Company, Do i need to say more! Not a good place to work."
bad,United Health Care was sadly a very bad company to work for. The staff is asked to perform several job functions outside their original assignment with little or no training available.  After implementing new policies/procedures it would immediately become part of the job performance matrix system.  Any error allowed for no grace any additional training requests to better understand the product were deemed corrective action/unable to perform job function.  With the changes in health care it does not pay to leave your front line uninformed with insufficient training.
bad,"Trained new reps."
bad,"This is the most disgusting place that I have ever worked. It feels as though I wasted two years of my life in a cube to be treated poorly by management!! I have worked for 20 years and never have been so disrespected in my life. I had great ""stats"" but refused to be competitive to the point of two facing it and cut throat to get promoted. "
bad,"Poor Management and No HR interfare, Red Flag Rulers are found here. No respect for employess"
bad,"I cannot express how horrible this company is. Management is beyond incompetent and they will LIE, LIE, LIE  to you to get you there and then try to work you to the ground. There is no work/life balance and the favoritism is beyond words. "
bad,"This company is poorly managed and there is too much reactionary change. Being a Wellness Coach I was constantly on the phone, not enough time to do a proper job with telephonic clients. Worked through breaks and lunches to complete work and management frowned upon this and was told I shouldn't do this but when I approached management multiple times about the work load nothing changed. In fact they knew this to be the circumstance and told me to ask for help but when I did on multiple occasions they were never available. They talk a good talk but management never walked the walk. No matter how hard you work or all that you accomplished, it will never be enough. Their philosophy was what can you do for me now. Management published productivity numbers/metrics which pits you against your coworkers and makes people cheat to gain the upper hand. Management encourages this behavior, however they will never admit it but the bottom line is higher metrics ultimately means their Wellness programs are  valdated (erroneously) so they can sell their services to corporations which purchase their wellness coaching programs. It is all staged and carefully calculated, what coaches say and how they calculate/inflate metrics, focus exclusively on short term results to make the sale easier for the sales team. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the consumers and seeing their success, other than that this job is not enjoyable at all. I learned that I never work for this company again."
bad,"Horrible company with terrible benefits. UHC has great insurance...but not for their own employees. Management does nothing but micromanage everyone else. No positive reinforcement. The only critiques are bad critiques. Multiple times, we found them interviewing for internal management positions after already choosing the person to get the job. The interviews were only for show. Terrible terrible terrible place. "
bad,"it's hard to know where to begin on this review. management is always about numbers making sure that you meet your goals, however the goals that are setup are unrealistic. a clueless management staff, and archaic system software. when you get three errors you're terminated, but the hard part is you can't fight your errors because there's no paper trail. the technicians are the ones that are finding, reporting for fixing the errors. they recently change the Vice President and the director of Pharmacy because they didn't know what was going on in that building also. I left at company because the place was falling apart and there was no one taking the reins."
bad,"I am surprised CMS in not investigating this insurance company for misleading the senior population. Google United healthcare complaints and find all the smoke and mirror tactics this company takes to enhance its bottom line! Seniors have claims rejected for medically necessary procedures, they get the run around when trying to utilize their benefits for prescriptions and also they receive plastic ""toylike"" hearing aids that last a month or two. Ridiculous. I do not endorse this company or their tactics.When the senior backtracks to the agents that sold the policy with promises unkept....they hear......crickets......"
bad,UHC is a great place to learn about the healthcare industry. However management is out of touch with employees. You will be forced to work Mandatory OT
bad,never work here. a horrible company.nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

bad,i learned how to help and talk with people as well as making sure they were satsifed and in a clean place
bad,Upper management doesn't make proper decisions for the betterment of the workers or company.
bad,"I heard about this company and was told it was a terrible place to work, but figured I would give it a shot. BAD DECISION on my part. Management is the worst and the employees are over-worked, under-paid and beyond miserable. The entire culture reminds me of high school. I was never treated like a professional, and saw no future as what I was hired to do, and what I ended up doing, were two different things. Find a job anywhere else, but United Health. The place is toxic!!"
bad,"At the beginning everything was fine until a couple of people in my training class and I began noticing the lies we were told and promised in training beginning to unfold. 12.74 an hour to process claims there was a JOKE and management was an even bigger JOKE. There was a HUGE turnover rate and many many unhappy employees that stayed due to not being able to find anything else (but I did, searched my butt off and got out of there). I wouldn't recommend this company to my enemy. Their benefits were terrible and there was so much mandatory overtime you were there more than you were with your family. They gave NO raises and the only way you could promote is by WHO YOU KNEW and how FRIENDLY (butt kissers) you were with management. I HATED it and came home everyday miserable."
bad,Working for United Health has been an experience that I would have never imagined. There is an enormous amount of processes and departments that don't work together.
bad,"Look elsewhere..please. Pay is low, no opportunity for advancement and management is incompetent."
bad,"I went to work for Optum Health in San Antonio. My husband was dying of cancer. Eleven months into my employment, my husband began the dying process. I applied for a leave to be with my husband but was denied. I received the call denying my request while my husband was in Hospice. He died 2 days later. I didn't care if I got fired or not. I was so sick with grief and my manager kept coming to me to tell me to get back on the phones. This is the most heartless and despicable company I have ever heard of."
bad,"I would just like to tell anyone who is seriously interested in this company...don't wast your time. The online testing is antiquated, and took 5 calls and 3 different computers (which I had to locate on my own) to complete this test. I then went on an interview for a Claims Rep position in the Kingston NY facility. The recruiter who BTW does not work for UH was exceptional. She interviewed me and saw the vast experience/education I had and put me though to interview with the hiring manager. She was horrible, no eye contact, did not ask anything about myself, experience, or education, and lasted all of 15 mins. Her only concern which she repeated twice, was not to miss any of the training classes for 16 weeks, for $12.74 an hour. I've worked in this kind of environment for over 20 years, and have never experienced anything like this before."
bad,Terrible. Employees are allowed to talk loudly while other employees take phone calls.
bad,"I am still employed with this company. I have only been employed here for less than 3 months and work in the HR department. I should still be in my honeymoon phase of employment; however, our jobs are threatened constantly, there's a strong lack of communication, the management has all been employed less than 1 year, and there is HUGE turnover in the entire company. The basic leadership of the company is incompetent and inexperienced. I left a great job to come here and thought it would be a good move towards career advancement. BIG MISTAKE!!!"
bad,"Most of the employees at UHG are nice people. But, you have to watch your back. If you have kids no dont work there. If your child gets sick you will be wrote up for it. Training-Lacking you will not be kept update. Management full of liars, you tell them there is a problem or you need something. They will not do what they tell you. Benefits.. Please, you would think working for a insurance company you would have good benefits. You will be paying more out of pocket."
bad,"The hardest part of the job, was that every phone call, was verbal abuse. We had no information to give customer about the the new billing systems, or when the doctors would receive payment from insurance companies,"
bad,"From beginning to end this company has a lot of growing. I came from over 20 years background in customer service and have never worked for a company like this one. The training was unprofessional and did not fully prepared for the position. Most of what I learned was from my co-workers and what I grasped on my own. The upper management team were not approachable and the company did not appreciate hard, honest workers. Time and time again you would see individuals advance who everyone who worked with them knew they were unworthy of the advancement. Yes it was not what you know but who you knew. The metrics this company set forth was unattainable, something had to be sacrificed and usually those precious customers were sacrificed. I loved working and helping the elderly and good customer service can not be measured by metrics. I worked from home and actually only looked forward to assisting the customers. For lack of a better word, ""this company ""SUCKED"" when it actually came to customer service. Hopefully this review would reach the desk of someone in management and he or she would care of enough about the direction of the company, reach out and actually sit down for an entire day with a customer service representative and review and evaluate the metrics and goals system. I really believe UHC has the potential of becoming a great company for both the customer and employees but someone has to be willing to really care about WORLD CLASS CUSTOMER SERVICE."
bad,On a typical workday you'll be barraged by corporate propaganda hammering the idea that United is a highly ethical company and a great and competitive place to work. In reality you'll be slaving away for an unending stream of new managers with constant re-structuring while getting paid sometimes 50% of what your position would pay at another company.
bad,"The company has not room for advancement, underpaid, all they think about are numbers and not the people. Not organized at all."
bad,"I was able to work independently as a medical biller, but the owner was too interested in collecting 2.70 in a copay from a medicare patient, than to be interested in the well being of his patients, and that bothered me. I brought in a lot of money for this doctor, but he was not appreciative, nor was he nice to me, and he treated me dreadly. I was injured in a car accident on my way to work in January, and had to have surgery on my ankle to insert a plate and three screws, so I could walk again. He said he would keep my job for me, but even though I went back to work before I was released from my surgeon, he had hired someone to replace me, and he let me go... sometimes God does for us what we could not do for ourselves, or I'd still be there, and miserable."
bad,"This company cares only about the bottom dollar. They do not care about their employees. They squabble internally. There is no commeraderie or teamwork or a team attitude. They also have a huge communication gap between departments. To get a question answered is nearly impossible. They meeting you to death! They promote the people who will make them more money instead of the best person for the job. Even though they are the nation's top insurer, they provide the worst benefits to their own employees. Working for them has been the single most worst experience I have ever had. I cannot wait to find another job."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,This really is not a good environment to work in.
bad,Lots of overtime and no compensate at all. Terrible management.
bad,"They have horrible bosses, no communication, barely any training when getting new tasks, and when ask for help it’s a problem. Very clicky atmosphere including managers and higher ups."
bad,Corporate companies tend to conduct a massive layoff from time to time. The logistics of the layoff is random which meant hard work doesn't pay off. I find the corporate goals/culture is not impacting downstream.
bad,"I started there and my first 3+ years were great. Thought it would be my ""til I retire job"". Great people, they focused on training and quality. Their culture was seen everyday. Then new management took over and we went from Resolution Specialists (resolving problems) to Call Center Slaves. Went from a busy month of 1000 calls to taking over 1800 in a 20 day month and told that wasn't enough. They took away all opportunities for professional development, even our ability to follow up and keep promises to our clients (doctors, other healthcare professionals). Claims were almost always processed overseas and they made gross errors. Every benchmark we were focused on - quality, caring, compassion - went out the door for quick Comcast level service. Supervisors went from teams of 8-10 to covering 35 people - no assistance or help for either front line or callers. Representatives started showing signs of stress - stomach ulcers, migraines, back pain - but Workforce kept giving us more calls and less opportunities to stretch, or recover."
bad,No work life balance overtime is mandatory because they didn’t prepare for the merge with United Health Care. We were Epic Hearing now currently United Healthcare Hearing. Now they are overworking their employees and most of them are not happy including myself. I have another full time job being a mom to 3 kids when I get off work I don’t need mandatory overtime put on me as well as Saturday work.
bad,"The focus is on customer service, yet they don't provide us with the tools 2 perform it. They roll out new initiatives that make no sense & training is horrible & rushed. Focus is on metrics even when they say it's not. Poor annual raises. Benefits suck. Morale is always low. Management seems disconnected. Do"
bad,"This company gives you the impression you matter, that you are important and their priority. I was there for 3 years and they always fed you non sense so you wouldn’t ask again. Most of the employees are there because they either have no more schooling or are just comfortable and can’t find anything else. All this company cares about is keeping their contracts and members never their employees. They pretend they have your best interest, but all they do is again feed you non sense so you can back off. This position is taught to you so you can perform at your best, they always want to throw you into roles and positions that they say are for the best, but you never see a cent to match what you do. This position should at least pay 4 dollars more than what is offered. I went in there loving every part of my job, but after more than a year all they ask for was for you to bring more. I fell into depression working there, my mental health was more important than this job. I loved the members, not the company"
bad,"Dont suggest. unfair, inconsistent. poor managment. too much work, not "
bad,"This company was the worst I ever worked for. The manager was known for favoritism and abuse of power, and even though reported many times, nothing was ever done. Everything is about sales and no consideration is given to job satisfaction for their employees. Terrible working environment."
bad,"This place is all about making money for upper management and stock holders run by a old boys club.  Average merit raises for last 10 years is 1 to 1.5 percent and the BONUS that they talk so big about when you are in the hiring process is a myth.  Unless you get a 5 star rating, you will get no bonus.  The training is horrible with people reading to you that cannot answer questions.  It is a sink or swim workplace and if you aren't looked upon favorably for things that have nothing to do with your work skills by the old boys club, you will never advance and never keep up with the cost of living. Benefits suck for a Fortune 10 company, health insurance horrible. The culture of this place is horrific- beat you down and intimidation. I talked to HR and they tell you this stuff is determined by your department's management.  You tell them that sucks and they shrug their shoulders."
bad,I did not like working here turnover rate sucked no room for advancement so easy to call in call volume was wack they fired me blah i dont care i dont have to do this
bad,I wish not to add any comments about my employment with this company. It served a purpose during a time of need. It wasn't a place for me to grow or advance.
bad,The company places profits over the productivity of their people. Does not pay well. The benefits are subpar to say they are an insurance company. I would not recommend.
bad,"One of the worst places to work if you plan on advancing within the company. Micromanaged and after the first 6 months I was switched to a different manager who worked remote from NC. Needless to say, after last years election that didn't end well. The entire team was allowed to work from home with the exclusion of yours truly. Compensation was poor, if you consider how much you ended up paying for their health insurance coverage ."
bad,The focus here is entirely on satisfying the contract requirements between them and Medicare/Masshealth.   The actual health and wellness of their Members is the least important thing for the company.   Case Management does not apply as Case Managers have no time to do the actual good work needed to help their members and instead are tied up with documentation (and ever changing processes) that don't allow them to give the time needed to Members.   It's awful.
bad,"Lay off in (w, not an H- tech error) Hausa, WI due to closing their office...without much notice. Not able to work for them now as I was not offered a position after. No displacement package."
bad,"Department leadership is disorganized & sends agents home (without pay)when a call ""quota"" isn't met, but continues to keep unlicensed agents on payroll at the Clients expense. Work environment is hostile, uncomfortable and not worth the aggravation of putting up with ungrateful management."
bad,"If you're not young and child free or don't tolerate nepotism, don't apply. I enjoyed the work however when my family member became ill I wasn't a good fit for them anymore."
bad,"I worked in 2 positions at uhc and they were both call center based and equally horrible. This place is the underworld that you serve your sentence in, its like a right of passage to get through it."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Thoroughly enjoyed working with my driven team members in order to help our community received the medical resources in order that they live healthier lives.
bad,This is an extremely stressful environment and you won't be trained well so be prepared to figure it all out by yourself . everyone there is miserable
bad,"I enjoyed my time at United and had a great working relationship with  all my coworkers.  However, there was always more to work to be accomplished.  "
bad,Currently one supervisor. She is extremely unprofessional. She belittles agents to other agents. You will be shamed and embarrassed on a daily basis  The department is new and she is unaware of many of the protocols associated with the position. She refuses to be proactive in finding info that is needed for the PCC to excel. She is ineffective on how to build a productive team. We started out with 25 agents. Only 9 are left. They quit.
bad,"This company tracks your keystrokes, using the toilet when you work from home is limited to 5 minutes or less and you have to indicate this on the instant messenger they use.  Workers who are favorites of management are quickly promoted to positions that requires meetings all day and no productivity.  Only under 30 are allowed to transfer to any job other than the hardest and most labor intensive jobs that require clinical knowledge.  You must take the United insurance and 'choose' between two bad or worse options.  Workers who do reviews for claims are targeted and abused for approving needed member requests.  "
bad,"some mothers were adv a day in advanced they would have to work on a weekend and were forced to bring children to work as there was no time to find a alternative to someone caring for their children and were advised they would be placed on a corrective action plan of they missed work. all our jobs are being outsourced to the Philippines and were not adv of anything and workers in the us mainly in Florida are being let go in waves as there allowed to pay lower wages to reps in the Philippines. no work life balance, no job security, benefits such as bidding for new schedule and PTO days which are benefits are tampered with as punishment when on a corrective action plan"
bad,"There is no room for advancement. If you want to transfer, you will get blackballed. There is a lot of blame and no structure. No management backing you up at all. The supervisor had no billing experience or knowledge and made more work for us since he only knew spreadsheets and numbers. The lead asked me if I was serious about my job because I didn’t take her advice. There was harassment, degrading and no management to go to because no one cared. This place is NOT military family friendly!! Not at all!"
bad,"I no longer work in that sweat shop. The department was very big on production and shaming you when mistakes were made. Some managers encouraged silos,, hostile environment and throwing others under the bus. Favoritism and unethical practices were prevalent. I have never said “never” regarding returning to a previous employer, but I will never return to UHC...NEVER."
bad,"I am currently working for this company and it is very stressful. Management is terrible Starting with the business managers down to the LAZY supervisors who love to micro manage the employees... they rather sit up and discuss food and drama rather than take supervisor calls. I am a member advocate and I’ve had many supervisors ignore my pings because they simply don’t want to do their job! Be very careful about applying, most advocates I work with are stressed and depressed behind this position. The supervisors are liars! And they are laying ppl off left and right. The company has unrealistic expectations... they expect us advocates to do everything as if we are robots. I’m thrown into different ques for states I’ve never trained for. Constantly bugged about completing commitments then when I’m completing the commitment I’m being bugged about why am I still working on the commitment.. I’m over this place"
bad,"Let me start off by saying that although they are a health insurance company, the benefits that they give their employees are overpriced and in name only."
bad,This is become an absolute horrible place to work. Constant monitoring everything you do only allowed two minutes between Calls if you’re not back in the phone exactly at the end of your break or lunch and they’re pinging you. So in essence your 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunches become 10 minutes was told during a team meaning if we need to go to the bathroom more often then our breaks we should get a note from our dr
bad,"Horrible manager on Maui.  A vindictive, and mean island manager (as well as her boss) with severe micromanagement /control issues.  Working for this company went from being a great job and fun place to work, to an extremely stressful job requiring overtime under a terrible boss who loves to punish those who dare to complain or admit they cannot complete her demands in 40 hours.  These women make a bigger bonus when they deny or minimize a Medicaid recipients a covered benefit  using trickery.  Expect to work 50 hours per week and get paid for 40."
bad,The culture is not flexible or inviting.  There are more concerns around metrics than quality of work.  There is no opportunity to truly collaborate. Methodologies in place have no process.
bad,The Manager at Optum 360/Quest Diagnostics holds customer service reps back from advancement. All she cares about is the numbers with no compassion for the people doing the Job.  Everything is dictated by the manager and the supervisors had no say. All they di
bad,Keeps every detail in her job report /besmirch diary. High tattle tail culture. Revenge and retaliation seems common. Forget that the bathroom exists.
bad,"uhg Micro manages which makes employees anxious and irritable.  employees are not listened to they are treated like and expected to act like puppets...  I have seen many people quit  and walk out of their job, good people, hard working, ethical, kind and professional.      Low job moral that gets worse the longer you work there"
bad,"I think the pay sucks and they do not compensate you when they ask you take on more and more responsibilities and try and pawn it off as a business need as a way to weasel out of compensating for learning a new skill or taking on more of a role.  I am still employed with the company but I think they do not practice what they preach.  One of the companies core values is integrity, which they have none, it is just take, take, take, do more and more and they want you to be happy because in your job is basically your compensation."
bad,"I work as contract there for short amount of time. Office culture there is not friendly and hostel. The full time employees, manager and PM gossip about all the new employees and use foul language. I worked in so many corporate places never in my life I hear or see is how fairly they treat they contract. Poor training. They blame everything on contract but don’t see that we were not train properly. When in meeting upper manager and employee are not in agreement on how we should be doing the project. There is no one voice. So many people tell you do the project this way and you  are the one ended up in hot seat.  At end they let they contract go without give valid reason."
bad,"Working here stressed me out to no extent. They have a horrible work/life balance, don't care if your child is sick, it counts as an occurrence... break your leg? Doesn't matter! You get an occurrence. If you didn't schedule your day off, it was considered an occurrence. Better not get sick! This place is not worth it."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"you are constantly micromanaged. if you don't comply with strict guidelines for documenting calls and use their EXACT scripting to the letter, you are reprimanded. the people who are listening to your calls are overly critical. as for advancement opportunities, once you take a job within their contact center, best of luck to you on EVER getting out. They will find any reason to thwart any advancement opportunity you attempt to take out of that one department."
bad,"Gente, que empresa horrível! Saudades do Dr. Edson que era o dono da empresa. Depois que ele faleceu, a empresa foi ladeira abaixo com esses americanos. "
bad,Not a good company to work for. Worklife balance is okay. I learned what not to do as a manager of my manager's example. I enjoyed working remote. The hardest part about the job is that I worked more than 8 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I worked remote.
bad,"Management was awful, tyrants. You had to bid for shifts, training was nothing like being on the floor. Got in trouble for going to bathroom, being on a call and having to take break late, being on a call too long. I hated every second."
bad,"Lets start with why I, a professional who only took this position awaiting for a better economy, always meeting my metrics, always appraised by customers, never late, never missed days, always present to volunteer.  Because my supervisor was jealous of my skills, yes- I am a professional within the Telecomunications and information technology and as a professional I can spot incompetant idiots a mile away, not only were the supervisors a JOKE but their manager also."
bad,I have worked here for almost a year and it has been the most stressful job I have had. The management does not help you and the company talks a lot but doesn't get things done. Don't recommend.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was working in a stressful environment but working under the direction of a ""bully"" supervisor. Other coworkers do assist under the team chat process but it kills your spirit to have the person in charge speak to you as if you are a child due to their own personal desire to micromanage their team."
bad,if you took breaks on time it was ok to yell at customers.  if you took the time to help  customer you were marked as inadherant to policy.  Who can hang up on a person with cancer looking for a stand up MRI in there area?  You would be surprised.  Have to meet that adhereance.  Sad.
bad,"The biggest down fall is managementbat UHC. From my experience not only was my manager not a resource for questions about the job but was a poor leader. I can’t descrie how many times I’ve been ignored, turned away from a question answered,  or have had a manger come to me trying to get answers. "
bad,"Very stressful company.  Expectations very high, low pay with no support from directors/managers.   Micro managers with clicks.  If they don't like you they will find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable.  Long working hours to include working weekends with no notification."
bad,"Very stressful positions. Micro managers, lack of support by management, lack of communication between directors,/managers with staff.  Expectations very high.  Low paying and very fair benefits."
bad,There was too much favoritism and bullying going on with the department director and supervisor. Not an ideal working situation for growth due to office politics.
bad,"This company and particularly their Optum division is abusive and treats people based on high school popularity and favoritism. Denying vacation time after it has been approved with you and your family holding the bag on expenses. The medical insurance is a joke and expensive for a medical company they could do way better job. They give annual surveys that are only used to fire people they are not anonymous. They do not honor the bonus programs and give no details as to achieving the bonus . It is all based on the flavor of the month favorites in the department. It is not performance based and you will never get anywhere near you maximum bonus outlined on offer letter. you may get 2 percent if your lucky of your maximum in my case was 17 percent of salary. As a member of former management they purposefully set out to ensure that you dont get the bonus and it is based on other aspects and not your performance of the company. Your leadership is an exclusive club of Caucasian men and the only diversity is in front line employee staff. "
bad,"I gave notice because I am a professional and a patient advocate. Otherwise, leaving the job and this company was the best decision of my entire life. "
bad,"High expectancy out of the calls with the time given to provide adequate service. The stressful environment and work load is not properly compensated and worthy to motivate those working. The people working there seem as though they live a daily nightmare and its completely understandable when the pressure is brought more so by the micromanaging even when one is in ""personal time""."
bad,"When I started at Optum Technologies multiple colleagues stated that Optum is a great place to be from.  After working there for over 3 years I can honestly say I now understand what they meant.  On average over my 3 years I worked a 60 hour week with many a night, early morning (finishing at 2 am) and weekends.The expectations were excessively high and they continually lowered the personnel resources available at my disposal, hot dropped projects on an already overloaded schedule, have entrenched bushiness silos and very stringent policies, all of which made it ridiculously difficult to make deadlines and keep projects on budget."
bad,"The typical work day involves helping members with their prescription benefits and claims. I have learned a lot and have a better understanding on different prescription plans, deductibles and copays. Management at TTEC does not seem genuine, it all about the numbers. The workplace culture is tense and confusing. The hardest part of the job is getting through the day, the most enjoyable part was helping the members."
bad,"Beware your annual employee survey. I was honest in mine, and fired shortly after. The management team are a tight group, to the detriment of the employees. Beware working for this company."
bad,"The Worse company to work for. You would think that because this company is a billion dollar company, they would be in the top 100 places to work for. Training is horrible. This job is more suitable for late teens, young adults. Don't make the mistake I did, it is just a high priced call center where if you are liked you don't have to do your work, though you are paid the same pay. Example: They boast about not having an AHT, which this is a horrible idea because most will manipulate this. I was in a group with a woman who took 1-3 calls in 8 hours, and others were taking 30+!!! This same person was picked for all these projects which let her have more time off the phone. Don't get me started on how they grade the calls either, its very phony, set up for you to fail. I was stressed out 98% of the time during my time at this place due to the unfairness. The best part of my job was interacting with the members."

bad,Management is terrible. They prefer to hire from outside than promote from within. Management knows nothing about the programs your using so dont expect help.  In a three year span they lost more than 80 employees in one area. Dont be fooled by the retaliation policy it is a lie. Several employees contacted Human Resources when they had a problem ended up getting fired. When physically unable to perform a job function they made no accommodation. The only way to get promoted is to blackmail someone.  Record everything they say in a meeting.
bad,"I would not recommend this company, it is very hard to make the customer happy and the company happy all in the same way. They company is not focuses on the right issues."
bad,"United Health Group was one of the worst places I ever worked. They did not help individuals grow to other positions. It was all done on who was their favorites. I worked hard for them was at one time training people for jobs, holding meetings, and doing compliance work and when I applied for a position to move to management I was turned down because I was told I could be utilized better in the position I was in."
bad,This company has no structure and they don't care about no on but themselves over worked low pay. The job is so high pressure and intense and they give you no appreciation.
bad,"I had a female supervisor that loved to micro manage you. She sat on the phone all day talking to her friends and husband, while the rest of us worked. Couldn't stand her. Very stressful job because of her. Loved to belittle you in front of coworkers. I have heard from several people that used to work there. Same issues. High turnover. I wouldn't refer anyone to this company."
bad,"Stressful with inadequate, poor training. I learned co-workers did not like working there. The management was terrible. The culture did not fit what they preached. The hardest part of the job was not getting the help when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
bad,"Non growth. Poor management. Was not appreciated. Never felt welcome. High turn over. Low morale. "
bad,"I worked for UHG for six years. My list of negative aspects would be long :"
bad,"The pay is terrible, not to mention Management is RUDE! It's bad when your team is labeled as ""Death Row"". Too much work, not enough compensation. They treat employees unfair, and like they are children. No engagement, or moral at all."
bad,"Poorly managed coaching operation in which Coaches are asked to adapt to constantly changing technology, evaluation systems, procedures, products, and policies. Compensation and benefits are poor."
bad,"Could be a decent place to work if there wasn't so much favoritism.  If you're not one of managements favorites you suffer.  In training they tell you you're going to have all this help when in get on the floor and start taking calls.  That is a BIG LIE. They don't work or help you anyway. Even if you tell them during your interview you need to be off by a certain time. They tell you we can work with that. Then once your hired, and it comes to scheduling, they don't work with you. They more less tell you it's there way or the highway. If your scheduled till 3:20P.M.and you have an appointment, scheduled transportation due to handicap, or need to pick up your child, if you are on a call that may take up to an hour or more (which is common) you need to finish the call. If you don't they will write you up or fire you for call abandonment. If you are in the favoritism club its very unlikely that we happen. Because you're hardly on the phones. Management basically keeps you off the phones to do what ever.  If you do ask for help they keep track, and if management feels you're asking to often they will talk with you and put you on a verbal warning."
bad,"Forced to work in Boston (a 3+ hour commute) with NO desk, only to work 100% with remote UHG locations. Work from home not allowed.  Was told this justifies mgmt's choice to locate to a moronic Boston location that everyone hates."
bad,I worked remotely as a coder. Manager was micro mgr and training meetings were with a condescending manner toward coders. They treated them like kindergartners.
bad,Was not happy going to work. I did how ever learn the process of prior authorizations. Management was never around to help with hard situations. The hardest part was that overtime was mandatory.
bad,"Disappointed with unrealistic expectations set, false persona UHG portrays for itself, no regards for the elderly members - it's all about the profit! You never get recognized for the good you contribute, but you get every miniscule mistake pointed out. Bonuses and commission are promised, but in reality, they find ways to never reward what you've earned."
bad,They don’t care about your well being or your family. They want you on the phones at all times no mater what. They have their picks in who they will give special assignments to.
bad,"Part time was supposed to be from home mainly, but whenever a computer error occurred they made you travel 45 min to the office with all of your equipment and work there.  The people who worked there where very unprofessional with attitudes and threatened your job when training and after if you didn't perform. No trust or confidence in their employees."
bad,Calls were time restricted--made it difficult to actually assist callers. I was a hired as a Health Advisor to explain benefits to callers but also had to look at pharmacy claims and medical claims as well. No help or support from my supervisor who has since been let go.
bad,The culture is fake and managers will tell you there are options for advancement based on performance but the advancements don't come. Once you start in Customer service you are stuck in that department. This position is high stress due to the call center atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,I worked for a branch of UHG. We never received the same benefits as working for UHG proper. They did not care about tenured employees. Revolving door of newer employees.
bad,"In this workplace, be prepared to be a number, you lose your humanity. I don't believe I was meant to be a part of a workplace so riddled with false integrity, where processors are unable to work together with leadership, where the processors who are not allowed to opt-out of duties are unable to receive straight-forward responses from leadership, where we are told that our feedback and concerns are appreciated but are not actually listened to and where negativity is used instead of positivity, where leadership is not capable of liberating their team to collaborate, innovate, or engage, is not capable of creating transparency with the team, confronting reality, practicing accountability, talking straight, or able to right wrongs. I wish you the best."
bad,Hands down the very worst work experience I’ve ever had.  You either work at a furious pace or you are mired in meaningless minutiae.  The company makes money hand over fist and tells you all about it while announcing lay offs.  They have no soul and no conscience.  Do not waste your time or skills on this place unless you have absolutely no other choice.
bad,"The training is horrible, management just doesn't care, a legit Big Brother environment. There is always watching over you, if you go use the bathroom you must take it out of your break time. If you are on the phone with a client too long it is counted against you. If you don't turn over even the smallest complaint (i.e. don't like hold music) you get a talking to. It is absolutely the worst place!"
bad,"I never actually met my manager, and the supervisor work ethic was less than desirable. you could not get time off for work even if you have available PTO. you had to bid on your vacation, and never received the time requested"
bad,did not like the fact that you can be working today and the next for any reason you were ask to pack up your desk. The class I started with went form 20  to 2 in less than a year.
bad,The work was challenging and interesting but management lacks accountability and does not seem to know the role of the staff. Managing up became an issue while managing projects. The ability to work from home was great but end up working long hours to cover other time zone and end up without being compensated. Management does not care about your health and well-begin.
bad,"This is a home base position which is one of the pluses  of this job, Another plus was the clients I loved working with the people. Management is horrible they have no respect for their .employees. You are in constant fear of not getting the inflated and unrealistic quota. Management is quick to punish and does not support their employees at all."
bad,"Do not work for this horrible company! They lied about every single aspect of the job! Management is terrible and yet you have no other resources to get assistance when you need it (especially since they change the way things are done daily) The workload is double what is promised when hired, and you don’t have the time or tools you need to complete the job. They only care about overall numbers, not quality of work. I regret leaving a mediocre job for this mess. Stay away!"
bad,"This job is extremely high stressed. The most stress from any call center job I’ve ever had and I’ve been working at call centers for 16 years. I developed anxiety from this job and many of my co workers did as well or their anxiety was heightened. We had to work mandatory overtime, I was working 60+ hours a week with a newborn at home and only making $13 an hour. The management was too busy messing around with each other to be available to their employees."
bad,"I feel that the Company is challenging to work for since it is growing and that could be positive, however, the consistent outsourcing lowers morale. I feel there is no job security."
bad,Upper Management has no clue as to what Entry Levels battles are to try to promote within the company.  There is no Appreciation in the Work Place. And the callers complain that they can not understand the thick accent.  But the company does not care as long as they can pull the off shore contract.
bad,This company is all about the money not employee relations. Plan on putting the company above every aspect of your life to make any progress. Advancement is talked about but not achievable.
bad,"Co workers were often pitted against each other, management gossiped about employees with other employees.  I was offered the job Sunday night and it started Monday morning, so I got less than 24 , hours notice."
bad,"Management is lackluster and you'll have a new one every 6 months. It makes it impossible to prove yourself and during review time your new manager usually doesn't have a clue. They play favorites and if you're not a favorite, your yearly increases will be pennies while more lackluster employees get 10%+. If you are loud, complain a lot, they seem to listen to you more. Be just a good employee, do your job, and you're pushed into the corner and will get the scraps."
bad,"Estrutura física da empresa é boa."
bad,Poor management and poor supervision.  Favoritism and lack of career advancement.  Very low training opportunities and lack of communication from management to other staff members.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"They do not care about their customers, offer lack-luster options at premium prices, and do not provide quality benefits packages to 97% of their employess"
bad,"When I interviewed, I thought this place would be great.. turns out it wasn’t! Manager Latanya Johnson is very rude, disrespectful, not a team player either, and she’s a MANAGER, did not know anything clinical, turned away sick patients who were only 10-15 minuets late! Coworkers on the other hand, a few were okay but drama, it was a small clinic. Not very helpful, tend to leave you on your own to figure everything out, I would never work for WellMed / United Health again. Very unprofessional and their benefits suck!!!!"
bad,"no room for advancement, manager invisible  lots of promises made.. United took over Oxford and the environment changed from family to unfriendly surroundings."
bad,"Typical day:Fast paces"
bad,The company has poor management and is so desperate for employees that they will hire anyone. They don't even consider if the person is qualified or the maturity level of the individuals. They promote culture values but none of management demonstrates the values that they promote. There is much stress at UHG because of poor management. They blame the employees for why things are not done correctly when it is due to poor management. There are no enjoyable parts of the job. There is constant overtime and no employee appreciation. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at UHG.
bad,"Low educated employees - not a healthy environment- management behavioral culture is unprofessional."
bad,"If the management does not like you, they will do everything in their power to make sure you do not succeed.  Nit pick you."
bad,UHC shames employees for an error - uses fear and threats along with that shame to keep the employee frightened in their day to day work. Its shocking
bad,"Pathetic company to work with. Higher management is having more power and can take any action against anyone. so i would say, dont join this company..."
bad,United Health group is a global health services business. Its a good company but  Its contract based. Its good opportunity to young generation to work.
bad,"Great Pay. Was very excited to come into UHC assuming there would be opportunities for advancement, job security and a place to really grow. That is until you realize your leadership=managers/directors will offer zero to little support, inadequate training and any reason to get after you or blame you for mistakes - God forbid you threaten their advancement. ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT! Workload is ridiculous - expect to answer over 20 emails a day, research claims issues without training in the different systems you are expected to know, return 10-20 phone calls per day, Meet a provider visit monthly quota, trainings, and push a different outreach every 6 months. MORE WORK THAN 1 PERSON CAN DO!! This is the most disorganized company I have ever worked for! Please PLEASE conduct a culture training for the managers you employ! "
bad,"This company has changed and not for the better in the last 2-3 mainly, management is under qualified and is typically less qualifed than who they manage. 1% Rasises or no merit raises are standard for years despite working overtime its expected daily quotas are unrealistic creating poor quality work and criteria unmet. Run if you want to be repsected and valued as the professional you are from this company. Associate degrees held by managemnt who micro manage and demoralize hard working employees with daily scrutiny and harrassment. Upper management allows and accepts poor annual company wide feedback without being forced to change or improve. System wide training is lacking continuity and new programs and platforms are not user friendly to daily users only for managers to run data reports for employee monitoring.  Ineffective unprofessional meetings held daily reporting back to management instead of management seeking information and date and reporting to upper management which creates additional work for employees held to daily quotas. Run & fast if you respect yourself and your wallet."
bad,"United healthcare bought out XLHealth which is where I started in 2008, The takeover was not a fair takeover for many employees but the option was to stay or be terminated. Management is located in various states. the work location where I was located has since closed and many work from home"
bad,"I highly do not recommend this workplace. A typical day is micromanaged by a supervisor who focuses more in monitoring your work than theirs."
bad,"Management need to get a clue.  Constant reorgs are brutal with change, one moment you are on one team, next time you are over here..  Management do not consider strengths, nor do they know, as well as people that actually do the work.  The latest reorg in Contact Center Services has left employees, especially in QA, fend to them selves and not following process they had once followed.  No guidance to anyone and your best is sought off as not so much and not being recognized for what they've done."
bad,The manager had no knowledge of the work the employees were to do on the day to day bases. Employees with degrees were making less than employees that came in with just a diploma. This is a revolving door company
bad,"From credentialing specialist to senior proposal writer, UHC SIGNIFICANTLY underpays their employees and treats them like rented mules.  Management is laughable from middle management to higher-level leadership.  They abuse their employees through long and unrealistic hours to lack of recognition for a job done exceedingly well.  A Chinese sweatshop would be a vacation compared to UHC.  You keep thinking it's going to improve and it never does."
bad,"Micromanaged, stressful, non supportive, no job security, huge turnaround, salaried position so overtime is not paid. Poor orientation. Should have never taken this position. Most enjoyable part of  job was payday."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"This company states it's about innovation, but obtaining funding is a free for all and many times projects don't have a positive net present value."
bad,I worked on the Optum side for 9 yrs.  Had 11 managers.  4 in the last 6 months.  It took a very long time to truly understand the role.  Zero training on systems and poor management to help explain the expectations and requirements.  With every new boss came new expectations.   Communication was poor.  But was very flexible as I was a telecommuter.  Which eventually was used against me and I was asked to return to the office while the rest of the team remained telecommuters.  Managers get promotions when they treat people poorly.  Never made sense.  I often said right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing so I was frustrated daily. Tough job.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Pay is horrible.  But a lot of pto.
bad,Management is the worst very heartless people and don't care about fire you so please don't waste your time because your feelings will be hurt at the end.
bad,"A typical day at work starts by organizing my day and then calling member after member sometimes at the expense of my own lunch hour and breaks. Management is very well aware of how much pressure we are under to keep our metrics and numbers up but they don't care.  We are short staffed and they don't care about that either.  This could be a great job but with all the micro managing being done it makes it too difficult to enjoy the job. Work and life balance doesn't exist in this position as they change your schedule with no warning, they don't care what you have going on in your life because you are expected to change your world for them!  Turnover at this site is crazy, they come and go so fast that it's impossible to make or keep friends there.  You would think this company would want to keep those few hard workers that stick it out and try to change things for the better but frankly they will just replace you with another warm body.  The insurance is the worst!  We work for an insurance company but I have to pay everything out of pocket all year because thankfully I haven't met the big deductible. Think twice before leaving a job to come here."
bad,"Horrível de se trabalhar no call center, péssimo ambiente e chefes péssimos."
bad,"Management doesn't care about medical issues that can affect your job, even when there is a simple solution that benefits both sides.  They pretty much tell you to get over it or quit."
bad,"Low pay, micromanaging at it's peak and sorry pay ( yes I said it twice). Slave rules for the workers and don't even think about using your phone to check on your family because you only get lunch as your break. A serious waste of time."
bad,"This company has along way to achieve the goals of patients.Slow services at best. a lot of complaint on wrong diagnoses,patients feeling pressured into medicine that don't need."
bad,Stay away from Key Accounts They over work their employees and micromanage them. They promote unqualified people into management positions. The Field Account Managers are all miserable and hate their management team. The manager of account management plays favorites with her managers. Very hostile environment to work in.
bad,"Thank You UnitedHealth Group for firing me due to my medical absences and misdirecting me for help because if you didn't, I wouldn't of found a place with Whelan Security and lets not forget my new opportunity at Apple Inc. So thank you #UHG for forcing me to get out and find my TRUE calling; if I was still working for you, I don't think my life would of reached the happiness it's at right now. "
bad,"They don't tell you that you will be telemarketing their services. If members tell you they aren't interested, then you with call them back in 30 days to try again, which leads to angry members that feel harassed and fuss you out on a regular basis. Management has no idea what they are doing so they feel that running the business similar to a sweat shop is the way to go. You will be watch like a hawk every second of the day to be certain you are making calls every second of your eight hour shift. Don't even think about asking for a day off. High turn over.Stay away."
bad,"A typical day at work is good and can change daily with new information. However the work load that the company puts on an agent in the time span is unrealistic and they want you to cut corners to assist Medicare members instead of providing the quality customer service. Management is hired, fired, or moved to an different account so you never know who you are answering to. Also to ask management questions they send you over to other agents because they never know the information."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, lousy health insurance benefit for an insurance company. Worked as a physician advisor and never had any interaction with Optum management or even to be aware of what was going on in the entire company. Also, the company has no loyalty to those they laid off when applying for future positions with equal skill sets. HR lied when I applied for jobs stating ""after interviewing you we found other more qualified applicants"" when they NEVER interviewed me. In following these 2 instances of deception they stuck to their script of actually having interviewed me. Obviously they are posing bogus jobs that either are already internally  filling or they like jerking around people they have laid off. Really not an ethical place to workin so many other ways too numerous to list. Avoid this company."
bad,The job itself was amazing and i love the customer service enviroment related employment. The company itself no longer exist due to the lack of organization and concern by higher managment.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Poor ""facist"" culture. COnstance surveliance, employees encouraged to back stab and report each other. Fake ""Compassion"" for employees and just a mess."
bad,"Very corporate culture, paranoid manager, insufficient healthcare. Co workers publicly humiliated each other, Marketing reported to sales which is inappropriate and ineffective."
bad,"Work day consist of 80-100 calls inbound. Creating cases, researching or being verbally abused by irate providers.No one is on the same page.your thrown onto new teams with very little training supposed to be back up however feels like it's your primary team. quality guidelines is the most stressful. You cough to hard you get a zero.if you don't say exactly what each scripts says u get a zero.they are ridiculous but they don't want you to sound robotic REALLY. NONE OF THE SUPERVISORS/HIGHER MGMT has your back.you are on your own. many reps in the department has tried multiple times to transfer to different departments and get declined. NO GROWTH at all. Going above and beyond don't mean nothing. Everyone feels STUCK. Supervisors shows favoritism. It's no morale.I HATE IT! Hope to get something soon with less STRESS and feel more appreciated for the work you do.we are on the front line for everything. They continuously add more to your job to do on a call.its like slavery in disguise! It wasn't this terrible when I started. I would NEVER REFER ANYONE TO WORK IN SUCH A STRESSED ENVIROMENT! Ask anyone from this department you will get the same review!"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"...is that it pays well. You are expected to follow metrics, time constraints, quality nitpicking and still "" delight"" the member. Members who do not appreciate your efforts. Reviews are annual, and pay raises range from .5% ( that is HALF a percent)  to 1%, if you meet everything. Cronyism is a huge asset, as is nepotism. Everyone else, you are out of luck. The benefits are awful. You are expected to pay most of your insurance, not the company. This health insurance company has the worst health insurance for their employees, fried food offerings in the cafeteria and bake and candy sales a plenty. Then they wonder why employees are obese. The area has few high paying job offerings. This is one of the two...the other is the local jail."
bad,Training was horrible the trainer didn't know what she was talking about often she appeared lost! Nonetheless they have a claims department in which is lazy as a CSR  they want you to go through and do everyone else's job and they are receiving more compensation than you are. Workforce is foolish you're not allowed to use the restroom when you have to the expect you to hold it. It's just a horrible place to work! Stay away you've been warned!
bad,All United HealthCare cares about is their numbers and money. They are not about customer service. They want you on and off of the phone fast.
bad,"Since their recent acquisition of another PBM, Catamaran has not employed appropriate management, provided a true integration strategy, shown sensitivity to employee concerns or displayed any motivation to combine the best of both companies.  It is the old SXC way or the highway, layoffs are frequent and employee dissatisfaction is rampant.  Catamaran leadership is way over their heads and seems to believe their own stories. It is a shame that their minds are so closed, inflexible and non-inclusive. "
bad,"RN's stay away from this company! They advertise jobs in Case Management, frequently as they have a tremendous turnover, but it is anything but case management. The job is more sales than nursing."
bad,"When I was offered this job everything sounded great. Paid training, ""competitive pay"", benefits, and good hours. I left my other job which was the worst decision I've ever made. 1 week after completing the horrible training program that they have, pay was dramatically changed for the worse. Hours were 8-4:30 unless it is during AEP which you'll be expected to work at least 10 hours a day including weekends, if you only do 10 you will definitely be ""talked to"" about your performance. Benefits are absolutely horrible and the management is even worse. Every second of your day is watched and you're in constant fear of being fired. Don't ever work here, worst job I've ever had. Not to mention the $15,000 pay cut that I unknowingly took. With commission changes, shift changes, benefit changes, management changes, not a single thing that I was told when I started is true. Worst company ever!!!"
bad,"Job responsibilities changed shortly after I was hired and wasn't properly trained. Didn't understand the departments policy and procedures in order to do the job....of course no manager support. Noticed staff was stressed and overworked.....sure sign of bad things to come. I was thrown under the bus by co-workers when I voiced my opinion on how the job was going and was verbally attacked by the department director. The most arrogant, intimidating boss I ever worked for. Couldn't work with a group of people like those folks in the payroll department again."
bad,"Pay is slightly above market, but turnover is still so high. NP turnover is really unbelievable. Insurance benefits are terrible. Management is very poor and hostile at times. Frequently understaffed. There are ethical concerns. They use all the buzz words like flexible schedule and work life balance, but they don't mean them. There is no work life balance. I would not recommend working for this company. Be very cautious when you consider this company. when you read the reviews, read between the lines. Are all the 5 star reviews actually from employees?"
bad,"The 'job' is not hard, for the most part the co-workers are great people. A few bad leads and supervisors make for a very miserable place to work. The general manager quit and things are getting worse. Mandatory 10 hour days/6 days a week and voluntary 7th. Bullying by the Leads and Supervisors is overlooked by upper mgmt. No one to go to...HR Direct is worthless, all they do is report your complaint to the manager...who does nothing. Snitching is looked upon with favor by Leads/Supers. Have seen at least a dozen people quit in the past 6-8 months due to the way they were treated."
bad,"a typical day would be on a incoming dialer with calls coming 7 seconds apart, you would take anywhere from 60-80 calls per day with only 5 minutes to service each customer, but customers can give you multiple members and you still have to get done with in 5 minutes to meet your daily quota, so hopefully you get alot of short calls because if you have 3 bad months you will get written up. you are micromanaged all day, dont be late for anything, dont get any system outages that could turn into a write-up. you have to try to be perfect because you cant give out wrong answers 3 of those and you could loose you job. this is a extremely stressful environment. worst job i've ever had."
bad,"I am writing this review to help others. I am a college degreed 50 year old woman who has life experience enough to know that this company is evil. when I read the reviews I felt affirmed, validated and amazing. I experienced 3 re-orgs in my yrs at the co. and a 2nd supervisor who was so verbally abusive I battled with HR to get her away from me. when I asked HR, ""if this supervisor drew blood from me?"", would that get them to get her away from me? finally, that statement got their attention. the 3rd assigned supervisor then, created a new job description of me having to ""defend"" myself daily. she persistantly falsely accused me of the craziest things and, in the 6 months before I walked out, after asking them to ""lay-off"" the position, ( I thought I was doing an ethical thing ) and,( who does that in this economy? ) I had been begging for work to do for almost 3 years. days, months, weeks then years went by and by the time I got a 3rd supervisor, I was completely ingnored. at least my mortgage was paid for 4 years, so amen to that. I feel sorry for the company and for their employees. everything I read reviews is accurate."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years. It was as if you didn't matter if you were not in managment. They lacked communication, they didn't care about the employees, and you got repremanded for things that were petty. I do not reccomend this company to anyone. Very high stress level. Not worth it."
bad,not a fun place to work for if it takes you longer than 13 seconds to use the restroom---the micro management is out of control!
bad,"The management is the worst I've ever seen. Supervisors definitely have their favorites. The ""favored"" people get special projects that give them ample time off of the phone, while those of us who are not so lucky struggle to take back to back calls."
bad,"I can file this as the worst job I ever had. Totally disappointing due to the fact that there is tremendous growth opportunities and SR Management seems to have a strong vision. Unfortunately, there is a total lack of leadership and so much of HR group is inexperienced. (Just see their linkedin pages) Judging from interviews that I've heard, they are inexperienced and unpolished. There is a reason why the company has high attrition and there needs to be an HR group that is strong that can work together and fix these serious problems so it can be a strong, pleasant workplace."
bad,Worked a flex schedule- 10 hours per day for 4 days a week But had to do every other Saturday for 10 hours- at least 8 hours.
bad,"I remember being thrilled about working for this company when I was hired. I quickly learned that you are a number and your importance is based on your stats. Most people who reached their stats reached them because they did not fully help the provider to the best of their benefit because they are trying to reach their Average Handle Time (AHT). No matter how many amount of claims the provider may have (and believe me, they can have several) you have an average of 5 minutes to handle that call, which that's the amount of time on average you may spend with one claim."
bad,"A day at work for me is going through 8 hours of data entry, claims resolutions, and talking to providers."
bad,"Worked for this company for over 15 years and was ""laid-off"" even though they were hiring 6 more individuals for the same position. This company / Regional and Senior Mgmt does not really seem to care about your dedication or your respect for the company and there is no such thing as job security. They have tons of corporate attorneys and will bully you out of your job if they want you to go. It's very dissappointing! UHC has lost a lot of valuable employees due to bad management and they don't seem to take a loook at changing how they manage or who is managing and instead the attitude appears to be that anyone and everyone is disposable! Management in WA is horrible and very dysfunctional! Directors, Sr. Managers, Mgrs operate with inflicting fear to control employees. This is not a collaborative working environment. You are told what, when and how to do something and if you have any ideas, thoughts, in-put, process improvement ideas or opinions you will be bullied and put down in front of co-workers and providers. The environment really lacks professionalism and respect. I would really think twice if in WA or OR."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"There are too many restrictions within the customer service MAPD department. My supervisor does not care about anything except numbers....and no matter how good your performance is, you will not be rewarded."
bad,"This company is very stressful to work for. The expectations are unreasonable. Quite a few nurses end up on medical leave due to strokes, mental health issues, other cardiac conditions."
bad,"Wellmed is under united health group and all they care about is money. They keep adding work on their employees and overwhelm them and are not being paid for what you’re worth. They say they’re all about patient care but really they’re in it for money. They order unnecessary things to keep juicing patients. They harass patients, basically forcing them to make appointments so they can get their numbers up."
bad,horrible work life balance .  worked 7 days a week during year end . bad management .  the campus was nice and that was the only good part. compensation was below average
bad,Don’t work at Greensboro location. You basically have to kiss butt to elevate your self . They say they help you an they don’t . Extremely Underpaid for the amount of work we do. The providers are great but the support an chats are awful .
bad,"A typical day at work is back to back calls with no time in between. I have learned that this place is about WHO you know NOT WHAT you know. Management is the WORST!!! Most don't know jack about what your suppose to do or how to help their to busy gossiping about other employees. Management doesn't care about there employees In regards to the workplace culture they have different teams to try and raise morale. The hardest part about the job is the outdated systems they use, No one knows what there doing they just straight up throw you to the wolfs.  The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving.  The job it's self is not that bad you get your good members and you get the ones that straight up disrespect you and you have to take it. Other than that its your basic call center definitely MICROMANAGED they focused on the wrong things (How long you were on break etc. Not really your performance with the mbrs.)"
bad,"See heading.  There is no such thing as work/life balance.  They have mandatory overtime and do not care about the negative impacts on your health, physical or mental."
bad,There is none! They do not care if you are trying to return back to school.  A lot of prejudice and favorites/clicks. Every second of your day is micro managed. Some supervisors require you to ask permission to go to the restroom as if you were a child.  Management is horrible. I’ve never disliked a job as much as I did at UHC.
bad,If u r ready to work in night shifts and not required proper health its fine here to work with UHG  earlier it was good in all comutings now it became wores
bad,"all about connection and getting close to supervisor,, very unprofessional work environment, no ethic, alot of gossip, empty promises, no job advancement,"
bad,"If I could give zero stars I would. This place does not care about its employees at all. You’re just a body in a chair. Miserable working environment. Pay was good, but not worth the misery."
bad,Treats employees like they dont matter. Everything is watched but some how you still have to answer when your computer has an update or IT issues. In 5 years have only gotten a $1 raise.
bad,"A typical day is unbearable."
bad,The Frederick MD location is a highly stressful environment. Opportunity in job advancement is not likely. Poor management and miserable staff members. Consider this a temporary job not a career path. This is only for Frederick MD location.
bad,Desvio da conformidade da norma NR-17 quanto a ir ao banheiro.
bad,"Salário baixo, poucos benefícios e muita cobrança em cima de pouco incentivo"
bad,"there is no ban list for patients that have threatened or injured staff, so they readmit dangerous predators.   many come from jail to us, yet we have no security.   UHS has no concern for staff safety.     zero security.   with low pay, it makes little sense for many to stay, so they leave.   the patients are demanding and many want help, but many just want a place to sleep."
bad,United HealthOne call center is the worst job ever.  The business as a whole is aweful making customers wait on hold for 2 hours just to make a payment or cancel their policy.  Getting a day off is near impossible even though they offer PTO.  Your mental health is a great danger working for this company.
bad,"I worked in the Optum call center, it was one of the worst environments I've ever worked for.  Management was some the most unorganized I have ever had the displeasure of working with."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,It became blatantly obvious that Optum is in the business to make money. There was zero concern for providing their members quality care. Members 1st!
bad,Undoubtedly the most disorganized and erratic company I have ever worked for.  No sense of direction.  Executive Leadership is completely incompetent and unethical.  Never ending restructuring and layoffs.  By far the worst company I have ever been associated with.  One day this company will collapse and become the healthcare version of Enron.
bad,"It's impossible to ignore the egregious rip-off of the insurance industry while explaining to human beings that they're being taken advantage of for greedy purposes.  Company environment pushes unhealthy life choices (junk food, etc.) while pretending to be employee friendly.  Horrifying trainer talked so much about his personal life, it was appalling and embarrassing."
bad,I would never ever recommend this company managers protect the supervisors even if the supervisor is inappropriate with other employees husbands the supervisors are trifling two faced tells other peoples business and going to hr is a joke you will never be given a raise if your supervisor is jealous of u because you look better than him or her the y constantly threatening to fire you and the one female manager is on a power trip shes trifling and scandalous and all the supervisors are snakes
bad,"Other than a couple of supervisors, this is one of very worst jobs and poorly run companies I’ve ever experienced. You literally have to schedule out your time to go to the bathroom and it is tracked over the course of the month. If you urinate too often, your job is in jeopardy. Your schedule can go from open to closes at any minute and they just fired several hundred employees with no warning, most of which had loyally been with the company for 20 years or more."
bad,"The company does not live by the culture. I lost my father brother uncle and cousin in one year , and the company compassion was bare minimum. I loved the work but the management was poor and directors back the poor decision of the managers which make employees work life horrible."
bad,"Some people can benefit from working there (i.e., recent college grads, vets, friends of management), but it is such a toxic environment, and the churning of employees is horrible. They lay people off, or better yet, spin it as a ""performance"" issue to avoid paying severance, and then they wait until their benefits are not retroactive and bring them back in. Usually, employee comes back in making less, and with the horrible cost of their medical insurance, people who are not execs or directors do not benefit from the huge profits. If you want to enjoy your career, I would advise skipping this company. Sadly, my opinion belongs to many, and everyone I knew was looking to get out of there. But those getting stock options are smiling all the way to their yacht while run-of-the-mill peeps are struggling to survive. Rant over. Grateful to no longer be associated with this disaster of a company."
bad,"Depending on the department, it may be all great. The department I am in. PNI Provider network experience. Its terrible, you get no overtime, no incentives, you get nothing, but 40hrs and see ya tomorrow. The department leadership is super dysfunctional, they don't know if they coming or going. The pretend to want to fix the issues and never do, I could go on and on. Trying to moving or excel in the company is not easy. Its not what you know its who you know in this company. They will create a job and put there favorite person the job. Ive seen a lot go within this company. but you learn every company is like that.  I am almost done w/ my degree so I can move on."
bad,"to many layers of management. The training for the position was rushed"
bad,"It's very overwhelming, alot of changes and they do not give you sick days. You are bum rush with calls that are back to back. They only care about the Business and the customers but care less about there employees"
bad,Worked to long with no raise. No fair days off and the hours don’t work for me no more. Need more money. Just over worked and under paid. Very poor management.
bad,"Our pay was below average for the region. Our insurance was so expensive that employees could not afford to use it. Our schedules were always changing. Shifts would be dayshift then the shift would change to night shift. I worked five different shifts in less than one year. Then got laid off because they send our jobs to the Philippines, so the company could save money."
bad,Managers had no idea how to reach the goals they set for the team. 5 minute max on calls or no bonus. No way to accurately do your job and meet goals. Only way to make bonus is send wrong medication to seniors.
bad,"If your an older worker, they will get rid of you and hire two younger workers with no experience.  They do not value employee sacrifice, hard workers, and successful implementations.  Management and director’s are a joke and do not stick up for their employees."
bad,"You will realize why they lost the 400 million dollar lawsuit once hired there after training. If a client is able to get to the pharmacy within their plan the copay might be $24. If they select the mail order option, for the exact same drug, it will be close to $1200. They are unethical."
bad,Massive company with no heart.  Change is constant.  The work load was unreasonable.  Management lies to staff about emerging role changes.  The values of the company are not apparent through the company’s actions.
bad,Most of the frontline work is moving offshore.  Used to be a great company to work for with benefits.  No room for growth if you are in USA and not a CEO. Cost cutting is happening in bottom up .
bad,This company does not have any loyalty towards their employees. They take advantage of nurses and work them like slaves. They increase the workload of nurses which takes more time away from your family without a sufficient increase in your bonus or income every year. They will fire you regardless of seniority and will react in a negative way if you are not keeping up the pace that they would like. They treat you like you are a robot and not a human being.

bad,"This department has experienced a lot of growth in terms of number of employees, but quality has unfortunately declined significantly. Most of my colleagues dislike what they do and new hires are already looking to jump ship. There is an abundance of micromanagement and tone deaf leadership. Management inhibits your ability to advance in your career and makes excuses when you provide honest feedback. The job should be completely remote, but due to “upper upper management”, this is not allowed even for folks who’ve more than proven their worth and competency. UHC is a good company overall, but flexibility is limited depending on the department and manager. Every pharmacist is evaluated using the same metrics, but some have 1-4 technicians to assist in meeting their goals while others have none. This is completely unfair and yet management continues to turn a blind eye to this fact. Either the metrics should be adjusted or everyone should be on an even playing field. It’s a numbers game through and through, yet management pretends to care about quality, too. I would recommend the company, just not this particular department."
bad,"took away CEU's for RM's.  Retroed the policy back to cove their tracks.  Pittance of bonus for staff; constant turnover of staff and no one especially administration seems to care why people are leaving.  Once a person has given notice; they are bad mouthed.  ""they were not working out, not doing their job, not a good fit."""
bad,"Overtime is ridiculous, they change/make up rules as they go and get mad when you fight back with the hand book that they do not update. They show alot of favoritism."
bad,"First of all, I was fired while still in training after 3 months of being told we are learning and that 3 specific things would cause such an early termination:cursing out a member, attendance policy, or a behavioral issue that has been addressed several times with no change. I unknowingly gave out wrong information to a member- which was an honest mistake where I was just trying to help. I am in my early 30s and felt like I was surrounded by insecure women who were conducting my training class who spoke down to people and I overheard gossip about my “ability to be coached”. Little did they know I walked into that company highly educated with a masters degree and ended up giving them a shot after recovering from a bad accident. I was initially told that my phone call where I gave wrong info was not going to result in me losing my job, but MOVING FORWARD- just not to say what I said again, and I said understood. A little over a week later I was taken off the phones and had someone grab my things put them at the front desk and was told my phone call elevated it’s way (like hot air) up the chain of command at UHC and a decision was made. Initially only a few people heard my call. My trainer, who you can tell quickly has substance abuse issues, she has to teach the class remotely from home one day sounded drunk while teaching!!!and the OJTs, one of which felt compelled to report my call and go after my job for some strange reason maybe perhaps because they were insecure and jealous of those who are motivated to live a healthy lifestyle- I’ll leave it at that. . The wage was completely"
bad,"very very poor management, managers would make rude remarks. they would pick and choose when to apply rules, it all depended on color. training class of 16 and only 3 made it 6months"
bad,"My time started with a wonderful supervisor who was promoted  and rightfully so.  The following supervisor was rude, demeaning and did not respect her staff. She did not allow for staff growth and often would search for things to bring you down."
bad,"I was a claim's representative as well as a temporary training assistant (DA). "
bad,"Dealing with angry and verbally abusive participants/customers "
bad,The training period for any position is too short. Your inability to be a fast learner in this fast paced environment can cause you to lose your job. Management is HORRIBLE and offers no true work home life balance all while using the motto of “family/friend culture” Job will definitely leave you stressed.
bad,"They work their best reps to death, meanwhile there are people sleeping. Leadership is never around to answers questions, probably sitting in the stairwell, and when you do find one they have to ask another rep for the answer. Unorganized and nobody knows what’s going on. HR had to come in because of how bad it got. Stressful place if you want to get ahead in life. If you learn the basics of the job and just keep your head low than it’s a good place to work, again reps just sleep and complain about work. Our office has never felt apart of the UHG family, which why the turn over rate is so high with 2-3 ppl quitting every month. Pay is ok but raises are a joke if you get one. You can survive off the pay but you probably won’t have a social life."
bad,favoritism at its finest. does not matter who is qualified or not if you are in the managers inner circle you are good. Supervisors are not trained nor are they qualified. majority have no bachelors
bad,It really depends on your manager that you have. They don't care about the employees. Just stay at service level. There's no need to advance you will not see anymore money. They will increase your goals constantly but not compensate you.
bad,Supervisors work off of favortism which is a huge issue these days in call centers. The training did not help a bit with the actual job you have to do on the floor.
bad,"This job promises full-time and benefits but the company is extremely flawed."
bad,"I worked for Optum- a branch of United Health Care. This company operated fitness facilities in corporate environments. High end clients dictated the rules and stipulations to Vice Presidents of Optum who then translated to General Managers. Often these clients would not hire, or fired people purely on looks. There expectations were ambiguous as were Optums. No matter how many hours you worked or how much energy put forth they were abusive verbally and cruel about ideas. Sets standards, expectations, deadlines, and procedures were not clearly translated nor were questions answered by upper management, there is little to no room for success."
bad,Every second of your day is tracked and if you appear to use the bathroom outside of your breaks you will get in trouble. The chance of advancing is extremely slim. Management is incompetent and completely overwhelmed. Supervisors average 25 employees each. This could be an amazing company to work for if they cared more about humans and less about numbers.
bad,"Anything. About anything. There was a Month long training process and set up in classroom style environment. This was constantly interrupted to parade ""Important Figures"" in front of the class to provide important information, such as the attendance policy. This would have been great, had there been any consistency with the information we were being provided. The most vivid example I can think of is in the first 2 weeks, class was stopped 5 times to go over the attendance policy. However every policy that was presented to us was extremely different. Some stated you were automatically fired for missing 1 training day, others said you were allowed up to 3 absences. Some said the calling out process was via an automated phone system, others said that you were to email your floor supervisor and others still said you had to call and speak to with an actual person. At a certain point an individual pointed out these major inconsistencies with the information we were given so they tried to do a test call out. The correct procedure was the automated call out system, however when they called in, there was a prompt to leave a voicemail that stated not leaving the voicemail would result I a no call no show, then immediately after, there was a prompt that the voicemailbox was full. This became a running joke amongst my classmates and people continued to call in and show other co-workers and in the entire time I was there, the call out system was never fixed. The explanation for the misinformation was that they were going through a merger and the different policies were different versions"
bad,"My experience was not pleasant, and I still shutter when I think of my time working there.  The amount of documentation is outrageous and never ending.  More time is spent documenting than on patient care."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,No one knew what to do about anything and management was horrible! Got contracts and they hired people who were untrained and unskilled to handle the job and situation.
bad,"Terrible management that will ruin your advancement if they want. They can put you on a CAP for things you didn't do, even when you prove yourself. XX"
bad,"VERY hard to get promoted, yearly increase even with a excellent yearly review are VERY small, like 1.2%, does not even cover the yearly increase in health insurance.  VERY expensive healthcare with little benefits, sad."
bad,"They tout work life balance and pat themselves on the back for it,  but its just NOT true.  The culture is stressful at best. Management never available to staff because they're always in meetings (frankly, i think its just them eating food and laughing about taking credit fir other people's work)"
bad,to much pressure to work fast and not accurately.  Managers give no support. Company wants to get claims paid even if they are wrong.  Should have more time to make sure claim is correct.
bad,This really depends on who you work for. There is a lot of favoritism in management. Many managers are not ethical they pit employees against each other and stab employees in the back if they don’t like you. They are petty about PTO and very good at putting employees on notice by way of bad performance ratings. Document everything anyone says to you if you work there.
bad,"NOBODY cares about anything except for covering their own a_s.   Progress be damned, quality be damned.   The number one quality for someone who would succeed here is to have no courage what so ever.    They tend to 'reorganize' every 6 to 8 weeks to eliminate the possibility of showing that nothing is ever accomplished."
bad,CEO and other executives are extremely vicious and not trustworthy.  Culture is terrible. The strategy is to scrape by and work people to death. If you voice your opinion and even question the executive team you better have another job lined up because it isn’t acceptable to be innovative.
bad,Manager doesn't hold anyone accountable and if they do decide to hold anyone accountable it's because they don't like that person. You also will see a lot of retaliation if you do try to hold the manager/supervisor accountable
bad,"Only way for advancement is to be related to someone.  Company in Phoenix seems to have 4 major families working there, if you are related or dating someone within one of the families, your opportunities are endless.  Middle management and direct supervisors do not care about their employees."
bad,not worth commenting on if you have no interest in life but to be someone dog then this is the place for you. human resources or as they refer to it as human capital is your dog handler.
bad,The company did not offer the correct tools to effectively perform the job duties asked of me. The company expected an excess about of coding per hour that was unreachable without the proper tools. The 6 week training was very intensive and they would not allow for any questions because of all the information they had to cover with over 100 new hires.
bad,"They only care about the bottom line and not the employee and the customer is at the bottom of the list, the training environment is horrible and I would never consider going there again."
bad,"At first, I thought the job was amazing. Great pay, great training. The overall job is beyond stressful, you get yelled at and cussed out by customers on a daily basis and that can be overwhelming. The managers blame the agents for the horrible numbers but in reality, it’s the company as a whole, including the managers blaming everyone. No one listens to the agents. They preach innovation but our ideas/opinions don’t matter and won’t change anything. I left because of the management, they micromanage every little thing that you do. The business manager in my department was ignorant and condenscending, she played favorites so she would be nice to the agents that she liked and rude to the ones she didn’t like. She was extremely unprofessional. I wouldn’t recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"mgmt lies and will not step up is un ethical"
bad,"Would not recommend employment for this company. The hours are not fixable. They do not care about their employees, only how may calls you take a day. No incentives for goals. Management is okay if you are not assigned to a manger who has favorites. Taking days off for any religious reasons is given but only after you have to fight for it.  Breaks are given but...how can a person controls when they have to use the bathroom. That's a big problem. Pros if you like talking to people this is the job for you. Cons if you cannot sit for most of the day or have bladder issues then this is not the job for you."
bad,"UHG started off good. Brainstorming sessions accepted staff suggestions. My suggestion was to certify all techs for OEM warranty repair, significantly shortening down time for the end user. Then 75% of the tech jobs were moved to the Philippines, with one central ""maintenance depot"" for almost all hardware repairs, removing the repairs from local techs. Thereby increasing total restore time for end users from 20-26 hours, to 3-5 days. Not caring about anything but the individual departments budget. Never overall global cost."
bad,Management at United Healthcare do not care about their people. They never compliment them and are eager to blame them when things go wrong. They only care about themselves and their bonuses.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The company is more interested in there bottom line than the employee. The company keeps growing through aquistion but does not invest in the the infrustructure so the employees suffer
bad,Not a fun place to work. Micro managed to death and all the management plays favorites. Hard to advance and numbers are stressed so hard its not funny. The goals are pretty unattainable..
bad,"UHC did not compensate it's employees well, nor did it choose it's management well.  It's turnover rate was astounding.   They make promises they don't keep and treat their employees like they are children, accounting for their every minute.   You can't even be an adult and get up and use the restroom when you want to.   If you had half a brain, subpar customer service skills, and a willingness to work they would teach you EVERY phone queue so you were taking 150+ calls a day, while the bad eggs with no work ethic were still kept on for some reason and were only put on 1 or 2 queues, therefore, you could be taking call after call, while the lazy one sitting next to you could be taking only 34-40 calls a day.  PITIFUL!"
bad,Management are bullies; no training; little or very poor strategic planning.   Incredibly inefficient management and work processes.  Very stressful if you are a high-achiever with a strong work ethic.  Any pros of the job are completely outweighed by the stress and verbal abuse.
bad,Management should be in Congress party. One of the best company to work if you love politics. Its a good company for some one who has got good family back up and come to office for the sake of working.
bad,Very stressful job. Hate going to work every day. As soon as I find a job with comparable pay I will leave. The health insurance plans are a joke. Would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"It's a huge company with diversity & some benefits, but you're on your own to solve a problem without a support from the dept or close manager although they're saying they're there to help you. Also, you have to do exact same per their standard from each dept, so it's automation of human works with NO human touches or care. I'm a hard worker but never had an actual chance to improve skill or advance the career due to NO support from the dept. They do vital surveys but there's NO change after each survey for 12 years that I've been here although they claim they're better than last year. It's becoming less & less fun to work each year than when I first started because of their poor management."
bad,"Micro management , Didn’t know the job as a supervisor didn’t had no idea how to manage people was unable to help you and your workload and we’ll talk about you behind your back and front of other people employees especially"
bad,Not a good place for job culture or room to grow. Was not comfortable talking to immediate managers about issues or felt uncomfortable since it is extremely number based company.
bad,"Avoid this place like the plague.  It's another inbound call center, with nearly impossible metrics, extreme micromanaging, and uncaring managers.  Just stay away."
bad,"United is very large with a diverse group of businesses. They struggle to collaborate and learn from other groups, companies and businesses within their organization."
bad,"Will phase out entire teams with no warning and gives the work to countries like Manilla.  And if they cut a partial team, it is the older employees (in their 60's) that get cut first no matter how many years they have worked for the company. "
bad,"This job is all cold calling and harassing members. They don't tell you how it really is during the interview. Everyday you call about 200 members to try and convince them to schedule a in-home visit with a clinician. But, what they don't tell you is you're calling the same members who have already let United health group know they don't want the visit so, you're harassing these poor members every 2 days. If you don't meet their numbers, you are let go. They just care about numbers and not the agents. Poor management, too much favoritism, small uncomfortable desks, no room for advancement, they enjoy failing agents on calls. If you're into telemarketing, then apply."
bad,"Training was terrible, the guy who trained us didn't know what he was doing. Management was even worse. Our coaches were from other departments and didn't know anything. Some of them were very rude. I hated talking all day on the phone with people. Free lunches were cool and work parties. Didn't appreciate being timed and called out in front of everyone for being late from lunch or breaks."
bad,"Had a terrible experience at Houston location. I don’t recommend here, poor management, poor HR and employee relations. Provider service, working here is a waste of time. They treat people like slaves"
bad,"In a job where your actions could actually end up killing a person, minimum wage and an incredibly lack-lustered training course made the job immensely stressful to perform"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"the temps here are treated very bad by the hired worker, we were required to attend meeting that only pertained to hired employees, even there was treated bad our questions was snarled at. we want to know answers to thing in case we were ever hired. we were put in a area buy our self and stood over like prisoners."
bad,"Started working with uhc in 2015 and was very excited. At the time it seemed like a good place to work. Two years later and I've never been so stressed out in my life! Not only is the training inadequate but your superior is just as lost as you. How they got promoted to be supervisor is a mystery. They are never around when you need help,outside smoking or texting their boyfriend, and they show favoritism to certain employees. You're expected to be on the phone your whole shift while the teachers pet colors on paper or passes out lollipops. Filing grievances and complaints go unheard because hr direct's decisions are biased. There are numerous inappropriate acts being committed between upper management and employees, given certain employees leverage for advancement over others. This is an unethical, immoral place to work and I live for the day that they are shut down."
bad,"They force you to use headsets 50 or more hours a week, I am deaf already from it. I was in the military, this company is 20 times more abusive than your basic trainning. The worst abuse from UHC is giving you tinnitus for the rest of your life, not being able to hear well, not being able to sleep well from the tinnitus. No matter what your pay is, your hearing has no price. You will also damage your throat cause of talking nonstop for hours. Leave the ""sweat shop"" as we used to call this company, leave for your own good, you won't regret it at all."
bad,While working for this company several people had problems with some of the coworkers and management told us to suck it up. While I was out sick my position was given to someone else with no notice to me and even though I was ill and had notes excusing me I was asked to resign my position. Not a good company to work for if you have a family.
bad,"I've been working at uhc for 5 years. I started off as a tier 1 member service advocate in August 2011, then moved on to be a tier 2 RSS agent as of November 2013. It was a lateral move, no pay increase and the biggest mistake ever. I take 70-110 calls per day. The trainers who get paid $50,000+ are not training these agents right which causes them to call tier 2 all day long for questions not in our job description. We are here to do billing and enrollment processes but get calls for everything under the sun as well as from every single department: enrollment, billing, compliance, subject matter experts, supervisors, claims, and quality assurance. It's stressful with all day calls. Micromanaging. The benefits are highly expensive and compensation that could be good is  realistically not due to the cost of benefits and out of pocket expenses! It's hard to move out of the Rss department and I'm tired of working here."
bad,The only positive side to working to UHC is flexibility  on your schedule.  There isn't a growth opportunity based off education and experience.  Most people are over worked and doing double duty because of high turn over.  There aren't any incentives and overtime is the only way they can keep steady on client numbers.  I have never seen such dated material and processing.  I am left speechless in a position where I cannot move up based on their scaling. The hardest part is investing so much time knowing you won't get anything in return.
bad,racist work place. unfair treatment. unorganized. no one knows what they are doing. training is extensive for no reason. support is limited.
bad,"As an analyst at Optum's Technology Support Center you have to adhere strictly to a predefined schedule with out exception and can be fired for not adhering down to the minute. As a contractor they pay you a poverty wage to reset passwords for 8 hours a day. No one speaks to you unless your are in trouble. Before being terminated I met with my supervisor twice. Both times to be reprimanded and threatened with contract termination. Not a single manager inquired about my wellbeing, or anything besides my schedule adherence. Again and like a robot you have to adhere to your schedule which will not allow for emergency bathroom breaks. I witnessed another manager wait for an employee to return from an unscheduled bathroom break only to reprimand him for not following his schedule. If you are a minute passed your break it is considered one half of an occurrence. The equivalent of a half day from work. The constant attrition and your lack of worth to the company is communicated in daily emails. Reminders to you that another person is ""deciding to pursue opportunities' outside of Optum"" I received an email from a co-worker the day I was fired, hours before I even knew that I was no longer with the company. For a fortune 17 company that has such lofty goals on improving society they do not care about their employees. They don't know my story and will never deem to care a whit about me or anyone they serve. 6 Months was far to long to stay there. Heed my words before accepting a contract with Optum. You will most likely regret it if you don't."
bad,UHG/Optum360 now manages the revenue cycle of the North shore LIJ system which is the dumbest thing. UHG is not fit to manage a 24 hr operating system as they are a 9-5 business. When you contact HR they tell you everything is up to your managers discretion. They are completely  clueless as to what goes on because they are in Minnesota and we are in NY. Very sneaky company.
bad,very inconsistent scheduling. not family-friendly. stressful work environment. very fast pace training. systems used are not compatible with work load.
bad,"I arrive, punch in and greet my coworkers. I login to my system and pull up Avaya, AS400, VOM, Share Point etc...I proceed to answer calls, some providers call to place eyeglass and/or contact lens orders, they call to verify patient benefits, to request lens options and availability or to have patients benefits reinstated. I enjoyed speaking to the providers and over the years I developed  a very good relationship with many of the providers. I'd encounter very pleasant providers and on occasion I'd encounter unpleasant providers but many had legitimate reasons to be upset. Many times their problem was something that was out of my hands, but I knew that transferring their call would only escalate the issue, so I would take it upon myself to do everything I could to correct the problem and make that provider happy."
bad,"The job is very stressful, almost impossible to take your PTO, Management is very poor, training is not through....their health insurance TOTALLY SUCKS!!!!  No advancement opportunities, do yourself a favor...keep on looking!!!!!"
bad,I had been warned before I decided to try to get a job there but I thought job security. Went through 16 week training program and it is not easy.  I made it out to the floor but if you don't bent over and kiss their butt you will not make it. (I don't I treat people with respect and I expect the same) When a certain member of management decided she did not like me there was no way I could keep my job I took up to 70 phone calls a day helping members with there health care and if you make a mistake they don't tell you what you did wrong and how to not make the mistake again you get written up with a warning. And it does not take many to let them fire you.  No one can possibly know all of it so if they look hard enough they can find your mistakes. I have never been treated more poorly than I was at this company.  Yes  I was fired. But they also have in  place rules and procedures to protect management so if they are on a power trip you have no recourse.  Most of the employees were great and the members most were nice to help and talk to.  But they manage you down to the minute and if you do not meet your goals which now are almost impossible to meet you get written up and no raise.  It is a proven fact that companies that allow micro managers the morale is in the toilet.  Everyone was so busy trying to stay out of trouble they are all miserable.  So sad for the largest health care company in the world.
bad,"Anyone who gave UHC high ratings, does not work in the call center. They keep you stuck in your position by keeping you written up for nonsense. No raises received for years, nothing ever works right, systems down daily with you being left without access answering 60 calls only telling them they have to call back, Management is unprofessional and condescending, high turnover rate. Please do yourself a favor...apply elsewhere."
bad,Worked at the the Shavano location for several years. I tried my hardest to stand out with performance and reliability. I always volunteered my time and rarely said no. Management is inappropriate and unprofessional they cant even do YOUR job yet alone manage others. Promotions are decided by favoritism get in cozy with the right people and you can pass up people who have been there for years in just a few months to a year. If you are quick to volunteer for the betterment of the company meaning taking on new skill sets  you are wasting your time. This company is all about metrics and numbers. Don't think you're doing the company any favors going out of your way to resolve issues like making extra calls or taking extra time. At the end of the month when your supervisor meets with you all they will care about is whether you have met your metrics or not. Pto is a nightmare you need schedule several months in advance to get it. They don't give bonuses as in holiday bonuses. the quarter bonuses are near impossible to obtain. The prizes are won by the same people all the time. They are so cheap they offered us holiday lunch in 2013 and gave it only to half of the employees and canceled last min on the rest of us. The pay is competitive I suppose but trust me you will earn every dollar they give you with tenure expect $15 + btw they will have you at your desk sending mail outs and fliers... The systems are constantly freezing and breaking down and they wait till the last minute to improve systems and processes. Management runs around implementing changes without running adequate test
bad,This company allows ADHD managers to supervise other employees.  By doing so each day you will get a different answer to the same question.
bad,"Was a pharmacy tech at OptumRx for 6 years in Cypress, Ca. First few years when it was Prescription Solutions were good, it was a  nice environment, I enjoyed the work and felt good about helping patients obtain their medications.There were no inbound calls, we processed prescriptions as they came in to our system, worked with pharmacists, contacted patients and Dr.'s offices...Then it became Optum. Poor inexperienced mgmt. who talked about the  employees to others, fudged numbers,  Micromanaging, inconsistencies in policies from one mgr.  to another, very high hourly production goals that went up every time a few people consistently exceeded because hey if they can do it..which greatly impacted the service you could provide since calls had to be timed and they gave us a script to follow,  and if you veered from it or used any filler words ( like saying "" I see"" or ""yes"" as patient talked, to show you were actively listening or to add a personal touch.. Most customers are seniors and you might be the only voice they heard that day) well you were dinged.  Paramedics at our site weekly treating employees and a number of people on stress leave ( even supervisors)  chained to a desk with assigned bathroom breaks so if you had any kind of medical problem you needed a note because no one should have to use restroom more than 3x daily, mandatory overtime at times was 20 hours a week and if you couldn't do it or signed up and had to change the hours you wrote down  due to family or illness you were written up. All the OT caused exhaustion and processing errors but they didn't care."
bad,Poor managment style. Critical environment with high stress level and managers who ruled by intimidation.
bad,"A typical day was spent hurrying to get applications approved."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Things change daily and weekly. The company goals are to have a 1 stop shop. Where a caller can call into 1 main number and all benefits needed on 1 call. No more transfering to different dept and units. Great Idea. "
bad,The Sunrise location displays less than compassion when it comes to the employees. I will never recommend this as a great workplace to anyone. I would suggest that management takes the necessary time to know the reps and how they add to the company as opposed to being so overbearing. Everyday there is  something new thrown at you that affects your metrics and your job. Its just horrible. Dont believe me? Just go and work for them.
bad,"Work in the Roanoke, Va Call Center...The worst management team ever. Your people are only as good as the leaders. 10 year employee...to the point now you are being told how to respond to questions. Unrealistic expections set by people in cooperate offices who couldnt take a phone call and research the issue and solve the problem if their lives depended on it"
bad,"I was in training for a couple of weeks with no direction, and confusing instructions. The trainer was rude and hateful. She took personal calls during the times she was supposed to be training. She did nothing but rolled her eyes and appeared disgusted when a question about the job was asked. In addition,  she went on and on about how much she disliked the St. Louis region, and her weight loss goals was all she really discussed. I wouldn't suggest this job to anyone."
bad,"I hated this job it is a blessing that i got out of it. They would stress their ""new culture"" but wouldnt follow it"
bad,"A typical day doesn't exist, because whatever I plan my supervisor changes, usually at the last minute. My supervisor is a bully, mean to the point of telling staff ""You're not doing anything right"", ignores ethical behavior and patient's confidentiality. Upper management makes ethnic jokes in presence in staff members and even though complaints are made nothing happens to offender. Supervisor gives confusing and incorrect instructions to staff then blames them for his mistakes."
bad,"this job does not care about the employees or their customers. No one is on one accord, and again they do not care about the employees at all and we work for the company and have the worst benefits ever and have to pay for them!"
bad,Management was horrible to associates in the Choices department.
bad,Micromanagement. Co-workers are terrible. Work place environment terrible. Felt like I was working with bunch of phychos.
bad,"This company does not promote within... all they do in training is rave about growth within the company and it's BS! They do NOT promote within... I have been a top performer for MONTHS and when applied to another position got a call from the recruiter and she actually told me they went with someone from outside the company SERIOUSLY?  They could careless if you have sick kids, sick family, if you're sick, if you're not on that phone 24/7 they don't care about you! They pay decent but that is only because its such a trainwreck to work for they have to have something to keep you... The insurance is a JOKE. They micro-manage like no other... constantly breathing down your neck. Apply here if it's your LAST resort! "
bad,"I've worked at this facility for just over a year now as a temp to hire, let go once because 'numbers' were not enough to keep me on board, but the 'numbers' were enough to hire friends and family members of unorganized management. Brought back because people hired were unable to keep up with the work that I had been doing while I was employed, that was due to lack of training and hiring unskilled workers to take over what skilled workers had already been trained to do. Caught the facility back up and was once again back on the temp to hire path, foolishly believed I would be hired and turned down several other job opportunities ( which was a huge mistake on my part ) and now am threatened again with termination for the same reason as before...but once again they have enough space to bring on more family and friends of management. They go through temps like a meat grinder, hiring in waves to let go within a month because they are highly unorganized and hardly do any research on real numbers when new clients come on board. My warning to anyone out there who may read this, if you are a friend of the management, this is the place you will get a job in no time. If you are a temp to hire, cover your bases and start looking for another job immediately. It doesn't matter how much you do, always on time, never call in, and bend over backwards to be at work, you will not be hired. Trust me, as someone who could output 2,000 - 2,500 scripts a week, even they wouldn't bring me on full time. Also was cross-trained in 3 different areas, while I helped beta-test this archaic system they used"
bad,"Well, a typical day at work consists of every second of your day being monitored. If you have to get up to the bathroom, you better be quick or you will get yelled at for not being on the phones. I have learned a lot about Medicare insurance and wish that it was something i could delete from my brain. It is one of the worst fields to be employed in. Constantly being yelled at by old grumpy people who don't understand half the things you say to them. Management is a complete joke. They ALL have different ""styles"" and let me tell you none of the 6 that I have had in the past year and a half know what they are doing. The hardest part of my job is dealing with such angry people all day and then being ""coached"" that i should have got a sale off of someone who is already a member. Your ""management"" will tell you that you need to get them into a different plan. There isn't a single thing that I enjoy about this job. I am desperately trying to find new employment that will bring my pay back to what I was at before leaving my previous employer. I was told and promised a lot of things at united health care, and all i received was a huge pay cut and tons of stress. WORST JOB EVER!"
bad,Horrible management that does not want to listen to any ideas to better the company. Their motto: my way or the high way.
bad,this company consists of management that does not respect its employees.
bad,"If you are looking to get in with a company on the ground floor with the intention of moving up, don't look here. If you're in a bad way, and just looking for a paycheck, then this company is alright. However, don't expect for your hard work to be rewarded. Promotions here are solely based on who you are buddies with; so if you're a brown-noser, this is the place for you. You can be the top performer of your department; train newcomers; be chosen to have the CEO of the company shadow you for a day to set the example for your department. After all of that you will see the people that you trained promoted over you, and then be told that you didn't get the position because you need to ""get your name out there""; even though their stats don't hold a candle to yours. My advice is to stay away; but if you choose to work here, don't even worry about your stats, just start making friends with all the right people."
bad,"Sold a bill of goods to take the job...they said quick career advancement, a lot of opportunities. Place was run like a sweat shop. Advancement opportunities in customer service slim to none."
bad,Run this company consist of management that does not respect its employees.
bad,"United Healthcare did not seem to care about its employees or its members. Although I worked here for 2 and a half years, I only enjoyed the first 6 months and then I just went for the paycheck."
bad,I have had the privilege of working with some top Fortune 500 companies and it amazes me that a Fortune 50 company such as UHC does not have sick leave in place. If your child gets sick then you must take an occurrence and be subject to a possible write up.
bad,Do not bother....you'll be sorry. Be forewarned!
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"I worked as a Sr. Customer Service Representative at the Oldsmar, Florida office. If you believe in fratenizing and being in the in crowd then this is the place for you. I worked in this position for 2 1/2 years with hopes of career advancement. I have a journalism degree, MBA, and a health insurance license. I applied for several positions within United Healthcare, and I was advised that I didn't meet any of the qualifications, but my resume was impressive. Sometimes they post jobs and then remove them once you apply. I believe in merit and good work ethic not brown nosing my way to the top. It is really frustrating when others are promoted easily and have less skills, that is a testament to how business enviornments these days. To those who are looking for work and are brilliant, don't waste your time in a call center environment. Management just do enough to get through the day. It's sad you can be a supervisor or manager without a college degree. Management allow other employees to do powerpoint presentations and other activities with the promise of taking them off the phones. As a supervisor or manager you should possess the skills needed to do your job. A company that made 3 billion dollars last year give their employees .10 cent increase in pay; that is a shame. Overall, United Healthcare is not a good place to work, they do not value their employees. I am now self-employed, and I am happy the day I walked out and did not look back!"
bad,"This company talks a good game; they say they care about their customers and their employees. The unfortunate truth, at least at the Avon Lake facility, is that they do not care about their employees one bit. This is evidenced by their high turnover rate. Employees are not efficiently trained, which causes unsatisfied customers; it is very frustrating to be expected to provide exemplary service when you are not given the proper tools to do so. Employees are seldom given positive feedback from management; and negative feedback is freely handed out along with disciplinary action for petty reasons. Avoid this place like the plague unless you have a friend in management. Then it is a great place to work and you'll be able to do pretty much whatever you want."
bad,"Horrible, horrible management team. ""Fly-in"" managers from Atlanta are discriminatory and verbally abusive. One of these managers - a woman - actually backed me up in my cube and talked so fast that she spit on me and shook her finger at me until I nearly cried. Managers from the local site are not willing to stand up to the Atlanta fly-in managers. No one supports the employees. The fly-in managers routinely chastise employees for actions that are fabricated and observe computer activity through ""stealth"" program to try to ""catch"" you doing something. (Which never happened to me - I did my job well, but several others that I know of were ""coached."".) BE CAREFUL!!!!! This is a crazy company with managers who are incredibly discriminatory and horribly mean-spirited."
bad,"You are stuck to your phone all day everyday, videotaped, and treated like your in jail. Managers have no respect for employees. All they care is that they get their big bonus each year. I think I saw my supervisor maybe once a month. They had no idea how to do our job or to even help with questions. This company is extremly micromanaged. PLEASE DONT WORK THERE!!!! You will regret it."
bad,"A typical day is coming into the office, process work and make sure I met the required daily metrics before I left for the day. They have a very antiquated system. Management here is horrible--they try to demoralize you. They don't care for your feedback or opinions. They just want you to come in, shut up & do your 40 hrs/wk. They never show appreciation to their employees. They only enjoyable part of working there were the nice co-workers I met. We were all in the same boat--unhappy working there, so we'd lean on each other for support to get through the day to day BS. If your considering a position w/ this company please think twice."
bad,"My work experience at UHC was not an overall positive experience. I received 3 months of training for my position which was intense and somewhat unrealistic. My group of trainees was the first large group which UHC trained, and there was not enough ""one on one"" contact for those who were in need. Over the time that I was employed by UHC, the company name changed as well as the title of my position. Our responsibilities were in a constant flux, as well. My co-workers were wonderful, we gave each day a team effort, which was squelched by the management who did not encourage teamwork, only individual work with a heavy focus on production. The qualifying production was increased a number of times, which caused a constant team feeling of panic. As for the management, there was the use of intimidation, very little positive feedback for all, and a strong sense of favoritism for those who ""met the goals"" from time to time. Unfortunately, effort was not rewarded, only results - this is a direct quote from upper management given to our department at a department meeting,"
bad,"Independent means CAPTIVE, NO salary, NO expense, NO mileage, NO cell, NO Laptop. Need I say more. Other competitors pay a salary ranging from $26,000 plus commission to $40,000 plus commission. Oh WOW, they give you a few leads (prospects throughout the year). They get you for FREE. I did it for 2 years. I didn't know other companies were paying their agents that much. Never again. I made half of what the other agents made, oh yeah I forgot NO Insurance. But they do give you a badge and business cards."
bad,Too much management and not enough help. Management has kneejerk reactions and do not listen to rational opinions.
bad,Local plan has struggled with senior management. From regional to local. Thus all of the good employees are gone. Unfortunately don't trust anyone as everyone must watch their own back.
bad,"I've worked for many F500 corps and this was by far the worst. The culture is extremely passive aggressive, no one trusts anyone, and no one should be trusted."
bad,A typical day at work is answering several inbound calls from irate or dissatisfied customers. The information provided to customer service representatives is inconsistent. Customer service representatives must be capable of working in an inconsistent organization whose processes never remain the same or management has little or no structure. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make a difference in people's lives.
bad,Nothing enjoyable about feeling like you are in prison at work. There isn't a culture to build on. I haven't leaned anything from management other than work ethic isn't important here as long as they like you.
bad,"I would not recommend UHC for employment. Considering that UHC is a health insurance company, one would think a great benefit would be great health insurance. I have never paid such an enormous amount of money for health insurance and I did while employed."
bad,"If you enjoy having 100% of your day dictated by workforce management software, it's the place to be!  Otherwise, don't bother with the major headache this org will give you."
bad,Upper Management have no concern for the employees on the front line. Very poor raises. Management do not give employees the time to be properly trained. Everyone is just trying to get the next promotion. Goals are set so high the are impossible to meet.
bad,This was not a good place to work. The schedules were not for people that have small children. You call and bother elder people all day to convince them to let a stranger come into their home to conduct a visit to assess the need for health services.
bad,"Do not work for this employer.  You will have no support in  difficult situations. Should you be harassed by your boss, don’t expect to get any support from HR or upper mgmt. Then expect retaliation and action plans until your boss falsifies your work. This is the kind of environment you will be forced to work in. Horrible place. Absolutely terrible, gave me anxiety, depression, irritable bowels. Don’t   Go!"
bad,"Management are cliquey "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"I spent 5 years at this company to be under trained - overly fast paced and no work life balance. To be laid off (almost 500 of us )due to downsizing, which was really them sending jobs to over seas to pay them less money. Benefits sucked"
bad,"Coming out of college I was ecstatic to be working for a fortune 5 company, Many people warned me about UHG but I ignored them. My experience was Truly awful. I was put on a corrective action plan only 3 months in to starting. Before that my boss had given me positive or neutral feedback, so this came extremely unexpected.  No helpful onboard training and an abusive boss. Managers will protect each other and HR is lazy so I ended up resigning. It was truly the best decision I ever made."
bad,It was a dream job for 3 months then management changed and it was a nightmare. The new management team committed teams to unrealistic deadlines and micromanaged the teams into a really poor culture
bad,Horrible very stressful ..unfair .. illegal practice . Alot of verbal  abuse from upper management. Work load was impossible to complete and more and more are added .. very unrealistic work practice.
bad,Had two managers while employed.  One was hands off and never made sure I actually knew my job.  The other didn't even know my job but wanted to micromanage and was never around or knew the answer when I had an actual question pertaining to my job.  She was rude and argumentative as well.
bad,The pay is great but the atmosphere is not genuine. They push to their employees that they care about you and they are for you but really they aren't. Your voice does not matter here and they don't care about you as a person or what is going on in your personal life. All they care about is you doing the job. Plenty of favoritism is shown in the company as well. pay is sufficient but I would not recommend this job to anyone at all. It is mentally draining and you have no support from your superior team.
bad,"I joined UHG as a manager, previously I was a director.  I wasn't concerned about the job level as I figured I could move within the company (it's so large it had lots of director positions).  However, once in the role two things became clear.  1) since my compensation was higher (due to my previous role) they lowered my bonus saying it was ""only fair"".  Then, to add insult to injury I applied to several director level jobs and the recruiter called only to change the title of the job from director to manager once they found out my current title.  My manager was a ""micromanager"" and would constantly ask me to look into minute details that he would ""check on"" when I was buried with work.  I wouldn't recommend this company.  Lastly, one of the best VP's they had was pushed out due to ""new management"" from Minnesota.  It was a huge loss for everyone working there."
bad,"Management expected us to drive in a snow storm to the office, while they worked from home.  Threatening to give us an occurrence if we did not come in.  Even when you had proof that their systems was shutting down, causing you delays from working remotely, you still would be written up."
bad,"If you want a job where no one helps you, blames you for others mistakes, and doesn't recognize your efforts then work here. I started here and was immediately given excess work from 4 other people and given very little instruction as to how to navigate through their systems. I was even shown how to complete some tasks incorrectly! The little help I did get was inconsistent because everyone did everything differently. There was absolutely zero management oversight or engagement. God forbid management did have to do something, you were met with a negative attitude. When they state you must be able to work independently they really mean it. If you need help with anything you'll have a hard time getting someone to help that actually has a positive or helpful demeanor. Save your frustration and avoid the Lexington, KY UHG/UMR location."
bad,I worked as a nurse practitioner for the house calls visits. They put you on a very tight schedule and expect you to make it on time to see all patients. Charting is 20 pages long-you need to capture everything about the patient in 45 mins or less n travel to the next patient 30-40 mins away in 15 mins to get there on time. Unreasonable demands from high management.
bad,Was employed with UHC back in 2014 approx. Had to leave the job due to a family issue and gave my two weeks. Applied recently to continue with UHC but apparently I don't meet a specific qualification. How is that so?
bad,Absolutely chaotic. No willingness to accept suggestions for improving application development and/or workflows. Definitely a depressing environment. Very difficult to interact with and get support from various workgroups.
bad,"work day sucked here. "
bad,ive been working here for over 12 years and now being layed off. this is a good place to work when they need you. learned a lot about health care and healthcare cost.
bad,I was not very happy there because it was not customer service. it was doing everything for the customer. I wanted to help the customer not enable them.
bad,"Salary doesn't support cost of living in New York, free education on IDEA a plus, this job would be great if pay was a little better, can't support a family on this salary"
bad,"Huge turn over, no one stays. If you want a job talking to crabby people with your supervisor breathing down your back then this job is for you. Not enough pay during slow months."
bad,"The best part of working at United Health Group was the campus and the daily fitness classes, bicycles to ride, and the variety of restraunt food available on campus."
bad,No job advancements and very very low pay!! Pay is to low for the amount of work you do.. They will move you in dept and give more work but not more pay....
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,They only want the young inexperienced and offshore workers. It doesn't matter how much you gave to the company they feel nothing showing you the door.
bad,"Terrible hours, terrible training, terrible supervisors. I would not recommend to anyone to get a job at this place."
bad,"A typical day at work in a production environment is being glued to your desk and computer.  I didn't take calls, but I still had metrics to meet.  I learned a lot about insurance reimbursement policies, coordination of benefits, Medicare and Medicaid Reclamation but everything I learned I had to fight management tooth and nail for.  Managers do NOT know the most basic answers to health insurance industry guidelines and UHC's own internal policies and internal systems, and they are unwilling to find out the answers for you.  They bully and pressure you to close out issues you don't understand, and that they themselves cannot provide answers about.  They will pretend that the problem is YOU.  They will gaslight you and never admit they don't know an answer.  Questions are seriously frowned upon. Do not go above your immediate supervisor seeking answers. My supervisor told me point blank that if I seek out information from the department director, I would have a target on my back.  The claims adjustment department wastes their Employer Group's money and management does not care.  I brought many training issues that could be fixed very simply to their attention. I brought many examples of improperly adjusted claims and overpaid claims to their attention and nothing was ever done about it.  This was the most stressful job I have ever had.  The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting.  I felt it was the most honorable thing to do.  You cannot fix this mess, please don't try."
bad,"Once a goal is reached people are discarded with little concern for their wellbeing. Culture is talked about at UHC but ignored, loyalty is frowned upon. If you leave UHC you are likely to be treated better than if you stay. UHC does not realize that long term success is achieved by steady reliable work not by the fastest and youngest new inexperienced people. The best organizations keep the big picture in view, treat their employees as real people opposed to disposable commodities, the best organizations inspire company loyalty. UHC practices rolling layoffs just to boost the stock and claim a reorganization will make things better when actually it negatively affects and destroys the culture of the entire workforce remaining."
bad,"Advancement is not for most, it is impossible to advance, h less they consider $0.12 raise advancement.  Terrible management terrible environment. Would not suggest planning a career at UHC"
bad,"I worked for UHC for a total of 7 years, The work itself was not hard and I enjoyed assisting providers with the many many complicated programs. "
bad,"United Healthcare is easy to work for. Ttec on the other hand is not."
bad,"I worked as an Analyst for several months, we were poorly trained on faulty software and programs they had implemented a few years back. It was legitimately the blind leading the blind, as our trainers whom created our job aid hadn't worked the position they trained us on. The work environment was very catty and drama filled. Our seniors had absolutely no respect towards the baseline employees and a complete unwillingness to lead us in the right direction if we had questions. A complete circus! I was brought in and told my performance was above their long standing employees, then let go the very next day. Our seniors were not willing to take accountability or responsibility for the direction they offered if it was off the stated protocol, and we got the brunt end of the stick. If you decide to work here, I strongly advise you to get everything in writing!"
bad,"I had to figure everything out on my own. I got pawned off to different managers, until I ended up with the 1 manager; who didn't know what the heck he was doing. Manager had no clinical experience at all. Very poor communication skills, and didn't want to listen to other people's opinions. I worked and trained others as a lead, but didn't get paid extra for training other employees. Company expected too much with little pay. Manager within our team didn't want to hire more Hispanic people...so much for the company's mission."
bad,Treated health information like sales. Quotas were emphasized more than quality of work. Management only cared about numbers. A person who made more calls in a day was more successful than a person who closed more cases.
bad,"Excessive mandatory OT 10+ per week "
bad,"Trainers are inadequate.  They seem to not know from one day to the next the proper way to do something. Trainees had their intelligence insulted due to some not fully understanding a process.  Evidently, if the trainer cannot get a point across, the entire class is not smart enough.  "
bad,"I would not advise anyone who is looking for advancement or a stable enviroment to apply here.  The management / supervisors in this facility are the worst no respect, favortism and overall unprofessional. The only reason I give it a 1 star is because I cant submit this without it."
bad,"The management team is pathetic at best.  My experience was with a bunch of catty, insecure women who exhibited poor judgement and complete lack of professionalism.  "
bad,Hypocritical goals set for employees which are not followed by employees or management. Advised by CEO to file a complaint and then no one pursued an investigation and I left while the problem employee remains.
bad,"I learned form this company what not to expect from other companies going forward, the management would only support only when there was something that involved covering themselves, moral was pretty low and was going to continue to be as such if the company did not want to change what they were already doing to the employees there there was so much expected but there was no give back from the company,"
bad,"I worked there over 8 years , I dont remember much. I would had liked to stay there since I helped start the night shift. I pointed out because my family became sick."
bad,to little pay  for so much work i didnt like it  they asked too much of you  for very little in return i felt like cattle  management only spoke with you to tell you what u needed improvement on no positive reinforcement
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Not everyone gets held to the same standards; there is a lot of favoritism and select managers make the job difficult to want to continue.  There is so much money that the company brings in and they continue to bring in more members, but the rate of pay is almost insulting.  By the time someone has the option to bonus, it is more than half a year and is entirely based on metrics, rather than the overall satisfaction of the member; some members need more help than others, but its all about the overall numbers rather than the member experience.  You could have a quick call, have a very displeased member, and have them hang up on you within a few minutes, but that doesn't really get factored in over those that you genuinely did help.  Overall, I wish I wouldn't have worked with UnitedHealth Group, but I am glad for the knowledge that I gained about healthcare, how plans work."
bad,"My first boss threatened me on what felt like a daily basis that I may lose my job. My second boss was great, and if I had stayed longer, I might have gotten further in the company, except that..."
bad,It depends on what you are looking for.They present themselves as a a company based on certain values but the management doesn't exemplify those values.The pay is not great and for it to be a healthcare company the benefits aren't good either.
bad,"My Typical work day is starting at 6:30 am and open all the system's that i need to do my job.. I then start pulling claim and work them, if I have questions on a claim we put them on a log and a person will look at the claim and answer."
bad,No comment high pressure not good management of priorities failing project office space was disruptive terrible terrible project  management fialure to deliver poor quality assurance
bad,"Could be a great place to work if the company provided you with the proper tools to become successful. Training at this company is horrible, feels like you're being set up to fail. Would not advice anyone to apply here. The pay for all the work they give is not worth it at all management sucks. High turn over rate here. It's not the company they would have people think it is."
bad,"Although purported to be a clinical care position, my job was focused on maximizing revenue for UHC, often to the detriment of my patients.  Questioning management decisions was strongly discouraged, bordering on forbidden.  Discussions about the ethics of patient decisions were stifled.  I would not work for this company again, nor would I recommend it to any patient-centered healthcare provider."
bad,You are dispensable at this company 10 years of service means nothing and they toss you or on the street like you never existed. I would not recommend
bad,well the job was very fast paced and management was not the greatest i did learn a lot about claims and i did get a chance to speak with different people from all over the united states
bad,As pessoas são contratadas e após estabilizarem as crises a Diretoria Executiva de HR aceita que sejam demitidos sem nenhum feedback e nenhum motivo.
bad,"If you like working 7 days a week and paying a lot of money out of pocket for health insurance and Dr visits,  then UHG is your employer.  There are a lot of incompetent managers and directors.  There are way too many people making demands and poor decisions and not enough people doing the work , they bring in a lot of people for projects and then lay off about 1/3 of the team once the project is on track to meet the goals."
bad,"Be aware that this is a Call Center environment. 90% of the day will be spent answering or making calls. Involves Cold Calling, 30 min break, low pay."
bad,"I would never recommend working here to anyone.  Unless you like being talked to rudely, call after call, it's not worth the amount of stress placed on you.  Trainers are great but training process needs to be revamped.  No wonder it's a revolving door at United Health Care Group."
bad,"The demographics are a real challenge, and there is no management support. There are standard operating procedures that are printed as a guideline to follow, however, in the course of a day, you can encounter issues that do not fit into the box. Typically, you have calls where there are no written answers to questions and it presents a challenge as management is either 1/ not available to ask, 2/ do not have the answers either"
bad,Very poor management and cut throat goals. Very unethical and unprofessional. Very unclear as to whether the job will be available in the near future.
bad,"n/a i dont really want to talk about this job, was a bad experience that i would like to forget and more on with my career hopefully to a better and more promising one in the future."
bad,"I was baited during the interview with Monday through Friday hours and the once training was almost over, they changed my schedule to working weekends without any notification that could happen.  Management told me they'd try and get me a better schedule within the next 4 months and then stopped replying to my email inquiries about it.   This also happened with 2 other colleagues hired after me.  Pay is good.  Management and communication is poor but I think they're just overworked and overloaded due to a lack of supervisors.  I was able to work from home most of the time.  It's VERY difficult to get time off and many days are blacked out to even request off.  Training is lacking as well."
bad,"Amazing technical place that will run you into the ground.  No stability, poor leadership, and constantly nervous staff.  I knew UHG was a brutal place when I arrived there, but it was so much worse than I thought it would be."
bad,If you want a career where you can be soul less its perfect. If you want to complicate and make understanding Healthcare for a member that is what I learned from UHG.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"The Charlotte call center needed a lot of discipline. They were fighting and doing a lot of childish and unprofessional things.  "
bad,"United Healthcare has a metric driven culture. The providers are expected to reach specific metrics each month . This is fine except if members are not home, change their mind or forget it it held against your monthly score. When this happens the only way to correct is to work on days off to try to accommodate the members or ask for extra members to compensate for those that did not show. It turns into a FT job chasing members and your numbers monthly."
bad,Management does NOT support you or care about things happening in your personal life. Things always change in an incoherent manner. Typical call center environment.
bad,"The place is a total sweatshop where you're expected to work unlimited hours, nights and weekends at your manager's request. And they're not asking. Yet they keep bringing up ""Work/Life Balance"", which does not exist in this place. If you value your time,, seek life elsewhere."
bad,"Just overall not a good place to work.  You go in thinking that because you will be working for a huge corporation that everything is on the up and up but it turns out it is as shady of a place there is.  There are lots of promises for advancement but it's lots of empty promises, they ended up eliminating my entire department because they were incredibly unprepared.  Very unimpressed"
bad,"Medsynergies is a poorly operated company.  The management team lacks knowledge, professionalism and are bias.  Advancement is based on who you know and not on what you know."
bad,"Be prepared to be micromanaged! I got written up for being out of coherence for NOT taking a break because I was on a call helping a customer. Isn't that what you are supposed to do?? Also, when the systems go down (constantly) you get in trouble for that too. Management treats workers like little kids instead of adults. The pay sucks for the amount of work you do, parking sucks, and breaks are short. I quit soon after training."
bad,This company makes their employees vote that they are the best company to work for when you are forced to vote and they are aware in each department who voted or not.   It is all FAKE for public review.
bad,"Working as a Utilization Review nurse telecommuting from home. We are assigned hospitals, and anyone who gets admitted to that hospital, you have 24 hours to review the medical records for appropriateness. The job itself is nice, but management uses inaccurate reporting tools to judge how many cases you have which frequently show only 50% of your workload. they install spyware on your computer to monitor how many keystrokes you type, yet the primary role of your job, being using clinical judgement and reviewing medical records, does not count toward your productivity. So you are constantly told you are not working hard enough, even though you are putting in 10-12 hours per day. Management does not listen, does not have a care about individual concerns, it is the absolute worst environment I have ever worked for in regards to workplace culture. I would not recommend working here for any amount of money, if you value ethics and a need for work/home balance."
bad,"I was never given the opportunity to fully do the job for which I was hired. My manager then systematically began removing my job duties, one by one until I literally had hardly anything to do... and I was supposed to be management!"
bad,"At UHC you are rated on your call adherence (sticking to your schedule) and answering calls using a specific ""call flow"". Adherence is a metric that if you are less than a certain percentage, it affects your ability to gain advancement or have certain privileges. If you are trapped on a call with customers and doing your job past the time you are supposed to go on break, this will negatively impact your adherence numbers despite that you were actively working and not intentionally ignoring your schedule."
bad,They will hire you and when the work decreases let you go with  no warning.  They call you Saturday night and tell you don't bother coming to work on Monday
bad,"I currently work here and this is the worst job I've ever had. Management is terrible! Like others have said all you are is a ""number"" to these ppl. Even if you're right at the numbers they want you to be at, you're still not good enough. My supervisor treats us like children yelling at us all the time. I was told I could get my tech license because they offer free classes. I have yet to be informed of the class and anyone I ask for info on it has no idea."
bad,"The management is unorganized, the scheduling is horrible, and the compensation is not equivalent to the amount of work that you are expected to do. The managemnet can never answer any questions and nobody wants to assist in your growth in the company. I had very High expectations for United and they have been completly tarnished."
bad,One of UHC core values is Integrity but I have yet to see that modeled with their employees from corporate down to management in UHC GBO. UHC is so focused on monopolizing Health Insurance it does not focus on it's own employees which are the back bone of the company. You receive about 16 weeks of training how ever training does not prepare you for the floor which is a complete culture shock! After training you go to an area called nesting for 90 days in which you're suppose to receive additional assistance however that's not the case you're better off going straight to your dedicated or highly designated team. The individuals that are there to assist in nesting are sometimes just as clueless as you! And when they don't know the answer or dont want to answer they refer you to an SOP to read through which can be pages long to find your answer but you're not allowed to put the member on hold while doing so. And when a member wants to speak to a Supervisor you have to start a group chat with the supervisors in which 4 out of 5 of them will reject and have the SME's  individuals who are actually working and assisting other employees take the calls. (Screenshots to prove).....they tell you to de-escalate the member but how can you when you're fresh out of training and dont quite understand what's going on yourself. Change is constant at UHC and so is the Payne group Sups on ordering their daily lunch and eating all day and having 5 meetings a day to avoid actually doing any work. UHC needs to develop a better training department that is geared toward what it will actually be like
bad,The hardest part of the job is making production and quality of the claims that you are processing.  The enjoyable part of the job was being able to work independently.  Processing claims is not an easy job and even though it was not a complete strength for me I did get the experience of processing medical claims.
bad,"I highly recommend you weigh your options before taking a job with United Healthcare. I worked with the company 6 months learning claims and was terminated due to production. Training was not the best. I took a pay cut to work for this company because of the opportunities they told me about in my interview. They sold the company really well, but I regret leaving my old job for this company. I strongly advise anyone considering this company to weigh your options wisely."
bad,I worked there for over 2 years. The Franklin TN site is the most unorganized company I've ever worked for. At one point my team went over 6 months without a team and  department manager. When they finally hired a  department manager after only a few months she disappeared for months with no explanation from our managers. When I transferred to another   department that same manager would interrupt our meetings and be extremely rude when we would try to say that the mandatory 15 hours of overtime a week wasn't doable because of children etc. Her response I have a kid too and I don't understand why you can't too. Seriously?!!??? Who speaks to their employees like that? The benefits are HORRIBLE!! Which I can't understand because they're an insurance company. On top of all that the company does nothing for team moral. No potlucks or anything to show employee appreciation. Only emails when you're not hitting the countless metrics which the managers can't even explain half the time. No room for any errors. You have to hit 100% to get the  pathetic $200 bonus every 3 months. And the pay is ridiculous. I never understood how one class would make $11 and the next $16. I knew people making $2 more an hour than me and I had more experience than them. I've never heard of such a wide range in pay for the same position. Overall this is one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. Stay away!!
bad,Responsible for determining medical necessity of procedures based on contractual language and groups desire for services
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"This org has no idea about their vision at least I can say so about Indian management !! they have lots of money to waste on unwanted projects, which never goes live and had to shut ultimately. But they wont give you pay rise !!"

bad,"The description for this job was the best I had ever seen. But the department manager, and hence the job, were a nightmare. I was a 25-year publishing professional when I started at this job, and I knew my work was good, if not very good. No one is more persnickety about my work than I am! Yet my boss--who was an actuary with no publishing experience at all--repeatedly edited my work, often 8 to 10 times per article. She read her ""edits"" to me and told me to repeat, verbatim, more than 200 words, which of course I could not do. I was forced to work more than 60 hours a week, without a day off for nearly a year. My predecessor, who was fortunate to work remotely for more than a year, quit after being forced to work in-house for less than a month. We both suffered serious health events that continue to this day for both of us. Fortunately, the boss was sacked after my stroke. Unfortunately, the department closed and I lost my job before someone competent could replace her."
bad,"Assisting the customers is great and the training was incredible, but when you get on the phones, you are given time constraints to assist members. The time is unrealistic to truly help the customers and so the members suffer as you are given time constraints."
bad,"If you are an introvert, you will fit right in.  Very hard to fit in with the clicky tight knit employees. Nobody talks to you.  They create a very alienated atmosphere, not conducive to team building or learning new things.  Unless you have nice shoes or fancy purses you will fit right in. lol"
bad,"I really don't have much to say about this company, I worked here for about 6 months and shortly after accepting a position with a different employer I found out that the contract with United Health group has ended. I am not surprised since this companies staff and management was very unorganized, and at times unprofessional."
bad,"Shortly after being acquired by Optum Health in October 2014, MedSynergies began outsourcing its corporate accounting staff in ernest.  There's not much positive to say about any company that outsources American jobs to low wage, foreign nations, and MedSynergies is no exception.  It doesn't matter what its mission statement is.  At the end of the day, MedSynergies is just another byproduct of a morally bankrupt health care delivery system that badly needs its value system realigned with the Hippocratic oath.  Single payer health care will ultimately become an inevitability with slash and burn companies like these pulling the wagon."
bad,I really dont have a positive comment about my tenure at UHC at this time. I have grown very frustrated with the fact that I am doing allot of work and not being compensated for it.
bad,"I worked there for 2 years and they were OK at the start.  I did have excellent trainers, however once I got out on the floor things soon changed.  Yes, call centers can be very stressful.  Micromanaging is terrible with them.  They set goals that are all but impossible to reach.  My direct managers were wonderful, and one business manager was great, however that manager transferred to another branch.  Her replacement was a very cold, and severe manager.  She did not seem to care about her employees, just the numbers.  Also, beware that if you work there awhile, they will start saying they are getting ready to do a large hiring campaign and the next thing you know people start getting terminated left and right for the stupidest reasons.  I would never work for this company again.  They treat their employees terribly.  The health plans that the employees get are awful.  The only good thing was the pay."
bad,"Catamaran is in disarray and they should consider a strategic management consulting firm to fix internal operational problems.  Poor internal communications, no strategic vision and operating principles.   Senior Management talks a great game but does not follow through.  Life / Work Balance issues, no internal training for job growth.  Constantly putting out fires and rework.  This has led to high employee turnover."
bad,"They are currently moving most of their positions to India."
bad,the people are great the patients are great but once they want you gone your gone
bad,"Starting from getting hired to working everyday to do anything new is extremely troublesome. Getting hired is a piece of cake if you get interview, otherwise, all hiring happens as if it were family business. So the employee composition is not very good."
bad,"This company wants perfection from employee's or they will not be employee's.  Only those who are ""pets"" of the supervisor or manage will be allowed to make mistakes and keep their job."
bad,"So called ""trainers"" chose who they would actually train and left those they did not like to fend for themselves or worse intentionally provide wrong information.  Allowed their favorites to stroll in late,  use cell phones in training room and blatantly surf the internet (which is strictly prohibited). Never once was I late or use the computer for other than work purposes,  however was repeatedly called out for doing exactly that.  The coaches have free reign and you are at their mercy during training.  They are supposed to be your resource during training, but instead demean you for asking questions. DO NOT WORK HERE!  I am turning on my resignation this upcoming week."
bad,They can't keep employee's because they have very bad management.
bad,"A typical workday at this company was stressful. It was so stressful to the point that I became physically ill.   You were more or less treated as a machine and expected to complete work that was far beyond a reasonable expectation.  I had  5 supervisors during the short time that I worked there.  My manager was located in another region than I and did not have the skills, or expertise for supervising employees.  She was unfeeling, uncaring and evil.  She made it virtually impossible to get the job done, with constant criticism and demeaning remarks."
bad,"DON'T work for this company!  Hell itself would be a much nicer, safer, and more professional place to work!"
bad,Up and Coming business utilizing its offshore partners to do most of the work.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Overall UHC is one of the worst mistakes I have made in my professional career.  The company comes off to be professional, forward thinking and innovative but on your first day of employment you realize this is not indeed the case.  They did not have  a customer service trainer when I started so my training consisted of 3 days of side by sides before beginning my new role.  They manage everything by spreadsheets so you can only imagine how inaccurate most information is in this company.  They do not have anyone that manages call queues, attendance, call outs, service level, or any basic call center functions.  This has been by far the worst place I have EVER been employed and I regret the day I accepted the offer.  Very little opportunity for advancement, favoritism is clear and present.  Management, I am not sue if you can even call it management.  Everyone from the VP down lacks basic call center knowledge, hopefully someone will come in and help them get it together because if not they will surely run this place into the ground.  "
bad,"No training! When a mistake was made due to the lack of training, you would be put on a corrective action plan. Never had time for lunch and definitely had enough work to do overtime but was never allowed to so the work kept piling up. No communication between myself and my supervisor. Wouldn't address any errors early on so that I had the opportunity to make the correction which led to more of the Corrective Action Plan. stated he wanted me to come to him if I had a problem and when I did I was made to feel inadequate about asking for help and put it on the Corrective Action Plan. Lack of loyalty to the company due to knowing you could be gone at the drop of the hat. I prefer smaller companies to work for. Think twice about accepting a job. Make sure you read all the reviews."
bad,You're more than likely just a number to this company and it shows. I quit within 6 months.
bad,I worked for a division of UHC that had been an independent company before being acquired by UHC earlier in the year. (Care Improvement Plus)
bad,"I wanted my experiene at UHC to be a pleasant one based on what I perceived during my interview. However, I was there for 3 yrs., and it was horrible. Yes, there was alot of different computer programs to learn, lots of meetings, etc., but the issue was the management. I either had to watch my back because of the insecurities of one of my co-workers or had to contend with my manager picking on me for some unrelated work issue. I was not on anxiety medication when I started working at this company, but I was when I left. I have worked in the healthcare industry for many years, but never seen anything like this. People in my department were dropping like flies...leaving left and right. Tranferring out of the department or leaving the company. The worst part is that upper management knew about everything going on, but chose to do nothing about it...I got out. I might say, with both my dignity and my integrity intact. Good luck to those of you who survive the work ethics environment at UHC. Bless you. . ."
bad,"For the first years that I was there, there was fair treatment, very good support, and a fine working environment. With more Federal regulations, UHC decided to cut down on what they were doing with the in house sales team, and then bring on independent contractors and other parties. This resulted in loss of business to myself, usually with the same product."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. I am a current employee and all they care about is meeting metrics. Not about servicing the members of the plan, and the metrics required are ridiculous. People get placed on special projects based off of who they know instead of merit while others are always stuck on back to back calls and numerous ques while others only have a few. They don't care about their employees and how they feel about the job as long as metrics are met. And I have never worked for a place that makes so many mistakes (sending out confusing letters to the elderly) ""mistankingly"" or not sending out id cards to new members after aep causing call volume to spike and then forcing employees to work mandatory overtime. Maybe if they treated employees better they would be more willing to work overtime on their own without being forced. Overall, this is a horrible place to work due to this job I am now taking medication for stress and depression and hope that I soon find something else. Save yourself don't apply."
bad,"Nasty supervisor in the Dental Dept of the PHX UHC. BAD, BAD, BAD. Lots of nasty girl"
bad,"The company has fallen apart. Was fired after 15 years of employment for no reason, they could not provide proof or even give me the time of day to talk about the issue to resolve it before letting me go. Beware"
bad,"You have to log in the computer everything you do. Problem with computer? Log in the time."
bad,"In many places a person works one has to socialize. However like most places...United Health Group takes the cake on favoritism, harassment as well as discriminatory comments. Indeed there are a multitude of advancement opportunities however they're there for only the certain few that ""fit in"". This is not a diverse place of work nor is there anyone one to assist on said issues that arise and that includes HR."
bad,"Promotes on good old boy system . If you report an issue you will be fired . They offer benefits, but if you use them you still get an occurrence. Corporate office is wonderful however they branches are ran with unqualified people who will cod anything to keep there job."
bad,"Managers get paid extra based on YOUR productivity. So, they work you like a dog and write you up if you don't meet goals. It's supposed to be hourly with no overtime but no one can get all their work down without working over secretly."
bad,Focus is always on time productivity and bottom line never on client care Management changes priorities so often that it is best just to ignore the current priorities because they will change soon
bad,"The Optum division of UHG is a stressful and unsupportive company to work for. I had three managers in 2 years and was moved to another group a month before the position and many others were eliminated. While I learned a lot working there, the company is not living its stated values and is totally focused on the stakeholder value and short term gains, not the customers and patients they should be serving."
bad,This by far is the worse company I’ve ever worked for! This company cares nothing about their employees. Everyday working here is worse than the last. Looking forward to my last day! My days are numbered.
bad,"RUN...The Other Way....Go to a different company. Management keeps you in fear. They pay well, but that is it.The company is too large and to many systems to navigate through. Just look the other way!"
bad,"I packed boxes of medication for 4.5 years and couldn't find room to advance in the company due to horrible management. I worked 50 hours a week for 6 days out of the week. On my day off, I just slept due to exhaustion. It wasn't always like that but over the years, the job took a toll on me and I quit to go back to school in hopes of finding a better job that had advancement opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"This company has poor management, low pay and have a very high turn over rate.  Make this the last place you apply. I wanted to relocate and thought this would be a good job but was sadly mistaken."
bad,Do not apply with the idea of being treated fairly because you are treated like a 2 year old! Being told your every move! They even dictate when u use the restroom and how long you are allowed to use it! Sad but true!!!
bad,"so much for keeping the jobs in america. they should be ashamed of themselves. all they care about is making money."
bad,The place sucked completely. They kept training us for more and more difficult procedures and greater responsibility. They didn't increase our pay to keep up with what they wanted us to do.
bad,"I would not suggest working for this company if you are looking for a career choice. They make you use your vacation time when business is slow so you end up eating is away a day or two at the time, From the time you are hired they try to fire you. Hostile work environment."
bad,"Muita cobrança pra pouca remuneração, sem beneficios"
bad,"Good compensation and health insurance, you are also able to work from home but the environment is too high pressured and you do not get credit when you have done a good job, you are likely to be micro-managed, co-workers will slander you when you are not there, not very conducive for minority racial groups. Do not let them give you a recommendation for your next job, their recommendation will make you lose the position"
bad,Management was my worst enemy at this job. I liked the job but there was so much that should have been done that wasn’t and they do not treat their employees well.
bad,"No opportunity for advancement. I was there 5 years and had great metrics, even worked at home but couldn’t advancement. I worked day shift but it was still super hard to get away from weekends!! Everything you do depends on basically if your supervisor likes you. If you will make it depends on again If your supervisor likes you. The pay isn’t bad tho and great benefits."
bad,"As an employee, I felt more like an unappreciated customer. Their policy is to send a lot of emails daily involving changes to practices (many irrelevant to your actual job). They expect you to retain the information while you are actively taking calls. When they bring to your attention that you are not following a change in practice, they reprimand you. Of course you tell them you are unaware of the change and their response is always, ""we sent an email about it."""
bad,"Bias, unfair and lots of back biting... management is sneaky and talks down to employees! Threatens and asks employees to do dishonest surveys. Awesome company but management is making many good quality employees resent coming to work each day"
bad,"Terrible - work environment sitting in a cubical and being yelled at if you went to the bathroom.  Managers were nasty and threatening.  When I started working there 68 employees in 3 months it was over 300 people.  Daily people quitting or the police being called to escort people out.  "
bad,There is no coaching and developing with management. They have peers coach you if you do something wrong but that individual could have same opportunities themselves. Management sits in meetings all day or at their desk listening to calls.
bad,Management didn’t know their jobs. They didn’t seem to care much about obtaining the correct procedures unless you reached out to someone higher. UHC needs to get rid of all Management in C&S and start all over
bad,"Culture is not just competitive, they are toxic, does not consider your safety, management who are usually nurses are managing professionals ie behavioral health providers. VP and CEO’s do not care. Will encourage you to find new jobs if you voice your concerns."
bad,Company is too big to care for its employers. Benefits are not great. No moving up the latter after so many years. Every year the raise's are the same
bad,"Management  is terrible,  never promotes from within, unless your a friend of a person in management.  Don't  even have to have knowledge of the business."
bad,I have worked at United Health Group for almost 13 years and have been recently laid off. I believe with a fortune 500 company their tenured employees should be valued enough that management tries to look for other areas in which that employee (being let got to budget cuts) is qualified and can be placed there. Letting employees go after being employed for over a decade due to budget cuts is morally wrong. However Florida is a right to work state so morality does not negate how a company should conduct business.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"No growth opportunities, no communication, over worked under paid, leadership not knowledgeable, no one listens but claim to listen. Company only cares about money not its employees. Underpaid when first started after having experience. Training is like sink or swim. Looking to grow not take 10 steps back. If u can work in chaos, UHC is for you!"
bad,"I know just the sound of UnitedHealthcare, sounds like a great place to work but it’s not. They’re disorganized and the supervisor are unprofessional. The pay is good but could be better compared to most. United benefits are terrible for it to be a insurance company. Work and life balance does not exist."
bad,"No guidance, no support from management.  Put on a floor with no co-workers.  No team-building.  Nothing but WebEx meetings to churn data and ideas.  They pay well, but it's not worth it."
bad,"Most disorganized company I’ve ever worked for. I never do these reviews, so take my word for it. The management only cares about themselves and unrealistic numbers."
bad,"A typical day of working with management was confusion, they were always changing are working assignments' and made the job hard and miserable.  The environment was very unstable with calls and enrollments"
bad,"I absolutely hated working for Optum/UHC. I worked as a telephonic case manager. The job was nothing as it was described. It is only about numbers and how much money you can ""save"" the company. You are basically a telemarketer, NOT a nurse. We had to call people and try to keep them on the phone. We had scripting we had to follow and read. Every little thing you do is monitored. If you don't get enough people to answer then phone or enroll in the program then you lose your work at home days. No work life balance. Don't do it!!"
bad,"Very stressful. Angry customers who don't get their rides to medical facilities. Demanding. Lyft drivers don't show up for patients, transportation companies are not  always flexible for immediate needs.  Expected to find rides for wheelchair and gurney at a moment's notice when they call you the same day or after hours and transportation is uncooperative.  Supervisors quit all the time, as well as employees.  You are given a bad grade for not making statements you didn't even know about.  Supervisors are too tied up.  There is no management or any Employee representative to solve problems. HR is a 1-800 number in Minnesota.  Is impossible to resolve any issue.  HR audited me and put me as part-time in error for 3 months, took 3 x the benefit fee out of my payroll.  Took me 2 months to get a refund of the money they STOLE from me, had to file a case with Dept. of Labor to get my back pay. No leadership, no responsible Managers, employees are expected to be robots,  MANDATORY overtime, BAD CHAIRS AND COMPUTERS AND PHONE EQUIP. as well as a very bad phone and computer system that freezes or doesn't work."
bad,"A typical day at work is taking back to back phone calls for the majority of the day. If you step away from your desk, management or work force will question you as to why. Very hard to get help online if you work remotely. You feel like just a number. Your number of years of dedication to the company mean nothing to them. UHC only cares about profit. They do not care about their employees or the providers who accept their insurance."
bad,"Horrid leadership team! No communication from direct supervisor. I was unable to learn from osmosis, which was the expectation by leadership. I would not recommend this company to anyone!"
bad,Expect no integrity and bad morals with management. Slave mentality workers that shuck and jive to stay relevant. Also bullying environment and prejudice pretense is strong. Toxic environment.
bad,"I was promised room for advancement, training, work/life balance.  None of which I got.  They allow working from home. However its restricted to maybe 3 days in the office.  In my case I got 5 days in the office per week, while the rest of my team has the flexibility of coming to work 2 times per week. One Sr. member of my team came in to the office 2 or 3 times per year. Since she worked from home she would yell and scream at coworkers when things don't go her way. She had privilege over others on the team. The team manager would support only the Sr. level folks on the team.  The rest get scolded daily and micromanaged.  This created a very difficult environment to work in.  I left for a Dr.'s Appt. after work one day and they clocked my BP at over 200.  The nurse-tech kept asking me if I was OK."
bad,"Greedy, brow beating, goals increasing daily, never enough no matter how many extra hours you work for them. The direct supervisors were very empathetic but the corporate rich big wigs were relentlessly slave-driving money hungry crooks with no humane bones in their bodies."
bad,My skill sets where not used and they kept breaking their promises for learning opportunities and advancement.  My manager repeatedly came down on my for things that I did not do.
bad,The environment is toxic and cut throat. Management lies and manipulates situations at the expense of the people who come in and work hard. HR does nothing to protect the employees and sides with management whether right or wrong.
bad,United is a good place to work under fair management. The M&R Department managers are unfair and unorganized. I enjoyed my work load but I was not happy coming into work. Poor management at its greatest.
bad,"Since there are hundreds of thousands of employees, the chances of getting promoted are completely contingent on knowing someone. I have been called for less than 10% of the jobs I've applied for, of which I have been fully qualified, and gotten 0 of those promotions. This company pays pitifully. In almost a decade of service, I have received about $3 raise to make less than a newly hired employee makes. Benefits are terrible, expensive health insurance, no college reimbursement to speak of. The only perk is the potential to work at home."
bad,"Work-life balance was one of the positive things about working there and why I believe many stay, but I also hear this varies quite a bit from department to department.  Many longer-term employees I developed relationships shared their reason for staying was to just ""riding it out until retirement.""  Many of them haven't worked anywhere else and don't have anything to compare it to. It's the most toxic work environment I have ever been in. It's a very hierarchical culture that is not open to ANY upward feedback. Many peers were great to work with, but that wasn't enough for me to want to stay. I wouldn't even recommend someone I dislike to this role."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,They don't bother to explain how this works. I would get authorization number when you call but it didn't mean you were covered.  Then 6 months later let you know it wasn't covered. Would not recommend then.
bad,"Management was a mess. Worked during Open Enrollment season, tons of unanswered questions and the 6 week training is a joke. Would not recommend...at all."
bad,"I was with UHC for just a few months.  I was hired for one position and put into another that I knew nothing about.  I asked management for assistance and more training, but never received it."
bad,"Management is very poor. Stifling atmosphere, very dry, no fun.  Everything is written in confusing, not completed, job aids. There is a long, drawn out, useless job aid for everything. Don’t bother asking a question, just read. Management has no clue either. Just read the job aid. If you follow the job aid, do as instructed, but the member doesn’t like it, it will be blamed on you. Armchair quarterback management will always blame everything on you, yet their ability to provide direction is very poor. Awful company."
bad,After 20+ years with this company it was decided by local management my pay was hurting the budget.  About 10 very long term employees were booted out to make the budget look good.  One lady had 35 years with UHG and was laid off and not due to lack of work but as a way to get rid of her.  I had 20+ years and had never had a negative review and all of a sudden I was not meeting expectations.  Prior to the bad reviews I was told to find a job or I would be put on corrective action and ultimately be fired.  Loyalty and dedication means nothing to these managers.  Making themselves look good is what everything is about.  When I was unable to find another position in the company (due to my current pay and pay is not cut with UHG if you are moved to another position) I made the decision to walk rather than be degraded and a blemish on my work record.  If you are looking for a life long career run from this company.
bad,They promote the company as a place to grow but growth is almost impossible. They bring people outside of the company in instead of promoting from within.
bad,Optum is such a joke and management was as well. They were very unprofessional but didn't want you to come back at them unprofessional and disrespectful. They had set an unrealistic standard in which management couldn't reach themselves. Management tells so many lies.
bad,This position was stressful and time consuming. It consumed most of my life especially during holidays Thanksgiving-New Year 60-70 hour weeks. Was made to switch positions numerous times with no communications or review and let go for company downsizing rather than being offered different role when other areas inner company were still hiring.
bad,"Pay scale is too low for a high cost of living area, especially in light of the high work load. UHC is not employee or customer oriented.  It's goal is to save money.. Period.  For a multi million dollar healthcare company, they do not even offer their employees decent medical plans.  I don't recommend this company."
bad,"They don’t care about their employees, they don’t have an understanding of work and life balance, the company only thinks about its money not employees or customers"
bad,"The company is a mess. It a wonder it is still staying afloat. People come and go at will, My manager ruled by fear and allowed for open discrimination."
bad,"Assessed patients and documented their medical histories "
bad,"One of the worst jobs I have ever had.  Snobby workers, very clicky, not welcoming to newcomers.  Horrible training, and worse yet no support if you do not catch on quickly.  Managers and trainers make you feel stupid.  Zero support.  So glad when I finally found another job and left that place.  I cried at work, cried on my lunch, really had to say prayers through my work day just because my fellow workers were so nasty."
bad,"From working for this company for a couple of years, I've learned they care mostly about making their money. They do not care about the well being of their employees. They penalize you for using ""personal time"", for example using the bathroom during your shift too many times you will get bitched at. The health insurance they provide sucks. You pretty much have to pay for everything. Pretty pathetic considering they are a health insurance company. Oh and you don't get sick time. They give you a certain number of paid time off each year but it is all considered time off combining vacation and sick. You also cannot call out more than 3 times within a year then they place you on warning and you can't apply for other positions or get your quarterly bonuses."
bad,"United Health can be a good place to work if you are in the right part of the company."
bad,"Lack of communication from the top down creates negative work environment, which is a problem company-wide. Raises are pitiful and managers seem to be clueless on how to motivate and keep employees engaged.  Additionally, there are Always re-orgs and layoffs and the company does a poor job training and onboarding new employees.  Lastlty processes are inefficient and dreadfully tedious. There is an  extreme need for  new or better technology and automation and better skilled management."
bad,"Great place to work dun enviorment ooen door policy, great people. They have the portion where your able to eat. I just dont like the no phones on the floor I understand why but when you have kids ot makes you worried bevajse what of noone can get ahold of anyone on the work phone and its an emergency?! Overall they are a great company."
bad,"not applicable I haven't worked here in over 2 years. "
bad,"The company itself has perks, but the management is horrible. They offer ""opportunities to grow"" but when you have busted your butt and get recognized for it for over a year and still can't grow, there is a problem."
bad,If you're on time you're late. Work continuously till the scheduled break time in which the break room is a vending machine and a TV with either CNN or the weather channel only. Conversations amongst co-workers must be brief due to the need to keep on schedule. Cannot leave early or stay late unless for business need. Check your email for communications before or after your shift to stay informed; there isn't time given during your shift to read/ reply to any.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"I was on the Outbound team., and had to take inbound calls during high demand hours. A lot of favoritism was shown on my team. The favorites changed from day to day. Constantly changing seats. I had to move my computer, and all of my desk items myself. Usually got an email to change seats, and was given max 15 -30 minutes to relocate to your new desk"
bad,"Way too many clicks, if your in good with management you will be fine but if you challenge them you will be made miserable and let go. They single people out."
bad,Manager unsure of some significant protocols; bombarded with state requirements that interfere with member care; for-profit is a hard place to work as a social worker; you really need two of you to do a decent job
bad,"They monitor every second of your work day. They count and ask why you took as long as you did in the restroom. They ask why your mouse was idle for as long as it was. A lot of people developed anxiety disorders working here, and their stress leave was denied often. A lot of people quit and were more than happy to be fired."
bad,"Working for this company was incredibly stressfull when working for he Wellness Team and for Brokerage Services.  "
bad,The amount of work is not acceptable for the pay and for an insurance company they don't offer good or affordable options to their employees. Coworkers are pleasant and helpful though.
bad,unappreciated at all levels. recognized company holidays are not permitted to be taken or in lieu of days permitted. Very inflexible. poor benefit structure given a health care company.
bad,This company is a very stressful company to work for. The pay is not really worth it but it will pay the bills. Supervisors arent really on your side.
bad,"Hired as an administrative assistant, yet did work such as cleaning store room, picking up after sales staff, transporting and lifting heavy boxes (sometimes around 70 lbs.). I felt like I worked at Merry Maids and Ace Warehouse. Did little administrative work. Supervisor (director) did not care and made no mention of the cleaning and lifting duties during interview (felt she was deceitful).  No one stays in this position."
bad,There was no teamwork. Everyone was left struggling. Management had no interest in providing support or even understanding roadblocks. The environment is top down where individual contributors are treated like cattle and essentially excluded except to provide management information to make decisions they are ill equipped to make
bad,"I enjoyed my time there. But CHI had a lawsuit against Medsynergies, and in turn, everyone was laid off. I loved my first 2 bosses, but then I was given an Inexperienced boss."
bad,I enjoyed my time at United Health Care. I learned a lot and the supervisor and manager were very helpful. I learned how to manage other people and learned the techniques to train others.
bad,"Compensation was ok. All Management does not support fully if you need to work from home and care for an ill family member, but they are happy for you to take FML (which is without pay)."
bad,"Wipro has bed bugs that are eating the employees daily For months And no one seems to care,A distracting source while working."
bad,"Too many systems, too many regulations, too few left that understand how any of it works together.   They kept laying off valuable employees to boost profits and then replacing them with new hires that knew nothing.  So many claims systems & products due to mergers....  not a very well organized company."
bad,"not to sure about the professional ethic of this organization, I experienced too many issues during my time there. I was not able to sanctioned from negativity and too many holes in the way policies are enforced"
bad,Would not recommend poor management and very unprofessional settings. Instead of the supervisors working to help you they are very selfish and not accommodating.  This field is a burnout field and I suggest you go to a company that does not add work to the already stressful work environment!
bad,"Senior leadership in Florida is very clickish and unprofessional. It is not what you know but who you know. Unfair mgmt practices. Poor training, no support from management. Workload volume is too high, as a contract manager expect to reply to over 100 emails a day and return over 30 phone calls. You will never catch up, no matter how hard you work, long hours you put in or how organized you are. Leadership is aware of the workload volume and they do not care, their response to the volume is work faster and smarter.  It is a burn out position. There is no pay for performance. Expect a 1% - 2% annual salary increase. And you can forget about a bonus, $500.00 is not a bonus."
bad,Medsynergies Omaha is  terrible!  There is inadequate training. I witnessed a good manager be forced out of her position as well as hourly employees. This location is terrible
bad,"Pathetic management, No proper vision in senior management.Appraisal process is serious joke here nowadays. no proper 360 feedback . Cant trust the management . One appraisal cycle u will get good feedback other total opposite without any valid justifications. senior management is not serious. I don't suggest people to ruin their career here. pls donot join this company."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Honestly, I worked here and loved the amount of money I was making but I made a mistake twice ( I was new, mistakes happen!) and instead of ""coaching and teaching"" me they decided me and a few others weren't worth is and let us go. "
bad,This company has no idea what they are doing and they don't consider their employees. It's all about the investors. I don't like not knowing day to day if I'll have a job and I'm in the top 10% of sales.
bad,"This was my second employer after college.  Good start, good experience, until job relocated from Horsham pa. to Philadelphia Pa, Management supported personal growth and advancement."
bad,"A typical day lasts over 8 hours. The management works you to the bone, to death. Good pay, good benefits, but your body will fall apart as you work."
bad,"They were once called the Family Friendly Company but for those of us who work/worked for them, we Never thought so. We know it's a call center but they put the employee's health at risk each and every time; like the time I was forced to drive to work with a cast on my foot, against my doctor's wishes, with four broken toes, on my driving foot to boot (no pun intended) because as the leave administrator put it (Sedgwick), I was not hired to drive, mine is a sedentary position; so as you can imagine, I had to fork out hundreds of dollars in cab service...I was none to happy and made a hasty retreat from this company."
bad,I worked at this position for almost two years.  I am not a fan of huge call centers and jobs that grade you on call metrics instead of the work and achievements.  The management was great.  They were forced to work within the ridiculous call metrics and hoops the reps had to endure as well.  It was a system designed to set you up for failure.
bad,"Rotina de um setor de analise de contas, voltado para reembolso, com prazos a cumprir e auxiliar os clientes internos e externos."
bad,"I started with UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans in February. We were to be trained and ready to go April 1st when they took over the TRICARE contract from TriWest. What a mess!  Our training was very poor, which is an understatement, and we didn't have a clue what we were doing as Referral Management Specialists.  6 months later it is not any better.  14+ hours of OT are required every week and there is no end in sight.  Management makes decisions without knowing the consequences and just makes matters worse. Very poor hiring decisions are made, performance issues are not addressed and most people are looking for other jobs.  Stay away from the Referral Management Specialist/Coordinator job!"
bad,I went to Catamaran very optimistic and open minded however every day just seemed to get worse. The management is horrible. The is no communication and I feel like I have no resources when there is an issue that needs to be fixed.  They have a really long road to go to get up to par with other PBM's.
bad,"The training was absolutely useless.  6 weeks of information that we hardly used for our jobs.  We got thrown to the wolves in week 7 taking phone calls that we had no business taking.  Our assistants and our trainer were rude when we asked questions.  Then we find out that the training department has people training things they've never done or even learned whatsoever before they teach it.  Once we realized exactly how deficient we were in our training we asked for more help.  We got yelled at and basically laughed at.  The ""new"" computers we were given we terrible.  We were in system outage almost 90% of the time as a team.  Before I started feeling even remotely confident in taking the phone calls I started getting talked to about hold time, handle time, and every bit of metrics they could shove down my throat.  They claim to be about customer service and caring about the people they serve but they clearly don't care.  The majority of my phone calls were people calling back trying to get something corrected that someone else in the company messed up.   I can understand why too! NO ONE was properly trained on ANYTHING.  It's like a guy with one eye that has cataracts trying to teach a kid to read a book that has half of the words marked through and missing pages.  It just doesn't make any sense."
bad,"I worked for them for over a year, managing  large team. Most of the team members were very good at their job though the HR Department made it difficult to discipline those that were not. "
bad,"Long time employee, Provider Services at a sub-branch called Oxford. Call centers are designed like Pyramid Schemes. They spend a lot of money to train you and there's really no benefit in replacing you. There are jobs out there, but the likelihood of getting them is poor at best. In the past year, only three other people in a call center of over 100 managed to move up or sideways into other positions."
bad,Advancement is sporadic and not on a permanent basis. I would recommend Aegis as a temporary position only.
bad,"Phones, interacting with providers and mbrs regarding prior authorizations."
bad,I was in need of a job and this one came at the right time.
bad,"If you dont mind being treated like a robot and micro-mananged in every aspect of your work day being a customer service representative you'll like this job. The calls coming in are 6 seconds apart from the ending of your last call..so if you like being overworked and given irrational goals that your supervisor is constantly on you to meet, you'll love working for this company."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"large company with high demand and critical deadlines with no support, and very manual."
bad,Given the training in the first 5 weeks to answer inbound phone calls and HIPPA rules and regulation laws was smart I feel for newly licensed agents selling these policies. I had every intention of making my past exsperience selling these products for the past 5 years bear fruit in the feild. After being on the phones for two weeks it seemed as if I only recieved more service related calls and knowing that with these products solicitation was outa the question with the Health Portabilty and Accountabilty Act in place. Knowing my job and responsibilty as a licensed agent I complied with all compliance rules and laws with one question of some questionable non residence licenses that would have caused me to loose my license if I sold in a state I was not licensed? Of course I feel my oppurtunity to make more income with this company would have been more if I would have recieved inbound enrollment calls instead of only service related calls.
bad,"This was one of my worse employers. They could NEVER pay me to come back. Culture of greed, who you know, and horrible medical benefits. Director was great and mentored her staff and gave flex time but the company as a whole is horrible"
bad,"Great pay and benefits, yet astounding turn-over. All managers must have granduated from top-notch schools of bullying - they have no nursing ability and no management ability. I believe they are a reflection of the ugly corporate culture - it was by far the worst year of my life as an RN."
bad,NO WORK-LIFE BALANCE... caps barely do that warning justice. Despite trying to advance it's culture (Our United Culture - the Way Forward) this company has a very tight grip on it's performance at all costs cultural history.
bad,"Great benefits but poor management. Management have no leadership training, you our promoted on who you know, people that have tenure and more qualifications at the company are frequently over looked for lead and supervisor positions. Overtime is sometimes mandatory by management with little excuse for missed days. Not that racially diversed in the pharmacy center due to their failure to recognize it. Pharmacists are hard working but most of the pharmacy techs and customer service reps are unfairly treated due to the factors I mentioned above."
bad,"I worked at a company that was purchased by UHC. The first year was fine, but then they started trying to smash us into their mold. An earlier poster was correct, if someone doesn't like you they are allowed to make your life miserable. My boss was laid off and then they changed my job title without telling me, the new boss gave me a bad performance review because she didn't know me and failed to read my self-eval detailing my accomplishments. I worked there for more than 11 years, mostly before the purchase. UHC took a good little company, ruined it and then closed it, making the non-nurse personnel lose their jobs."
bad,"There is no work life balance. The work expectation is ridiculous. I worked past my work schedule constantly. I had a great supervisor, but the work requirements are a lot. Then they laid many of us off due to budget restructuring."
bad,"Complete and total nightmare, training is ridiculous and way too long, awful management and poor company culture, the pay should be way higher, and the claims calls will drive you to the bottle."
bad,"I have been at UHC for about 13 years and have always enjoyed my work here but no more.  Upper management is terrible, systems fail constantly.  We no longer have time to service the members because of so much pressure to make production.  I have always had top notch reviews, and my quality and production have kept up. However we now have a miserable work day.  They have placed road blocks everywhere and it's nearly impossible to get anything done.   I used to recommend UHC as a great employer but those days are over. I am currently searching for other employment."
bad,"Empresa instável e desorganizada."
bad,"I had to go to my managers boss to find out why the contract was ended. For the 3 months I was there, I was not given much guidance. By the time I understood what was required in the position, the contract ended."
bad,"Management not good. Older employees picked off one by one. "
bad,Not supported by leadership - you are supposed to find your own consulting gigs without real support to learn their organization or help in networking with internal clients
bad,I was micromanaged immensely.   The pay was fair.  The work atmosphere was stressful at best.  The job description wasnt close to accurate.  Not time in the day to take a bathroom break hardly.   Wouldn't do it again.
bad,"I worked for United for a year and was let go in the middle of the day with no reason wat so ever. My contract was terminated without cause. I would not recommend a coder take a contracted job with them, there is no guarantee of job stability."
bad,"Try for yourself, one has to form your own opinion of the company. They have a great cultural ambassador summit. But do not look out ;for their employees sit is more management."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,Honestly this environment is the cheapest and worst.. Outdated environment and lack of respect from management and hire ups. The procedures are outdated and sometimes lack compassion!  Long term employees complain of lack of growth and communication. No one on one meetings or constructive criticism.
bad,"This location in Miami,  by dadeland mall.  Horrible management and always harassing the employee.  Very stressful environment.  Horrible experience I would never want to go back"
bad,"Interesting, interesting and more interesting but short lived. Training techniques need very much more improvement. The computer system was not very user friendly. A very challenging environment."
bad,"Remote employees at Optum360 are basically invisible.  It feels like working for 2 different companies.  All the monthly presentations by upper management support the mission statement and believe in the company.  However, days to day remote employees do not get the recognition spoken about by the upper management, I don't believe they know the real day to day culture.  Example, the ""Bravo"" rewards are given by managers to other managers, the actual remote employees are disposable.  Being remote, there is no real team building are to be given to employees from other employees, however, the approved Bravo awards (with financial incentive or gift) are just approved and posted among the managers/directors.  I had notices that other employees gave me a bravo award, but they were never posted or amounted to so much as a Starbucks coffee.  "
bad,"Training is long and grueling, they make you feel like you could be an exec, but they tell everyone that. Then after a few months they introduce you to what you’re really doing, which is listening to people complain at you all day. Very stressful job, I was either worried I was quoting people incorrectly or I was being yelled at because someone else did. They make you feel like you’ll  make a difference in people’s lives, it’s really just a call center where you get yelled at on the phone in a cubicle all day. I don’t recommend this to anyone with anxiety or easily stressed out."
bad,The starting pay is lower than some fast food restaurants in the area despite UHC record profits and high paid CEO. They are consistently automating their jobs and sending them overseas. I originally worked for the company as a contractor and then was hired on permanently which in return meant I would receive even lower pay. Even if you make it to your yearly raise they tend to be below the cost of living in the area  which means every year your making less for yourself. Stick with company's that know your worth as an employee and avoid this one.
bad,"They were over working us as T2 claims processors even though they had enough of us to take calls and process claims. We would only get about 7 seconds between calls on a good day and about 5-6 seconds between calls on a bad day. "
bad,"This place sucks, only good for a place holder until you find something better. Very stressful, you meet your numbers and they still don't hold up what they promise you."
bad,"I felt like favorites were chosen, and promotions and praise was given depending on favorites.  I felt my hard work and accomplishments were ignored.  This is just my personal experience from the department I was in."
bad,"Fast paced depending on the call volume.  They do volunteer work, which I love. Can be stressful at times but I enjoy helping my members. They have fun events on a regular basis."
bad,"Offers good benefits from health insurance, vision, dental and 401 savings.  All office locations are accessible.  Nice company to work except for some department."
bad,"The company has great trainers that know what they are doing.  The problem is the structure in the training curriculum and classes.  When you are out of training and on the floor, they only look at numbers and not situations.  If you are put on a dedicated team (without your choice, option, consent), then you are no longer offered the privileges like taking VTO, where you can take time off, without penalty, and be able to have a dr's appointment.  The schedule is very strict and many people CAP out because of attendance. The chance for bonus is great.  Just make sure you meet your metrics."
bad,DO NOT WORK FOR OPTUM360!! very poor management! Especially in Cash Management Department. I will never work for this company again as I left due to stress. The Rancho Cordova CA office will literally kill you.
bad,This is from my former boss. As far as improvement in your career? It is only for a chosen people. You will not really have a chance to shine because they work you to death.
bad,"I was stressed from day 1, all this company was after was how much production you do, not the actual quality of work, not the actual care of the patients. No matter how good a job you do, you will always never be good enough."
bad,Its very said when all of the top and lower manage.memt lies to protects themselves when they are wrong. But everything in the dark comes to light and God takes care of his own. not the fake christians trolling around. lole
bad,the work environment is very stressful depending on what department you go in. it is a very good paying job and it has okay benefits but they could make some adjustments
bad,"Poor communication, poor management, management does not support individual growth. "
bad,Nothing but drama inside that call center management is lazy and don't wanna help... If you're not sleeping with management you're not moving up and the fake.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,Horrible training and management from my experience. Managers cannot answer questions and just refer you to lengthy policies. It seemed like a ship adrift at see without a compass or a rudder. Could not continue to work there in good conscience.
bad,Worked there through a company called Optum. Did not like how they changed shifts on people and rearranged schedules. I liked most of the supervisors but the managers not so much.
bad,"No one in charge, management immature and unprofessional.    "
bad,"I was excited to begin my job at UnitedHealth Group, but received a phone call from my manager, who hired me, that he was changing jobs effective that day.  From that point forward I was bounced around and was morally beat down.  The job I thought I agreed upon never came to fruition and I left after a year."
bad,"First Of All.... Training was only 2 weeks & a half with a lot of expected crammed information that we’re expected to know as soon as you’re out of training. Second of all.... something new on the systems continued to fail each day that we attended training. Once we got on the floor, it was directly to the phones. No shadowing or anything. We were told to assist on the floor because they were “short staffed” & when we asked for help, it was like we were expected to know this stuff with a half you know what training. It was the worst experience ever!!"
bad,The best thing about this place is their cafeteria. The turnover rate is horrendous. You are paid just enough to get by and the hours are horrible. I don't regret leaving this place.
bad,"the environment was good at first until they made the wrong people bosses, coworkers started dating, and it just became a high school of rumors, messy old women, poor management, mangers talking about who dating who, etc. worse place ever in some job areas!"
bad,to much rapid change -- every job has change but its over the top there.. no real support from managers... i learned a lot about medicare and medicaid
bad,This company has a highturnover for a reason. Theres great benefits offered at this company but the employees aren't. There is favoritism and abuse of power sometimes. Just be cautious of this company.
bad,The job is okay! i would like to see some changes within this job itself. I would like to see differences with how it works and the support for the rep.
bad,"Business detail I work in the Optum, the mail order pharmacy. Everything is completely held together by duct tape (not literally), but figuratively. Nothing is as it seems. Pay is terrible based at similar positions throughout UHC. Mandatory OT, and complete lack of training."
bad,"Took over 3 months to pay workers for one event, was also un organized while finding work. Also didnt really care about people that were there."
bad,"I worked for the company for 2 years as a call center member services rep. We were treated poorly by the company where the hardest part of the job was actually showing up. They did not care about your life outside of work. They just wanted you to be there. Their occurrences lasted one year on your file per occurrence. Once you reached 5, you could be terminated. Which is absurd. That included occurrences for you even being one minute late from your lunch or break despite what circumstances might have played in to you being late. They didn't care."
bad,"Not a company for an american to work for."
bad,"poor management at a professional level, the employees look really unhappy,bad training and not enough work materials"
bad,During training they act as if they are so big on compassion when really that's just a one way deal.  No work/life balance.  Very stressful environment and too much over time at the last minute to even have a life.  I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to work there.  Need more organization and a better structure.
bad,"I used to see this company as very rewarding, professional, and beneficial. However recently, my opinion is forever changed. I have to agree with some other reviewers. You are constantly being watched, micromanaged, and treated like a child. Managers are unprofessional,  they repeat favoritism, and you even get harassed from time to time. You get treated as if you are a slave. You also have to expect overtime. Even when you cannot work it you can also get in trouble. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,I was hired on permanently after only a month but now 6 months later the department is being laid off. Was hired as a Provider Installation Rep but I couldn't tell you what that is bc the only work we've had since I've been here is processing return mail. Almost everything we were told about the work/security have been wrong. I turned down other more secure positions bc I was told this was a great company with plenty of room for advancement . Not only are we being laid off but the company is still hiring ppl just to turn around & lay them off. We were told yes you will be laid off but we are not at liberty to give you a date. That is unacceptable. My supervisor resigned the week after we learned about the lay offs & we were split up amongst various teams awaiting an end date. Most of the supervisors don't know our job role & mostly work from home so we are left to figure things out amongst ourselves
bad,"Packing up Prescription Orders for Customers. I learned how to send different Medication, different way to the Customers. The Management team doesn't follow through when things happen between Co-Workers. I enjoyed working with some of my Co-Workers. Some of them it just gets me wondering how they got Hired. The Hardest part of that job, was working sometimes 10-12 hour shifts. But, mostly working about 4 hours before your 1st Break. The Most Enjoyable part of that job, is the Paycheck."
bad,Claims to be a caring company but could not care less. Behind the shiny PR it is a putrid Gulag. The Processing divisions have an unhealthy obsession with Metrics and any humanistic tendencies are ruthlessly rooted out. If you like turning off your cognitive abilities and sitting rooted in a cubicle hitting keys automatically you can do well and actually prosper. If you don't do so well on cruise control the place can be soul destroying.
bad,"I worked for UnitedHealthcare for a few years in the sales department. My first year at the company was great but our upper management team was laid off and when the new management came in, they got rid of anyone that reported to the previous management team. They continually lied about our future with the company. Going so far as to allow my direct supervisor to post a job opening for our team while all the while they knew they were going to lay everyone off. Our director was so cowardly that she didn’t even show up the day we were laid off. She came in the next day so that she wouldn’t have to face anyone. I used to have respect for this company but not anymore."
bad,"Being with this company has been an exceptional place to work. I found on my time while I am there, I meet new people and unusual ones as well. The property is 18 acres and I patrol in a security vehicle ( some times walk it), and check doors around 8 different buildings. Sometimes I transport patients to different buildings then walk them into the hospital areas. I also bring forms, various supplies to the units, as requested by the staff. I also pick up valuables that patients bring like for example money, credit cards, identification cards, ...etc.. I then bring that stuff sealed in a bag to a vault/ storage room. The co workers there are very cool and I get along with them well. The management is okay, but they need to make better choices in the judgement of there employees. The hardest part of the job is confronting patients whom are aggressive, angry, and are in a fighting mood. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have permission to be able to enter the cafeteria and make a sandwich and get a bag of chips for lunch break."
bad,"This company is the blind leading the blind. They say 1 thing an do another, this place is ridicules."
bad,"There are many competitive people that want to succeed, It was stressful because it was like a high school environment. If someone didn't like you including the trainer then your experience was a terrible one. There was lots of gossip. They pay well, benefits are awesome but its not worth it for me to be in that type of setting."
bad,"I liked the work but got zero information when I joined a highly technical team, no documentation, no overview, I was supposed to pick it up by just breathing. No communication among co workers or superiors. Lots of broken promises. Kind of a big disappointment."
bad,"THE WORST EVER!!! ALL AROUND! The nervous breakdown is not worth the money. Tried to tell my non English speaking boss I could not set up my table to market Medicare because there were people with guns in a dumpster next to where I was to set up"
bad,Old company.  bathrooms need updating mice frequently come in and eat your food.  Ac and heater sometimes don’t work.  Some supervisors have favorites. People from off the street can come to use bathroom.
bad,This is BY FAR the worst company that I have ever worked for. Their systems are always broken which results in you getting non stop calls all day everyday with upset and rude customers.  They have ZERO understanding for life issues arising. They expect you to come to work in a boat if necessary or it will count against you. But they do have an unspoken buddy system between managers and their favorite employees. If you're cool with your manager then you can  get the leniency of a normal company. The pay is good but nowhere NEAR what it should be for what you have to deal with on a day to day basis.
bad,"A typical day starts with the favorites making rounds and non stop gossip about the stupidest stuff. "
bad,"doesn't pay enough for what job wants you to do. management is way too strict. The process constantly changing. Very, Very, Very poor training and expect you to know process immediately."
bad,"Do not work for this company! The Dublin office has the capacity for over 800 associates to work there, but there are less than 200 people working there. As soon as people are out of the poor training provided, they leave within six months. It is not worth the hassle, headache or the stress."
bad,"As a previous Remote Senior Coder for Optum 360/UHG for 5 years, disappointed that such an innovative corporation would treat their on-shore coders unfairly so that they could outsoure on-shore coders by deliberately failing them on inpatient audits to justify firing employee. Corporate Compliance does not defend employees but employer. Extremely disappointed by this employer."
bad,"UHC training program and trainers need a major overhaul. Not enough time allotted to work side by side with experienced call center representatives. Supervisor uses passive aggressive  approach style of management. Four long weeks of mediocre training. No training manuals to learn or reference from. After 4 weeks you're thrown directly to the call center and you're  expected to know everything. I mean everything!!"
bad,Poor communication poor training and awful atmosphere. The company is poorly managed and had to downsize.  Upper management was taking credit for others works and not giving credit to the proper employees.
bad,"The Clinical Administrative Coordinator is a great position...on paper. Worked for the company in this role for 2.5 years. In that time, more and more tasks were added. These tasks were the equivalent of actual positions. During a team meeting, a few co-workers spoke out about salaries not keeping pace with the increasing work load. The Supervisor told us, matter-of-factly, that we were overpaid. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Barely any training and basically figured out the job on my own.  When an errors or questions were raised it was criticism rather than training.  I was barely new and people were rude and unhelpful.
bad,"Low pay they don’t pay at all and never give raises, the medical benefits are horrible for"
bad,"business over all is satisfying when your are very consistent on wanting to help members with their problems. company as a whole is very unprofessional and unorganized, they pay you little money for the work that is requested of us. they throw tasks on you that you did not get hired for and if you do not agree then they will try to find all types of ways to fire you and write you up"
bad,Way too many middle management Who passed the buck down to theEntry level workers who have absolutely no control over Their mismanagement.  They're more concerned with their Public Image than with treating their employees with any decency
bad,"There really isn't anything good about a position once you reach the manager level.   You have no work-life balance, and you are in meetings 8 hours a day, and cannot adequately manage your staff."
bad,"Estrutura da empresa excelente, ambiente limpo e organizado o treinamento ministrado pela Ana excelente , profissional de tamanha integridade. Porém o call center é outra realidade , não é por competência e comprometimento  que você consegue permanecer na empresa. Os valores que a empresa prega, Integridade,compaixão , relacionamentos , inovação e performance não são praticados .Falta uma gestão realmente humanizada e comprometida com os valores da empresa  que respeitem os funcionários por sua competências e comprometimento. Que Valorizem o funcionário que veste a camisa da empresa."
bad,"I enjoyed my position within my department. However, recruiter and legal departments are by far unprofessional, noneducational, rude, and I WILL NOT EVER recommend anyone to apply for this company. Especially, dealing with the two departments I had too. They ignore all your emails, and phone calls. When they give you wrong information they do not re-inform you and they make you jump through hoops just to find the correct information and to get a hold of them. I have not ever been treated so poorly by a company before. "
bad,"As the 6th biggest company in the world, it's as corporate as corporate comes. "
bad,No room for advancement even if you meet the required metrics unless you are one of the chosen. Constantly changing supervisors or promoting non qualified fellow employees to a position of mgmt with no training. Favoritism runs rampent. I loved my job and enjoyed being able to resolve claims issues but the lack of compassion for the employees made it a dreadful place to be.
bad,"Overall good management. However, the QA management at runs on who you know, not what you know (This seems to be an isolated issue within this particular group)                                                                          ."
bad,"immediate supervisor spent more time with her personal issues than managing the team, was on her cell phone constantly with one of her children and listen very little during team or one/one meetings"
bad,"This job has the worst culture I have come across.  Every minute and second has to be accounted for, and you are constantly ""coached"" for everything not done according to their rules.  They discourage you from using the restroom outside of breaks.  You are micromanaged, surveyed, spied upon, and lectured weekly.  Anything you say on break or in the parking lot will be repeated to supervisors. I have seen grown women cry and grown men shaking in their boots due to the hostile work enviornment. There are weekly meetings/threat sessions by ""sups.""  The training is backwards and stressful.  They force you to take calls when you are only partially trained; then judge you when you give misinformation.  The only good thing is the pay, which is decent, and some of the benefits, excluding the health insurance.  Hmmm an insurance company that offers their employees horrible insurance coverage.  That says it all."
bad,Poor Management ... Too much favoritism. No room for advancement. Upper management works in another state . No supervision whatsoever. Team Leads are horrible. They pick and chose who they like.
bad,"A typical work day starts with anxiety and stress when viewing emails and what work is due soon. The training was HORRENDOUS: unorganized, lack of help. There are  TONS of ""flow charts"" that lead to unanswered questions and more confusion. Micro management. Ton of work without the pay. Numerous amounts of repetitive websites that should be consolidated. Not enough hours in a day to accomplish what is being required. The answers are NEVER consistent nor clear from management/trainer. The hardest part is trying to figure out HOW to do your job mean while becoming agitated knowing you are being timed for each movement and how long it takes to process your appeals. Management speaks to you in a condescending tone as though all you say are excuses. Metrics driven, which are displayed for peers to view  becoming discouraging to others that are not doing so well. The most enjoyable part of the day is the end of the shift and the end of the week."
bad,"If you want to job where as soon as you walk in the door you're taken and thrown on the floor without any orientation ,information or anything then this is the job for you. The supervisor does not have a clue, puts his work off on other people, makes stuff up when he does not have the answer or comes off with an attitude like you're the problem. I was told on my second day that a project had to be done because ""you know it all rolls downhill"". Upper management knows about this but will not do anything about it. I couldn't get out of there fast enough."
bad,Not flexible. Not caring. Difficult place to work if you have a family. Managers don't care about their employees and are lazy.
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. Management is unorganized and inconsistent. Stay away and keep your sanity!
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Worst place to work. they did not care if you had a family or life outside as long as people were there to answer the phones no advancement opportunitues at all. Poor treatment of employees. Cold management
bad,"Very disorganized organization. Management team not ethical, educated on their work, very stressful company to work for. Pay is not that great either. Advancement possible without being trained for position you are applying for. Warning stay out!"
bad,"I work for a segment within the company.  This segment was acquired by UHG in 2012, so my review is based on my experience within the segment and may not apply to the company as a whole."
bad,There's no sense of work community of appreciation of employees. Nothing is well-organized.
bad,i would talk to doctors nurses and even clients about their prescription medication. Either the pharmacy was taking to long fill or their was a problem with their insurance coverage. i would try to figure out the problem and let the person know the status of their medication. really didnt talk to anyone. this call center had calls after calls back to back.
bad,"Your every minute of every day is planned for you by Workforce you are monitored every second and if do not follow their schedule exactly are in trouble. Not allowed to go to the restroom except on your lunch and break and if you do need to go before then you are told in training and by your supervisor to learn how to hold it. On the phone all day from 8 to 10 hours a day depending on if they decide you will  be working mandatory overtime when they decide with no exceptions. The only way to make it a career is if you kiss up to management and do not miss a second of work if you are sick you are expected to get over it and be there if a family member dies you are to be at work or get points and after 7 points you are fired. It is the worst company I have ever worked for and I am looking for a new job, DO NOT EVER GO TO WORK THERE it will make you sick, if a member or provider calls and cusses you out you are not allowed to respond just take the abuse and if you do then you are reprimanded by management or lose your job,. If you do not stick to their schedule or meet their desires you are fired. You are not allowed to speak to co workers unless on break and are not allowed to stand unless told you can. Like being in a prison they pay well and have good benefits but several people have had to seek mental health treatment after working there for a  period of just one year I know for a fact it is so stressful they change your hours as they please and do as they please like your their slave. Nothing is enjoyable about working for UNITED HEALTH GROUP unless your a supervisor and most"
bad,"As atividades diárias, elaboração dos projetos, ler e-mails, entrar em contato com fornecedores, coordenar obras em loco, essa empresa acrescentou muito em minha carreira, cresci muito como profissional, lá aprendi muito, a coordenar obra e lidar diretamente com as dificuldades e supera-las, a diretoria era bem dinâmica e norteadora dos processos, o setor era bem agradável de se trabalhar pois havia harmonia, companheirismo todos se ajudavam."
bad,"This company does not care about the people they provide services to, the community, or their employees. It is all about profits and making money. They reap all the profits and give little back. Then on top of it, they make employees sit at all these boring meetings and brag about how well the company is doing... Unbelievable!!!"
bad,quiet and boreing unable to make friends. No realistic trainning or guidelines to follow.
bad,They place to many demands on you to be perfect and rush thru the calls.
bad,dont work here cuz they work you to the bone and wont tell you how much you get paid until months after the work is over.  dont waste your time find another position and more trustworthy company
bad,I was transitioned from Northwell to Optum360/UHG after 25 years.  The Optum part of UHG is mainly in the midwest so therefore there wasn't much they helped us/me as employees.  Everything was left up to our management who worked for Northwell.  Very trying times getting answers.
bad,Senior level managers more focused on ensuring group think instead of seeking new ideas and process improvement.  If they bring you in as a thought leader be prepared for 'we have never done it that way' (and thus we will never do it any other way).  You will soon be the focus of their attention instead of being focused on improving the business.
bad,United Healthcare is one of the worst jobs I have worked at. The only good thing about this job is the pay. The work environment is stressful and dramatic. Management doesn’t care about employees only themselves to make numbers look good. The benefits are horrible they have high deductible plans which you’ll never meet. No room for Advancement. They show a lot of favoritism. The position itself is pretty easy except for the irate customers cursing you out every 10 minutes. Literally the worst job!
bad,Can you work from home? Yes. Are you respected by your superiors? No.  They care more about production then anything else. They will terminate you based on a lie.
bad,"I worked in the call center while in graduate school. The surroundings and co-workers were great, management was horrible. Couldn't even use the bathroom unless I was 'break' and if I did, it was used against me."
bad,"It is a high stress position with too much expectation and not enough man power and too much emphasis put on numbers and meeting number-related goals than attention to patients and patient/staff and staff/staff relationships. They pay never did meet up with the demands of the position"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,This company offers a Telecommuting opportunity for most positions allowing for open scheduling.  The Management Team doesn't work closely amongst each other and they are very unorganized and not educated.
bad,"I would send 8 hours a day in my cubicle.  Some days I would have training or meetings. I was taught how to process claims effectively and quickly.  I thought the management was alright, most of them were fair.  The workplace culture was very diverse and they accepted everyone for employment. The hardest part of the the job was trying to get as many claims processed in the day as they expected you to do. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
bad,Done my JO with them and was shocked on how low their base pay is ranging at 15000. Benefits and HMO are not the best offer you can get which is an irony since they were supposedly doing business in that field. Highly not recommended for tenured agents since the compensation package is very insulting. I am not signed my contract with them due to this concerns. This company is a waste of your time.
bad,if you rocked the boat you where fired. Supervisors and leads and managers did not know what they where doing and had no people skills.   Training was half-assed and trainers where train people on procedures they did not know.
bad,"You are just a corporate number, not a person in this company.  After 14 years, I was let go instead of being transferred out of a job that was impossible for me to be successful at."
bad,Training was very helpful. They have a nice facility for employes. My supervisor was very professional and nice. I enjoy the attendance program and pto .
bad,"I enjoy a company of important, dignity and respect!"
bad,Management is horrible shifts are even worse but there's an xbox in the breakroom that's about it
bad,The overall atmosphere is gloom and the employees are disgruntled.
bad,"A empresa é boa para trabalhar, porém com a liderança que tem torna difícil a convivência e a forma de trabalhar."
bad,I took the position because of working from home was promised but they no longer allow new employees to work from home and if one doesn’t keep up their metrics they will have to work for the office with no chance to work from home
bad,I worked at the N. Richland office for about 1month. Since day one I didn’t feel welcome by my fellow co-workers. It’s like your back in high school having to be bullied by Perla Peña who runs the show. I informed management about how uncomfortable I felt and she did nothing about. It’s like this girl was allowed to do what she wanted because she had seniority.
bad,Great company to work for. The Flexible hours are really great for work life balance. Just looking for a change of pace and settle in family life right now.
bad,"As a member service Advocate with UHC, I loved my job! Although, they lied to us when the site closed in Kingsport and sent us to work from home.. we were told we would not have our positions taken away and then 6 months later, we were terminated/laid off without any notice or compassion. We were treated like a number and not even given the opportunity to apply internally within the company for other jibs."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is having to explain things that should be previous explained through the members employer. The Pros and cons of benefit plans. the premium amounts and when they will fluctuate, and getting a member to understand the employer chooses the plans to offer to the members, the premiums are paid to the employers just to have the plans and that the insurance company just administers what is being offered by the options the employer chose."
bad,"This job would be a great fit if the director of nursing would allow others to do there job instead of micromanaging staff. The environment had different expectations in different departments under the same roof. Double standards. The Director of Nursing is a liar, unprofessional and needs to learn leadership skills. That office will never keep a nurse in office if management does not change."
bad,The new manager I had drove me out of the company after 10 happy years because I had the nerve to go out on leave for back surgery. It is very stressful and you are expected to do the work of 2 1/2 people.
bad,"A typical day would be working at your assigned computer, and speaking with clients that called into the call center. I learned to triage clients who called in with different health problems or emergencies.  I also educated consumers on different health topics of concern. Management was okay, but there was some issues with the department that audited the quality of your calls.  I think they were overworked and took out their frustrations on the nurses they graded.  The grading system was not fair as to how they graded our calls. Some of us were graded harder than others which wasn't fair. The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking with the consumers.  The consumers were so appreciative for our help with their concerns. I really did not want to leave the company or job, but because of the way that your calls were audited you were not given an opportunity to stay with the company."
bad,When I started with this company no one could have ever convinced me to leave. The people are great to work with and the work was rewarding. We recently lost a huge contract and the company is laying is off right before the holidays. The hurt and confusion that comes from this is really stressful. The company is laying off some staff but keeping others and it's host not right. If I would have known this is how I would be treated after years of service I would not have continued with them.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,Too many layoffs but the company pays well. I don't have much to say about this company
bad,Upper Management can’t get things fixed because corporate is in the way. Middle Management is stressed. And entry level is even more stressed. Pay is terrible but what more can you ask out of this position. This place is temporary if you just need a job until you find a real one. Highly stressful and still can’t pay your bills.
bad,process claims that were not automated to make sure that providers get payment. if claims were not sent correct deny the claim so provider may correct
bad,UBH was great when I worked there. However they laid off over 300 people 3 weeks before Christmas and plan to lay off more in the New Year.  Proceed with caution. Little to nothing done to assist workers stay within the company.
bad,this place was an unfair environment. i don't want to explain anything more.  It should be enough. They don't treat you fairly. I wont come back to work there.
bad,"Managers will not do work on their part and in the end if project succeeds then jumps in for credit otherwise throw you under the bus threatening job security. Big miscommunication gap between managers , employees and directors. Your position in the office solely based on your kiss a** ability else job security is at risk."
bad,"It was a shame they closed the Medicaid program.  We all lost our jobs, and will never find anything comparable. United said they were in it for the long haul, but cut us out. Hello unemployment."
bad,"Gross Misrepresentation from day 1!  Extremely disappointed with the way employees are treated and talked to.  Being one of the top 5 fortune companies, I expected more professionalism.  Training went from 8 weeks to 14 weeks!  Class was for benefits/coverage info and creating auths.  Now calls are 95% claim calls.  ""We want you to succeed, we will do everything we can to help you succeed""  lies, lies, lies."
bad,Had a very high turn over rate. Benefits were sub par. Alot of changes and bad communication from management. Stressful and unappreciated. Supervisors aren't required to learn the job they supervise.
bad,Poor management this company does not care about their employees they just do whatever it takes to get the job done regardless. You can not take off any weekends unless it goes through a whole process which is rarely in your favor.
bad,"I think the headline says it all:"
bad,The management in the claims department pretend to care about our patients however they do not care about the employees. I felt like an invisible number is this department
bad,"Do not waste your time, this job is stressful and  training is not long enough. they expect you to go from training to the floor knowing it all and if you dont they start writting you up, until you get an elevated warning and get fired. dont waste time. horrible experience"
bad,I have worked for OPTUM that dealt with insurance benefits for elderly people or people who have retired.  Not a big fan of call centers because they are too confining to the workers.
bad,"I was laid off after 15 years due to managements decision to not sell our product to potential clients, but to take all of our platforms and information gathered for years to build their own segment and laid off my whole department. We were all employees with 10-20 years given to the company. We had to beg for fair raises. Any pushback to management was met with retaliation. I would not recommend."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Just a bad place. Training was not up to par. So much to take in then they act like they get mad if you ask a question. No bathroom time, except for on regular break like you're in preschool and they don't trust you. When you have a lot to put in notes you need after call quickly between calls. They get on you like you're a small child for taking too long in after call. Totally ridiculous. They still haven't got the clue why turn over is so bad. The calls and customers aren't as awful as the head people on the job. Stressful. Happy now that I took a lower paying job where people don't breathe down my back like they did."
bad,I would not recommend that anyone work for United Health Group.  They have no respect for their employees and the only people that paid decently are upper management.  It is a very hostile work environment with extremely poor managemtn
bad,I applied to a position in Utah at the beginning of December and didn't hear back from them until mid- January. They didn't have contact info and the only place where I could chat was with recruiters from other states who had no idea what the manager in Utah was doing. My job status didn't change for that whole month and one of the recruiters I chatted with told me I got the job. Today I received an email saying the position isn't available anymore and that they hope I choose to work with them again in the future. I'm really sad with all the trouble they made me go through to just receive that email.
bad,The urgent care front desk for Sienna and Eastern is very poor management . If hired try to get any location but those two . Very unprofessional and they retaliate against you if you say anything against them .
bad,UHC does not offer competitive salary compared to other companies in their field of work. Also their medical benefits for their employees is very poor
bad,Very much a group that protects itself with an inside group. The management has un degreed officers running the computer development.  Management caters to people on political bias rather than merit. I was hired as a degree requirement for the office with absolutely no way to advance around people that had no degree.
bad,This company treats their call center staff like robots. They do not account for their family time or life. It is all about just making sure the calls are answered without any down time.
bad,"inbound call center job for pharmacy portion of UHG, most of dialogue was to read verbatim from a script like a robot and required to be off phone within 5 minutes regardless of caller's age, hearing capability, mental capacity or history which was a daunting challenge when you are in Medicare D unit with average caller 70yoa"
bad,Im only leaving a comment because I have to but truthfully I don’t have a positive comment I was laid off within months of starting so.... yeah very bad experience
bad,"I spent my last 2 years as a team leader for customer service in PA, but was not fairly compensated.  There were team members under me making more than me.  My request for a salary review went ignored.  This was just one of the many problems I had in leadership."
bad,Management was very cut throat and unsupportive.  I would not recommend this position to anyone.  They are very unrealistic when it comes to making mistakes.  The accuracy rate they want is 99.9% which is very unrealistic.
bad,The agile transformation lacked a unified big picture approach and disagreements among middle level management made it challenging to move forward at a reasonable pace
bad,"When I started at medsynergies it was thought to be a positive experience. I've had 2 promotions since starting here. But early this fall we found out we, my co workers and I, that we would be out of jobs by December 8th 2017."
bad,"Constant on call, always on calls and no time to complete necessary work in-office.  Work at home was 24/7 and the entire organization works in silos."
bad,"Productivity is priority, not quality-touch and move on. Management does not see what individuals accomplish, only what is not accomplished. Co-workers make the day!"
bad,Everyone I know who worked here had to eventually seek mental health services. Very unprofessional work environment. The management sucks! Enough said! STAY AWAY. The pay sucks
bad,AWFUL company. Everyone is based on favorite.. Dont care about their employee awful benefits.. Just flat out worst company everrrrrrrrtrrrrtrrrrrrrrr!
bad,This can be one of the most stressful job you can work at. Management is very poor and very deceiving. Most information about policies was misleading which caused a lot of confusion and jeopardized job security
bad,"the job itself is a great career, it is a fantastic feeling knowing i made a difference in someones life.  I enjoy helping families in need and doing everything i can to solve their issue."
bad,"I do not enjoy the people that work here. If you have transportation to make it to work, you have a job there at United health care."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Upper management is transparent about the company's earnings but you will see nothing of if as it does not trickle down to the operations/production employees. The ""ivory tower"" takes care of it's own and the shareholders. You are constantly given ""lip service"" about how well everyone within the company is doing but the end result is that you do no matter. You are a number....""do your job, ask for nothing in return, and move along"" is the mentality of this wonderful organization. Your ideals and input are also not welcome here."
bad,"Na verdade, pelo pouco que permaneci não tem como avaliar como um todo."
bad,"It was horrible to work for this clinic.I worked in a 24 hour urgent care and when I got hired, they told me they would be flexible with my school schedule. However, when I started, my schedule was constantly changing"
bad,"Local de trabalho foi a área comercial, onde o ambiente é bastante agitado, com certos momentos agradáveis, mas na maioria dos momentos não tão agradável assim. Em relação a equipe, não nos entendemos bem, sobre tudo com os colegas de trabalho. De início um bom relacionamento com a gerência, mas que por alguns motivos foi se desgastando. O mais agradável é que tinham momentos em que o trabalho era sem pressão, flexível, que gerou harmonia de todas as partes."
bad,"Wouldn't work there again. It was not at all flexible, and made no exceptions for family situations. I would not reccomend this job to someone who has children."
bad,"Loved the job!"
bad,"Empresa seria,estruturada,beneficio plano saude excelente"
bad,"Well one day I received a phone call from a very angry lady, first thing that came to my mind was Compassion I stayed very calm and positive on the phone and at the end of the call the lady was satisfied and please with my services."
bad,This was temporary. I really dont remember much but sitting at a desk and showing vacant apt units.
bad,The health information i learned while in training was great but i did not like being on the phones and was not my type of job. 
bad,"Harassing, discriminatory practices. Micromanagement is a norm. Work place environment terrible."
bad,There is always something to do. I really don't have time for breaks or even a lunch break. The co -workers are very nice. I've learned so much at this job some many different systems and still learning. The hardest part of this job is there never ending work.
bad,"do not work for them. there is nothing to gain. I cannot express how horrible this company is. Management is beyond incompetent and they will LIE, LIE, LIE to you to get you there and then try to work you to the ground. There is no work/life balance and the favoritism is beyond words."
bad,processing calls for evercare health plan members. Did not always have the tools or proper resources to service the calls properly
bad,"Empresa de Excelente conduta aos seus colaboradores, sempre ajudando e auxiliando em qualquer situação, estando sempre comprometida com o funcionário."
bad,"O s beneficios são otimos,o ambiente de trabalho muito bom e éuma empresa que respeita seus funcionarios com seres humanos."
bad,Worked at United Healthcare 20 years enjoyed the work place in
bad,"I managed accounts for employers' benefits, too many clients, with difficulty with hardest accounts, unresolved issues to deal with, working beyond office house, taking laptops to home and continue to work, and underpaid for the work we did."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,This company has endless possibilities if the tools needed to be sucessful were available for the employees.
bad,They say intergrity is a core value but they do not act with it. They will tell you one thing but it ends up being different.  Your starting rate is ok because they will not give you a raise for hardly any uptraining.
bad,"a typical day at work can be a very fast paced environment, the team I work on is very understanding and helpful, some members can be nice and others not but its nothing that I cant handle,"
bad,Depending on your roll and who your boss is depends on a lot of things. Normally you spend your entire time at work processing claims. You come in at your time of day and adjust claims until you leave.
bad,"Sit it a dead silent room, cant talk to anyone, look at a computer screen and just hit 10 keys on the keyboard over and over and over. I personally quickly became depressed and sad and couldn't continue to do this job. There is no substance to this position, you cant change positions unless it has been a year, which is a long time to practically sit in a prison cell. I feel like a robot just wasting away my life. Benefits are good if you can put up with the job."
bad,Much favoritism. Expectations on the number of claims to follow up are practically unrealistic. Extremely stressful. Managers have their favorites who are given easy accounts to handle while the difficult accounts are given to non-favorites with the same expectations. Meeting an unrealistic quota is extremely stressful. Close colleagues are friendly and helpful.
bad,"It is good to be in United Health care for past 7 years and I learned alot using very large database systems."
bad,Do not recommend anyone working in the Kingston office. They keep telling u to advance but unless u kiss up and basically bust your tail til u have nothing left you don't get the advancement.
bad,"Overall not a bad place to work , staff and employees are Very fun to work with. Very easy to move up in the company.  I would recommend this company to further candidates"
bad,"mandatory overtime of 55 hours a week!  No time between calls, no body around me was taking it seriously , my throat was so sore I could talk to my family after a full day at work."
bad,"really its a stressful place to work for , especially the surveys, if you get a bad survey they count it towards you is if its your fault when really the members are complaining   about their benefits  and the treatment given to them form united health care.  And they discriminate against Black people!"
bad,Job eliminated after 4-5 years. Every employee was let go with little notice. I was lucky enough to leave before this happened. No consideration for personal life.
bad,not quite satisfied with new management. Policies are not employee friendly. Resources are made available to employees but not so handy to use. Management lake practicality when making decision
bad,"For a health care company their health benefits are horrible.  They play games with their employees, work them tirelessly  and have no concise vision."
bad,The trainers were not prepared for all the agents that was hired. Rhe trainer that was in my class was new out of NC and she should have been sent to a customer service class along with leadership
bad,"Only take care of themselves, no opportunity to grow, pay increase is a joke ($0.42 cents per year forever), if you have experience they will find a way to fire you, hiring newbies who last 3-6 months only."
bad,UHC places you in charge of 40 plus clients of different waivers and changes the documentation process continuously.  Offer praise and then do not follow through with their policy throughout the whole company.
bad,"No or very low raises, no bonuses, expect hours to change to evenings and weekends per business needs. They will bait and switch you at the interview. The environment is always about what you did wrong, not what you do right. So many unhappy people. Have to be a horrible person to be a Director. Lots of bullying."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"i do not have an opinion that is relevant. I am sure since i have worked there, that there have been changes made and adapted to the current business climate for that industry."
bad,Not a good place to work; low pay; stressful work; underappreciated. Poor management all around! Not a great place to work! Would never recommend it!!
bad,"The job itself is great. Going through the training process and nesting period, not so great. I think they need to provide better and more knowledgeable training."
bad,Was going to be expected to work in the field for 8 hours THEN come home and be on computer for 4 more hours without pay. I quit the job for this reason.
bad,"Managers hardly pay attention to you after training.  I sat at my desk for 17 minutes with a doctor on the phone with a question that I had not learned yet, and nobody could see to come help.  I do not understand how a patient cannot get a request expedited and only a doctor's office can.  Are the patients not the biggest priority? Then you are not sure if we are trained for certain clients or not?  Then find out we are not, yet still are told to work the case?  Huh?"
bad,"It was a while ago that I worked at United Health care. Wasn't a pleasant experience.  Just remember, very unorganized. It was a call center that I worked in."
bad,"If you want a stressful, high workload job, with low pay for the amount of work required, then this is for you.  Very poorly run call center.  Everyone there wants to leave."
bad,Attention do not work for vendor tele-tech. Everything negative will apply to this company. That says it all!!!!!!!!! This would be tele-tech vendor for united health group orlando florida.
bad,"Although the training was quite extensive, the management was very poor. if an associate needed help they had to email the manager and await a response. Meanwhile the caller is left waiting and the cuatomer service associate is docked for calls that take more than the allotted time.  No day was the same. Lunch hours were always changing due to the calls coming in and leaving on time was never an option. Representatives were dictated by the computer and timed for restroom breaks and had to clock in for any and everything, including having to consult with a manager for help, and were penalized for that as well."
bad,"answering phones, helping customers with prescriptions, the hardest part of the job was not being flexible with family. most enjoyable is being able to talk to customers and help with if you can their needs."
bad,Great job if you are starting in the workforce. Would not recommend as a career. Benefits suck. UHC only cares about their customers not the wellness of the employees. There is no work - life balance unless you are a supervisor or some one with higher authority.
bad,I have been with the company for about three years now. I have applied for different positions over six times and I still can't get promoted. I even went to college and graduated and I still can't get promoted. There's tons of overtime. It's hard when you have a family. The pay is below average. The raises suck. Training is not that great either. There are work from home opportunities. They micromanage.
bad,"I thought the cullture was terrible.  Even if you are a team.player people just step all over you."
bad,"The hiring process was lengthy, and could be set up better. Once final training was complete they place you at your desk, and expect you to be there, and frown upon taking mandatory breaks. Along with mandatory overtime."
bad,"Não apreendi nada Novo - não tiver interação nem apoio em nada da supervisão ou gerencia."
bad,A typical work day is fast paced back to back calls. Management shows favoritism and the hardest part of the job is constant change and no support. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the elderly population and helping when you can.  Co-workers are awesome. I learned that this place is not good for work advancement nor do they care about work life balance.  All the values they teach the company does not stand by.
bad,"I was an RN there. Horrible. Unrealistic expectations for productivity. Watch you like jail wardens "
bad,"very stressful and over worked !!!!! worked there for 7 years and it was a waste the best thing i got out of it was the experience in a call center, and i was able to built my 401k with a struggle with the poor income they where giving me."
bad,don't  want to  disclose.     always   worried  about   job  stability . always   under  staffed   .  no   work /life balance . the   employees  are miserable .    upper management is terrible
bad,The location in Elkridge is great. Not to far from where I live. I had a nice window view. It has a nice presentation both interior and exterior.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"O cargo horário de trabalho é muito puxado,e também não aprendi nada além do que eu ja sabia,não foi uma experiencia muito boa"
bad,"Not organized"
bad,would not reccommend this company to anyone with any desire to have upward mobility.  Very cold natured company not very much to say after that
bad,"It was very difficult to stand out as an individual in such a large company, While I was there, they did offer classes for you to get your insurance license, which was a bonus."
bad,"enjoyed working with co workers, management was poor, communication not provided to all involved in the work environment, no support"
bad,"most supervisors  work from home. and only come in once a week, co-workers are some what friendly,  some supervisors single temp employees out of department meetings and birthday celebrations ect..."
bad,"United HealthCare is a very stressful place to work. I feel as though I was misled. Being that this is a health care company, you would think that they would have better benefit options for their employees. There do not give their employees sick time, or if you have children, this is not the ideal, or understanding place to work."
bad,"Giving an overall rating of 2 is generous at best.  I was hired through a temp agency and and it all started out good.  Training was well performed and then we went live.  Sounds simple then we took calls for a week and the management changed our schedules.  OK, not what was promised or expected but many of us needed the job.  Within a week, the whole Orlando site went crazy and they trained us on a new skill.  After 2 days of training they threw us into a contract that was very hard and nobody else is the building knew how to help us.  Supposedly we were certified but we had no support and we were left hung out on our own.  We tried really hard and oh yeah, they changed our schedules again.  After a week of this, on a Friday they changed our schedules again beginning the next day.  We talked to our supervisor and he was left hung out to dry just like us, he tried and we all felt bad for him.  Still with no support we learned our skills and what happened, they changed our schedules again and then started laying us off because we bailed them out and now they didn't need us.  Management was horrible, they seemed to hide in their offices, there was NO work life balance and they didn't care, Compensation, we didn't even get the shift differential we were told we would get, job security-I don't think so they just laid people off when they used them up.  Management, talk about a joke, the 2 ""call center managers"" we non existent and didn't care about their people.  Culture, they have none and just don't seem to care.  They pushed us to work overtime and even demanded it from us. "
bad,"Jobs being off shored, management not experienced with basic management principles. Ethics compromised on all levels, there is a credibility issue with management to employees. Stakeholders, board members biggest concern, not patient care Or best interest. Inappropriate use of coding for billing claims. Supervisory, team leaders require more education and people skills training. Inaccurate audits done by employees not managers , on other employees. This data is used for reviews. Is biased, incorrect, not credible data. Drug use and theft occurs daily on the floor. Managers turn the other way."
bad,"Overall management is not supportive, does not encourage vacations, gives work to 1 employee that requires 5 people to do, due to bad management there is a high turn over rate either people quit or they weed you out if they don't like you.  The worst place I ever worked at!"
bad,"We're are just going into business with these people and they are very disorganized, make haste decision without thorough review and are demeaning. The manager is overwhelmed, doesn't meet his commitments which causes distrust. They provide lipservice and there is absolutely no communication and they dont make timely decision. I am very disappointed in my company for partnering up with MSI for only one reason -the bottom line. I don't see this partnership lasting."
bad,"Micro management, no room for advancement, no flexibility, nice building, hire turn over, daily huddle to discuss production in front of peers and increased job duties without proper compensation."
bad,Recent extensive layoffs have EVERYONE anxious and wondering who is next is the current atmosphere. Process changes are nearly weekly.   Embrace change and keep your ‘mood elevator’ up is one of the company’s mantras.
bad,"Employees have the worst insurance coverage. High deductible and high premiums, forced to use company pharmacy instead of local pharmacies at a much higher cost."
bad,Never in my life have I met more sadistic people. Not a team. Managers are biased and openly ugly/rude verbally. Not a pleasant experience and would not recommend this people-disposal to anyone.
bad,"I have been at UHG for about 20 years but I found out that new hires (no prev experience) are making almost the same wage as I am! Seems my loyalty is misplaced."
bad,"Work life balance for management only. Micro managing professionals."
bad,"I world recommended it only as a stepping stone! Management is very poor and lacking professionalism. To much work vey little pay. Micromanaged, constant changes."
bad,My department is becoming micromanaged. At first a lot of representatives were not given annual increase for not meeting unreasonable goals.. A 2% raise should be mandatory cost of living increase. Next almost whole department has been put on a CAP for again not meeting unrealistic goals. They have taken away our flex time and now make us use pto. Flex time was probably one of best parts of job. Now instead of taking an hour to go to a dr appt and then staying an hour late .. I have to use pto.  The work in my department has started to decreased out of nowhere. On the hub the only similar jobs are only available in the phillipines. Front line is being outsourced to the Philippines and it is disgusting. There are literally hundreds of reps in training .. Once they are out of training I fully expect the lay offs to come. This used to be a nice place to work but its clear we are being sweat out..

bad,"Let's just say Certified Application Counselors are at risk of contracting diseases, endangering their lives and are working under a lot of pressure resulting in high stress levels. Not a great position. The salary was not worth it!"
bad,"Very stressful, no job security, accounts always closing. Very low pay, and hard to get approved paid time off. Very nice building on John Young, with gym."
bad,"No opportunity to grow, they terminate for small reasons even if your a top performer. The salary does not increase. There is only their opinion when it comes down to a matter."
bad,"Average day is regular call center environment.."
bad,"I worked for UHC as well as their child company,  Optum. Optum was weird because weren’t treated like true UHC employees, more like unwanted stepchildren. I started off as a tier 1 agent and eventually learned and was put on several different skills. I made it to tier 3 and capped out. The company is very, very stingy. There were no contests or rewards for doing a good job. The PFP structure kept changing and eventually became hard to get a full payout with. We had to be extra careful with our clock ins because More than once, I noticed my timesheet was wrong and they would refuse to fix it. Optum was actually sued in the past because of this. "
bad,"Most management was focused on themselves, not much regard to help develop their teams. Played favorites. Typical insurance company, focused on how much money they could make."
bad,"My experience was within one relatively small department which I do not think was a fair representative of United Health care as a whole.  I can only comment based on my experience:"
bad,"OptumRx did not care for well being of employees and only sought to overwork them and lower morale.  Despite poor reviews from employees, did not feel like we were heard.  UHG did not do  anything to ensure the pillars were implemented. It was disappointing.  No supervisor wanted the task of overworking the staff, and there was high turnover."
bad,"Seemed like a great place to work, but raises & promotions are rare. The people who are promoted have less experience than other candidates who have a lot more experience. Focus on quantity vs quality."
bad,Distinct line drawn between management and the grunts and we all know who wins. Managers do not “have your back.” We should all be able to adjust to change but this company is ridiculous. Change is implemented to accommodate the company profits at all times and we all know the company is worth billions. This is a healthcare company and they don’t give employees sick days. Favoritism runs rampant.
bad,"It’s only good for your resume, minimum pay 11.50, with full benefits, 40 hours. Supervisors don’t know how to talk to people; has a huge turn over rate can’t take this place as a career"
bad,"I worked for UnitedHealth Group for a decade, and it was an ongoing nightmare. The culture was cut-throat and difficult, people were encouraged to ""not worry about who gets credit"" for your work and so forth. There was a lack of innovation and a blatant disregard for diversity in leadership. There was disorganization with constant shifts in leadership (I had 4 different directors in my last 3 years), lots of office gossip among leadership and generally unprofessional behavior."
bad,Management is horrible. Can never get help when needed. I have never worked for a call center where the atmosphere was dull. There is a high turn over rate here.
bad,No training they just throw you in and expect you to learn.  Always changing your job description.  They do not communicate well at all unless they need to scold you for something
bad,"Usual stressful medicare annual enrollment atmosphere, where there is no avenue to advance within the company.  When annual enrollment was completed your contract ended"
bad,I knew the moment I stepped into my bare cubicle I had made a poor choice to accept the job. Culture was very toxic in my division. Drinking seemed to be the solution for many to deal with the pressure and stress put upon them.
bad,"Just like United Health Care, OptumRx received a poor rating.  Their is little room for advancement.  They do not provide pay raises very well neither do they give decent bonuses.  Stay away."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Not knowlagable about proper proceedures for FMLA & Mental Health Disabilities.Slightly flexable but very limited on Flexability. Managment was very focused on Business not individuals.
bad,"benefits are  VERY EXPENSIVE and have very HIGH DEDUCTIBLES. You would never know you work for a health insurance company. Make sure you ask for at least 5K above the salary you want to pay for benefits and deductibles.. ( for a single person) Pay are beyond horrific especially for a company tells us how many billions they made last quarter year.You are lucky to get a 2% raise."
bad,"Very unstable job. Look to fire to rehire, never provide any raises and any open job oppourtunities always go to supervisor favorites no true process in hiring."
bad,Employees are not valued and often worked way over 40 hours a week. Managers change constantly. Poor training. Little to no recognition of employees that go above and beyond for either the company or the member.
bad,This is not a place to work since the acquisition. The leadership and culture is now cut throat.  This is not a place to work going forward unless there are drastic measures taken at the executive level.
bad,Working for united healthcare was the worst year of my life! The stress and anxiety of being yelled and cussed out by customers all day is not worth the pay they give you. Second benefits are horrible and you would think working for a health insurance company they would provide better coverage for there employees but it’s a joke! The never ending criticism and big brothers watching you is a bit much and makes the job even more high anxiety! I would not recommend working for united healthcare worst company!
bad,"Na função de atendente foi o pior local de trabalho onde já estive.E muita pressão e cobrança pra no final do mês vc chorar quando vê o salário.Nao há valorização do funcionário,acham que somos robôs.Quando colocamos uma pausa banheiro o gestor já olha com aquela cara feia,como se estivéssemos fazendo algo errado."
bad,Too much stress and expectations for the measly pay.  Not enough support from management and supervisors. Members  and providers  are always yelling at you; the position should be called a complaint/grievance specialist; if I wanted to hear people complain all day;  I would have applied to  those positions. They don't tell you this on the interview; which they should so you can make and informed decision on whether or not to accept the position.
bad,"Like most insurance companies, they not only treat their customers horrible, but they also do not take very good car of their employees. Unless you are desperate, I would not seek employment with this company."
bad,When they took over the contract they wanted to treat it like a commercial insurance and that so wasn't the case. They had a lot of learning and changing to do when they came aboard.
bad,"Constant changes without proper training and review. Manager not up to date with updates and process changes and gives wrong information. At staff meetings people are not recognized by manager as he does not take time to learn names and faces. After multiple years of working with good scores, still no raises. And being a telephonic job, a lot of inappropriate perverted callers and NOTHING is done about it."
bad,"The co-workers there act very kid like, the manager doesn't do anything about it. If you have questions about some things or procedures they do not explain in full, kind of give a ""get you by"" answer, if they respond at all. Trainers and managers are not on the same page of the way things are done. Mind you it was a 16 week training."
bad,"horrible job security, poor management, unrealistic metrics, health insurance very high cost for everything.  sit all day and make 35 or more calls, have at least 3 to 4 enrolls per day.  working form home a plus but the stress is not worth it.  pay is okay but the cost of benefits or should i say having no real benefit is very high.  i paid as private paying patient in most offices because the cost was less than my co payment."
bad,"Very hard to move up in the company. You can only be a debt collector no other position available at the time I work with the company. Relocated to Orlando, Florida and did not help the debt collectors relocate."
bad,"Never really felt the company cared about me, heard my concerns in trying to help me. They need better trainers/training for new employees because they are spending alot of money and they should honestly be concerned with making sure every employees is successful and employee's needs/concerns are addressed."
bad,"mandatory OT, all the time! NO work/life balance. was terrible! most people there hated their jobs, so everyone was miserable. management didn't seem to care, and used the ""up to and including termination"" bit to scare people into compliance."
bad,There is virtually not support for employees working in the field. Owners try to make the employees feel that there are no other job options out there.
bad,Attendance policy is unforgiving had to resign before they termed me as husband was very ill and did not allow for appts...it's just too bad if your spouse is critical...u had better be at work!  Very clique oriented and do not pay for all They ask u to do...HR doesn't care either..  new hires coming in 8 months after our group started got a dollar more an hour and when confronted just a lot of red faces and no answers...

bad,"United Healthcare is only worried about management. The members are not first priority, they are only numbers. The company pays well but you are expected to do so much overtime there is there no time for family or personal life. They fired me because my father died un-expectantly and they told me after being gone for two days I was MIA and if I  did not come back I would risk my job. The turn around on employees is terrible and the training sucks so the new employees are never really able to help a member correctly. The mandatory overtime wont even allow you to go to your scheduled Dr appointments that have been scheduled months in advance."
bad,"Everyone would have to come in for my shift and log on and would be literally watched all day and if you got up to use the bathroom or your 15 minute breaks you had to make sure your manager knew where you were at all times, now this was in the in-house claims dept. Other departments were not like this. Career advancement was almost impossible unless you knew someone who could help you post out to another dept."
bad,"no opportunity for advancement, work life balance is very poor. there is definetely no job security, its a very stressful work environment"
bad,"Run fast, they have terrible management, rude , disrespect , condescending and no job lost.The hardest part is working their everyday."
bad,"Boring, mind numbing work. Hated every minute there. Made me very depressed while I worked there. Padding this review."
bad,"Um dia tipico de trabalho era bem corrido, tinha que estar focada sempre nas análise que eram feitas durante todo o expediente de trabalho. Tinha fácil acesso a gerencia, os colegas de trabalho também ajudavam no que era preciso."
bad,"it is poor communication between front desk, Medical Assistant and administration, it a big clinic and it is not enough personnel. Adrianne and Monica (administrative manager and supervisor) expect the MAs assist the doctor or FNP, attend the patient and finish the paperwork by the end of the day."
bad,This division of United HealthCare was just developed in 2013.   There is no consistency in the rules and compensation.
bad,UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans has not been very consistant in any part of their service to our service members and families. A typical work day is spent correcting incorrect infomation provided to beneficiaries from the call center.
bad,"Specialist :  Banking liquidation of assets, Shares, mutual funds, Analyze health insurance claim, Cash flow, bank reconciliation, cash flow, fixed income, derivatives, equity etc."
bad,Was not to fond of the job. Angry patients and  Doctors. Was just thrown on the phones with out proper training.
bad,I have worked for United Health Group for seven years the pay has not been good and the benefits are not good at all
bad,Not sure why United brings people from other countries to the US to take US jobs ?
bad,On a daily basis I would answer inbound complex customer calls
bad,Company Cultuer is difficult to understand due to value conflicts
bad,"Yeah, I worked out of one of their southern call centers. Compensation was poor, given the abuse from callers and strict adherence to phone metrics."
bad,"You have to know someone to move up in the company. Matters how good you are at your job, exceeding company goals, proven results on the intranet web portal, and volunteer for the company; apply for other position that pertains to your current positions, you are not considered. You get these email notifications that the position is closed. Why post it on the HR site?"
bad,"Massive turnover rate! Job was not hard at all. Most Management not willing to assist if needed. For the most part Co-workers were helpful, friendly. It’s a call center so there is definitely some.. a lot of problems!"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The company has been around a long time. Management needs to appreciate their employees better and management needs to give better salaries and benefits to the employees.
bad,"MR FWAE dept-Micromanagement to the extreme, constant, as in DAILY changes like no place I have ever worked, (It seems as though management has no clue to what they are doing and they are in constant meetings deciding what to change, implement or take away next, be it a system or job aid, or review guidelines, etc.)  There is lack of clear consistent communication from management, mandatory 10hours overtime starting at Thanksgiving and lasting for months (happens every year) always raising production. One can meet and exceed quality and production and it still never seems like its enough. Your every move is tracked by the computer and if your mouse is idle for more than 60 seconds, you are questioned about it, yet they say its ok to not move your mouse during meetings. hmph  They promote this position as flexible, a great place for work life balance. Its the farthest from it. You must specify when you will be working your OT in advance and not deviate from it in the slightest."
bad,"Depends on the group you work with, careful as it can change.  I was working at a start up that was purchased.  They sliced and diced it, folded into another group and everyone except a handful were laid off or went on their own way."
bad,Nice pay mentally draining management is ok. Could be better need to allow more training time more point freedom attendance rule is almost unreasonable
bad,"Gestão individualista, pesada e focada no interesse próprio. Empresa perdida na estratégia tanto Amil quanto Optum, que teve a pior gestão do grupo.  Resultado disso? amargam em prejuízo desde que a UHG veio para o Brasil."
bad,"there is a lot of travelling required,driving to and from various locations, no set schedule. There was a lack of communication from my direct manager, so things were very unorganized."
bad,"They only care about the bottom line, not there employees. Management is out of touch. If you work hard and show up on time you are not rewarded. they do have lots of work from home positions which is the only thing that made the company tolerable."
bad,"No job security for hard working , managers are not at all giving preference for hard working,  all these because of money (bribe)  , Managers required bribe from their associates to save their job"
bad,Your on the phone 99 percent of the time your there as soon as you finish one stressful call you have another 6 seconds later. Your supervisor never stands up for you even when providers are in the wrong. You will only climb to the top if your willing to be a office snitch.
bad,"Not enough pay for the work and a lot of office drama. Bonuses are great.... if you can achieve what is needed to earn them. In order to get the bonus, you have to be a machine and work through breaks and lunch to survive."
bad,You get no cooperation from other teams.  You're lucky if anyone even responds to an email.  The pay is well below standards.  If you don't put in the minimum salary when applying you won't even get an interview.
bad,Very diverse company only cater to their own kind and tons of discrimination 31 cent raise in 2 years and none of the supervisors have a clue about their jobs always telling you to ask peers because they dont know the answers
bad,The culture favors only a certain group of individuals.  This group determines your success or failure based on how low you’re willing to bow to them.  Promotion is based on who you know where.
bad,"The place has a fake culture. Filled with people that will throw you under the bus in a minute to make themselves look better. I have had a few jobs and this one by far was the worst. Management is unorganized and hectic and the pay is awful. Also, you will be looked at poorly if you so not allow them to use you to do work more than what you are paid to do. Absolutely 0 advancement even though it had a bunch of job postings."
bad,Management is not flexible with time off and work life balance. Metric quantity driven not quality driven. Job security not high. Feel threatened with losing my job.
bad,"I worked from home as a benefit advocate, which was cool but, I was stuck working til 8pm for over a year! If your fake  you'll go far here. It's non stop calls! You only have 7 sec before the next one comes in. They expect you to ""reset"" your brain and be fresh for the next call... Their computers can't even keep up!"
bad,"UHG is very structure-oriented and the environment is not comfortable if you need to use the facilities outside of break times. For those this doesn't effect, great opportunities are available."
bad,What I don't understand is how we are working for a company that just increased it's revenue by 65 billion dollars and we can't even get a DECENT raise. We get paid BIWEEKLY! You have employees struggling living paycheck to paycheck! I can;t even afford LUNCH today! How is that? Why is that? We are the FACE of your COMPANY! We are the REASON your revenue has increased by 65 BILLION DOLLARS!!! If it wasn't for us your company would be NOTHING!!!!!! Treat your EMPLOYEES BETTER!!!!
bad,"No paid sick time, forget taking PTO and communication was terrible.  Plus, everything Is MICRO managed and Big Brother is always watching. It was impossible to feel like you were ever doing something right because employee expectations were never clear and changed almost weekly. No regrets about leaving even though the pay is great."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"very low pay, When lunch was provided the portions were very small, fitting for an infant not an adult . Very high call volume. No career advancement help"
bad,"Team has really good Members and one that has to prove he is right at all times. As a contractor, this person singles you out during meetings but when you ask for assistance or clarification the person is not willing to provide information but rather send you a URL."
bad,Leadership and structure is very very lacking. Feedback is solicited but never heard. No one leads. No one takes accountability . Bonus incentives are poorly structured and impossible to attain
bad,They are currently trying to offshore as many resources as possible to save the bottom company dollar.  They laid-off closed to a thousand employees this year alone.  Be very cautious when looking with this company that is not for saving jobs in America.
bad,There was no management to go to for any questions if you had any. No one to call or trying to call the manager without any call back at all but we had to be on call 24 hours a day.
bad,The environment is non-conducive in the areas of forward thinking.  Very cast oriented and based on who the employees know and not what they know.  Overall environment is very immature
bad,I worked for this company for 9 years in STL and was never really able to move forward. They put so much work on you and then they lie to most of the members about benefits. Also if you're not kissing up to management you are not advancing. I helped in training classes kept my numbers together and each time I was never allowed to move. I applied for a position without telling my sup and I got my interview was told when I would start in the new department. Then was asked if I let my supervisor know I was applying for a new department. Once I told my supervisor I was not allowed to move to the department. No lie three weeks later it was given to another person on my team.  I can go on and on about the company but I'm not. The STL call center is the worst if you're working with small business (PRIME) and large business {UNET}
bad,"After Starting as provider services rep, our temporary supervisor came from Texas and was not very impressionable, then when they did hire someone from our state. they had previously said i could apply for that job and was told that the state required a person to have a degree. then after all that all supervisors had been contacted by HR and it was swept under the rug, and nothing was done about it."
bad,"it was a terrible place to work at.no one was really trying to help the customers, they made it unbearable to be there.the formulary wasn't easily at the patients disposal."
bad,"Monotonous job, talked with Medicare members about health screenings and attempted to schedule preventative visits, gave member insurance benefit info"
bad,"Worked with United as a Senior Provider Services Representative for 5+ years.  The job consisted primarily of phone customer service speaking with doctor's offices, hospitals and other medical providers.  The call volume for front line representatives was about 70-100 inbound calls per day.  Calls consisted of quoting health plan benefits, setting up prior authorization for care, account troubleshooting and claims processing."
bad,"Poor benefits, management and work environment. Typical day at work would be answering calls confirming health benefits for recipients of medicaid, calling providers, trying to confirm providers are in network. You deal with a lot of irate customers . The hardest part of job is being in a call center environment and a customer request a manager, managers are not receptive or welcoming when taking the call, there is a lot of call avoidance."
bad,My experience was not positive. It is unfortunate because there are a lot of good people across the organization. Unfortunately the management is weak and the culture is very stifling. Politics are rampant within the organization. Very restrictive environment.
bad,"I cannot speak for UHC or the the broader UnitedHealth Group Organization, but the Optum Services organization  is very unsettled. It seems they lack a clear vision and what it takes to get there.  They do not encourage empowerment or reward results, they are still very stuck in an old established political structure."
bad,The company is bent on denying any and all customers proper service by creating a system of employee metrics that is so constraining that no one can perform all functions of their job.
bad,"Ever since I have been an employee for UHG, I have been on a sinking ship. UHC M&V was broken up and I was stuck with level 1 tech support. They are too cheap to hire enough skilled analysts so they have been replacing the Technical Support Center techs at Optum with people from over seas. We are slowly being outsourced and no one is happy about it. People are leaving the company because the company rarely promotes people from the TSC. They recently told us they are moving our office so they can put us in smaller and louder working conditions. My supervisor recently left because of the terrible environment. We are all over worked. There is never any down time and people that call us have to wait on average about 40 mins every day until around 2pm because UHG acquires more and more companies that we need to support but won't gain new tech support employees. Bottom line is we cost the company money so we are a problem. It's the reason why I am looking for a new job. UHG is a terrible company to work for."
bad,Higher up management that work for this company doesn't care for their employee's.  The supervisors and team leads talk down to you  in unprofessional ways. They underpay you for what you do while they make millions off of you selling they products. The bonus money isn't worth anything compared to the amount of policies you sell for this company.
bad,"Management loves great ideas enough to steal them. Culture is welcoming on the surface, but the deeper you venture, the murkier it gets. You really need to have a passion for the mundane and a serious affinity for micro-management to thrive."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Just wish they would promote me after being there for so long and having knowledge of all the systems. I have applied multiple times and have gotten no response or nothing
bad,Don’t fall for the upfront discussions. Everything changes once you are in.  Management=Micromanaged by a Dictator. Management uneducated on company policy. Rules are different for certain employees. Expect to work 60 + hours a week due to heavy workload. Also expect to be told to take 0.5 hours of PTO if you need to leave 20 minutes early one day as a salaried exempt employee. Job advertised as flexible and becomes very fixed once you are in. Consistently adding work weekly via additional documents to complete. No communication from management. Performance graded on scales and measures you are unaware of until after they give you results. They promote by seniority so therefore you end up with a bunch of under qualified managers and it shows. Bullying is allowed and overlooked by upper management due to lack of confrontation experience. Not ever sure which guidelines to follow as management gives opposing answers on specific job functions. Pay is good until you add up your hours. Raises are a slap in the face. Range from 0-1.71%. Therefore new hires are hired in with less experience at same rates as one after a years raise.
bad,The work environment was negative. There was favortism and bullying from other employees was allowed. Promotions were only provided to those that were the favorites
bad,"Seldom opportunities for growth, favoritism is a big factor in this company. It’s not what you know it’s who you know. Life and work balance is tough here they don’t appreciate you having time off. Salaries are not up to par with competitors."
bad,"Too much work and not enough employees to balance without overtime.  Overtime is required (although discouraged) and there is no work/life balance."
bad,"Helping people over the phone sucked, due to the fact that when refilling medication there were people cursing us out because their doctor didn't call in to refill their medication. People were rude and management was no help. I was glad to transfer them to someone else."
bad,"UHG strictly adheres to the 'promote to the height of incompetence' employee development strategy. Far too many promotions are not based on qualification but tenure. If you can keep a seat warm, you have a long-term 'career'."
bad,"This is a good company to work for if you want to add a Fortune 50 to your resume. Don't expect to be promoted unless you've been there for about 15 years or hang out with the head of HR. Very slow moving, risk adverse. No real leaders, pretty much all people managers making sure you stay in your box and don't make any waves."
bad,If I had not been a single mother I would not have stayed for 17 yrs.  Terrible employee health insurance - I have worked for two other insurance co. with better benefits and pay.
bad,"UHC overall is a great company. It management and supervisors discredits the company. Lack of professionalism, training and coaching is thick. The pay is good so for that reason and that reason only I would recommend it. Other than that get in and get out. That place a has a revolving door"
bad,"The company, in general, was good in some departments but they allow and promote people to positions in management that are highly unqualified in other departments.  There are managers who do not treat people with FMLA very well and HR does nothing to assist when employees have concerns about management."
bad,"Poor management and training, information is not disseminated effectively. Overall, a very frustrating experience. Things seem challenging, not used to this experience compared to other managed care organizations."
bad,"Working as a customer service representative at UHC, did not provide any flexibility or work life balance. I was on a queue, so breaks were limited to two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. If you were late from a break/lunch your manager would be notified. Your manager is also notified if your calls are longer than the suggested timeframe. The job was very stressful and not meant for someone who has a family with small kids"
bad,"The company does not boast on room for growth. They is never any acts of appreciation such as nurses week, birthdays or Christmas, Even through a tramatic personal loss. No signs of sympathy or compassion. The pay is below normal. What could be an explosive and wonderful company Is stagnated by egotism and grand standing."
bad,"It's a rather difficult place to work. The pay is sub-par, the time off is pretty decent, and the inter-office politics are perhaps the most unappealing aspect."
bad,"attached to head set staring at computer screen with very strict 2 -"
bad,I worked for UHG for over 6 years and would not consider them a long term career path unless you are a VP or above.  The main driver is stock price which shouldn't surprise anyone.  The company for the most part had a toxic work environment which did not support work life balance.
bad,So many IT policies and procedures that a technician cannot follow to troubleshoot. Raises are 1% if at all.  Training is poor.  They talk about Culture but then treat employees poorly.
bad,99.74% quality expectations. Responsible for metrics you have no control of. Complete change of floor management witch changed many of the many of the positive improvements that took years to implement.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,A typical day at UHC consist of answering 50 -100 calls answering questions and assisting customers with benefits or billing information. I've learned that even with upset customer's I am very gentle and kind even if the customer is upset. We have to show respect and compassion even with upset customers while my plan of action is to resolve the issue and make the customer feel better in the process. Management was great however there was no one to file complaints to and get complaints resolved. The hardest part of my job was no support during difficult times such as death in the immediate family. The most enjoyable part was knowing I've helped someone today on one or many different calls.
bad,"Poor management, mandatory overtime with no advance notice;  shift change every 3 months went based on seniority versus performance.  No opportunity for advancement and managers tell you that there is an open door policy, but good luck trying to talk to one."
bad,I was certainly a good experience working from home but he pay on the West Coast did not compensate for the cost of living in the West Coast.  Upward mobility for reasonable pay was a bit out of reach.
bad,Monitored to the key stroke. Lack of work life balance. Expected to work mandatory overtime. Management is only interested in productivity and numbers/reports. No opportunity for clinical advancement. Cut throat coworkers with self-entitled mentality and lack of teamwork. A lot of favoritism. Very disappointing.
bad,"the place is ok and the people I work with supervisors are the worst, they talk abou their employees on the floor with everyone listening no coaching and and they have their favorites"
bad,Not a promoter and benefits and healthcare too expensive. Management changes too often. Pay and raises are only for upper management. Not a fan of the culture.
bad,A typical work day consisted of meeting a quota and ensuring quality with eye wear for customers. I learned alot skill base jobs that would advance me in the lab or other optical laboratories based on procedures
bad,"set up the computer and phone to get ready for the day; greet customer on the phone professionally and respectfully; I learned how to treat no 2 calls alike; and management, was not to excepting of recomendations from employees; the hardest part of the job is to hear the plyth of the elderly; but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to educate them on their health plan!"
bad,I learn from every experience.  Management was not practical with expectations.  When people left for other positions there was no grace provided and no additional support offered.  Very stressful.  Poor morale.
bad,"No room for advancement, 9a-6p work hours with 1 hour lunch. Cannot adjust break time to leave early even if you have exceeded the daily goal. Small request to change work hours to 8:30a-5p was denied even with high quality performance and working here for 2+ years. Favoritism is high. Hardest part was work life balance due to commuting/travel. Only enjoyed my break/lunch times. Office is empty with many telecommuters working from home, however, depends on the department to approve you as a telecommuter. Unfortunately, my team was denied permission even though the role only requires mostly outreach calls to members which can easily be done from home."
bad,This job is full of women that keep mess going. You do NOT use your Master's degree that you worked so hard for as a Behavioral Intake Counselor. This is a job for someone that has a associates or a bachelors degree. Your degree is under utilized and you are underpaid. This job focused more on quoting insurance benefits to members versus counseling anyone. SUCKS!!!
bad,Just no don't work for them. Since the Optum merger they want cheap Indian manor and they've brought them here. The Cotton Center is now filled with cheap manor it looks like a call centre in Mumbai. If your not a RN then don't bother.
bad,It was not a hard job but it could be tedious at times. Upper Management was never forth coming in what they were doing. The culture was fine until we found out they were closing the site. I was promoted to a Real Time Analyst but never promoted in pay or permanent positioning with the company
bad,"Temporary position, I learned how to do prior authorizations and answered a lot of phone calls, customer complaints, doctors calls, Everythiing is timed."
bad,Worked there 10 years and was let go over minor errors. They do not accept human error or technical issues. Profit is their only motivation. They care more about profit and members than employees. Bonus programs are removed and replaced with a simple thank you. Employees that have been there almost 20 years are let go. They expect you to learn their programs with little to no training. There are no user manuals. Bottom line is they do not care about employees.
bad,not much good to say because the program was pilot for UHC. met some nice people but supervisors were not as knowledgeable as one would expect. no home and work support.
bad,"This call center runs off of drama. If management isn't being dramatic, then fellow associates are bringing drama within the company. Management does work with and around schedules if need be."
bad,UHC is a always changing company. That allows work at home if requirements are completed. Flexible hours and schedules are allowed per supervisor discretion.
bad,You are micromanaged with your time. The management is terrible. Do not have to miss a day for a doctor appointment or emergency because they will not take doctor's notes and they will fire you for it.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Very frustrating trying to get customers their prescriptions especially if there was a Autorization req and we had to get it overided and that took alot sometimes.
bad,"This place has a revolving door with their employees. I came in with a solid 22 and when I left 3 months later, my class had 9. They do not care about the employees or what they need to do their job. You cant have ANYTHING at your desk, it actually reminds you of a jail cell, No paper products, no snacks, you have VERY strict break times with no time to eat or breathe or potty, managers are all on different pages, very unorganized, the bonus that you ""can earn"" is RARELY earned and very hard to achieve. It's a great place to save a little money up to move on to the next place, but all in all it not worth it. The company as a whole is horrible. They have no intentions of hiring people full time and offer NO benefits until you are. The only reason why they got 2 stars is because I loved the people I worked with and most of the  members were pleasant."
bad,Your team co-workers typically are great people to work with. The leadership is still in dark ages with a command and control mentality and have no loyalty to their subordinates
bad,Great place to work just badly managed and unorganized. Too much favoritism and not enough recognition of the people who actually did their job correctly and accurately.
bad,it was not all that it was all cracked up to be.There is no support and you are left all by yourself.  and it depends on your supervisor if they are pro-agent most of the time they just grill you till you are dead tired too many metrics
bad,"I worked as an onsite case manager. There was a high turnover, low raises each year, and a very heavy caseload most times. There is no room for advancement. There is a lot of favoritism shown and not much support from management. In the 6 years that I worked for the company I had 3 different managers and 6 (maybe more) medical directors. Benefits are not so great for this to be an insurance company. There is no work life balance and there are so many changes that it is hard to keep up. This company also does not pay out the balance of your PTO that you have earned once you leave the company."
bad,"UHC is one of the reasons why people hate corporations..exploiting both their workers and customers..I mean! members. Is not surprise is an HMO company.  The wages are low and don't mind helping people, you're not.  You will be overwork in a point of being mentally ill until they let you go for the smallest mistake such as long holds or wrong transfers.  If you're looking to work in a call center, work for a tech support company, in least you are messing with computers and gadgets not human lives."
bad,This job requires a lot from you. It is decent pay but by the time you receive your paycheck it is half gone. United care charges their employees a lot for benefits.
bad,"Great company, job was very elementary.  Call center.  Was like we were puppets, micro managed.  Might be good for someone fresh out of college or with no education or experience in the working field."
bad,"they do punish you if you don get into it with another coworker, there are so many women there. There is no diversity. There are people that buddy with the manager just to keep their jobs. They will rat you out and listen to your conversation while you are on break. Some of the manager will write you up even if you have a doctors notes. I had a doctors notes. There are so many educated people there it is sad.  they changed rules just so they can keep the client and keep the money coming in!!!"
bad,There is NO comment I would like to make about UHG right now. There isn't much to say about the particular company. I had great Co-workers and good teammates. I don't understand the management in this company.
bad,I worked for Optum for 7 years. Throughout my tenure at the company I excelled and received several promotion while employed their. The hardest part of the job was being held accountable for other people action and work ethics when they aren't always the same as mine. I enjoyed the experience and the ability to build strong relationship with the employees and clients I served.
bad,"very UNWELCOMING ENVIRONMENT. Felt strangely out of place at first, and overall this did not improve during my employment."
bad,"Very disorganized, a lot of favoritism, offer to advance within the company made on paper but the reality was quite different. Constant departmental in-fighting resulting in watered down or purely ineffective efforts at improving plan efficiency. Not a good experience overall. Pay was, as well, not commensurate with the level of difficulty inherent to the position. Coworkers were wonderful for the most part. A good sense of humor was a daily requirement. Actually solving a member's plan issue and contacting them with a resolution was the best part of any day."
bad,UnitedHealth Group works you like a dog for very little reward. You have to carry the work of other people in order to get anything accomplished because colleagues are not accountable for their work. All the hardworking people leave as soon as they can.
bad,"Once United Healthcare cam in and took over Hospice Inspiris the company went to the dumps. They don't care about their employees or their patients, they just want the census and the numbers. they do not have a good reputation in the community at all. If you go to work as a field hospice nurse, be prepaired to give up all hours of your life! They suck the energy out of you. Management is horrible!"
bad,"thyere very unorganized from training and beyond.. systems dont work and they is alwasy a gray area so about 90% wer're just as confused as the members. my manager is hardly at work and when he is, he is on a project to help better his own career. and the for this to be benefit administrators, employss have some od the worst benefits. ive heard that multple time from my own dentists,smh."
bad,"This company started off showing all the positive that it could be, however numerous mistakes are made by the mgrs which have a negative effect on others."
bad,"Management didn't seem to care about employees or how the forced OT (10 - 20 hour a week) affects their health, home life, etc. No opportunities for advancement unless you ""knew"" someone. Moral is very low. Written up or put on Final warning for being seconds late from break, or to leave your desk in emergency bathroom situation, or to find someone to answer questions pertaining to work."
bad,"UHC community plans is the step child of united healthcare, corporate is interested only in their group business not the Medicaid population or the people selling to them.  Unrealistic quota, daily expectations are ridiculous and management that knows their days are numbered so we must be constantly micromanaged in the nastiest way possible by a team that can barely figure out how to do an enrollment.  I am sorry I left my old job to come here. They promised more Money then took it away with the cost of my health coverage. I am barely making more and I am miserable here."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,United Healthcare is a great place to learn to see if you want to work in the heath insurance industry.  It is fast pace where heavy expectation is  given in mandatory overtime while the management plays on their I phones.
bad,"Trabalho super estressante,lhe dar com pessoas de todos os tipos (sendo que a maioria super nervosas), colegas de trabalhos compreensivos e dispostos a te ajudar,chefia não entendendo o seu lado,te sulgando o máximo que puder;"
bad,"Uma ótima empresa, que valoriza o funcionário, mas estou em busca de uma outra área."
bad,"I deal with pharmacy benefit plans with a focus on public sector like medicaid, workers compensation, and beneficiaries to veterans. I can take 40 -60 calls a day from members, pharmacies, and physician offices. Ive learned a lot about the ambiguity of insurance plans and yet I was hired to interpret the plan's procedures to our callers. I am then graded on if I said unprofessional words like ""gonna"" versus ""going to"" but then were told not to talk above our members because we need to be able to relate. Management is usually unaware how to coach us because every situation is different but were being graded on generalities. My co-workers are awesome which is why I havent comitted professional suicide yet. The hardest part is having no real authority to help the members, any call I get i have to refer them somewhere else because I was not provided the tools to really aid anyone. We basically gloss over information while exasperating the members because they are looking for simplicity but we confuse them further and then refer them somewhere else. I am then made to stay at my desk where they give us 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch which we cannot put together for an hour lunch. If we are 1 min late from break or lunch we are considered out of adherance which will then rank you low and you may never become permanent at this company. The enjoyable part only is the people I work with, period. I have received tokens that was suppose to add up to a gift card 08/2012 and I have yet to see that incentive. I also have received compliment calls that I have never been recognized"
bad,"I worked at UHC for a year exactly. After 2 months I knew that the BS that was fed to us daily during training was just that, BS. They will throw so much at you in regards to their work/life balance and advancement opportunities, tuition reimbursement, etc but at the end of the day it was hog wash."
bad,8-5pm
bad,there is no real advancement and training is non exsistent.
bad,"Good health benefits, pay is not good. Environment is not good."
bad,"Training experience was great but once I was out on the production floor on a team, I started to see the true colors of the company. I expressed to my supervisor in training that I wanted to make a career at UHG but didn't want to spend my entire time on the phone. Although I had exceeded all the call center metrics and had the knowledge needed to move up, my supervisor would not allow me to move on because I made his team stats look good. He gave me horrible evaluations and when I asked him why he bluntly told me that he couldn't afford to lose me off his team. Those evaluations stopped me from getting promotions and raises that I deserved. I tried to go over my supervisor's head to his boss, but they were best friends for over 10 yrs so he supported any decision my supervisor made. I ended up having to take two mental health leaves from all the stress before eventually resigning."
bad,"The company is very focused on training at the start of new projects, and they do a great job in this area. However, management is often unclear about numbers needed to do meet criteria for projects - will tell coders/auditors they are doing well for weeks and then ""flip the switch"" one day (especially when it comes to projects that have tough CPH). I feel like there is truly no culture when you work remote for this company - the only person I ever spoke to was my supervisor (sometimes once a month) for him to give me a progress report."
bad,"When I was initially hired I was not only told but promised certain financial expectations especially during the annual enrollment period, we worked over 60 hours a week, with not hardly as many sales as promised, and then after aep our expected checks were THOUSANDS less than promised during our AEP season, very disappointed in this position over all. And then your hours are dropped to 32 hours with not even a slight increase in pay."
bad,"The work is easy. However the PC set up is horrible and IT can’t seem to fix it. While the dress code is very casual and laid back, the people in general are mean and gossip a lot. The managers play favorites, blatantly."
bad,"Layoffs regularly occur making employees feel insecure and stressed. Company is more focused on metrics than anything else. You will be micromanaged to death with no flexibility. Management is very poor and not supportive. It very much feels like you are working in a factory. The pros are the ability to work at home , and decent benefits."
bad,would not recommend Optum Rx work assignments but recommend UHG work that does not deal with the pharmacy end of things. Office was to big where I was located and you are just another number. They do not train well at all. Too much info and supervisors who don't know how to help. You will get on the floor and be lost for lack of knowledge from management.
bad,"Everyone gets the same training, but the training that is given does not really help for the job in play. The company needs to focus on performance more."
bad,If you want to be micromanaged every minute and be yelled at by leads and supervisors who are just seeing you as a number and not a person than this is the right place. The training was good however the attitude  od the leads and managers is very high school and completely  unprofessional. It's not even worth the training but at least its paid and you really get to lern something.  If in the end you want to be treaeted as a number it's  totally  up to you.
bad,If you like being moved to different teams every couple of months due to “restructuring” and never being given clear direction this is the job for you....
bad,Management unsupportive and lacks empathy and compassion. They don’t care about you succeeding in your role and will work you to the bone with no care in the world
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,I have nothing to say. I don't like this place. I don't like the environment and people. They are not friendly. They don't want to share there knowledge.
bad,"I was excited to work at UHC because of the good things I've heard about the company. That took a turn when I started the job and was micromanaged about everything. The position (customer advocate) I was in was more concerned with employee stats rather the the members themselves. If you want have 20 coachings a week, stressful calls, high demands,no help, and low pay then this is the job. I since left and I can say I am a lot happier since being gone."
bad,"United Healthcare is a huge company that only respected overall payroll over employee care.  Benefits were horrendous, pay was not up to par with industry standards and management frequently changed due to cost cutting or payroll reductions.  Overall was not a good experience, however I did learn a lot during my time there about analytics."
bad,"A typical day is on the phone all day, you have to stick to your schedule, no extra bathroom breaks (you need Dr excuse if you have issues). Some management is not helpful at all, some don't want to be bother, so hopefully you get a good supervisor. There is a 4 week training period and the class I was in I  had 15 people in the class there was a lot of playing around, arguing, and trainer was not professional. Very cliquish, not professional environment. The best part I met some cool people who was willing to help me when I struggled, they have a counselor who you can talk to when going through stress."
bad,"None, they hired me as contract to hire. After s 6 months contract I was hired as a full time associate. Open my transfer. He then cut my pay 1.50/hr. Siting we give you benefits. I replied I pay for my benefits. They did but care so be very careful about a position within the company."
bad,"There was almost no training for this position. After I expressed the need for more training and that I feel like I cannot do what is expected of me because I have never received training on it, the manager asked me to provide list of exactly what I wanted training on. After I provided said list, they simply never responded."
bad,"It is ok under the right management. The company bought out another company to gain more income. This was a great decision, however it seems they could have been better prepared."
bad,"I never received a raise the entire time I worked here, which was 4 years. Even when I was promoted to another position, I did not get a raise. The work culture was so relaxed it was ridiculous."
bad,"Theres times in the call center at UHC the environment would feel like your still in high school. Gossiping consistently there and one would think Management or your Supervisor would assist with any issues or concerns.., it’s more like using open door policy does have consequences."
bad,I wanted a transfer to another department and was blocked numerous times due to childish and harassing behavior. An awful manager and management. IJS!
bad,"It was really unclear who was driving the ship.  Decisions were made without much logic, or explanation.  Resulting in a constantly stressed, and overworked, team."
bad,"This mission statement of United Health Group is of one which anyone would be excited to stand by and work for, but the actually environment in which you work is awful. My particular department had no opportunity for growth. The metrics are unfair, and management is poor. Management did not have interpersonal skills and never shared best practices."
bad,"The job will just keep giving more and more line of business in ur plate but the pay stays the same.Management makes you're job harder and stressful, all they do is si in an office and talk about the people they don't like and plot to make their life impossible till they either quit or they get fired. Employees don't last.HR cases will get you fired."
bad,Management hires all their friends and does not worry about everyone else working there. Management consistently changes the process without input of the ones doing the job.
bad,Started out great. Then went nowhere. Countless great reviews and no advancement. Very structured workplace. Helping the customers was the only rewarding thing. Hitting metrics and still not getting bonuses happens a lot. Being shadowed by training classes and not getting any recognition or pay increases.
bad,This job began great I was very thankful management for the transportation dept was horrible the supervisor used to only favor certain types of ppl and the manager sat back watched and defended her overall my experience was horrible the need to seriously do something about national medtrans islandia office management
bad,"disorganized, no predetermined vision, chaos, changing roles, horrible hiring manager, saw her 2 times for 5 minutes each time. could not wait till i left the account."
bad,Its all about who you know and get along with. That's the only way to last at this place. I tried moving to a different position  but never got a call back and I was already in.
bad,"The job I interviewed for was advertised as a ""Reporting Analyst"" yet my actual interview was for a Senior Customer Service Professional.  It took six times to interview for the job.  The turnover rate is extremely high at UHC.  I had no idea I would be working in a call center; it was never touched upon or mentioned in the interview.  I enjoyed the interview and the interviewer ended up being my manager.  She was awesome!  She knew how to coach and build up camaraderie in her group.  At some point she was dismissed, however, and I am sure it had to do with her ""numbers""."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Need to pay more.benefits for employees are the worst  High deductibles, quarterly bonuses double taxed which defeat purpose. Low company moral in dep"
bad,"It was a great job at first and then it went downhill. Advancement is due to favoritism or who you know. It's a very successful work environment, I wouldn't reccomend this job to someone who's easily stressed. Management is not great either."
bad,No structure due to new contract for Military and Veterans so I left. A lot of us were hired from the previous contract company which I was ok since I still needed a job. But they picked out brains. I was in a different department but because I understood the job from school and experience they wanted to learn how we did it with the other contract. The only positive I got from this job was I got promoted quickly and I enjoyed my title and helping my team. I was sad to leave them.
bad,"Poor work/life balance. Poor mgmt. unable to fix multiple problems within department to stop overwhelming turnover and burnout. Unrealistic expectations for production. Very heavy emphasis on production over quality. Poor raises. Most received no more than 1-2% annually "
bad,"Only care about their bottom line period. Lots of adorning qords in their culture statmnes and mission goals...meaningless. no room for advancement, no honoring of employees as people, they are numbers only. Rigid policies that are outdated. They reward Yes men only."
bad,"Starting to run the company like a prison. Not helpful nor hopeful for those 3+ years in to hear from older employees how great it used to be and how easy (more opportunity for advancement) 10+ years ago due to the amount of work and policies increasing. Sadly the focus and drive of the company for  those in the Customer Service Department has taken a horrible turn...turnover rate is about to sky rocket under bad leadership decisions, meaning loosing quality people that stayed and made the  company decisions work just be over looked for any advancement opportunity. DO NOT APPLY if you are looking to be promoted from Customer Service after putting in years to meet and exceed expectations, picking up extra work (you are not paid for), and having great attendance. They have even stopped giving rewards (which are given as points) for employees to purchase merchandise with for this department as they no longer have a budget for it...however the demand of work increases every week. Company also laid off the entire department..very concerning. Health benefit options are terrible, expensive with little coverage."
bad,"At the Irving location things start out great. The staff comes off friendly and nurturing. They lure you in with all the bonus talk etc. Once you hit the floor from the extensive training it's everyone for themselves so I would suggest trying to find a mentor within the office. Expect the managers and team leads to have a title but A) not know sufficient skills for their role B) never be at their desks C) micro-manage when their bosses come into town to visit the office D) be rewarded based on politics not metrics E) drill and harp on attendance meanwhile not being in accordance with strict attendance policies themselves. The best thing about the company is the 401K and stock buying options. Make sure you take full advantage of those as team managers will have you fired when they are intimidated by you and your skill sets and also to make room for their excessive new training classes. The turnover rate at the Irving office is subpar and demonstrates the effects of poor management and leadership. Look at your role as only temporary. I might add the morale is exceptionally low across the board and teams. There is no room for career growth or advancement at the Irving site as team managers do not approve for you to leave their teams when your stats are exceptional. Also, if you do not like change this is not the company for you as metrics change frequently which also affects your quarterly bonuses. Pay is decent. Bonuses are competitive. 401k is amazing."
bad,This place is a stressed environment. It’s actually like your in high school all over again when it comes to drama. Stay away from this place yes starting pay may be good but you only get like 20cent raises each year.
bad,i really do not wish to type anything in the box. i am only doing so so that i may move on and apply for more jobs. I haven't worked with UHC for four years and don't remember very much.
bad,"management in call center was only promoted through the job. They do not have the experience in their roles. They say there is a bonus to earn, but the call center does everything they can to prevent you from actually earning that bonus. Don't ever plan on being sick. If you are sick it count as an occurance for an entire year. If you have children, they do not make any exceptions for daycare arrangements or accept doctor's notes for sick children. They will put you on a CAP for corrective action. if you are on a CAP you cannot receive your bonus, apply for jobs, or bid for a good schedule even if you meet all other metrics. There is not any work/life balance, and the health care is horrible."
bad,"Work is like 5th grade soccer team. First everyone goes one way and then the other. All together, trying to do each other's job. They think the ""Open Office"" is like Google and productive. It is distracting at best. You get a different desk every day."
bad,Not a good place for a person looking for a career or long term job assignment. The company did not keep provide proper tools to wrk with to accomplish the goals they set for the employees to complete the expected task.
bad,"My time  with united Healthcare was spent watching the company say one thing and do another. the company is divided as branches "
bad,Too many changes with management which made it a stressful environment..Pay raises were not given for cost of living only on doing more work that what was required
bad,Everyday you learn at a curve . Physial building was clean . Management was rude not helpful . Trainer was boraderline unprofeshional rude manipulative . Coworkers are very cliquesih like high school . Mirco managed to go to bathroom . Pay was good
bad,"Very low pay with minimal opportunities for career advancement. I had to work very long hours, including on weekends in order to handle and manage account deadlines. Work/life balance was not acceptable."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,They monitored every second of the work day.  Never given time to check your coding for the best code.  Always pushed to do more. No support from management.
bad,"Although UHG claims to care about their consumers, they really only care about making money.  Employees work in a ""churn and burn"" environment, and cultural protocols are not followed by many senior executives."
bad,"Company always wants more,more,more from their advocates yet doesn’t fairly compensate their employees and gives no fair chance at what is suppose to be a quarterly incentive yet if you get bonus you get two months after the quarter ended."
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for.  Management is as confused as the workers are most of the time.  They treat everybody different depending on if they like you or not.  They definetly micro manage, with mouse watching and computer shadowing.  You are lucky to be able to use the restroom with out them wanting to know why your mouse wasnt moving.  If you can go along to get along then you will fit in, if you ask questions or challenge anyone this isnt the company for you.  They do NOT enjoy people that challenge them."
bad,"UHC strives to minimize costs associated with caring for patients, while maximizing bonuses for their upper level management.It was very difficult to stomach the ethics at this company."
bad,"Optum is very cut throat.  You don't perform you will lose your job.  The management micro manages every second you are working. Very stressful.  Learned a ton, but it is not for the weak."
bad,"The work life environment is one of the worst that I've experienced. I've gotten married and celebrated a birthday within 2 weeks of each other and my manager nor sup has told me happy birthday or congrats. Everyone here has really bad attitudes and  that is the tone for the whole office. right out of training no one wants to assist, they just tell you to look  it up. I have a team lead, and a supervisor who doesn't seem to do anything daily except sit around and gossip. My supervisor rolls her eyes at many of the reps below her. The products that are sold is completely  useless and are a complete ripoff. They are basically stealing peoples money (individual policies, not group, employee policies). The metrics are very easy to meet, so just try to stick it out until leaving the call center or finding a better company."
bad,"profit driven a little related to their mission and what they are advertising."
bad,Everything that is wrong with American corporate IT culture is on display at UnitedHealth Group/Optum Services.  They have systematically devalued the role of development by insisting on using the cheapest labor available.
bad,"Long interview process—but makes sense as they are looking for certain people"
bad,"Management at Costa Mesa, CA will lie to trick you into doing what they want you to do as far as working hours, volunteering for projects, volunteering to come in on a certain day for 1 time will all of a sudden turn into a permanent schedule. They don't care about people who have leadership abilities and try to go above and beyond for customers and coworkers."
bad,"Great for recent grads, poor for experienced professionals. Very compartmentalized, hard to move projects forward. Compensation is decent, atmosphere is ok."
bad,"Company is production driven, micro-monitoring employees and constantly increases the metric scale. Overwork and underpaid. Annual raise is very small 1-2% raise, however bonus is given to top producer thus increases the metric scale."
bad,"I was hired on a temp contract. During the interview I asked the question if this was the way to eventually become FTE. They said yes. However, that is not true (may be for very few). The manager was so desperate to get help for her department she did not bother to give me a truthful answer. I was micromanaged to the edge of work harassment.  The story did not end with an extension or an actual job offer. Do not recommend getting in this company, unless you are the type that has the high ability to be a follower and not a leader. If looking for a career change, this may be ok to put something on your resume, but do not get comfortable. No HR to get your back. I repeat, no respect for contractors. You will be on your own. I worked reviewing marketing materials in alternative languages."
bad,"Unless you're hired on a managerial level, and have no ethical qualms denying care that is required for some more so than others because of their plan"
bad,"unfortunately  there is not much good that be said about this place. the building is new and its a nice looking environment as far as looks go.  The training and management is very poor and in many cases non existent or training is interrupted for an urgent need for reps to answer calls they are not yet prepared to handle. There is an ego issue among some of the management group that often creates a hostile work environment. The hardest part of the job is trying to get answers to critical info needed to support your role as an employee. "
bad,Over the past years UHG has lost its compassion for their employees and their need for work life balance. Benefits are being systematically reduced while costs for what they continue to provide keep increasing. They have reduced staffing and increased workloads. They state their culture is a pay for performance structure but they continue to provide minimal compensation to high performing teams while the company continues to post record returns during the same time frames.
bad,Management is the only reason I am looking for another job. I have been in my current position 8 months and have never had a conversation with my manager.
bad,"Clean and secure building, but the company is still a bit in the dark ages. There is little to no flex time schedule and you take on many job duties, but the wages are not a reflection of the job. I took a pay cut when I took this position because of potential  advancement opportunities within the company. Workplace culture is not as diverse as  some of the other companies that I have worked and it is more of a corporate atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is advancing to other open positions, which is why I have decided to move on. The most enjoyable part of the job are some of your coworkers. I think that this a good place to work for recent graduates, but not for established individuals who are looking to be rewarded for their hard work or job advancements."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Leadership is shady, training is mediocre, training materials are dated and grammatically incorrect. Any complaints brought to leadership incurred through the training process is brushed off with the trainer being protected. No support after training is complete, even when help is specifically requested."
bad,Over Worked - underpaid - You may have PTO to use but if it is not approved by HR you cant take it. Raises are based on the TEAM production not personal contributions. If a system error is noted it may take months to get resolved if ever.
bad,Company is always watching you.  You were forced to sell and were written up if you didn't make sales goals.  All avenues of culture from all different backgrounds.  Have to really like working in a call center setting with watching eyes on you at all times.
bad,"Poor leadership and work a lot!  There's a lot of flexibility, but you'll work a lot and have a ton of meetings.  The culture is competency based and other departments, including your own - will throw you under the bus..."
bad,Not a great place to work because of management and colleagues. The manager is rude with a nasty attitude as well as some of the staff. They love talking down to black people for some reason.
bad,"Does not live their mission"
bad,Don't work here. Poor Management. Lack of discipline. no training available. Horrible leaders. Lack of safety equipment for handling dangerous drugs. Don't work here.
bad,The job in itself was a non stressful position. Educating the customers on the healthcare. However the meetings every day were repetitive and time consuming.
bad,The commute was horrible. Upper management was not very good to work for.  Very condescending towards employees. Not a fan of the higher management. Pay wasn’t very good!
bad,My 1st supervisor was amazing. It took me almost 2 years to move around in the company when I clearly had the experience to move. Of course you are told all these good things in training you can move around in a year if you do what you are suppose to....LIES. Takes forever to get a interview and when a department finally wants to hire you its a bilateral move. Insurance companies do not want to deal with UHC because they don't seem to get paid or don't trust them so u will have to come of out of pocket a lot. The best thing about the company was how we were treated after Harvey. They didn't want to let us leave the Friday before the hurricane but once the hurricane hit we were off with pay almost 2 weeks and longer if you needed.
bad,"Trolls in management. Very poor work life balance. Little recognition of talent. Advancement not encouraged."
bad,I don't recommend for anyone to work at that company. They have poor management and Human Resources is unconcerned about their employees and are completely useless.
bad,"maybe its just the appeals department but it was always a total mess. Working for a large company means policy and procedures can change often and quickly, but management does not pass that information on to their employees until after a mistake is made. tons of micro management happening and if you have a suggestion or a genuine question, you are spoken to like an idiot."
bad,"Not invented here (Minneapolis)...centralized decisionmaking....highly matrixed, but not accountable."
bad,"The environment is constantly changing.  A typical corporate job.  Very competitive.  Find a good manager, keep your head down and keep your eyes open."
bad,"many managrment problems,seems like they only care about what the employees can do as far as how much work, don't really care about employees as a person"
bad,I had a schedule and goal of visiting a certain number of clients to visit and do documentation on per week.  I also had to attend many meetings and answer to several directors about my documentation.  The procedures changed frequently increasing the workload.  It was impossible to meet the expectations of my managers and do a good job helping my clients.
bad,"Empresa que aprecia ""puxa-saco"", não valoriza funcionário que quer aprender, muitos superiores não olham para todos os membros de sua equipe desvalorizando aqueles que estão realmente dispostos à ajudar o desenvolvimento de seus produtos e valorizar mais a empresa. Muitos viraram coordenadores sendo despreparados para o cargo. Empresa comprometimento para todos seus superiores e engajamento de todos em tudo que sua equipe faça porém,  há não delegação para alguns colaboradores. Posteriormente são ditos que não servem para trabalhar na equipe e são demitidos. Falta de treinamentos fundamentais em muitas áreas para melhor apresentação e desenvolvimento das áreas e produtos. Sem plano de carreira. Sem aumento de salário."
bad,Annual raises are from 0.05 -0.10 cents a year. No room for advancement. No development plan for seasonal employees after furthering their education. Employees are underpaid and extremely overworked.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Working as an MTM call center pharmacist was mind numbing and monotonous.  The management team makes decisions based on emotion.  Office politics are crucial to getting promoted.
bad,If you are not one of the chosen ones be prepared to stay in the same position if you are not one of the supervisors favorites. You can work your hardest and break records for highest perfect user reviews and not get any recognition. You can meet and exceed every metric they put in front of you and somehow still rank at the bottom of the pack.
bad,"The pay is great. "
bad,There is no chance of advancement in the company. They say there is when you interview but there isn't any. the more experience you have the less they want to advance you.
bad,"A typical day of work there was filled with stressors and unrealistic demands. Upper management is constantly changing there minds and what you learn today changes by tomorrow. Turnovers were high and the caseloads were higher then in any other ltc plan. If you can work somewhere else, save yourself the trouble and stress and work somewhere else."
bad,The actual job is not difficult. The hard part is not being able to actually help members when they need it the most. You have to often deliver bad news to already struggling members and no solutions to help make situations better.
bad,"At first this job seemed great. You got great pay and wonderful training. After the training was said and done you went on to the sales floor. At first they give you their expectations, which at first is simple. Then as the days go on the expectations change on the hour. One second you need more calls then you are taking too many calls. And it wasn't just a select few individuals. Everyone was getting told they were doing something wrong. Then when the season was over they gave out the assignments for everyone. They at first told me that i was going to be continuing on. The day before I was supposed to start my new assignment I was told I would be laid off before the end of 2016. Not only did they lay me off they also made it to where i could not get unemployment. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY."
bad,Forcing philosophical talking points down your throat about how we all need to be accepting and loving and tolerant of others beliefs. Sick hypocrisy!
bad,"In most parts of IT, work-life balance is poor.  The company routinely assigns 8-10 simultaneous projects to a project manager, and the various major divisions, which are legally separate entitites with their own profit and loss, do not cooperate well on joint IT projects.  Executive management has put the IT organizations through multiple large reorganizations in an attempt to adopt Agile at scale and speed delivery.  These have destroyed long-standing working relationships, reduced inter-team cooperation and worsened morale.  Another large re-org is in process now (Q1 2017) which reverses several aspects of the 2016 reorganizations.  "
bad,If you are liked from the beginning you will move up otherwise it's just a matter of time before they try and get rid of you . Those that are liked get lots of perks those that are not walk on needles
bad,"Expected to work 50+ hours a week, leadership disorganized, no sense of direction leading to confusion and frustration."
bad,"no structure, people constantly quitting. managers are immature. and no help when you need it. you also do not get to pick your own schedules. they are just handed to you whether you liek it or not."
bad,"There is more opportunity for lateral job movement and challenging work than most companies. The management practices are less than desirable regarding career growth, promotional opportunities, and pay for performance. If you come into UHG/Optum, negotiate for a higher salary as adjustments are unjust and it is all about how high your salary is when you enter the organization. HR/HC will pay new hires outside of the organization in lesser positions more than someone with 10+ yrs of experience in a higher position, no adjustments are made. A lot of Sr. Management talk the company culture, but it is still about their bottom line and bonus, I have never seen such greed in Sr Management. Very poor Career Growth once you reach lower level management."
bad,"Everything lacks direction.  Everybody thinks they know everything. If you are not a know it all, it makes day to day life very frustrating."
bad,This is the only company that I have worked for that does not have a good job work/life balance. It is very difficult to use the hours that you have accumulated for personal time off. If you have an emergency and need to leave early or come in late management requires you to make up the time along with using your PTO.
bad,"Wellmed is a good group to work for, I was very happy when I first started with the company. I knew what my title was Utilization Case Management Sr. Coordinator. This consisted of me to working with nurses and medical directors to approve and disapprove treatment authorizations or review claims that claim specialist could not get paid. In any job a person must be grounded first of all, it's good to keep and open mind and be prepared for the unexpected. When I found out that United would be taking over our department it concerned me greatly! Only because,  I knew United had a high employee turn over rate, I have friends who are doctors, nurses, medical billers and coders, who also worked directly with United Health Care needless to say I was warned. I found in a matter of months there was drastic changes, training which I was given managers in my area were not going by training manual. this was reported to training team but nothing ever came of it. I loved it when Wellmed had control of department, once it became United chaos hit. I do not approve of gossip, berating of an employee in front of other employees, the discussion of an employee personal life or income rate increase with another employee by management or lead. QA was done but not done in fairness, your QA is important to overall advancement not only for company but employee. The training given by Wellmed, if United had new set of rules new training is required because the employee suffers. Many complaints were lodged to HR by employees but went unheard by United. I feel much of this can be remedied by keeping watch"
bad,UHC didn't approve of overtime but gave you so much work that you couldn't get it all done in 8 hours and most of it could not be carried over to the next day. No work/life balance at all.
bad,"would not suggest. glued to your desk, with very strick adherence you must follow. there are many conflictions when trying to figure out the correct way to handle something. very cold and unfriendly environment. horrible benefits"
bad,"UHG has lofty goals.  Unfortunately it's goals and its actions are incongruent.  The organization openly expresses support of work-life balance while piling on excessive work with unreasonable deadlines.  The desire to ""fulfill contractual obligations"" that are unreasonable (based upon current staffing models and workloads).  You find yourself having to choose between life, health, family, and career on a daily basis.  It is easy to become jaded and not even recognize the compassion and caring professional you were when you began your career with them."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"An emplyee has to complete things on his own.  There motto should be ""take ownerdhip"" because that is all they say.  I never grew, was never led."
bad,"Worst company with poor management team. "
bad,"A typical day consist of claims back to back and your numbers have to be 100% per day. We get complicated claims and you have to have them resolved in 5 minutes which is unreal. The company has a very high metric to meet and it is almost undo able. You will constantly struggle with the numbers and be put on a cap ( probation ) constantly. The group suffers from low morale and most are always looking for a job. The company ha a culture in this department where managers don't communicate or talk or speak in the morning and i have been through 3 managers working on 4, and the mood is the same. All they care about is numbers and the culture is one that is least desirable. The hardest part of the job is being in a environment where you know the company does not care about you. Its a very cold place. The most enjoyable part of this job is the pay, that is it.  Its also a place that explains training last for almost a year, claims are difficult but when your year is up they will not likely  give you a merit raise if you were not 100% of your metric, which you would not be if your in training 9 months , which by the way was cut back from being in training 1 year. Therefore, when new claims rep come in they make more money than you do and you have been there doing claims for over a year. That is just wrong. I worked for this company that provides insurance to the world,  but its employees have the worst insurance on the planet. Its covers nothing unless you meet a $5000.00 deductible."
bad,"When employed in the claims department the old management made working for this company exciting. It was a great work life balance, easy to move around within similar segments of the company. They pride themselves on diligent training materials. All in all it was great. Once it changed hands of management, it has gone down hill. The customer was no longer the focus of production or work. Micro managing became the main focus to management. In the results of poorly thought out managerial decisions, customer contracts were lost and 2/3 of the employees in that department was either fired or quit. It was just tragic. Those talented employees have found employment with other companies who valued their abilities, utilize their educational experiences and offered better pay. As of now for todays date of 2/28/2015 I wouldn't recommend anyone I cared for to work in the claims department."
bad,"So, all jobs have positive and negative aspects.  UnitedHealth has great sounding policies, but the application of such policies is spotty.  Managers actions are arbitrary if the manager is arbitrary."
bad,"no chance for advancement "
bad,Worked 70-80 hours per week with frequent employee turnover. Management discouraging and not supportive.
bad,This company is a job. The training sucks. They stand in front of a class and read off a screen. We could have gotten more by reading it ourselves. The management also stunk because they were never in the building because they are working at home. I like the people but hated the job.
bad,"A typical day included seeing 3-7 patients and scurrying from visit to visit. & trying to get in touch with primary care providers during the 9-5 business hours during your day.  Coming home at night and charting, while calling clients for your next visit day. Often answering circular Emails about client while charting until 0100 in am. My efficiency went up 100% and doing anything I could to decrease charting during off hours.  This is a job for a type A personality with a workaholic mind set and no family."
bad,"The hours could be better, but the people that I work with make every day fun."
bad,Medsynergies is an ok place to work but needs to learn to test things out before just going with it and do all that work and end up reverting to the previous way of doing things.  Not stable had 2 layoffs within 2 years without prior notice the second time.  Low paying job with a lot of work expected.
bad,"lot of politics, leadership very slow to take decisions. Lot of resistance to change and improvement of old processes."
bad,"No flexibility with work schedule on site"
bad,"Análise de processos, digitação, auxiliar administrativo, contato com outros setores."
bad,There is no direction and management is not working to address it
bad,I believe that comfort care transportation is a company with good old boys.  Thtere is to much buddy-buddy system.  The management at comfort care transportation is not intrested in the lives of it's drivers.  they do not take serious the information that is passed on to the management from the driver's about condition's on the road and the patients that we serve.  they say that they listen but they do not.
bad,Long hours due to mandatory overtime but not given raises or bonuses on an annually basis.
bad,"I worked for United Healthcare in Southfield, Michigan as a Provider Phone Representative and it was the worst job I have ever had. The supervisor was under educated and should have retired over 3 years ago. The supervisor used fear and intimidation to communicate with staff opposed to coaching and developing. She was not an effective listener; only listened to find fault and get her point across. On one occasion and employee abruptly quit and was going to jump on her because of the way she harassed her on a daily basis. The turn over rate is very high and the rate of pay is not competitive. Lastly, if you were not one of the supervisor's favorites, your record would be filled with damaging reviews which would keep you working for her and unable to move to another department. Although there was not much you could advance to in Southfield, Mi, but there were opportunities to telecommute within other parts of the company."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Pay is mediocre and the health insurance benefits are the worst I have ever seen!  Days off are very limited.  Didn't realize how bad the health insurance was until I started working for UHC.  Had to find a position with better benefits after working for UHC for 8 months.  If you have to supply health insurance for yourself or family, you might want to rethink employment with UHC.  I also found their corporate ""culture"" brain washing at times and they have an extremely uptight office working environment. "
bad,"While this promised to be a career, the disorganization, lack of real leadership, and overall morale crushing trend of no communication has convinced me that this is just a job."
bad,No real benefits. Stressful. Most enjoyable part was helping others.
bad,I learned so much working at United Healthcare. There is an extensive training over benefits & claims that'll benefit me for the rest of my life.
bad,The education and training materials available are excellent for the self-starter to get up to speed.
bad,"Great benefits, flexible hours, other than this I dont have much else to say about this employer"
bad,"Working with the company for over a year now, not a bad job but management is horrible! Lots of favoritism at my center, lots of compliance violations that were brought to the compliance departments attention and this MA got away with everything! Oh and I should also mention the retaliation that is going on and HR has done nothing! They don’t care about the good employees who actually show up and do their job!"
bad,The team that I worked for provided no work life balance. Expect to work 45 to 50 hours a week and still not be caught up with cases and documentation. Case loads ran in upper 100's and sometimes had to drive up to an hour to complete a home visit.
bad,With this company i felt as if they didn't care about their employees. There were no options for advancements. What I experienced is that they just wanted claims completed and done correctly and made sure you were on time.
bad,Make sure you have a good manager or your job is doom. Never heard from my manager when I sent email but only 20% of my entire time with Optum. Manager was focus on offshore team then onshore.
bad,"The supervisors only care that you meet your goals so they can get money in their pocket, they don't care about the employees unless they are kissing their butt. They can't help you half the time with problems cause they don't know the job themselves but they are suppose to be leading you. Overall the company only cares about the big hires, if your further down the list you pretty much get stepped on while they put all that money in their bank accounts for you to show pretty much nothing for it. Don't take my word for it, there are plenty of people that can tell you stories about how they are treated poorly at this company which is why they have such a big turn over and can't maintain loyal employees."
bad,"I did not like the bad environment, poor management, and un professionalism that this company has. If they could clean that up it would be a better place to work at."
bad,Not for people planning to advance in the careers. Leadership heavy with lot of layers and lot of unnecessary collaboration. Not much job safety with layoffs off late.
bad,"No flexible scheduling, mo room for growth in position, no morality to employess but wants us to have both emphathy and sympathy when hire ups are having personal issues."
bad,"Work here if you need a job or it's an opportunity to learn. Save every penny--the layoffs are frequent, the severance is low & culture is backbiting."
bad,"Sucks terrible awful lousy don't work here. Underpaid, metrics are terrible. Training non existent. Coworkers are backstabbing don't work here. They promise you world it promotions are few and they will at off with no warning."
bad,"This is a call center, time limit for customer contact and will loose your job if you do not limit your talk time. This is not a customer service position helping until the customer is satisfied."
bad,"They are the largest provider in the world. "
bad,"They have no interest in being progressive in their management skills. The culture is basically, do your job. They do not pay overtime. They will tell you they do, but you will be expected to take flex time and still get all the same amount of work done and so you are still working over 40 hours. It is a Good Old Boy mentality. If you are pretty and young, you will get listened to, otherwise, keep your head down. Most managers on up, are males. "
bad,I am uninterested in writing this.  There is a character count so I will continue for that reason.  I did not enjoy my time there.  They look at quantity over quality.  I did not feel good about providing patient care with this organization.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Tremendous amount of layoffs right now, 3000+ were let go this week. There is no work life balance, constantly being asked to do more with less. Employee bonuses go down while Sr. Management is cashing in on 7 figures regularly. With the inherent risk of health insurance in the forthcoming political cycle, talent is leaving the industry and is not replaced by competent staff. I'm activity looking myself right now. Pay is sub-par for equal work with other organizations, salary increases are minimal, employee level bonus is mediocre, health insurance is surprisingly bad for a health insurance organization. Overall I would not recommend working here."
bad,"super easy job. managers are never on the same page about company policies, you'll get a different answer from every person you speak with. the agents direct managers are awesome but the higher ups dont care about you. Do not let them fool you for a second. They let go tons of loyal employees that were there 10+ years and even fired the man who started national med trans, all out of the blue without telling anyone and the reason was ""downsizing"".  Security is one of the most important aspects of a job and you will NOT get it here."
bad,"UHC is almost too large for anyone to successfully navigate. There are lots of resources, but little to no training on how to access them. Overall, it’s an ocean of people and departments with a lot of different “leadership” silos that rarely coordinate. Also, UHC’s benefits are generally not very good and hiring freezes and surprise layoffs to make earning numbers are an annual occurrence."
bad,Not satisfied at all there.  Pay and health insurance not good.   Not much advancement.   Supervisors had favorites.  To much work for what you are paid.
bad,Pay is not comparable to other insurance agencies.   Our health care benefits are horrible.  We do not receive any kind of discount on our health insurance.
bad,"UHC touts a compassionate and innovative culture but falls pathetically short.  Depending upon your leadership and/or direct manager, the experience can range from fulfilling with an incredible work/life balance to perpetually stressed, anxious, and micromanaged into misery. The ""culture"" is not consistent. If you work there, you just roll the dice and hope to get a manager that is genuinely a good person, do not rely on UHCs culture to ensure a fair employer or ensure job security."
bad,"Leadership - from supervisors to directors, but especially supervisors - do not care about the patient/member, employee, improving things, or doing the right thing. All that matters is how they look via metrics. They will not fight for you or what is right, just what makes them look good."
bad,The management was not there to provide help at all and were not familiar with out specific job functions to be able to assist us with any issues or concerns.
bad,"I have friends that have worked there for 8-10 yrs and they love it, but were I worked had a manger that was newer and no experience, it was a numbers game so it you didn't get your QPH you would get in trouble and wasn't that I couldn't do that, it was the amount of work coming in wasn't enough for all of us to the point they started training people in my department to other places. then they started letting people go  I was one of them. By the time that happen I was fine with leaving  the benefits suck cost for insurances company was Honorable expensive."
bad,Management style consistent with the 1980's mindset as well as hardware and software tools for position.  Internal fighting on best training methods and call methods to service policyholders. Unrealistic expectations regarding lunch and break period timeframes. Quick to judge slow to praise.
bad,"Middle man taking money that should be given to “actual” healthcare providers. Companies like UHC are THEE reason healthcare costs have skyrocketed. It is criminal, in my opinion."
bad,My coworker makes 16k more a year than i do. She has been there only 4 years longer. We do the same. People newer make more than others that have been at the company longer as well. Everyone knows you have to quit to get a raise around here. They pay poorly in this area because they can. But wheres the fairness scale.
bad,Telecommuters are often not updated with important information to successfully perform job duties. Supervisors micro-manage and aren't available often
bad,This was a horrible job. It started off as a great job where it seemed to be honesty and growth in the company. But for United Healthcare Ridgeland Ms site the growth is only for friends n maybe family.. They lie on a consistently and mgmt couldn’t tell you anything about the job their only concern is UES scores so that they are able to obtain bonuses for themselves. I was employed with the company for nine months before receiving a call advising due to business needs my position was no longer available. Which was a lie because no one else with my same position was terminated. I hate I wasted my time there and I suggest you don’t either  wicompany nine months when I was a
bad,I loved the overall culture but management could be better and collaboratively working with others should be less stressful. They need better management that won't take advantage of the employees.
bad,"A typical day is 9-5, rarely a lunch break. Production work and then development work, including ad hoc requests."
bad,"Uhg needs to aculturate wellmed into the uhg culture , wellmed's mangement is not innovative, or open to educated people. They promote people that are under educated for their positions and people that are emotionally immature."
bad,"I know that the company is good, but the account that i was in isn't. We had been promised several salary increase for every upskill. I was upskilled 4 times, and got no increase like what they promised. Also, some of our colleagues had seen a loophole in our system, and they can transfer calls and it won't reflect on their names. The agents use this advantage in order to transfer long calls to others,so that their call handling time will decrease. Unfortunately on the receiving agent, that'll be a burden."
bad,"It was a lot of stress and the strange thing is they didn’t seem to mind that you would never be able to know all the possibilities of the members. The management was great and the IT Support, (Israel) was amazing and totally chill."

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"I worked for United Health Group for almost 5 years and felt as though for the most part that it was a very fun place to work. Until things started to change. Quality and Metrics and the fact that we were servicing member's and provider's reviewing and processing claims, quoting benefits and reviewing authorizations. I felt it was a lot of work and we were very underpaid. One of the best things that I could say that was the fact if you met your Quality and Metrics consistently that you would be allowed the option to work from home. I think some things that the company needs to change is they need to train employees better and make them aware when new processes are changing so that it doesn't count against them when calls are being scored."
bad,"Worked for over 2 1/2 years at UHG with Optum with the AARP account, during my time was switched to 4 or 5 different supervisors and 3 different managers. Work and calls not hard to handle but did have to work with seniors. It was hard to get time off approved especially with the supervisors, and don't even think you will get a schedule change they are not flexible. Supervisors act like they care only to workers that suck up to them, only had one good supervisor. They don't care who they fire, you are just a number, they act like they care with bonuses but at the end they are not worth working harder for. Job that I appreciate for gaining customer service experience but wished I had worked under different management."
bad,Your just another number. Management blames everyone else and never themselves. All UHC does is buy companies up so it looks like they are growing. They are not the employer they claim to be.
bad,"the A4Me role is an awful, stressful position for any nurse. Upper leadership in Minnesota suck as well. The A4Me program is a waste. "
bad,My supervisor was absolutely ridiculous. All 3 supervisors for my department were so caddy. The training was horrible. They would compare you to other employees. Each supervisor had different rules for their staff. Supervisors would watch you like hawks and then cover for one another when they needed to leave while on the clock. I liked the other employees I worked with just not management. My supervisor constantly harassed me and would claim she was just trying to help me. I would be told (by her) how nice she thought she was and how she would do anything for her employees. When in fact she would
bad,"Challenging IT environment to work in - Senior Management has defined timelines that are unrealistic based on legacy systems and processes that are bloated. Unwilling to provide time, money or personnel and focus to make corrections that are certainly necessary to remain flexible."
bad,"Very Poor Management they don't care about the workers only the number of claims you can do a day, and as the supervisors say when you don't meet you messing with their money."
bad,"The division I worked in was a start up for a new contract.  I cannot compare it to a regular work experience within this organization."
bad,Not enuff work to keepTeam busy for over 6 months.Employees worried about being job eliminated.No cultural training or opportunity to meet other leaders.Org chart was never reviewed.Poor communication.
bad,"the people I work for were good, and tried to help each other.  My final boss was micromanaging my work, and consuming all my time that she should have let me do more efficient time management.  She eventually blamed me for her misuse of my time."
bad,"This used to be a good company to work for when I first came on I used to love what I do ! I had a passion for the job! As I tired to advance I was constantly blocked because certain Sups had their picks and just would post the job knowing they already had a candidate .I can say I filled out for 38 jobs within the company and have not been hired for 1. Managerial changes become ridiculous when your team is given a manager who isn’t competent to stand as a Leader ! But once you make leadership aware nothing is done no help is given . But you are expected to work continuously like a slave in a queue with heavy volume ."
bad,Overtime workload that is more than 50 hours per week is not unusual. There doesn't have fair metrics to evaluate employee for promotion. The most of daily time is spent on meetings. The good thing is employee can have flexible working hours.
bad,"After almost 14 yrs with the company, I was let go along with one other person in my group, both female (just saying).  Also, I was the lowest grade employee on my team despite all of us having the same responsibilities.  Moving up with the company is nearly impossible.  It's best to leave and come back if you're looking for promotion."
bad,When the manager is in Texas she can't really know what is going on in the office. A typical day unless during peak was filled with meetings or trying to find something to keep yourself occupied.
bad,"it's a good learning experienced,  I got to meet nice and hard working people.  The job is good for  people who wants to explore, learn and  get experience. The job is ok but there is no advancement.  Poor managment and no future."
bad,"Way too much cronyism in the management / leadership ranks.... Hot bed for backstabbing politics, theft of ideas, and relabeling of intellectual property - nobody questions the origins and too many 'leaders' steals credit."

bad,"There wasn't very much work-life balance - huge caseloads and unreasonable expectations to complete visits.  Colleagues were stressed and cynical, and this led to a poor work environment"
bad,The job I currently hold at UHC/Optum anywhere else would be great opportunity.  Quality rating is extremely difficult.  Also the selling of AARP Memberships can be a struggle.  What makes it more heartbreaking is that in the end the customers suffer from unmotivated employees.  I hope to be able to stay with the company but I do want to see what else is out there.
bad,"It all depends who your manager is, but with constant org changes, it's been challenging to keep up with whiplash.  Just as you feel comfortable with the changes, another comes along.  "
bad,Not an enjoyable place to work. The compensation was way below for the job required. The training was inadequate. Management was very unprofessional as well as the workplace culture.
bad,United health care was okay to work for most of the time. But  management was not always the best. We just had to do our best and go home and come back to work .
bad,They give you the tools to training and become efficient in their system. Lots of phone calls are made and answered. The micromanage you A LOT. If your numbers are down then find reasons why to let you go. Not a good place to work
bad,"UHG is a burn and churn environment. They claim to believe in healthcare for all, but they are focused on the bottom line only in becoming Fortune #1 (currently at Fortune 5).  They will sell their consumers down the river if it means they make a buck.  NOT a supportive place to work, but I will say great 'on the job' learning but not a long-term gig."
bad,they tell you can advance into company.. you cannot its all in who you know.. im more qualified than my supervisor.. took me two years to get into another dept and when i get there they make us help the dept i left with calls and those calls are back to back all day long .. everyone in my dept has been trying to post out to another dept and all we recd is denials.. the claims system is set up to deny all the calls are claims and most of the claims are denying incorrectly. now this month we are hearing we will be having more responsibilities come 2019..  over time is optional at this point but if the call volume continues it will be mandatory! bonuses we receive  about every 4 months which is based off metrics and if you meet all months you get 1200 which is the max now they have change the metrics up so now they are making harder to meet. this place is upside down. and it will get worse as the years go.. good luck if you're thinking about applying or just try to be a brown nose it will get you far in this company..
bad,"Majority of work was telephone calls at the beginning of my employment mostly due to the back up of claims and unhappy customers.  "
bad,"Metrics production goals were unreasonable. When I covered coworkers on my team I noted that they had 70% less referrals and carried 30 members where the expectation was 150. No correction was ever done. Promotion was based upon ethnicity and gender."
bad,This company has potential of being a good work place. The training is horrible. They just put you on the live environment and you have to teach yourself and depend on your surrounding coworkers to assist. Management does not know how to perform the job and yet could give their opinion and bad critiques.
bad,"the work it self takes some months to learn, but senior management pushes the goals on the auditors. constant fear of losing job if goal not meet. some of the supervisors are really great and try to help everyone they can. its the senior management that are terrible. the culture there is mostly teamwork yet the senior management pits the auditors against each other and still expects us to be a ""team"""
bad,"The old commission structure was more fair to the agents. The newly introduced commission structure is convoluted, in that it includes chargebacks, partial payments and such.  Very unnecessary.  Needs to be uncomplicated."
bad,"empresa com ambiente agradável, porém com salário e benefícios baixos para a função."
bad,"The managers play favorites, no matter how hard you work or the experience you have advancement is governed by supervisors who will only recommend their friends and favorite employees.  Even if these employees do not posses the skills or knowledge needed for advancement."
bad,it was a job . also it allowed me to pay my bills. I wouldn't go back unless its my last option to be honest. Pay was awful and so was management. That is all I can think of
bad,"Wouldn't recommend it as a career choice.  Cut throat company.  If you like metrics and stress, go for it. While they will tell you it is all about the ""members,"" it is truly all about profit."
bad,"I learned that this major technology company does not want to spend the money to keep their infrastructure up to date and state of the art.  Instead of giving raises and bonuses to their employees after they received massive tax breaks, they are using that money to advertise their products and increase the bonuses for their upper management."

bad,"Here is another you can do better company. Do not go to UHG expecting to climb the corporate ladder, it is very difficult. If you are coming in at a director level, it is OK, anything less, you will have a hard time moving up. A lot of people 30 years old and younger working here----not a good fit for the older worker. High turnover at UHG---check the number of jobs they have open.  Keep looking, don't waste your time here."
bad,"This job involves taking calls from providers and answering claims, eligibility, appeals, etc.. If you like to sit down all day and talk on the phone, then this is the job for you."
bad,Poor management and lack of new employment training . A lot has changed with company demand. I wouldn't refer anyone to this company. Hope its some changes.
bad,A better pay structure would help retain new agents.  There are many task to do to make it a part time job.  Work can get overloaded and not enough compensation.
bad,"Numbers driven no real interaction with peers, forced conversations, telework and flexibility are the only real perks. Too much focus on profits opposed to quality"
bad,"UHC in Eau Claire, WI is a cut throat culture and poorly compensates employees and leadership compared to equal positions in Minnesota.  UHC promotes based on meeting metrics, not merit."
bad,"Did not like the work culture."
bad,"Janitorial services were less than desirable. They care more about the scripting than production. There was one great Manager and Team Lead that did truly care about the employees, to the rest of management it was all about making $'s"
bad,Moral is low. Management is unpleasant; only worried about their job security. No opportunity for growth. Management has poor communication. Worked almost everyday and did not accumulate at least one week of vacation. Terrible experience.
bad,I was let go after only 26 days because I wasn't completely up to speed. I was told it would take too much effort to mentor me to achieve the desired performance. I don't feel I was given a fair chance and it was therefore a very discouraging experience. Especially as I turned down a job I'd probably still have to take this one. No concern was given to my future.
bad,I was held a position as a health coach and it was stressful and time pressured job with management that did not have a health or wellness background and was not supportive of her team. Hopefully things have changed since then.
bad,"United Healthcare is a decent place to work, the pay is decent and they provide a lot of benefits. The only issues I have had is being able to spent time with my famly."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company's sub sites like Optum they are very sketchy and high turn over rates. Managers don't know what they are doing and they are disgusting.
bad,United Healthcare is based in Minnesota and I am in Arizona.  Opportunities for advancement was non existsent for me as I was part of a remote telephone helpdesk.  I was not paid what my pay rate should be for my pay grade.  Raises were nill and bonuses were given to on site technicians and I was not.
bad,"A day at work with my surgeons was always amazing. Dealing directly with patients and doctors with care and education was great. The management portion of this job was the hardest part. There was constant questions and micromanagement with someone who did not communicate with the surgeons and would make decisions based on their need rather then the patients needs and would not follow up with anyone. She constantly would ask for me to do things that were unsafe for the patients and when refusing, she would threaten. It was not the best work environment in this aspect, but the work environment with patients and doctors was phenominal. I cannot say enough about how amazing they were."
bad,This job is a very mentally stressful job.  There is little to no advancement with in the company making is difficult to expand knowledge and experience.  They management is great which is a plus to the company
bad,This is an ok company to work for. There are many issues with management and training. There is no follow through with anything and no help when employees struggle with learning new information.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"The member Services dept is very poorly managed. The environment is very ""catty"" and petty. They ask for extremely high work standards which make a work / home balance nonexistent.  The company asks for a lot while only giving a little in return. I was ""baited"" in with promises of career advancement when actually those opportunities are very scarce and awarded based more on a ""who you know"" ""who's butt you kiss"" basis. Over all the turn over rate is high because of the unrealistic expectations and I would not send any of my friends and family a referral because I would hate to be the reason they are without a job after not being about to cut it @ UHC."
bad,Once you finish your license and get on the floor you receive very little help or direction. My manager was very rude and unprofessional. There was a lot of yelling across the room. It was not the type of environment that I was used to.
bad,Ruthless and without any humanity...pick a place moire dedicated to the patient and the worker and save yourself time. They relabel competitor companies they acquire and simply switch patients around...the PA lock system ruined my life for several years of customer interaction.
bad,"Overall United is a good place to work for a salaried employee with a pay grade of 27 or higher, work life balance does not apply to pay grades 26 or below.  If you are are 26 or below, you are chained to your desk 8 hrs a day, there is no work life balance if you are paid hourly. If you are a nurse looking for work life balance at united make sure to apply for positions with pay grades 27 or higher."
bad,Meetings were with Lap tops  everyone was focused on their emails  made it a stale environment and lots of meetings and teleconferences at least 3 to 4 a day
bad,It was somewhere I went for 8 hours a day that I did not enjoy.  The only enjoyable part was when I got paid.   I did not form any bonds with anyone so it wasn't somewhere that I looked forward to going to.
bad,"My fellow colleagues at Optum were phenominal. However, there was so much miscommunication between the management and the "
bad,Falta de gestão.Não estão preocupados com os funcionários só com resultados.
bad,Not a fan of company culture. I hate to be micromanaged. Would rather work independently. Trying to advance within the company was also difficult for me. The position was sold one way ended up being totally different. Trying to obtain the bonus almost became impossible. Management was aware but couldnt/wouldnt do anything. An 'ok' job for the mean time not a career.
bad,"Overall people are great however from an IT perspective there is ""something"" going on. HUGE layoffs since last yr.  Unstable IT environment.  Business is NOT providing $ to support product enhancement therefore limiting/drastically reducing the amount of coding/testing work."
bad,"the management was bad. "
bad,"You would get so many recognition for being such a great employee and little incentives here and there. But when it came to you applying internally and actually getting hired, knowing you were a perfect fit for the position, no one internally was rarely selected. They like to keep great employees where they are. You make career suicide by showing managers you are great. They do not want to approve transfers and in cases, I have personally seen them purposely jeopardize a great employees track record to keep that employee on their team."
bad,Depends on what branch of United Healthcare. I was in calling customers to setup house call visits by healthcare practitioner. People who refused to participate were still callewd over 10 times a month which made it very annoying to customer and uncomfortable to rep. I would'nt recommend this job unless you like bother senior citizens daily after they refuse to participate in the program.
bad,"For the minimum wage and lack of decent medical benefits you get this stressful environment isn't worth the mental anguish. It's rather embarrassing to know that you are working for a health care insurer but your own benefits are terrible. And for the minimal wages with pathetic- and I mean PATHETIC raises you get- 2% if you are lucky, you'll lose money every year you work there with just the increase in benefits let alone the cost of living! Oh and make sure you are paying a claim every 2 minutes to meet your numbers or plan on getting worked out of the system. 2% raise if you are lucky- many with 1% or less for their annual raise... come on this is a fortune 6 company they tout constantly... making 50 billion a quarter they brag about but they stick it to the employee and let them struggle. I would bet the upper brass are not struggling or getting a terrible raise. There is a good point that works well though- you can pick your hours so that is a big plus on the work life balance."
bad,currently United Health does not provide a clear direction of where the company is growing.  Stock indicates it's growing in leaps/bounds however we are faced with constant layoffs of individual who are very experienced in their field only to find out United is hiring kids out of college.  Doesn't make sense to me.  Management does not seem to appreciate experience.  Personal opinion
bad,"The CDP program is not set up for those with their MBAs. Low compensation, little guidance, lots of bureaucratic red tape. I was not treated with professional respect. I cannot recommend this program if you are not fresh out of undergrad... Good benefits though."
bad,It would be nice if the company had a better system so we can work how they want us to work. once they get something new they will be fine. The management team should want to be there everyday making their people feel good.
bad,Upper management is very heavily concentrated in a for profit attitude. They have no respect for work life balance. I've had a manger tell me that I should consider working on weekends to increase my numbers. They do not follow a  set pay scale when hiring. Some agents make more than another not because of experience but who one knows when hired.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Low moral, expensive benefits, informal training, poor communication as a company. Employees are addicts and incompete individuals. Supervisior makes errors and blame on others."
bad,Management needs to be restructured completely.  They do not do the work and definitely do not support their team. The culture and mission statement is not practiced at all.
bad,"It is a good place to have your first contact with professional ambient. You have a good office and good managers, but the salary is low and don't have many perks."
bad,I went to work for them in April.  Finished training and began work.  I became very ill and was let go because I missed too much work.  They would not even accept hospital receipts or doctor's notes.  My supervisor only liked certain people so if you were not one of those people no matter what you did you did not get reviewed well. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,There are very stressful moments while working here including with management.Things can change at a drop of a dime so it can be very gast paced at times.
bad,"At the end of the day if your not on your manager's safe side your job is always up for grabs. They are constantly cutting jobs for the bottom line, regardless of how good of a worker you are."
bad,If you work here say good bye to ur life. they will tell you you're working mandatory OT the next day an hour before you leave. They change work schedules every month. Management is extremely poor and plays favorites. Employees complain but never speak up.
bad,this company pays well but you are under trained. you train for 3 months but on things that never even happen when you start your job. you have to basically live and learn type of thing.
bad,This place is to build your resume. In the beginning it all seem well until you are being forced to sale AARP memberships to keep your job. Systems are always having errors and you still have to take calls which effects your scores for sales causing you to miss the goal for the month but you are still reliable for their errors.
bad,"If you can handle working in the office until you are able to work from home, then this is a good option for a job. "
bad,Good work/life balance. Was always able to take a PTO day. A health insurance plan is not so good - high deductible plan. Managers are allowed bullying employees. The HR was of no help.
bad,"In my dept, all they did was mircromanaged, but only who they wanted. If you were in good with the supervisors and manager, then you got promoted and praised. If you just came there to work, they micromanaged and harassed you to the point of wanting to quit. People that have been there years complain but not too loud so they dont lose their job so they either stay hush hush or they move to another building or dept to be happy. They continuously train you saying the more you know, the better job security you have, but that is not true. They have great incentives within the company and great job functions to attend, but your position is ran by insane quality standards and you are constantly on edge whether you can make those numbers work for you that month and not get scolded for it."
bad,Okay job but numbers driven. Company had spiders in the ceiling and did nothing til ceiling collapsed even after employees were bitten. Okay but not great pay.
bad,United Healthcare is a great company to work for but they are not true to their culture. Management is horrible here and a lot of employees are under paid.
bad,"Work is stressful and cut throat. There is no value placed on past achievements, loyalty, knowledge or willingness to try something new. To further career you must blend in, not stand out and play a very political game. Truth is not as important as telling leaders what they want to hear and making sure you just make your leader look good."
bad,"High level of incoming calls, no time to communicate with other employees.  You were always pushed to do more sell more. Pay was not equal to the company's demands.  I learned about various insurance products that the company offered.  Best part of the day was company lunches and going home at the end of your shift."
bad,"my experience there was not good nor bad. sadly that company DO NOT follow their creed. Unless they get a lawyer involved, they would not reconsider anyone to re-hired and sad the flagged them from the company."
bad,Management and their training need to get on the same page. Thru the training there is so much that is not taught that when they throw you on the phones you're expected to be ready to go.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,Poderia  melhorar muitas coisas para os funcionários
bad,The management was not encouraging.  Too many rules and micromanagement and not enough respect and support.  I would not recommend this company if you enjoy patient contact.
bad,"Spent 6 mo working here as a contract employee."
bad,"It started off as an employee centered work place. Managers encouraged time off, continuing education and other career expanding activities and networking. As of late, meetings get cancelled, leadership goes dark, and there is no support.  It has turned into the quintessential corporate work place. Mounting pressure to exceed unrealistic expectations while demanding more and more extra curricular work to be done. This paired with severely convoluted metrics destroys the trust in upper management."
bad,"My current role is not hard, however it is stressful. calls are back to back. concerns are not heard or considered. leadership is not approachable. they have ""favorites"" and if you are not a ""favorite"" chances of doing anything is out. This job has affected my health in more ways than one."
bad,"I was actually in management and was astonished at the metrics we were forced to make our employees adhere too. I literally had employees crying if they fell short. Though I have spent an entire career in mgt of heath insurance departments, I have never seen a company that expects such micro management. I attended a class where the class instructor told us that one penny over paid or under paid was inexcusable for staff. Also, there is no job security! They have HUGE layoffs every other year or so. The salaries for managers is fair but compensation for claims processors is totally pathetic. As a manager, I cared about my staff. Keeping up with every second of staff's day is over board. These are adults that you are forced to treat like kids. Unfortunately, UHC's corporate mind set does not foster a work/life balance at all. "
bad,This is a call center for a healthcare company. There is a great contradiction of service. This company prides itself on giving the best customer service. NOT
bad,"Very oppressive atmosphere.  Big brother is watching every move you make."
bad,"okay place to work for. benefits, including salary for social workers, could be improved. were a lot of program changes during my time of employment. May have been some changes since then."
bad,"Nobody seems to know what they are doing. You are trained on something, out it to use and then you told that they want you to do it a different way and this happens so often (10 times in 2 months) and it puts you behind in your work. It is impossible to catch up"
bad,"UHG is a big company who expects their employees to do as they are told."
bad,"So much work, not enough staff to get it done in, with the constant question why is there so much work left in your queue still?!  Never a dull moment because you'll never run out work to get completed.  The online training is always available, but you don't have enough time or hours within the day to be able to attend the online course."
bad,"My position was MRA, member representative agent for the Charlotte, NC location. "
bad,"This rating is specifically referring to SMA or Southwest Medical specifically their scheduling department.  Unfortunately this is the first company I have worked for that I would not recommend to anyone seeking employment. There is no respect for employees, management has little to no concern regarding life outside of the office (emergencies, illness, injury, etc) Just to give an example a woman went into LABOR...yes labor....having a baby. She was taken to the hospital and upon her return she was presented with a final for attendance due to her having to ""leave early"".  When other coworkers would transition out of this department to another within the company management would stop speaking to them and snub or ignore them in passing and their reasoning ""because you left us"". A-lot is thrown at you with little to no real training. Its a sink or swim atmosphere with little compensation for the work load.  Currently the department is VERY short handed because those there have already or are currently leaving (quite, transferring out) and when they saw this happening management began putting employees on Corrective actions to trap them into staying (if your on a corrective action you cant transfer). Those that did transfer management kept prolonging their leave dates because they have to release the employee to begin in their new position. Not to mention its all about the numbers. Management does not care how this negatively impacts the patient or customer as long as their numbers are met. I am not sharing this because I was disciplined or fired...I applied for and received a new"
bad,"Strict metrics for customer service that make it impossible to meet your numbers and quality as measurements are conflicting. Poor middle management,"
bad,Too difficult to move. Lots of opportunities but very difficult to move and move up. Miserable working conditions. Have hated all but one role I've had here.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,This is the worse company ever. I would NEVER recommend anyone work there unless they don't mind being completely miserable. This company care NOTHING about it's employees and works people like they are robots. This was the worse work experience of my life.
bad,United Health Group needs new management. There is no room for advancement. It's really stressful. Its decent money but not worth it.
bad,Would not recommend anyone that I know to work there. Upper mgt did not care about their employees. The metrics that we were supposed to uphold were not reachable
bad,"I actually worked within a pretty dysfunctional, poorly managed segment within the company.  Suffice it to say, I would rather be dipped in a vat of sulfuric acid than work with this group again."
bad,"Mandatory overtime, system that always has issues, nothing works. One process takes over another process just to revert back to the old process and you're the last to know. Escalation process has multiple calls to resolve and if they dont call then issue is closed assuming the member/provider just forgot.Big grey areas that they dont share with the employees.....you have to figure it out the hard way. System tools would have 60 percent of the knowledge to work there. Multiple calls routed to you even if you cant bring up the members account. You are at fault for system issues. Ask you supervisor a question instead of an answer you get a question asked right back at you. No compassion for employees."
bad,"I have worked in the health insurance industry for 15 years and by far UnitedHealthcare is well below par as far the the products they sell, employee compensation and benefits. "
bad,"If you are looking for a challenging and fun work environment this would not be the a good fit for you.  This employer micromanages their employees and frowns upon any type of outside of the box thinking,  They are taking slow but gradual steps toward moving into the 21st century."
bad,The hardest part of the job is that no one actually trains you thoroughly. Management is mishandled and theres no room for growth.
bad,"I had worked for PacifiCare for many years which was an excellent company that really cared about the staff and while it was a national company it felt like family. UHC bought PacifiCare and the environment immediately changed. While it may be right for some, it was tough for others. The company was so huge, you became a number and the drive was about the numbers. It was not about quality any more. That was tough for me because I believe that without quality you cannot survive in any business. Management changed their course so quickly and often that there was much turnover."
bad,"Since I'm an independent contractor, I enjoy working for myself and my client.  It's trying to get paid in a timely manner as well as trying to initially getting set up with the company that bites.  Getting set-up as a provider takes forever (over 3 months) then getting set up for electronic payments takes another month or two.  And of course as with everything, once they decide to change something, you have no say in the matter, just have to live with what it is with no advance notification."
bad,"I worked at United Healthcare for over three years and the company had so much potential for being a great employer - unfortunately, the management on a local level works against the very compassion and innovation they preach.  Getting promoted is impossible unless you happen to be friends outside of work with one of the supervisors, and seeing people with the most potential stagnate in the call center was really frustrating. "
bad,"Manager contradicted many of the processes, unknowledgeable, unable to properly train.  I believe they should promote from within instead of first reaching out to hire outside candidates."
bad,Great Place. There needs to be some major changes in updating the systems for the company. Also there needs to be more room for advancement because there is none.
bad,"Did visits and telephonic work with the Medicaid waiver population.  "
bad,"All talk... NO ACTION!  You will be constantly bombarded with propaganda spouting their belief in the CULTURE, support for INNOVATION and the VALUE they place on employees.  It's a social experiment... if they tell you often enough, you might believe even when their actions do not support their words.  "
bad,"Money is good, benefits are expensive."
bad,"United Healthcare was a great place to work at but there have been alot of changes that have happened in the last couple of months in regards to management and policy. Alot of the changes were not exactly for the best. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Unfortunately, there is way too much focus on quantity, not quality. I am on the latter end. I believe in the quality of service a member receives. You are on the phone all day, every day. There is not much engagement between managers and their teams. I LOVED my co-workers. After being in training for 13 weeks, they are like your family. the hardest part of the job, for me, like I said. Is quantity of calls. The most enjoyable part of the jo was speaking to and helping 20-25 members a day. Making them feel that, I am not just someone trying to rush them off of the phone. My surveys that members took reflected just that."
bad,"As a member of management, I can say from top to bottom this company isn't a good work experience. Work environment is tense not enjoyable. The compensation is and benefits are nothing to brag about and there is no real job security (several ""restructures"" while working there). Company struggles with functioning processes and procedures to remain competitive with its rapidly growing size. Overall....Not good for growth."
bad,"I enjoyed my project teams, but behind the scenes, management would claim they will support you--but they don't.  It is all just words."
bad,United Healthcare is going offshore and terming employment for any and all reasons.
bad,Busy non stop call center. The calls come in every second. This company is all about keeping up with healthcare and providing both a quality product and keeping employees busy.
bad,"Great company overall, ice work environment also has a lot of different people from different races and they all are great loving people they make you feel like everyone is a family"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to understand the member needs and surpassing their expectations.
bad,"I learned new things,the experience doing so was great. I think the managers need to get a better handle of communicating and dealing with problems."
bad,I have spent many years in customer service.  This job was difficult.  I was limited in what I had the power of to help the provider get payment for services.  The pay was low and you would get yelled at for things there were out of your control.
bad,"Company was very disorganized, Professional culutre was not represented within the company."
bad,"i learned how to be patient with the customers, but the job itself is terrible..they lie to you from the start about all the bonuses and bidding for your shift but when you get in and work, they completely change everything..i have a child and it was horrible to try and balance my work and home life with the false promises they delivered.."
bad,I was let go after 10+ years in a department that swore they never did any lay-offs.
bad,"21 calls a day ( average ) "
bad,"This company although tremendously large and succesful, has much to improve when it comes to understanding the markets they serve and their employees.  From the outsiode looking in, this is a very desireable place to work for.  Much different when you are already inside.  If you are a top employee, you are often ""blocked"" from leaving your current role as management does not like to release good talent.  That creates a really bad environment since they are not just looking our for their own best interest, but playing with your career as well.  I would not recommend being in a management role in this organization either. "
bad,"This company provides decent benefits to employees but it is very difficult to move upward internally from the compay. UnitedHealth tends to hire people from outside the business to manage and supervise rather than promote from within. Its is impossible to even apply for an internal position if the new position is over 2 pay grades over your curreny position,"
bad,"Worked as a front end claims processor and was promoted to Quality Assurance. Everything was fine until they turned my position into one were i was reviewing claims from CSR's. It was my understanding that CSR training took 6 weeks to complete and most were not comfortable with procedures for about a year. I was to review these claims for procedural accuracy without any training at all. I begged management for training to no avail. I was basically set up to fail and at the end, I stopped reviewing claims and let them go because I had no idea what i was looking at."
bad,Co-workers very helpful; great onsite accommodations for food service and exercise.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"If you are a team player and appreciate a team atmosphere, Catamaran is NOT the place for you. If you like extreme competitiveness between departments and groups, then you will like Catamaran."
bad,I worked for UHC for 13 yrs and was let go this past January as a reorganization happened and I was out. My overall experience working at UHC was good. Co-workers were great. Management has a tendency to switch up supervisors way to often and there is no reasoning behind this.
bad,"UHG claims that quality is most important, but more weight is placed on processing a large volume of claims (43 per hour). Besides the half hour lunch and two 15-minute breaks, the remainder of the day is spent processing medical claims. Had some good, fun, helpful co-workers. Hardest part of the job was meeting the 43-claim-per-hour expectation. Most enjoyable part of the job was doing research for the claims, but it slows you down."
bad,Call Cener enviroment. There is slot of young people but still a great company to work for.
bad,It seems that there are clicks. Snobby team leads that treat CSR's differently.  The overall work is engaging. But the treatment of supervisors and team leads towards new people is not acceptable.
bad,"Just a normal call center. There are some perks, but the entire call center is so political and it all depends on who you know for promotions. I am glad I left."
bad,The company loves to make its mark in the community by volunteering which is great! Massive layoffs. Several departments/jobs went overseas without higher ups being open and upfront.
bad,If your company is acquired by UnitedHealth Group then begin looking for work elsewhere. UHG begins to transition employees out and replace them with UHG vets regardless of employee success and loyalty.
bad,"The pay was great and I loved the ability to work from home but there is no room for advancement as I was promised. I worked there for 4.5 years and applied to various positions for advancement and never got it and was never given a reason as to why. I left to go to another company and was immediately told I was overqualified for the position I applied for (one similar to what I was doing at uhg) "
bad,Could of been better. They have a high turn over rate. So some improvements could be made to help employers stay. The training could be better as well to help people be more prepared on the floor.
bad,"Work hard, gain experience and move on. The raises are very low. Lays offs extreme.  I met the most amazing people on my journey though.  Get the experience and move on."
bad,"I no longer work at this company so I'm not sure why I was asked to review it. The office was beautiful and offered an on-site health club, and wellness center. It was not located in a good neighborhood."
bad,"It was by far the worst experience to date. Everyone complained about my manager and how she was verbally rude to them, not helpful or supportive, amongst other things. Nothing was done to mediate with her staff or resolve the issue. She often lied about her instructions to staff and when shown emails or proof, it was disregarded. The pay was very good but not worth the headache  . At some point i hated coming to work ."
bad,"I worked for UHG for 10 years, and my position was no longer needed, they claimed due to the business changes, my position would be eliminated.  I feel that was unfair, and they have no commitment to their employees."
bad,"The management at Optum is questionable. The level of unprofessionalism is high. Optum laid off hundreds of people by sending an email with the subject line ""BH update"" and employees had to sign in to a WebEx meeting that was very disorganized and then were told that their job has been deemed unnecessary and therefore it was being terminated. It was presented as uncaring and unprofessional and to make it even worse, the employee's direct manager/supervisor was not aware of anything until about 5 minutes prior to the employee. Layoffs could be done in a more appropriate way."
bad,"The management is horrible. Quite A few time customers needed life saving prior authorization in once instance to see A heart valve specialist, which hit home my mom was going threw heart complications.  When I asked what I could do to expedite it they said to sit in my chair and take my next call. Heartless I had A panic attack and quit"
bad,"This is just my personal experience-I have been with the company for 3 years and when I first started in 2016 things were great. Great shift, decent pay, managers were on top of their job, everyone seemed fair and got along well. Policies were being enforced and not abused and best thing no micro-management . Fast forward to 2019 , these past 6 months have not been all that great and it is showing within the employee retention. I have never felt so drained by a job that I do now, taking the calls is the easy and enjoyable part. The office is very negative and gossip is encouraged there is literally no professionalism. The training use to be very good but now they bring trainers from different areas who are not knowledgeable and/or does not have enough time to teach us all of the material. I would just say this is a pit stop for many until they get into the positions they really want but even with that I know of many qualified agents whom applied for internal positions and were not considered. I wouldn't say it's based on favoritism but I personally know people who have been here for 8years+ and it is not because they did not apply themselves. I will leave this here because I really don't think UHG as whole is bad, its just this particular branch is not what it use to be."
bad,Insecure and more contract and they will only    permanent only 1 out of 100...more over every one is a contract in optum. More work stress and more night shifts

bad,"Management at the time played favorites and changed schedules often with little notice"
bad,"Everything is good and the atmosphere is great. Company takes care of its members and the people that work for them. I make sure that the members of the health plan are taken care of by the employees, as I contact the employees and they take care  of the members problems."
bad,Layoff to whole navigator program after 6 years of founded.No more comments. this company don't care about employee at all. Training is not good. You as employee work alone most all the time.
bad,I was with company for 8 years with no chance to advance. It felt stagnant. Several lay offs have occurred over the last 3 years. They lay off and do not laterally move people within the company.
bad,"Working here absolutely sucks. Been here for 4 years and they only give 10 to 20 cent raises. I pay out of pocket for most of my health insurance expenses (not including the premiums) as they barely cover anything. "
bad,Coworkers and management teams were wonderful; Always willing to help in any situation. Supervisors on the other hand was overwhelming to deal with; Disorganized and created too many conflicts for our daily work tasks. It made to work place hard to focus on the true facts which is production.
bad,This job pays alright but the stress that taking a call every 7 seconds for 8 hours a day gets old quickly.. they also state that you have a very good chance to keep advancing and to bonus but this is not the case as they will nitpick your stats once you are about to bonus. So the stress mixed with no bonus I think makes it not worth it.
bad,"Was excited to work for company but within the first year changes came about, company began to downsize and without prior notice jobs were lost. Company seems to have lack of concern for the employees. Lack of communication. Metrics became "
bad,"I don’t even quite know where to begin. They constantly hire for programs, then after 6 months-1year close them down, then without barely any notice leave employees to find new positions. They gave insane metrics to meet. You are expected to accomplish those metrics however need be, regardless if that means you do free overtime, skip breaks, take no lunch."
bad,"I worked for a manager that reminded me of the movie Mean Girls. She was very moody and unprofessional. Working from home can be a wonderful thing, but the expectations were unrealistic. It became clear that if you didn’t become buddy buddy with her, she, as a manager could and did make your job miserable. Unlike my fellow employees, that were a fantastic group of hard working nurses, my manager was never there to help."
bad,"There is a definite shift going on here, and there are MANY layoffs in the IT departments. They are moving of offshore support and the employees are forced to train the offshore staff which ends in the elimination of their position. There have been layoffs in the 100's scale over the past two years. Not a secure place to work. Management is clueless and will attempt to place blame immediately for anything that may go wrong. They are uninterested in the issues faced by their employees, and are just concerned with being able to present metrics that are favorable to their superiors. The IT staff is forced to work 50+ hours per week, holidays, and weekends. There is no consideration for balance of life outside of work. Health insurance is all high deductible and no real benefit until you have spent thousands out of pocket. Being a health care provider, this is shameful."
bad,"Does not support career development. I have not had the best experience with management these last 5 years, I have had only 7 1-on-1 meetings with my manager in last 2 years."
bad,"Beautiful brand new building, all of the state of the art equipment.  Work from home flexibility and good PTO.  Unrealistic expectations from Senior Leadership and Everything is a Priority."
bad,"Telecommuting options are available, and the pay is reasonable, but the raises are below cost of living, and if you stay long enough, you find yourself living paycheck to paycheck.  Immediate managers are good, but to anything above them, you are a number, and treated like chattel.  Department mergers with employees in different salary grades result in the higher grade employees being reduced to the lower pay grade.  Performance is heavily customer survey based.  When you frequently deal with customers that are already upset about a problem before they even call in, you feel like your job is on the line with every call.  When employees complained about being punished as individuals for corporate recommendation scores, despite high numbers for the service on the calls themselves,  Management responded bluntly with, ""You are part of UnitedHealth and will be held accountable to those scores"". I have watched dozens of good, experienced employees leave the department, and even the company, because they could no longer take the overwhelming stress of maintaining the performance metrics required in the call center."
bad,They were bought out by Compassus Hospice.  When they bought out the company everyone jumped ship except my boss and myself.  We ran the place until we were able to get the patients relocated.

bad,Suppose to be 7 seconds between calls when busy but there is not 7 seconds between calls.  You have to write your notes while on the call because once you hang up another call is right there.  No consistency.  You get multiple answers to a question.
bad,This company doesn't pay enough for the amount of work they want you to do. They encourage you to not take breaks so you can meet your quality for the day would not recommend.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"If it were not for the fact that I was helping military members that needed it I would have quit sooner than I did. I could not, in good conscious quit with the level of incompetence  shown by most of the managers in the call center. How any of them were able to be promoted is beyond me. In fact, the call center manager hired her hair dresser, who admitted to me and fellow employees that she had no formal training nor experience as a manager but was ""really happy to be here and to help as much as I can""."
bad,I started in 2002 and the company was very pro employee at that time but as the years went on they focused more on shareholders then customers or employees.
bad,"Over the years they have become less concerned with the welfare of the employees and only concerned with their profits and rewarding the top level executives.  Everyone else gets the excuse that the company isn't doing so well as quarterly reports continue to show how much the company is excelling.  If you're looking for a company that truly cares about it's staff, this isn't the one for you."
bad,"I was a RN then became APRN, wait for a year for an opportunity, never was given even though they promote ""growing"". It si a change they ont care about they employees."
bad,"Empresa sem plano de carreira, salários 982,00 reais, muito abaixoo do teto para o cargo de telefonista, eles so avisam na hora da entrevista, refeição no local, e liderança sem ética."
bad,No work life balance.  Just get the job done.....no processes in place.  No clear job description or clear career path.  Expected to be available 24/7
bad,The team I worked on was supportive and cared about one another and the members we served but upper management implemented a lot of negative changes and some of the policies make zero sense. Little room to advance and grow in your career and high turnover rate with little salary increase or raises.
bad,A good place to work if you like someone always looking over your shoulder and treating you like a idiot.  They say they hire from within but every manager i had was from outside the company
bad,"I worked with UHC for almost 4 years. It was an extremely difficult company to get hired with, so I thought, until I met most of my training class. Everyone applied 1 time and got hired with a referral, even those less qualified than I was at the time. The training program is very fast paced and overwhelming, yet they don’t give you all the information you need for when you’re live on the floor. The call volume is ridiculous for majority of the year, which meant long hold times and many upset and disrespectful customers. The systems they use are extremely dated and always failing every single day, which made our calls much longer than necessary. Their website was updated almost 2 years ago and there are always issues with it, resulting in many more angry calls and a lot of times I could really relate with the customers’ frustration. I don’t understand why they can’t get it together. They are a Fortune 500 company, yet my raises were less than 50 cent per year while consistently meeting my metrics for majority of the year. Which brings me to the metric system. It’s better than it was because they didn’t use to give us a break on adherence when we clocked out for lunches and breaks late due to a call that went longer than expected, after several complaints they came up with a solution. It’s still very difficult to meet goals without feeling like a complete robot. If you do met them you are rewarded with quarterly incentive bonuses, which is a plus. If you or anyone in your home is a person with a weak immune system and get sick regularly, I wouldn’t recommend working here (unless"
bad,At first when I was hired I was excited thinking this position would be interesting with guaranteed hours for longevity however after working with the company for 6 months our hours got cut very short I mean unemployment type of hours working 20 hours every two months I would resign from the position but I'm holding on to see if I can apply for other internal positions it seems they hired a whole bunch of staff for this position but didnt have the budget to keep paying us the weekly hours promised and also the HR department is very unhelpful you call in for HR questions and feel even more confused the department I work in loves to micromanage which I'm not a fan of dont know how much longer I'll be working for this unpromising company
bad,"No interaction with functional leadership"
bad,"very corporate environment, secure company, many opportunities.  ask for what you need up front so not stuck in the 2-3% treadmill thereafter. benefits okay but stuck with really high deductible plan."
bad,"UHG is a difficult place to work in that there are a lot of politics to navigate.  There are good pockets and bad pockets to work, but once you find a good pocket and try to stay there, you can quickly get moved somewhere else or lose the boss you're working for."
bad,The training does not prepare you at all. They just give you some info and then throw you to the wolves. After a department is out of work you go without work for a while and then they find something but you have to remind the HR you worked there.
bad,"Initially I was excited to be a part of this company but, now, not so much. EXTREMELY OVERWORKED AND UNDERPAID! Don't do it to yourself. Every few weeks more and more jobs are being added to your role. The pay is shameful for the amount of work you do. We work out of approximately 17 systems daily... I am not making this up. We have so much on our plate that we use 3 monitors and honestly, that's not enough. Ibuprofen has become a part of my morning coffee routine. I catch headaches thinking about starting my shift and I'm guaranteed to have another one by the end of my shift. There are no good days when you have a role that can be broken down into 5 different departments. You never know which day will be your last day...and I don't mean getting fired... I mean losing your cool and walking away because the pay is NO WHERE near competitive for the stress level."
bad,"Would not suggest job to anyone, horrible experience. The best part of this experience was the hours worked. This business has since shut down and I am not surprised"
bad,"Okay Company, high turn over, lack of management."
bad,"Basic call center atmosphere: loud, crowded, little room for advancement if you were quote-unquote too good at your job. Some of the management was great, others not so much.  Coworkers were a mixed bag.  High turn over."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Depending on the organization, you can be severely underappreciated and overworked.  They claim life/work balance and advancement opportunities, but that is certainly not the reality."
bad,"Though excited to learn on the job and succeed at becoming a long term employee, it did not take long for me to find out that a coder's accuracy score has little to do with actual coding accuracy, and a great deal to do with the numerous data entry steps required to complete one single processing.  Each fax scenario required differing, yet still numerous steps for inputting into system.  This would not be a problem if training on their system had been provided before being expected to ramp up productivity in the first month, and not let accuracy score drop below 95%.  The best education I received was from the QA department when they found errors, unfortunately each error counted against me. I am convinced this must have been an unusually negative and isolated employment experience, otherwise nobody would be working there."
bad,Management is on crack.  They implement a good plan and in the middle of being focused they try to combine four different roles into one job.  Its a complete mess.
bad,Very good company -Learned a lot. When people get jobs there-they never leave. I worked there for 5 years and Im trying to get back in the company. The office is very close to my house and the freeway.
bad,"I was ecstatic to have a full time job that offered benefits and was well above minimum wage. I was finally able to be financially independent. The job was steady work I did learn a lot about the health industry, high production based department, metrics do mean everything it was at times a demanding job. I was in that honeymoon phase, so I put in 110%. However, after about a year that happy feeling began to fade. I soon felt trapped, unappreciated and like I had no future there."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is that I indirectly help improve the member experience, however, there is a severe lack of role recognition, and appears to only care about number of sales, enrollments.  No Open Door Policy."
bad,"Trainer as a bully, we called them the anti-trainer. Spent 3 months training and most of it was wrong. Lots of gossip and back stabbing in office. Hypocrisy is dominant within management. They are very proud of being fortune 200 company, so does it really matter how the worker drones get treated?"
bad,It is very discouraging when you hear about the billions the company makes but yet the raises are cents. No defined process the company is all over the place. I have been in a few departments and none of them seem to be on the same page. The good thing about the company is the promote work from home. I’m in Texas and compared to other healthcare companies around UHG does not pay as much.
bad,"I've been a top rep for United for some six years and my day starts immediately with enrollments lines up one after another. A typical day for me can bring in anywhere from eight to twenty new clients. This would be a decent week for most reps. "
bad,"It is faced paced. Always busy, it is constantly growing the downside is that you are always playing catch up or clean up. There is plenty of work, but they will burn you out. Little room for advancement. There is a bad case of nepotism. I will say that I learned a lot and had the freedom to work with minimal supervision. There is trust that you are a professional and know how to do your job."
bad,"Terrible work environment with unbelievable stress due to unrealistic goals and metrics.  Constantly monitored, low pay, poor benefits, lax management, no real vacation time but accrued paid time off that must be used for both sick days and vacation.  Unscheduled absences, even due to illness or emergency, are considered occurences and more than four in a rolling calendar year will result in corrective action/termination.  Just an all around unrewarding, exhausting and stressful company to work for, at least as it applies to the call center.  Would not recommmend the company to anyone"
bad,"Very high work load, very stressful, expected to perform work of 2 roles-phone and process claims. Pay was not equal to work required and stress. Management cares more about numbers than people. I was skipped over for 3 pay raises on purpose I found out later due to politics and discrimination."
bad,"If you like having zero home time while working 10-12 hours a day under strict guidelines and watch, this is the place for you. Also having to adhere to strict meterics at all times"
bad,5+ years there was a pay freeze. No raises were given out. There's no growth. You get pigeon holed into on department forever. Most managers block you from posting out to other departments.
bad,"Something to have on resume, good for first-time being on the phone, this job is only about numbers, needs better management and staff, very unprofessional."
bad,The management was hired in my same class and the lack of training  felt as though they set us up for failure. The trainer did not know anything about the systems we were using and didn't understand where we needed to go in our training direction.
bad,"Advancement seemed more about being off duty buddies with an existing manager. The environment went from professional self monitoring to oppressive security driven after the current owner took over. Several ownership/management changes each causing the work environment to become increasingly less enjoyable. Call centers are often known more for ease of employment than quality of employment, but I would not recommend this location to friends looking for work."
bad,"Rare promotions, work life balance not supported. Pay not very consistent year to year. In downsizing mode for the last few years. Discouraged working from home."
bad,"Would prefer not to say"
bad,Management doesn't know the company policies or how to run the company properly. They hire on uneducated supervisors and staff. It is like a high school with all the drama.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"UHG has some good department managers, and others have poor ones. The culture you work in is entirely dependent on who your manager is. My manager had regular screaming sessions, which everyone on the second floor of the building could hear. It was embarrassing and nerve-wracking. She was unstable and eventually left the state when the department was eliminated."
bad,not enjoyable wish they paid more. does not have a work life balance. You feel like your at school majority of the time the management is horrible . i would not recommend
bad,No coment supervisors not very on top of what needs to be done. No meetings that were productive. Not a clear understanding of our jobs. There were favorites.
bad,I worked for UHC through a third party. The actual company was very strong and secure in there core values and mission. The third party that I worked for was more relaxed however owe represented the parent company with pride.
bad,The company was relocated out of CA. There were many changes and inconsistent information employees received at the time when the company's decided to change course.
bad,"home based jobs are nice, but the work-load is excessive, plan to work 10 plus hours a day."
bad,The job offered little to know support without the proper training to do the position.  Had I not come in with extensive Benefits experience I would have been  very lost.
bad,"Terrible work environment, impersonal cold and the management micro managed employees.  I would not recommend working here, quickly fired new employees without offering  additional training"
bad,Need to improve on their company culture on inclusion to all employees and not just management staff. Attention to the customer service reps needs with handling claims.
bad,Management is incapable of performing there employees' jobs. The culture is toxic and includes a lot of tattletales about who's shoelaces aren't the right color to match the dress code.
bad,Started at UHC it was amazing 16 weeks of training and then a year went by and we were told that our policy had been bought out by another insurance but we were not losing our jobs but would be placed in other rolls of the company.
bad,"Even working from home you have to start early and end late every single day in order to meet the required metrics. It wasn't unheard of to start at 7am and finish at 9pm (830-5 is advertised schedule) just to do all the extra stuff required. Need to prepare for Monday? Congratulations, now you're putting in hours on Sunday just to prep yourself for the week ahead. You have to alert them every time you step away from the computer (including bathroom breaks) which can lead to disciplinary action if you're gone too long (ie. no more than 5 minutes, three times a day max)."
bad,"I worked there for one year and the last 6 months dreaded even going in. My manager did not like the staff, it was just a paycheck to her. Anything good she would find fault with and made fun of staff in meetings. She always saw the negative. Never acknowledged a  job well done but took all the credit."
bad,"It was a great place to work, till the new management was brought in. The new hiring process allowed massive hiring opportunities without credentials."
bad,"As a regular pharmacy technician with certification and registered, we should get paid at least a living wage.  One can not live in this state on barely 29000 a year."
bad,I did not enjoy working at this company. It may be good for other people who would like the type of environment. They dont let you advance in the company.
bad,This company is definitely behind the times on a lot of things. The micro management is crazy  within this organization. The management within the company feels as though they are above you. If you speak up they will find a reason to get rid of you. The  metrics and expectations are unrealistic and the training is non existent. The lack of career advancement is startling to say the least. The management has less experience than the employees that they report to them.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE COMPANY. The culture  at UHG is horrible and  pay is horrible and above all overworked and underappreciated.  This company has some serious ethical and integrity issues and in due time will face several law suits.
bad,"As a support analyst / end user support,  you are stuck in a specific role with very little to no exposure to other IT related fields. Which is very unfortunate for a company this size."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"good money, great atmosphere to work, don't like being in a call center though, sometimes you have to work long hours for aep but not too bad, bosses are great, cafeteria"
bad,No employee loyalty. No pay increase based on performance. Training did not always pertain to work tasks.  Benefits expensive and no HMO option available in my area. Upper management didn't care about the common working employee.
bad,"Once you are comfortable with your job position and get to know your manager, you are moved to a different project multiple times a year without your knowledge or choice. You are also moved under different groups and manager, who knows you so well they have an opinion of you at time of review. Directors never talk to you never see you or work with you, never join a scrum call but know exactly how you behave function or what you do."
bad,"Decent place depending on your needs. slow hiring, slow growth, typical come in with this salary die with it company, depending on your department but growth is there."
bad,"My site was a typical call center. They did not promote from within. Internal hiring freezes lasted half the year. The employee turnover rate was absolutely terrible. It was easier to quit and reapply if you wanted to move up within the company because they couldn't keep their call center representative positions staffed. Really a terrible burnout position. I was always able to get as much overtime as I wanted, but I hear from my old friends who still work there that that has changed."
bad,United Health Care has very poor health benefits for a medical insurance company and very poor compensation.  They expect you to work overtime every day.
bad,"Poor work life balance "
bad,"They never praise you if for good work they always point out the bad.  The member would be mad at the company and the bad "
bad,"flexible hours, good working environment. Able to work and go to school. Can improve training for staff and advancement opportunities. Ample break times"
bad,"The wrong people are in leadership who have poor communication/ people skills. Management to me seem to be insensitive to employees personal health although its a healthcare company, I could never understand it."
bad,"I started United Healthcare in January of 2017, I fought so hard to get in with the company only to find out once I got here it wasn't all what I was fighting for. Since I have been here I have seen more changes than anything in my complete life. Everyday your job changes, adapting to change is one thing but when something becomes inconsistent, it promotes you to deliver your job inconsistently. There is no way possible that one here can always do good only because the resources alone are not helpful and the amount of different information that is received is ridiculous. Its almost as if they want to walk you out the door, If something isn't done the way they do it they do everything to belittle you. While everyone who works in management is not like that many are, and its very intimidating, almost as if no one is here for your growth or productivity. They have core values that they want you to go by but the core values toward the EMPLOYEES suck! Micro Management is something they live by. I honestly think some of the supervisors and managers should not be because they do not have the attitude or spirit for leadership. They lie about promoting and then they promote ones who don't perform half as good as you. They put wrong UES scores under your name and if they member is mad at the company but specifically says ""The Representative was Great"" that's your problem and it effects you. You can never win, with these people. Lets not talk about the schedules, cause its all about Shift Bid, If you are a Highly Designated rep, you might as well give it up cause  I enjoyed working here"
bad,"Training not adequate for positions, definitely learned more on the floor than in the month long training. "
bad,"I expected my role with UnitedHealthcare to be a rewarding experience that would open the door to a myriad of roles. I was wrong. Though the company has benefits such as telecommuting, quick advancement in certain areas and pay (though not matching work load) the cons outweigh. The work environment was highly unprofessional. This includes inappropriate comments and supervisors making constant jokes about termination. The atmosphere didn’t foster a culture of empowerment. The benefits (medical, dental, etc) are the worst of any employer I have worked with. This is more astonishing since this is an insurance company (though in their defense I was warned during the recruitment process that this was the case). Lastly they encourage you to reach out to their 3rd party HR (HR Direct). HR Direct is unaware of the operational and atmospheric components of the site I was at. They were also not trained well in issues involving HR."
bad,"Great location, but there was to much control over everyone's jobs and not enough training while on the floor nor information given if they didn't like your questions regarding what was needed to input."
bad,There were too many changes in supervision and upper management which lead to confusion within the work space and employees felt a lack of job security.
bad,I enjoy everyone I work with.  they are very friendly and make the environment pleasant.  we would have put locks to take a break from work to enjoy each others company
bad,"There is a lot of favoritism here. If they like you your As will always pass if they don't, they get on you all the time. They have passed over a lot of good hires and it's really hurting the department."
bad,"Honestly, this is a corporation and unfortunately you have either play the game or look the other way.  The worker bee's on the lower end of the payscale will never reap the amount of money that is made for the people on the top.  It would be nice if the CEO would take a pay cut, no bonuses,  no additional raises, and extra's  to show evidence that he is doing the right thing for the right reasons at the right time for the patients and the employee's that continue to increase the profits of the shareholders and all the individuals who make 6 digits and over."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The work culture and environment was strict and toxic.  Everyone was in competition with each other for minor benefits.  There was a lot of inequity.  Very little career progression.  Brutal work hours.  Constant required overtime.
bad,Rude and disrespectful management that loved to micro manage but had no leadership skills. Demeanor was very dismissive and  predictable to say the least
bad,"by giving employees something to look forwarding to, with the good work they put in , please . they don't treat employees right. I said what I need to say"
bad,"I worked at United Health Care for 2 years as an contractor and was passed up for a permanent placement to someone's son who worked for the company,  Worked over 2 years without being considered for any permanent role.  I left the company after my 2nd year for a better opportunity under a different recruiter."
bad,"Learned alot about system implementation"
bad,I have never felt like more of just an employee number than I did when I worked for UHG.  Their team managers barely know they team members name. The turnaround of both FTE and Contractors is dizzying.
bad,"-Pay was moderate but I know other health insurance companies pay a lot better.  Plus, another CSR who also started at the company with me negotiated her salary and it was far higher than the average - this was unbelievable since she had no background in healthcare but I did, but my interviewer said she does not discuss salary..."
bad,"Growth for development/engineering jobs are nearly nonexistent. Management dismisses complaints, hoping they go away quietly. The company values compliance to their standards vs innovation."
bad,UnitedHealth Group has decent benefits although healthcare coverage could be better.  There are many work from home positions which is really a great advantage when the weather is bad.  Some positions have schedule flexibility and easy to work with in the case of medical appointments.
bad,no comment about anything to do with company i dont know why indeed makes you fill this out ................is was not my choice ever to fill this out
bad,"typical day at work, come In work lunch break and go home.  quality can be stressful. managers are always around to crack the whip but never to help.  lunch aand breaks are standard."
bad,"constant change in senior management resulted in repetition  of work and processes. "
bad,"Very stressful job, but some flexibility in working hours.  You will be scheduled to work for 10 hours a day, 5 days a week.  But the data entry work itself takes more than 6 hours a day, and you will end up using weekends to complete your work.    Software used by them is very antiqued compared to epic, which is used by most hospitals.  Many systems do not talk each other, inadequate reports in the software."
bad,United Health group was a great learning experience.  There are a lot of changes in the environment and not much job security. Independent culture and great learning experience.
bad,"Help guide and educate customers about the fundamentals and benefits of consumer-driven health care topics to include managing their health and well-being by selecting the best benefit plan options, maximizing the value of their health plan benefits and choosing a quality care provider"
bad,"A typical workday never ends, poor management on the client side interwoven with poor management and the inability to say no, or offer alternatives gave little to no work life balance.  Average week was minimally 55 hours, some up to seventy depending on code deployments and other work loads.  Only benefit, was it was a Telecommute and travel to client site job.  Benefits were horrible at best, you'd get better on the ACA Exchanges, cheaper with the same overhead and cost sharing"
bad,"From lack of managerial leadership/experience to idiotic team policies, this left a sour taste for the entire UHG experience. Fresh ideas and implementation of efficiencies were not encouraged, which made no sense coming from healthcare technology company (Optum)."
bad,good place to work.  Spent twelve and half years working for United Healthcare.  promoted a times since my tenure.  Worked from home for over seven years.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"I staerted working for UHC in 2016, Got on a team and it looked like it was going to be a team affair but after a few days, all it was is a show, no team work at all Would not recommend this company to anyone"
bad,"The very, very low industry salary is not worth being micro-managed and treated like a child. You would be better served to work at a smaller company that pays more and doesn't see you as a number who can easily be replaced and treat you like less than a person."
bad,"Worked medical claims"
bad,"The management was very poor. There were many situations that arose where the supervisors had to be educated on the job we did daily. If a situation came up that didnt benefit them, it would get put off to the side. Lots of micro managing! Also there are very strict metrics to adhere to. Be prepared to be told ""we dont expect you to be perfect"" but in the same sentence ""we will hound you if you arent perfect"". Regardless of what is said, you will always be hounded about metrics. So if you are looking to truly help a physician with a patient, and you dont think you can do it in under 2 minutes, than be prepared for the emails, the ""pings"", and the coachings to be politely told to ""hurry up and move onto the next doctor"". There is great potential to meet some really fantastic people and establish some great realtionships. And the pay and benefits were okay. Its a call center environment, so know your strengths, weaknesses, and your patience levels before entering into this role."
bad,this is a good company to work for depending upon your area of expertise and what you are looking for in a company. the company benefits program for employees is good.
bad,"UHC core concepts need to be a reality and not a facade within management in DBM. The facade is real, lack of company's values throughout the department."
bad,Initially company was Executive Health Resources and was fantastic place to work; was bought by United Health Care about 5 years ago and has changed dramatically; at present is stressful and quixotic in decision-making with poor planning and use of tools that are inappropriate to task at hand
bad,Very Stressful unfair work place. This company does not pay overtime what so ever. They over work and under pay their employees and expect them to do work off the clock.
bad,"United Health Care is company that is competitive and constantly growing. Their work mentaility is to micromanage their staff. There are some employees who take advantage; however it is not applicable to all. The rate of pay for them especially for those who are not on a level of Lead, Supervior or Manager is minimal at best, and the pay increase and bonuses are sub-par.  For an organization that prides itself on healthcare, the cost incurred are too high."
bad,"The department I worked in with united healthcare was TERRIBLE!"
bad,"They expect the near impossible. They talk down to you if you are not a regular paid employee. Management is messy spreading people business. Call out and everyone will know why,"
bad,"Good place to work, where as management and project allocation is issue. Work culture is average. Management need to focus on many things, employee satisfaction is average."
bad,Work environment was too stressful. Too much micro managing and staff was afraid to request time off. Once new management arrived I already found a new job
bad,"I started out there as a temp and managed to survive , not a easy company to work for , very demanding and stressful also.  pay should be higher for all the stress they put employees through."
bad,"I have been with this company for 17+ years.  Depending on the management in place you can either be very successfull and flourish or in my case, you are valued only on your production."
bad,"Call Center Environment, No room advancement, low morale. Would not suggest this as a career, more of an entry level job. Different locations with different job functions may have a different outlook on the company."
bad,I felt that there was too many people that were working for them and they could not give their attention to every single person. unexpected turnover and employees felt like the company did not care for them at all.
bad,Everyone is overworked and the mix of personal and work life does not appear to be valued or maintained. People are always coming and going and in general not very happy.
bad,It has been a long time since working here hopefully things have changed. There was a lot of work and less pay. And a lot of unorganized  departments.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Fast growing business, long hours, performance based job. Long hours at desk, good people. Needs more of 'team' atmosphere, better pay, better benefits."
bad,"I appreciate the stability and security of a paycheck. The pay isn't enough for the work that is done. "
bad,M&M didn't treat employees with respect. Hard to receive raises and there were many times that the higher up took coworkers for granted and didn't offer what we worth.
bad,Most co-workers like their jobs.Constant changes to procedures. Rarely is the job done the same way.   Almost never get a chance to take a deep breath and relax and recharge.
bad,"Their system or database is always updating and we are unable to access members accounts. It has a balanced work life, meaning leadership offers vto when available."
bad,"I'm not sure if it is company wide, but the department that I worked in has a horrible work environment.  It is made known after an individual starts working there that the annual bonus that is advertised in the recruitment process is competed for within the department which has created an atmosphere where everyone competes to put in more hours than the next, reaching 60+ hours in an average week.  Furthermore, I was told that corporate only wants to pay bonuses to 70% of the staff, so even if you do take the bait, you are still very much not guaranteed a bonus after working as hard as the next guy.  "
bad,"Job was good in the company but the level of the position don't change, if I show my full performance.About the co workers they are friendly but some of them are double minded people taking in front of me and also at the back."
bad,Not a good takeover.  Was a local company call Unison.  My 2nd Position there.  I was a DBA at first.  I switched to another team.
bad,"I work for Optum as an Operational Trainer.  As a trainer, I love my job and I don't mind working over.  Trainers typically work between 40-50 hours per week.  The great thing is that we are hourly.  "
bad,"Event planning, advocacy, care planning, team coordination of events, field work, health education, challenge-no opportunity for growth."
bad,Prudential was eventually taken over by Hartford and lastly by UnitedHealth Group.  I worked on a toll-free line answering questions related to the AARP member's Medicare Supplement insurance plans.
bad,"Don't look to start a career here. They have a high turnover rate. They will let you go in a second. I worked very hard for this company. Working overtime up to 25 hours every week. No matter how hard you work if the manager does not like you, your out. The manager I had was a liar. She was rude and just plain ignorant. If you are a person that just go to work and do your job, this is not the place for you. I was quiet. I would mind my own business. I was a very hard worker. When I was in training my trainer quit before we got on the floor. That should have been a sign. Our training class was constantly pulled of the floor to train for something new. The first month there was so much confusion as to what job I was going to do! Just not a good place to work."
bad,"Was a good place to work, at the time. I have nothing bad or good to say. Was a big Company Job. P lease let me move on to the next question I do not want to talk about working for different company's."
bad,assisted the teacher in the infant room with the daily lessons of the classroom and also helped out in the before and after school room
bad,Everyone is not happy with current changes within office.  Managment has poor communication. No team work. Work load is too much for number of employees to patients.  Patients complain daily long hold times on phone.
bad,"doing everything from bathing to dressing cooking and cleaning"
bad,As an employee you are about to get great discounts on Michael's arts and craft materials. The main office has a lot of amenities for employee's including fitness gym and cafeteria.
bad,"Call center work can be very stressful. Whether you work for a customer service, sales, or technical service account, you will encounter heavy stress. This is part of the reason why a lot of call center agents are smokers. The stress from call center work does not only come from the nature of the work, it also comes from the culture of the customers that we deal with."
bad,United Health Care should have more presence and sort of hands on in day to day operations.  Need to be more transparent with employees
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"its a good company, i learnt lot of good thinks fo TPA industry. my base improved in the same company & because of this experience , i have got a job in FHPL."
bad,"No values in this company setting, a starter job. Pay is just ok. Not an organized company. I have outgrown this company, Coworkers or management are not friendly. The process is not a good process."
bad,This is a new pharmacy benefit management company. You will learn a lot. The hardest part of the job is listening to elderly people not being able to afford medication.
bad,"Over the past year the culture of what UHC stands for no longer exists."
bad,"Empresa com benefícios bem abaixo do mercado"
bad,"Co- Workers some are friendly but for the most part fraustrated with the company all the rules and what they want you to do"
bad,High turn over rate and it was like going to highschool. The management was clicky and you could not move up in the company unless you were a part of that click.
bad,"I loved my job there, but a little too much drama for me."
bad,"Poor communication.  If you telecommute, you are invisible.  A non-entity.  Too large and so many divisions, no idea where you belong.  They bought the company I worked for and we were definitely treated like an unwanted stepchild.  We were never integrated into the large overall company.  Didn't get access to their website as an employee for nearly two years.  If you called IT they didn't even know who you were  - couldn't help you because you were never made part of the UHG network.  UHG finally disbanded  EHR, the subdivision and laid off 100s of people.  Handled poorly - no compassion."
bad,"•	Dispatching directions to satellite technician, to customer's homes"
bad,This was the most unprofessional work environment that I have ever experienced. The supervisors talk about other employees to other employees. There is no open door policy because if you speak about something that you have a problem with upper management goes right to that person and tells them exactly what you said. The only thing that matters here are bonuses and getting callers off the phone. They teach you that its about the customer but really its about the money. The plan seems unstable and there is little communication between lower level and upper level management. The job requires you to be robotic and perfect. There is no room for error or you will be threatened or talked about by your supervisor behind you back to other employees.  The standards to receive a bonus are constantly being increased while the amount of the bonus constantly decreases.
bad,Posted charges and entered all patient demographics. At times had to verify insurances. Poor support from management when it came to my request for certain tools to be ordered that would help me complete my work accurately.
bad,"This office was definitely an experience for me. When I first started working there, everyone started leaving. Two assistants left as well as the Office Manager, which left me with running the entire office. I didn't mind the work load even though it was overwhelming. The office was far from where I lived and I didn't have anywhere to move up within the office."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of receiving my client visit list the previous night. There is no attempt to coordinate visits to within one area for the day. Instead the NP must go from extreme ends of the assigned county to reach their clients."
bad,It was my first job so it is very tough for me to work long hours in the night. I have learned a lot from this organisation. Its a very quality driven organisation. so much focus is given on quality and also the employee have to work very hard to meet these parameters. There is too much  work pressure and one need to work very hard to survive. Overall its a nice organisation and I have learned a lot from it.
bad,Bad work environment and bad management. Job was too stressful for what it was.
bad,"Inbound call center that processed and returned recall items from \"

bad,"If you work hard, you will get reward but it does not promise that you will keep your job."
bad,"Management decides individuals who receive privileges and/or discipline without following any specific criteria. Management allows some behaviors in some people, but not in others. Very discriminatory. Managers use the work at home program as manipulation. Deciding scores needed to work at home, and then as soon as you reach that goal, they make the goal higher, so it cant be reached. No incentive to reach goals."
bad,"Dental benefit eligibility, claims inquiries and research"
bad,"it was a good place but need it more of team mentality, most people didn't talk they were just working"
bad,"expectations are continuing to become more unrealistic. Co-workers were the best part of the job, if you were seated next to someone pleasant. Supervisors are ridiculous and under qualified.  You're tethered to a phone all day and answer the phone like a trained monkey. It's a call center environment."
bad,It is an organization open to new ideas and innovation. Be prepared for structure and non structure. Be able to adapt and also flexibility being that there is no perfmance base standards.
bad,"This business has double standards, and actively works twards hindering its employees."
bad,I am currently an Associate Trainer with UHC MV as of November 2012.
bad,"Company is build on mindless ""company man"" willing to but up with anything to keep their jobs. "
bad,"I don't feel that this company is very sensitive towards family circumstances (sick kids, etc) I also don't feel that they are as ""military friendly"" as they should be, seeing as they provide benefits to our service members (getting off work to say goodbye to your spouse who is leaving for a long period of time) Also, there was plenty of people that I worked with willing to put in as much overtime as they could, yet everyone was still required to put in mandatory overtime. This may be fine for some people, but for people who have families to attend to, it can be less than ideal."
bad,"From the start UHG is an employer that focuses on productivity and profitability. Emails come out from various sources drilling that information into each employee's head. The organization also makes a good display of how they have values and they want you to succeed. They are very lax with their IT departments, they still haven't left windows XP (heck, they only got XP in 2005) Everything in their systems seems to be held together with scotch tape and a few safety pins. When a major event happens they aren't prepared to react or they don't want to believe it's happening. When they finally get around to authorizing a new system or upgrade they suddenly want to yesterday and put so much pressure on the development to get it done that the result is a complete mess that they say ""look how much we saved"" The people who have to use it say ""jeez, how am I going to hit my productivity now with this disaster"" as well as ""this is the list of manual work arounds because the system doesn't do what it was supposed to do"" I've seen this with service systems, claim systems, enrollment systems, phone systems, and email. Benefits are sub par considered the organizations focus on ""health and well being"" Depending on your department you may have excellent work life balance or a disastrous one where if you take a day off you dread returning because no one is able or willing to cover your role because they as well have such a workload. The 401k, health savings, and Stock programs are good until you leave then you have to close them or get fleeced with various charges on the accounts. Moving up"
bad,Ability to evaluate system change requests and define requirements: 5
bad,Job does not pay enough for the amount of work they want performed and does not give raises.
bad,Employee superficiality; poor workspace and lack of appreciation of contractors - would not recommend for creative employees if you can get other employment.
bad,Work at Home opportunities
bad,"Typical day you have about 80 to a 100 calls a day servicing members with their insurance problems helping them find a doctor, helping them get authorizations for their medication . You learn to be very patient,, manage your time wisely help co-workers who need help. Management was no help The most hardest part of the job is when you have done all you can and the member is not satisfied or you have done all you can and the member still couldn't get their prescription. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the call the member is happy."

bad,"Claim representative responsible for 43 claims per hour with zero errors while at the same time keeping up with online training requirements, timesheet, reading/understanding all e-mail communications/changes to policies,procedures, processing guidelines, schedule adherance. Upward mobility is strong if one can meet the minimum requirements indicated. Mandatory overtime was finally eliminated (10 hours per week, scheduled in advance, was required). When you leave the company, you do not receive any of your banked PTO, so use it before you leave."
bad,"When I first join the company in 2007 they had decent benefits and other perks  after 2011 there was a systematic decrease in the level of health coverage, wage increases and a marked increase of US jobs going oversees  Donald Trump should call out this huge company for taking so many jobs from Americans and sending them oversees in the name of profits. The work done oversees is abizmal"

bad,"Management played favorites  and as a temp they use until they train "" permanent staff""  Don't want to ever work there again!!  I came in as a temp and was selected along with a few other for ( special projects)  and we all well,  however permanent positions were dangled over our heads like a game."
bad,United Health Group up to two years ago was the place to work.   Camaraderie and dedication was key.  I no longer feel like that.  It is sad because this was the place I wanted to retire from.  Now they are hiring only offshore.
bad,Teams have difficulty working together.   Lot of dead weight hiding behind management.   Not moving with the times.   Need to be in with the gossip to advance.  Not my style.
bad,"The culture across the company overall is great but can vary drastically from team to team. All depends on the manager. "
bad,"Serious lack of communication, which makes work difficult, They have their own ""click"" if you don't fit in with them, you will not make it. And that would entitle a bit of backstabbing and a few lies."
bad,"Considering they’re laying off thousands of employees so the execs can keep taking in millions, it’s safe to say they care  only about themselves. They do NOT care about their employees or members"
bad,I had a great MANAGER who really did seem to care about his staff. Unfortunately upper management wanted to replace him once he earned his NP.  They refused to increase his salary. Put someone in his place who didn't and couldn't perform any of the assigned duties. Her staff would work until 10 at night but she would leave at 5 pm the dote
bad,Its alot of questions thrown at you quick to see how you react. Be prepared for anything. Be honest and answer things just how you would really do them and you should be ok.
bad,UHG is a good company; however some of their managers and VP's leave alot to be desired and should not be in those positions.  The people make the company and there are people who treat others unfairly  and without just cause.
bad,no room for growth unless you know someone.  Having to achieve 99% accuracy rate puts too much added pressure on employees and I feel that lessens their productivity
bad,Huge company that is continuing to grow but they do not have any loyalty to their employee's.  It is 100% about the bottom line with zero consideration for the employees
bad,This was a remote position and we were suppose to track each and everything we did. If we are working a case we given a tracker and we are suppose to mark when we open case when we make a decision when we submit. It was like working as robots. Manager was of no help when I was going through a personal matter and didn't help at all by temp switching my hours around.
bad,"My company was purchased by United Healthcare and they came and changed out everything new and modern we had in our office to the bare minimum. They arent worth a long review, if you just need a paycheck, apply."
bad,Too many layoffs and loss of knowledge. The ones left standing are already over worked and have to pick up the slack. No time or money for training and very little cross training or shadowing opportunities.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"This used to be a place you'd proud to recommend a friend to but the last couple of years is continuous layoffs (some large & others small and quiet). So, those left standing work harder and try to figure out who does what after all the deep knowledge is gone. It's a constant struggle to get things done with more pressure to implement quicker."
bad,Doesn't matter how long you have been working there you are treated the same.  Its all about money for them and less about valuing their employees. Don't care about making you work lots of late hours every week.
bad,"They still manage the company like it's 1992.  Even though they have many remote employees they struggle with how to manage them.  They even have software that requires you to log every time you change an activity, every time you take a break, etc.  It's so antiquated.  They treat every employee as if you're working on an assembly line, even if your work has nothing to do with production.  It's mostly because managers don't know how to analyze workload.  They offer little or no training unless they charge back to budgets, so what is available is never offered.  If you've never been a manager before, this place would be a nightmare."
bad,I would recommend not looking for a job in the medicare department. Career advancement is not favorable and it is difficult to leave that department. Leadership is not optimal.
bad,"Overall good work environment. Low pay for the IT Engineers. over past few years management stopped caring employees, everyone is replaceable now. they would fire and offer same position for less money to another person."
bad,"some very high egos to deal with, known for being a sweat shop...the poor executives have no work & life balance but they are paid very well.  the culture says one thing, but the behaviors are the opposite."
bad,"I worked in Iowa. We were all paid well and provided lots of PTO, however, the health insurance did not help cover much. We are also all losing our jobs and were told we would get considered to transfer internally, but everyone ended up getting denied. There is no job security or help finding a new position within the company when your position is cut."
bad,"The company does not care about there employees overall experience, as long as you are meeting the company needs and providing expertise service to the member than that's all they care about."
bad,I was not recognized for get projects done on time and closed the most projects. I was told I could not get promoted because I was a single parent. I to share this with the leadership team they let me go in 6 months.
bad,"United Health Care doesn't care about its employees. In corporate America numbers are all that matters. You can come to work everyday and work hard but, that dosen't matter. Around the building you see the company values .These don't apply when it comes to the employees."
bad,"Depending where you work as a nurse. As a remote work at home nurse I would not recommend this position, unless you are willing to work 12-14 hours a day. That is the expectation to meet your production numbers to get a decent raise 1-2% with little or no bonus. "
bad,"A lot of people liked working remotely from home, but this is one perk that I was not fond of at all. I felt that although UHC had strong company values, I did not see them passed on to employees on a day to day basis."
bad,"My supervisor is the absolute best but she is so confined by upper management that she is often frustrated."
bad,If your not well know in the company you are invisible.  Certain departments are driven by metrics to the point of nonsense.   Leadership is distant and does not value staff.
bad,"Managment seems to be all over the place. One new practice is introduced and within a few weeks the process is completely changed to something different as if they did not think of how new processes would actually work before introducing them. Work is very metric based. Even when doing you job properly as trained, you are graded/ judged based on the member's feelings. So you can the the job properly, but if the member is upset do to their own self doing or not properly understanding their plan before they chose it, that direct impacts your regardless of if you did you job right. Employees are used as a scapegoat for the companies bigger short comings. There is room for growth, but limited. Very nitpicky, micro managing workplace. The positions comes with a shift bid every 3 months instead of having set schedules upon hire. Forced to re-adjust your life every 3 months due to shifts changing( majority of employees become comfortable and don't want to change shifts, but it's done anyway with no option for shifts to be kept) . Shifts ranging anyway from the usual 9am-5pm or 8am -430pm, to shifts of 2:40pm - 11pm, 3am- 11:30 am and more. Even shifts which hold he whole weekend and mid week days such as Tuesday and Wednesday off. Not a schedule that supports anyone with an active family. Employees are basically seen as if we do not have our own lives to live and that our life revolves around UHC/UHG. New hire trainees also make more money than tenured agents upon entry, even though they have about 4 months of training before being able to do the same work as tenured agents and assist"
bad,"They have you do a month of training (paid) but do not teach you the system for Prior Authorizations until the last week so you're thrown to the wolves. Did fairly well considering. Then they state that if they decide to not keep you after your contract ends then they will give you a 2 weeks notice. This did not happen but i knew my contract would end give or take in a month so i was able to thankfully land another job. Interview for my new job was the day before they ended my contract. Lucky break for me, not so lucky for others. Be careful with this company. A lot of favoritism as well."
bad,"Management at in my particular office believed that the best way to motivate was to threaten your job on a daily basis.  Most days would start with a meeting where you were told produce at an unrealistic level or be fired.  Training was completely non existent (literally trained by a person who had never worked the job I was expected to do, and admitted to the whole team she had no idea why she was tasked to training us being that she didn't know the job) then told by management if I didn't hit my number by the end of the month I would be fired.  My manager had never worked my job and literally had no idea how to anything other than micro manage a job he didn't understand  and could not possibly do himself.   I once received a threatening email for being away form my desk for nearly 5 min.  I had used the bathroom during a non scheduled break, even though I didn't take a later break.  This was a health care company that offered truly terrible health coverage to its own employees.  Might have just been my office but would not recommend working there to anyone with a choice.  I was warned the same thing by others before I started there, wish I would have listened."
bad,"UHG is a good company to work for with good benefits, but the growth of the company outpaced more quickly than the ability to hire new employees to take on the workload. The work environment over the years has improved greatly with better management. Not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,They started me 3 weeks before my training started so I had nothing to do. They trained me remotely from Phoenix. I felt totally isolated. No support.
bad,"Did not learn much, no direction,management unhappy, always ready to leave, workplace culture was great as it was diverse, made to take lunch a certain, never advised in interview."
bad,I have been with the company for 5 and a half years. I started very eager and excited. Management in place at the time was effective and very helpful. There was no official training for my area but I am a fast learner. 3 years into my career I noticed management was no longer being hired from within but rather outside the company. This has resulted in a downward spiral because while these new supervisors and managers had the managerial experience they were/are very often unknowledgeable about healthcare as a whole and moreover the specific product we sell and service. I have stuck around for the last 2 years with hopes that things would change and maybe we were just in a rut however things have progressively gotten worse. My team has been understaffed for over a year and the work has been overwhelming. In no way have we been compensated or our current pay reviewed. We are a 3 person team handling the workload for 6 people. Our concerns have fallen on deaf ears and it's just been very evident that our area/job is not a priority. Other departments in United HealthCare and Group may prove to be more accommodating or even enjoyable but this department has failed repeatedly to live up to the values the company so heavily stressed upon my arrival.
bad,"You would think that a Fortune 100 company would be a well oiled machine, but this one isn't. United Health Group talks a very good game but does not follow through. They lie to get you in the door and snatch the welcome mat from underneath you. Employees (including nurses) are grossly under paid and over worked. I am a licensed nurse doing waaay too much work, yet I can work at UPS without a degree for the same salary. They use the word ""transparency"" like its the Jedi mind trick, as if they say it enough you will believe it although you know it isn't true. They are anything but transparent, they cover up changes until its too late for you to do anything about it, then say ""we will make this right"". Think about it, they are #6 on the Fortune 500. Where did all that money come from? The poor patients they are supposed to be caring for/representing, and not paying their employees."
bad,"I love the people that work in this place, but I can see the ceiling. The managers and higher positioned people do not care about the lower level employees."
bad,"it was a fine company to work for but the office is very blasé and staff is not lively. I enjoyed the time spent with the company for learning purposes. However, it does not encourage individual growth or implementation of creative new processes"
bad,The company has so much to offer but is way to big that the mission of the company isn't always followed.  There are highly qualified employees but not all are meant to be leaders. This company cannot recognize the difference between a high level individual contributor and a leader.  If they would improve who they chose to lead teams then this place would be great to work for.
bad,"I worked hard for years at United Healthcare, when my health failed, they fired me.They harassed me for not keeping up my numbers which seemed impossible because I was always talking to members. I believe they manipulated my numbers because of my increased health costs but I can't prove it. I know people who were just sitting in their cubes half of the day socializing that still work there today"
bad,"The telecommuting opportunities were great, but they end up treating people like machines and monitor every move of people working at home through desktop surveillance."
bad,Great co-workers at UHG.  Many knowledgeable and friendly people at UHG. Greatly appreciated the assistance provide by people outside of the immediate team.
bad,"Optum, UHG can be a wonderful place to work. However, there are too many chiefs making decisions without collaborating with the next. The only thing that remains constant at Optum, is that there is change, EVERYDAY. There is no true work life balance in these positions because you will always bring work home. It's almost impossible not to do. Benefits are good."
bad,"Great place to work in regards to compensation for entry level jobs. "
bad,"This company is constantly evolving and changing policies and procedures.  It is difficult to stay current with the most recent changes and what is the proper procedure to follow."
bad,Work / Life Balance was a benefit for employees at UMR.   Some employees get the option to work but not all employees have the option.  This sometimes led to friction from those employees who did not get the work at home option.   Many employees have double-digit years with the company.  Good for organization memory; can cause complacency.
bad,Working at UHC was Great in the beginning. I really felt like I was helping...then the company made a change and they forgot that these were real people that we spoke with. It was depressing that all that it seemed they cared about were their numbers.
bad,Not a great place to work  unless u get the right position basic a lot could be changed to fix the red tape plus u can't email and someone is always hovering over your sholder
bad,The only issue I ever had was actually getting my earned time off they just out right paid me for it. With that being said that created a stressful situation.
bad,The pay was good at UHC and you can tell they hire a lot of different people. But their management is made up of their favorite people. Meaning if someone of power likes you as in friends of course you will advance.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Micro-managed at a Director level.  They say they promote within but it's almost impossible to move around.  Well known for downsizing/layoffs, you're job is never safe there."
bad,"They pay is decent."
bad,I think they could have either raised the pay per hour or offered overtime. I was carpooling with a friend to work and the money still wasnt good. The building was nice but for a lot of work i think the pay was really poor.
bad,"Allowed the ability to work from home, which allowed some flexibility with an opportunity of job work/life balance.  Provided time off with PTO. Overall adequate place to work"
bad,"Management is messy! Everyone walks around talking about others. You are punished for things others have done! Everything is an issue but they wont fix what is really the issue which is the shortage in sevice coordination. Work in any department besides community and state! There is strong favouritism with management. Some sort of ""in crowd."" If you do work there beware! The benefits are terrible! You have to pay the company you work for too much for little coverage!  It works if you have nothing medically going on but if you do its no help!"
bad,"During my time with UHG I did not witness that they encourage a life/work balance.  I heard that UHG encourages such often, but I did not get to experience myself as I was regularly expected to work 12+ hour days despite being a single parent to 2 young children."
bad,The culture is one of backstabbing and cliques. Parts of the company are great but I was in a group that was being absorbed and dissipated so it was not a pleasant experience.
bad,"United's motto is ""Helping people live healthier lives"", but this does not extend to their employees. Health insurance on offer is laughable, and there is entirely too much focus on hitting numbers and percentages, with little regard to personalities, abilities, or individual situations."
bad,"Grueling and lack of advancement.  If you have a pulse, you're hired. No emphasis or recognition for Advanced degrees.  Supervisors are quick to throw you under the bus."
bad,"Metrics of handle time 3 min or less, to be eligible for Pay for performance. Could never meet the metrics, Always being  put down saying "" because of you our team is not meeting goal."""
bad,Management is stressed and takes it out on the team. Keep adding more and more tasks to complete in a visit without allowing more time. Is now permissible to over schedule and you are expected to work after hours without pay. Plus multiple tasks to complete after hours at home nightly. Threaten job if things are not completed immediately. Forced to attend awful company meetings yearly where they all pat each other on the back for forcing medicare to increase their payments to UHG.  Lots of pressure to add diagnosis that are not present by QA group - which is why we are there in the first place.
bad,"Too many unnecessary & untimely business meetings. "
bad,I enjoyed working for the company however that changed quickly when management began abusing the companies power and policies. I didn't like that I didn't feel although we were able to assist the impact wasn't enough for me I felt.
bad,This job isn't the best to work out. Bonus/ commissions pay scale is hard to achieve and you aren't getting paid much. Management don't care about employees
bad,"Between the inconsistent management, the difficult metrics that change regularly, and the members that either fell like they're owed something or that think we can work magic to get them services or products that aren't covered, this is a very stressful job. I've had anxiety attacks on calls and going into work. Migraines that caused me to miss work. Its rough most days and painful the rest."
bad,"Option to work from home was nice. Company culture focuses too much on profits and less so on the individual, the person who receives the care. Due to the size of the company at times you feel that you are not part of a team."
bad,"Was with UHG/Optum for many years. When I started it was a very good company to work for. As time passed and things became more metrics driven it became more of a ""What have you done for me lately"" work environment. Now it's work hard, work fast and do NOT make any mistakes! It appears the corporate view has become - family and leisure time is fine as long as it doesn't interfere with your dedication to the company."
bad,A4Me pgm is the worst pgm at United Health.  I would not recommend this area of United Health Care.  I have heard that other departments are better places
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"Management is terrible, they are allowed to do as they choose with no repercussions. Take too long to approve PTO. I had to buy more expensive plane tickets due to this."
bad,Management did not focus on the value of the product to clients. Very stagnant office for growth opportunity. Employees were not valued. Management wanted to keep things the same despite changing industry after office was acquired in 2010. Profitability was not maximized therefore Optum saw a better value in sending the business to Quest Diagnostics. Benefits were great and affordable so corporate at UHG does value their employees and health. Just not through salary compensation.
bad,I liked my manager and the department's vice president. I learned a lot about effective employee communications and working with senior leadership. Good learning experience overall.
bad,I would not recommend working n the CAS department at all. Poor management and lack of direction leads to horrible morale. Complete lack of accounatability by management
bad,"The roles, the hours, and the managers changed several times in a year without any warning. Multiple people were layed off. Basically everything changed and there were no warnings or care for staff's concerns."
bad,Loved what I did but they start to nit pick on you until your ready to not care about everything and want to leave.  Things are getting ridiculous and ready to walk away.  Benefits Suck
bad,"I spent years at this company. My pay was low. Over the years they expected more and more work, pay increased very little. Expectations were not realistic."
bad,"A typical day was answering back to back calls. Sometimes, if it slowed down you could be given off phone work which I enjoyed. I learned a lot about medicare and medicaid. Management was inconsistent between the teams. The hardest part of the job was that you were constantly going in for more training. The classes were short and you never got to practice what you learned.  Once you were out of class it was hard to get help. Most enjoyable part was my co-workers and some of the agents that called in and made me laugh! I loved being able to help them."
bad,"They have a quota that you need to meet on a daily basis and they watch every move that you make via computer, phone and in person.  I learned a lot about health insurance and that this is not the career that I would like to pursue.  The hardest part of the job is getting in contact with people, insurance companies, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with people and learning new things."
bad,"I worked as a Customer Service representative and the work was just incredibly dull. Made for long work days. Basically just data-entry all day, you hardly interact with customers or team members."
bad,Bad place to work.  You talk to everybody and they are all talking about getting out.  Look at other companies before here.  No Pay.  People don't care.  Just there for a check
bad,The pay is not worth the expectations and stress of the job. So much is expected and the training in my opinion was terrible. You are asked to change on a dime and learn different processes with little and sometimes no training.
bad,"Health benefits are horrible, but the pay is good. There are times when we were allowed to work from home, which helps with the fact that the job can be stressful and tedious. Management sucks and complaints pushed to the side."
bad,"Management pitted pharmacists against one another which provided a very competitive environment. "
bad,"The rumors are true. There are tons of opportunities if you are willing to sacrifice your life and well-being to join the organization. I love my work, it is my passion, but within this organization it seems that isn't as important as just getting the job done."
bad,"If you need a job and they call you take it, but if you wait you can find a better company. They have a lawsuit against with the goverment. Run away from themmmmmmmmmm"
bad,Tons of shifts in management and frequent leadership changes. Revolving door of teammates and no consistency in direction. Advancement opportunities were limited as leadership was constantly changing.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,This is a call center. Everything is done in a way that tries to make the employees resemble robots. Management was not willing to budge to make situations better.
bad,"It's like high school most days and everything is based on seniority, rather than performance and knowledge. Not a great experience and very turbulent. Don't expect to be respected and cherish the extra PTO."
bad,"The training that you received does not corresponds to the actual customer service work you do on live calls.   When doing followup on denial claims it seems you are transfer 100 times to see the who, what and why te claim was denied fr the client.  30 minutes for lunch in which there is no on sight restaurant to get something eat immediately."
bad,Tricare renewal virtually promised.........But if not there will be jobs here........wasn't the case.........Working for Military and Veterans was an HONOR
bad,This company is very diverse and that is pretty much the only good thing about this place. They are extremely unorganized and the pay is horrible. i would not recommend working here.
bad,A stressful work environment with ever changing policies. The tools given do not fully prepare you for the job. You will wear many hats.
bad,"If you work in packing and shipping you won""t be treated in the same manner as a pharmacy technician or a pharmacist. Too much volume with not enough space to put it away. Forced to stay til work is done."
bad,I have never worked in such a terrible place. The management does not help with work/life balance as they say they do. Also their non-retaliation policy is a lie.
bad,"The case managers under the Tricare Autism contract were given caseloads of 250 which is 200 more than any known case management model. Additional tasks were added constantly and management often did not allow case managers for weeks at a time to take PTO they had already earned because they were behind schedule. The execution of the contract was poorly thought out and extremely disorganized. Problems were addressed only after they occurred. Consumers were always angry about the poor service they received. Management was constantly walking desk to desk handing out candy and even flowers and saying ""You're so awesome!"" thinking this was an adequate replacement for effective management and just treatment."
bad,The pay is minimal. The over time is manadatry.The company is very large. Over last 5 years the company has gone to a work at home platform. Very hard to find a manager unless you are being corrected.
bad,"Could be a great place too work.  Not a clear focus on the marketplace direction. Hard to accomplish goals with monthly management changes.  good coworkers.  Ability to work from home, which limited the amount of commute time."
bad,Okay job I guess just wasn't for me. The compensation was good but the job itself was highly stressful. No selling involved so that was good but there were other metrics which seemed rather extreme.
bad,"Among Leadership there isn't much transparency which trickles down into the work direction of employees. There isn't a true understanding of work life balance. In addition, I came into a leadership position from another insurance company, and there is very little to no acceptance of outsiders. This is a company that is stuck in it's on processes and will not allow room for true successful improvement."
bad,"Management was very unapproachable, they had poor interpersonal communication skills. Work day was supposed to be 8 hrs always spent extra 2-3 hrs charting at home."
bad,"You will stay busy. But they have you traveling to other clinics around central texas, and they pay roughly 12.00 an hour. They don't have room for advancement. Turn over rate was high when I worked there, and they also don't give enough hours."
bad,"Too many work hours and not enough pay in the Data Entry Department. "
bad,"Poor management, push nurses to act like ants and just do as your told, discouraged from using clinical nursing judgement, holds a carrot over your head to work from home"
bad,"Good job if you keep your head down but don't get sick or call any attention to yourself or you can expect to be ruthlessly punished and harassed. Leadership is absolutely morally bankrupt and once you find yourself under any negative attention you will be ""gas lighted"" with no hope of getting back to normal. The practice seems to be to force people out while hiring new people if you are identified as someone who is a problem. Even asking questions is labeled ""push back"" and you will be accused of all manner of awful things for just trying to do your job. The pay is not competitive. Go somewhere else for more money and to be treated with dignity. Optum can be a good place to work but ultimately you're going to be humiliated and treated like garbage for less money than you'll make elsewhere. Leadership delights in making it harder for you to do your job and then blaming it on you. Complaints are met with ruthless retaliation."
bad,"Large company perks and problems, DBA function broken up into many pieces so must involve many groups to get work done and the communication necessary to perform job is more time consuming than performing the work."
bad,Job expectations constantly changing. Focus of job is production and not quality. Management and staff turnover is high.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,worked 70 plus hours a week on a small salary.  loved my team and my actual job.  upper leadership was not great.  benefits for insurance were not good.
bad,"Working for United Healthgroup is very stressful to say the least. The calls are non stop all day long which does help the day go by quicker. They expect you to be some type of robot. You have to do mandatory overtime a few times a week which isn't really beneficial if you have other requirements outside of work. They do not care about there employees personal life at all. You are told a lot of things in training but when you get out of training it is totally different. They say they offer flex time, however if you try to get flex time they advise you that it is no longer available. Did enjoy helping the members that call in."
bad,"It is not about the customers or patients it is all about statistics and profit maximization. Being a customer service advocate for OptumRx was a horrible experience. The patients were alright and most of the time that they were upset it was for good reason. We are not encouraged to help the customer or go above and beyond, most of the time they are lied to just so that they can be rushed off the phone as fast as possible to keep call handling times low. I feel sorry for the patients that have to use this service. Customer service is very poor and unqualified, as are some of the supervisors."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"constantly asked to do more with less time, continual mandatory 10 hours of overtime each week, poor management, high stress, only enjoyable part of the job was some of the coworkers"
bad,"Working at Optum would consist of handling 80-100 inbound medical claim calls per work shift. You receive calls from pharmacists, technicians, doctors, and benefit investigators. I have learned how to deal with diverse people from all around the country that call as well as the people around within the workplace. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the calls in and out and being able to help the callers with all of their questions and concerns. Everyday was different for me but I would quickly adapt to any changes."
bad,"My job at UHC was Remote.   My day consisted of logging on my applications.   This job was a Call Center,calls were answered in a timley manner, metrics were a part of my daily job meeting quotes, AHT, Surveys, call back rates."
bad,Overall it's a nice paying job. Just hope that the management will show genuine love and care to the employees.
bad,You would have to work overtime every week. They have little to no regards of your personal life. You cannot attend any additional education training/ classes because your schedules changes day to day.
bad,Management is not employee friendly. No benefits to employees. CTC Salary does not include proper benefits. Midnight meetings
bad,"Productive and fun work place."
bad,"Managers are unprofessional and have their favorites. If a supervisor does not like you , you will not last long. Co-workers are very messy and will sell you out to get on top."
bad,"Providing directives to agents and ensuring resolutions and adequate and accurate information is being provided. Beiing a personal advocate for specific plan members reaching out to other companies for help including physicians, clinicians, and refering members to other agents and core managers who can asisst them with  paying for the medication,  and copays, premiums etc. Ensuring individuals are educated on their medications and tracking their refils to ensure they are picking up their medication and taking them accurately"
bad,worked for United for 9 years. Moved my way up within the company. Sure wasnt easy but i was determine to do so.
bad,Management is not professional and they treat people like selves.
bad,"I would not recommend United Healthcare. But, everyone has to see for themselves."
bad,"I worked there for 6 years. The pay was decent for a technician. Benefits were okay but had high deductibles and brand name med copay's. They also roll your vacation and sick time into what is called PTO or planned time off. The amount is generous but if you get sick and it is not planned you get an occurrence for it. You are only allowed 4 occurrences in a rolling 12 month period before you get a warning or get written up. The work/life balance is not great. It was getting better when I left as they had done away with mandatory overtime. At one point there was anywhere from 10-20 hours of mandatory overtime per week. You were expected to make arrangements or get written up if you did not work the required hours. Many times it felt more like we were supposed to be robots and not people. We were told do not talk, do not turn around in your seat, do not email, watch your breaks and lunch, etc..."
bad,- sit a computer processing insurance claims
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Fluctuating workflow / copay policies /co-workers are supportive / telecommute effective
bad,"Laid off many people, refused care to members. Felt like i wasn't a Nurse but someone who didn't care for the members."
bad,"UHC preaches well but preforms poorly in Brentwod Tn. Management is dollar driven to keep healthcare expenditures to a minimum at the expense of the patient,Tenncare and Medicare.. How can a company serving an indigent population amass Fortune 25 status? Easily! Patient care is denied. Patients return to the ER and are readmitted, and this company scrambles arround with devisive ways to.point fingers at everything but the truth. The truth is that you cannot throw patients out of the hospital to save a dollar, because it will cost 3 admissions to rectify what could be completed in one. Patients with catastrophic injuries were discharged to home with home health. This cost Tenncare millions in complications because the did not know HOW to care for themselves. Management is retalitory. Nurses are not encouraged to do critical thinking and only original thoughts are by management. You will not sleep well with the care delivered."
bad,"The workplace is no fun, and people are treated like numbers instead of human beings. Employees work very hard toward unreasonable goals and advancement is little to none. Information varies from person to person and consistency is nonexistent. Reward and recognition is few and far between."
bad,I usually determine what's my work day will look like by assessing my priorities.
bad,"hrs might be stressful, long shifts, work weekends, benefits ok, management ok"
bad,this company seems not to be very concerned abt the well being of its employees it seemed as if we were just there to do a job and nothing more. employees never felt as if they were an asset to the company
bad,Poor management communication and high turn over rate. Management had little faith and trust in employees.
bad,"United Healthcare as a whole does strive to bring great and innovative care for it's members. However, the call center is an intense place to work. The provided systems and programs constantly and consistently crash. They are either slow, or they just don't work which decreases productivity and efficiency. During Open Enrollment, your calls will be back to back without a moment's breath in between. Truly, and there will be follow up work for many of our calls that must be concluded within 2 business days. The average time for these to be resolved, however, is up to 3 business days as a general minimum for most items. Our follow ups tend to take the form of requests that are sent to differing departments to resolve. We are to wait on these departments to finish these requests, yet we are held to 2 an average 2 business day goal. A particular department has a known issue in constantly pending items back that only they can resolve as well, which further slows the process. We will be given an allotted 20 minutes a day to work through these follow ups, however, if the call volume is high enough they will remove this time altogether and still expect that we be able to finish all follow ups within an average of 2 business days. It is not a position for lazy individuals, and the pay is not high enough for all the skills and tasks that we are trained to take on. Especially if you have to travel."
bad,"Work volume creates difficulty in balancing home/life. Many often work 10+hr days to keep up with volume despite being a salaried position. "
bad,"•	Handling customer issues in a friendly, patient, respectful and professional manner."
bad,No life/ job balance.  Stayed in OT the whole time I was there.  They do not care about your personal life at all. Management is just out to make sure their jobs are secure.
bad,Inadequately prepared in training as medical insurance is very complicated. Rigid adherence to the clock and breaks. Too many systems to use and incredibly long write up process. Expect you to stay for mandatory overtime.
bad,"An ok company to work for. I've learned admission and discharging skills. It's a remote job that allows me to work from home; so, I'm home when my kids arrive."
bad,This company has evolved into a company focused on numbers and programs to help micromanage nursing/axillary staff. Very poor work life balance. Highly reccom. if you like being micromanaged.
bad,"This is a nice company to work for. Fast-paced environment, overwhelming atmosphere dependent upon certain factors and work load. Most enjoyable is of course helping others. However, upper management and corporate can seem ungrateful and less deserving of hard working individuals. Pay is less than acceptable, management can be very pushy and you have to learn to separate personal from professional and this is something that the leadership does not exemplify at all."
bad,Make sure you have a great work experience in many fields. You will need a vary of skills and the knowledge of many areas to excel. Be willing to learn as much as you can with little guidance.
bad,This company is in an ever changing field that requires you to always adapt and change with the companies growing needs. The only problem with this is information distribution isn't always the greatest .
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,This company tries their best to be there for the employees and family. They are very goal oriented and power driven. Upper management does their best to be understanding on all situations.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work in the billing customer service department. Poor Management dont care about their employees its all about numbers to them and meeting your monthly quatoes
bad,Working from home was good. Communication and training is bad. The company doesn't value there employees. They offer a wide range of hours. I continue working until i find better.
bad,"Management gossiped and spent most of their time walking around and talking instead of getting work done, coworkers were nice, they promote people who shouldn't be promoted."
bad,Very stressful and demanding job for a great lack of pay.  Upper management has no idea about the claims preparation that is being done.   Upper management is very weak in leadership qualifications
bad,"If you are ok being constantly micromanaged, having someone constantly looking over your shoulder, and always having to report to someone that doesn’t like you then this is the place for you. Management picks favorites to hire and give positions while they step over internal hires to hire externally."
bad,"The primary challenge in working as a Claims Processor was the bait and switch on continuing education. I'm the type of worker that appreciates hands on leadership, and prodding when necessary, to spur production or guidance. I did not receive that. I asked, and it went unanswered. Instead, I was often directed to peers or to non-management subject matter experts, versus retraining (on the the various unclear areas, as some work was very uncommon, but required the same rate of production). I was never sat down and talked to about how to be a better worker, but I was talked to about going on documentation once a month. By the time my manager (who lived in another state and I never met!) finally started to engage with me, he had apparently already had his heart set on termination. I pushed myself, but there is only so much a newer worker can do solo. Because it appeared I was the worst performer, I feel as though I was labeled as an outlier, and so therefore, I was the problem (as  if to say ""everyone else gets it, why don't you""). Ironically, I was never once reprimanded for tardies, and I had a few. I mention that to say how little actual attention was being paid to me as an employee. Apply if you must, but proceed with caution -- you will have to do most of the development on your own and find your own help."
bad,"$12/hr. No raise or growth with the company ever unless someone retires, quits, or dies. If you get a raise it will be 12 to 14 cents after a FULL YEAR"
bad,"Unfortunately, my experience at UGH/Optum Analytics has not been positive. Our much smaller company was acquired 4 years ago and as is typical in a much larger organization I found that the large, distributed workplace lacks the intimate culture and interactions I enjoy that come with a smaller company. "
bad,cons outweigh the pros i do not have much more than that to say about the company i am glad i am no longer employed there. That place is all about who you know to advance anywhere.
bad,The manager should never have been in charge of staff. Didn’t have the temperament to be a manager. Treat all employees the same. Give all staff the same opportunity to succeed. Not make up roadblocks to frustrate staff.
bad,"The customers are amazing! They are by far the best part of the job. Serving the callers is relatively easy after about 4 months of taking calls but you will be quickly and frequently required to take on additional responsibilities with no additional time to complete them. Quickly multitasking will be required to keep up with the constant increase of demands that you will be given. Also, there will be no additional bonus, raise or incentive for your efforts or the additional work you are given. This job does not give you many options or hardly ever request your opinion for seating arrangements, scheduling, days you've requested off, position, job responsibilities, or market you service. You must do as you are told and roll with the punches because things are always changing."
bad,"My day-to--day job is very monotonous and boring. I like the benefits the company offers such as the financial package and the PTO as well as the flexible hours but as far as my day goes, I am not a fan."
bad,"Terrible management can careless about their workers. No real compensation, bonuses. Yearly there was a new attitude bit still terrible.  Boss was overwhelmed so she came down on us."
bad,"Being a Claims processor is a stressful job, although you are not on the phones, if not trained properly, the job is stressful.  A lot of people like to work for UHC because of the fact of working from home but there are only certain positions that will allow you to work from home and the wait is not what they make you believe it is.  The pay for this position is not the best for the amount of work and stress that is involved."
bad,"while understandable strict adherence to schedule throughout day is understandable, goes overboard....stressful environment, certainly don't follow their business mission statement, political"
bad,Good company with bad management. The management keeps saying that we will listen to all your thoughts and suggestions and implement any needed changes which they never do. They let the business make IT decisions and shut up the IT resources.
bad,Bought out by UHG from Catamaran and the company went down hill from there. Management had no clue and no care and turned our team against each other to eliminate jobs.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"The role of a Community Health Worker is more sales and they don't tell you that during the interview. Members decline home visits left and right and they still expect you to meet your metrics. You are stuck in that position, due to metrics and it makes it hard to advance in the company. You are rated on your calls daily, phone audits, and referring people to programs,  that they program are gonna say no to. Its like a cold calling position. Numbers numbers numbers.  You get paid little to nothing for all of your driving. Pay increase is very poor. Very micromanaged by Manager.  Hard move around in the company if you aren't a RN."
bad,The job  itself wasn't stressful.  It was the management and the fact that they were constantly laying  people off.   The back stabbing and two faced co worker that I witnessed was horrible.
bad,"It just felt like a dead end job where there was nowhere to go. High turnover rate, overly micromanaged and strict. Felt like a number instead of a unique employee"
bad,"Strictly business, not much room for growth, no flexibility.  Everything is about numbers and not you as a person.  Help is available which is a good thing."
bad,"This company turned out to be nothing of what i expected. I am not sure if its just not for me or if its the company itself but i do not recommend. "
bad,A empresa deve olhar mais o lado do seu funcionário.
bad,I had system issues on a daily basis which made the job much more of a challenge then it should have been. I learned how to push through and keep going - communication was not great.
bad,"I was #1 on my team, Average 98% quality, always in the top percentage of top performers and yet i was never selected for any of the opportunities i applied for. Was there there two years, got all types of awards and kudos but when it came time for a raise i got $0.20. Lol this company is for people who dont know there worth."
bad,"Before hired I was promised room for advancements. Since then,  I have asked to work from home and become a team lead. I have trained several people on the floor and my metrics has been 100%. Unfortunately, if you're not buddies with the cool crew, you won't be considered for anything."
bad,They push on having compassion but don't have it for their employees and the rules are different for each department you are in.  Lose seniority if you move departments also.
bad,"Mostly hard working, very intelligent staff and management.  A quarter of the Directors and Managers are poor communicators, play favorites and have unrealistic expectations."
bad,"I have worked here in a couple years. I loved my position as a regional sales director. The team, the VP & President were great."
bad,"This was an incredibly poor atmosphere where it was frowned upon to speak to those in higher pay grades."
bad,Not Applicable - No response as I don't feel comfortable writing a review.  There are different segments within UHC.  Some lines of business is ran very well while others are not.
bad,"I have worked for UHG for five years. In my time i was treated fairly, and was met with professionalism at all times. My managers and co-workers always conducted themselves appropriately. The work can at time be difficult, but that is usually the nature of any job."
bad,"UHG could be great, yet they fall short every time. Let’s start with payback work load. The pay is minimal compared to other contact centers in the region and raises are mediocre. The work employees do is daunting with at least 10 systems and new ones always being added. Most employees are constantly looking for other positions else where or second jobs. Next is the company culture, they do not care about their employees one bit. The appreciation we are shown is at employees or direct supervisors monetary expense. They consistently revamp the systems , but it is never for the better. I would only recommend if you absolutely need a job. The pay would never be able to support most families with the cost of living in Phoenix.  With all of this being said I’m sure someone from UHG who monitors social media and what  not will respond with a generic answer. I only ask one thing of them, if you choose respond do so with intent. With the intent to relay the message to the powers that be that this company seriously needs to change. If not for their employees, do it for themselves.  Change to stay relevant in a competive job market."
bad,"My time with UHC  was during the introduction of Iowa based MCO. My position as a Case Manager was complicated due to the newness of the program, constant change with process and member participation."
bad,"The benefits, both in office and outside, are unmatched. However, the down fall comes with management and the environment where they have you sit next to two other people and cannot talk, while the manager and SME’s talk all day. I would not recommend this job, outside of a great necessity for money."
bad,"review and reprocess claims that may have been originally processed incorrectly, contact provider with outcome if unsatisfactory results were discovered.  When I was first hired the first 7 yrs I was on a great team and was not so stressful and not as much overtime was required. I loved it, but sadly they sent my division work over to India to work and we had to move to new department. We used to have more company functions and fun in the workplace back then also. now it is just work to the grindstone."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"This is a nice place to work if you have prior experience in a call center or in an office. I feel that there are standards and policies not always strictly enforced, which sets a bad example and spreads non-compliance like wildfire. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be,"
bad,"I have been working here almost 3 years and I have applied for more than 30 jobs trying to advance in the company and every time I get your a good match great candidate but we decide to go with someone else, they give lousy raises and bonuses aren't even worth giving out, they want you to work and make production but not want to help you advance or give you raises"
bad,"During my tenure at UHG I was extremely devoted and committed to the goals of the business. It was my observation that the Leadership Team method for evaluating individual performance was not consistent within PM employee community. "
bad,"UHC has a great Medicare product, but too many people are given leadership and management roles who do not have experience with the products or teams they are being asked to manage."
bad,"Worked in many different areas, but now in Optum Tech. This is a 2 star company for employees, but it wouldn't take much for it to change into a place that high performing employees want to stay at. The pay and pto and 401k and stock purchase plan are wonderful benefits. The ability to work from home many days is great. If you are a high performer and want to learn and like to be busy, it's a great place. Two thumbs down for advancement opportunities. 4 and 5 star performers are blocked from moving internally and don't get promoted. For me, it's time to move on, but I still think the company has potential."
bad,When the company makes changes they dont account for the changes in other ways.  Very poor style. They come up with ways to make it a very difficult  place to work.  Upper managment has never done what they want us to do.
bad,"I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to work here. They overwork you and you're underpaid. Management doesn't care and yes, there is favoritism and yes you have to kiss up to people to move up, and bonus doesn't exist."
bad,"Unhealthy Atmosphere. Unrealistic goals, very little support from Outreach Department. No budget provided for promotional items for sales events. No Support."
bad,New hires do not get enough training before placed on phone with customers. They did not seem to value Medicare customers or Medicare business. Management was full of immature individuals.
bad,"Decent place of employment for entry level. "
bad,"If you are familiar with a call center you already know the deal. After Call Wrap up time closely monitored, 10mins personal time a day allowed to be off the phones otherwise you are out of compliance. 80-120  Inbound/Outbound calls daily, stressful leadership team. Great pay, but must be available any shift 8am-11pm plus may have Mandatory Saturday depending on business needs."
bad,There is so much work you were required to work 20 hours  of overtime per week to try and manage the work load / very stressful to have to work additional hours regardless of your personal time off
bad,"People are nice but the work life balance is a joke. "
bad,"UHG is a large company lost in bureaucratic morass. Little to no advancement from within. Very dependent on direct manager for any raise, bonus or promotion and often they have little say to their managers."
bad,Depending on which department you’re in this could be a really stressful job. The pay is not competitive and the benefits are lacking. Job security isn’t a problem but career advancement is minimal
bad,"Keep in mnd, being a health care provider dose not mean CNA. Not many hours are given and nothing is set  in stone. There's also a lack of communication, some mail is not recived at the proper time and no calls or emails are made."
bad,"For such as large company, the culture of each business unit is very isolated. Management claims to want to increase employee engagement but allow for a limited number of access paths to implement."
bad,The company was extremely cheap for the department I worked in. They did not offer over time and was a forever changing the companies guidelines which set unrealistic goals for the employees to meet production which is something they always cried about. All the supervisors were racist and fake.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,nothing to say in regards to the company or the management if you get a job there you will find out yourself exactly what its like & the culture but I have nothing to say in regards to the company or staff.
bad,Process medical claims via computer.  High standards to meet Claim per hour requirements.  Highly stressed environment.  Do not compensate employees for job they do. Management does not always listen.  The employees who work for them are very dedicated and a pleasure to work with.
bad,"During my time with this company a lot of changes have taken place, proving that change is the only constant.  In that time a lot of people have come and go, and policies have been updated.  One thing that has not changed is that I love working with my feel teammates, as they make the work-place fun and enjoyable despite the high call volume."
bad,The convience of working from home was wonderful but the work demands were too much. Management also did not care about the unsafe work conditions if you were a field nurse and when we complained just gave us company phones.
bad,A lot of favoritism in this company. they would like to their customers about their rewards and benefits. Their were many complaints and the customer service representatives had to deal with it
bad,"Training is very school orientated, then when you hit the floor yourealize you know nothng about your job but bits and pieces and are expected to put the bits and pieces together and make nearly unattainable daily /weekly thresholds"
bad,"UHG is a workplace where it is difficult to maintain a work-life balance. The compensation is not that great, and the expectations are very high. Everyone that I worked with were always stressed out, sometimes for no reason. That is the experience that I and many people I know had and it differs from team to team. Although, it is a good company to have on your resume. Thats one plus point."
bad,"1. Management is unsatisfactory. good work atmosphere. free cab    "
bad,"I have been with Unitedhealthcare for over 15 years and seen a lot of changes which I'm always excited however their work ethic has changed, we used to have Christmas parties, night of recognition, etc it used to be fun and exciting place to work, it was beyond amazing but unfortunately all that has changed, we don't do that anymore and the employee morale is extremely low."
bad,"If you are looking into a telecommute position within this company and you are being recruited, Please be sure to ask for the full job description."
bad,"As a former UnitedHealth Group Employee I find that as this company grows it is very very important that you document everything! From the environment entirely, the workplace, and especially management! Management as we know are humans however they bring their personal issues with them to the job and lash out as they please because nobody goes on the HR site to complain. It is very important to document every time your supervisor, team lead or manager handles a situation with questionable results. If there are no issues with your supervisor and or team lead, the company will look at them as Stellar teachers and the employees know different. So I'm just saying, each and every time your supervisor acts inappropriately please document in the HR section."
bad,Everyone is not treated the same. Some people get to do things others get in trouble for. Its a lot of females which means its a caddy and petty call center. Compared to other call centers this will be a culture shock very unorganzied and unprofessional BEWARE.
bad,"The job I was hired to performed was not the job I performed-there was little/no training for the new duties. One month before my first evaluation, my manager said he questioned my ability to perform my duties!? Things were fine, or so I thought and was told, before that. In the two years employed with UHC, I received two salary increases that totaled $1,800-this included annual raise and bonuses."
bad,Processing Dental claims and answering customer calls about dental claims and dental benefits. Learned A LOT about insurance and what goes into processing claims. The hardest part of the job is the extreme work load and angry callers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping our members.
bad,Company promotes multiple transfers of incomming calls and long hold times for members resulting in poor customer satisfaction.
bad,"I gained a value skill set working with medical insurance  Medicare/Medicaid, reimbursement, ARO, RMU, ODAR, CSP, FACETS, MACESS. Everything changes so you constantly acquire more knowledge."
bad,"I love the job I do but the management is terrible. Very unprofessional, and very childish. Vitals are always low because of the constant micromanagement. The company is great, benefits, and pay."
bad,"Consistent Overtime demanded."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The training program they administer is one of the best I have ever experienced and provide a lot of support and resources
bad,I been through 2 accounts with Optum. This job has no security. The accounts are not safe they are always closing. The most enjoyable thing about the job is coming to work and making the customers feel happy. But im willing to move on to bigger and better things.
bad,"Fast pace environment, but the issue is simply a lack of job security, and declining moral."
bad,"Management, and the human resource team was horrible . Was a very unstable envirement to work in.  I made some great friends with some of my co-workers , some were very hard working people but others were just there for the paycheck . "
bad,"If you're in leadership and outside of Minnesota then you're ""fringe"""
bad,The job was enjoyable but did not feel like it was a company I could grow with.
bad,"assisted members in healthcare information regarding their accounts, such as prescriptions, medical coverage, etc."
bad,Its a typical call center. I can say I did learn more about benefits.
bad,"United Health Care was simply just not an company for me.  The company does not at all care about the employees past the building that they work in.  I was hired as a Provider Phone Rep, and a month after my training I was told they would be blending the dept with the claims dept.  This meant twice the work that I signed up with no pay increase. Not to mention that the first raise we were promised after training was never given, because the management then said it was given at discretion.  "
bad,"Ambiente agradável"
bad,Transaction is a hard area to get out of. It's not about what you know but who you know. If you are a favorite you are given special treatment when you do something wrong it is over looked. Managers and supervisor work together so if you go against one you go against all. If you try to report something wrong... look out you will have a target on your back and will be messed with until they find a way to get rid of you. You are not a person just a number and they set goals that are hard to meet especially with the tools given to you. macro always messing up and many system issues. I love working for the company itself and I have heard great things about other areas but if you are in Raleigh/Greensboro area do not work in claims!
bad,"Well you are working for the insurance company yet I am paying alot more out of pocket on health insurance vs my previous job. They are very strict with time adherence.  They want you to try to keep ER visits up to 2% or less per month and about a third of your calls should be home care. So go figure, insurance company for you. They make billions of dollars per year so they can make some useless new job like hiring people where all they do is listen in on your calls. Anyway,  these people are not RN's but try to figure if you picked the ""correct disposition"".This was not how they described this job to me during my Interview. I thought it was cakewalk because all you do is triage but now they want you to sell programs, your talk time should be between 9-14minutes. Very unrealistic and after 4 call ins in a year-you get written up. Good luck with PTO, you bid your time.  You have to make a certain percentage of referrals on each account and there are about 50+ of them! your starting rn salary is $58000."
bad,This position and manager held me back from any kind of advancement.
bad,"Working here is ok, I have actually met some ok people here, other than that, management is terrible, we get no incentives, hung up on constantly, called out of my name for that pay. The breaks go by so fast and no time to breathe! Currently looking for other opportunities."
bad,"This company offers growth.There was alot of benefits to this company, However I did not like the hours."
bad,"This position was not a good fit for me, to say the least. UHC has a reputation as The Evil Empire for many reasons. Extremely long hours and a hostile work environment. Good compensation; average health care benefits that were quite costly, and a culture that looked good on paper and to the Board, but was not realized."
bad,"MedSynergies actually started as a small group of Texas Health Resources and Medical Edge had a huge physician services group that they purchased.  These two groups formed MedSynergies.  The month-end close is generally a time to work some overtime, but they will require work on holidays, saturdays, and even sundays.  If you are looking for a work/life balance this isn't a sympathetic employer.  Beware."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

bad,"No training, system outages on regular basis which prevents you from accomplishing your job.Very fast pace"
bad,Temos que buscar o que é melhor para nos.
bad,I have been with company for almost seven years. I have applied for over twenty positions that are relevant to my skill set. No importance is put on employee development or using the dedicated employees you have to move up in the company
bad,"There is not much room for advancement here (member services dept), and it is difficult to move into different departments. The facility is wonderful and clean, other employees and management are friendly. I have worked here for almost 2 years and had only 1 performance review with my supervisor, so it is difficult to guage your performance here."
bad,"Often did not get paid on time. Eight week training delayed by hurricane turned into a ten week training. This left two weeks in the Open Enrolment season, the time for which I was hired. They based the longevity of the employed on how many sales each invidual closed. The problem was that they did not verify my license (which I acquired as a prerequisit to entering the training [eleven weeks prior to completing the training]) until two days before Open Enrolment for Medicare ended."
bad,"Nice place to work, but the pay was not enough. The boss's tried to learn your personal business and if you did not talk to them you were treated differently"
bad,"I worked five years here. It's your typical giant HMO insurance company. The top execs spend a good part of their time in Washington with an army of lobbyists working on Congress. While 40,000,000 Americans go without health insurance UHG's CEO takes home $100M per year salary, bonus and stock. Their previous CEO was indicted for stock option backdating and forced to resign. Not the kind of place you'll be proud to talk about with family and friends but can provide a decent paycheck if you keep your head down and back to the wall. Do what I did take the job but keep looking elsewhere for something more respectable."
bad,the $ is good but the insurance its self is horrible. One of the worse insurance ive had. There is a good life/work balance once out of training in the Claims Dept. you can pretty much make your own schedule. But they expect you to get 0 errors/ month and maintain
bad,There is nothing really to tell about this job or company. I would say enjoy it while it last because the company priorities are not in its staff.
bad,The job itself is easy and you are well paid but they are very reactive with policy changes when there is ample opportunity to be proactive with everything they deal with. Only 2 of the managers were worth what they are paid. Examples: I was there 3+ months and had neither a one on one nor a team meeting. QA was handled by a 3rd party group who were never trained on or performed the job.
bad,"Long hours with very little management support. Very poor communication down the hierarchy. Unpleasant t, also nasty, environment to work in. Benefits, except health insurance, are good\"
bad,Good pay but the company has no true sense of direction of where they're going. A lot of change but not for the betterment of the employees and customers. Management has unrealistic expectations and don't have any experience in a field that they're managing. Employees have no clear understanding of what company they work for and what's going on. Operations and sales force not on the same page.
bad,"I started as a healthcare advocate. I became a trainer, but was still expected to train all day, and then go back to the phones to assist clients for mandatory overtime. Every quarter depending on your stats, your shift could change. The employee with the highest stats get first pick at work shifts. If you took a vacation, or were out sick, you stats would drop and you would be forced to change shifts. This makes it nearly impossible to deal with childcare and school schedules. This is not a place that respects your family life, or schedule outside of work."
bad,The workplace culture tends to negative and hostile due to overworked employees. They have been in a state of mandatory overtime since 2016. The employee benefits when utilized are helpful but this is not the best working environment.
bad,"Exempt employee only works one way. If you work a lot of overtime due to people quitting and your queue adds 15 new mbrs at one time, etc. when you ask to come in later or leave earlier the answer is always no. This is NOT a truly exempt job. The people I work with never bring this to management. You know the reason why.  They keep adding to your duties with still the same amount of time to perform themto get on and off the phone with mbrs"
bad,"Most difficult staff to try and connect with and terminated contact work early. Didn't have the decency to wait until i came into work on Monday, instead called and left me a message on a Saturday."
bad,"UHC pays extremely well but you will have no work-life balance. Should have stayed where I was at! More money in this case was not worth it, currently looking elsewhere!!"
bad,"Each department is different and each has its own pros and cons. Some were great to work in and the managers worked well with employees. Others were so by the book, they felt like drill sergeants. The higher within the company you reach the less training you get."
bad,The program I am within has terrible culture. Upper management makes rash decisions without taking Input from employees into consideration resulting in poor outcomes.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Decent company culture but struggled to live up to its motto.  The company was more concerned with squeezing pennies than developing its employees.  Work environment is run very lean but there is flexibility with work schedule.  Pay increases were laughable.  The hardest part of the job was to get clear direction or prioritization on tasks.  Lots of good intention but little follow through.
bad,"I contracted with Optum/UHG as a Project Coordinator for 5 months and sadly this is the worst environment I've worked in. Absolutely no professionalism starting with Management which trickles down to the morale of the employees. It's more about clicks than who can effectively carry out the tasks. "
bad,Downsizing and provided employees little to no severance no assistance with other internal opportunities. Company hiring under qualified applicants to pay less
bad,"The collaboration between departments is lacking. A lot of back stabbing at the supervisory level. A new director started about six months ago and things appear to be getting better. People are final getting held accountable. Not much communication between shifts in the inventory department. That starts with the manager and works it way down to the supervisor. Company provides meals occasionally, and that's great. The work force is very ethnically diverse, and that is great as well."
bad,What started off as a great company became a horrible nightmare. Being there for 10yrs and being told I was going to be laid off in 2 weeks was a disaster. We were told to apply for other open positions however I was rejected over and over. This company did nothing to place the lay-off group into another department. Worst part is our positions are now posted to be filled.
bad,This place paid low and then did not offer insurance or 401k until after a year of employment. Wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone with a life......
bad,"99% accuracy is expected and because it's production based with this expectation of perfection, the stress is unbelievable. On top of the quotas, the management needs new people with new mindsets. They even know they have a turnover problem, start with your management! I could not stand the feeling I was inadequate compared to them even with 10+ years but it's a click - you're in or you're not! .  I could feel the negativity when I first walked through the front door.  Work life balance was great but that was not enough to stop me from leaving. My biggest regret, not leaving sooner."
bad,um empresa de grande porte porem somos tratados comoapenas mais um.
bad,"Horrible family work life balance. Plenty of overtime. Bad management and little opportunity for advancement. Benefits were okay. Management would not let you leave at your time to go, no matter how early you were scheduled to come in. You can leave when everyone's job is complete, not just yourselves. On call rotation is also a thing here."
bad,Not the best place to work but pays decent if you need a place that does not require a degree. Management and the company clearly do not care about the workers but try to pretend they do. Money grubbing company that completely overworks you.
bad,Once they put you on the floor it’s like a train reck! If I could change anything it would be the higher up in management they new management in there
bad,"When coming in they paint you a nice picture. Managment at the office change and this new manager wants everything to the teeth. We used to have borrow time for vacation, not anymore. Be aware if you coming late 5 times you will be place on a cap ( the tolerance for latency is only 3 minutes). "
bad,"Things were great when I first started but after a change in Mgmt it went downhill. The new Mgr was horrible at micromanaging, bossy, and made each day uncomfortable. I was moved into a recently vacant role due to a promotion and after I started the promotee wanted the job back and didn't care for their new role. It was no secret they wanted the position back which made things very awkward for me. Constantly compared to other workers - absolutely no social interaction with other employees...come in, keep your head down, no socializing, go home."
bad,"I won;t recommend this place."
bad,"There is little training and you are expected to read the mind of your supervisor when communicating with outside payors.  The IP CM setting is so sterile, communication is nil, and there is very little team cohesion.  The job is boring and, if you do not fit in it, your job will become stagnant and you will not be advanced or recognize.  The management in this department is very unprofessional, but, you are expected to respect them regardless.  The manager is very angry and will personally attack your profession skills.  Negative environment and no place to flourish.  Volunteer work is not encouraged.  If you like staring at your computer for 8 hours straight without communication amongst your peers, this is the job for you."
bad,Overall thru my 27 years ant united healthcare it was a good experience and was able to learn a lot. Did not agree not finding the people that they let go another opportunity within the company
bad,"It's been my first job in the finance industry on a coproparete level.  the culture lacks by far.  They're is no sense of a team or. connectedness.  My hiring manager takes no initiative on trying to make time too get an understanding on how I'm doing and does not provide feedback on where I can build and grow.  Which has led me to feel undervalued. After 6 months I was ready to transfer to another department because of the lack of direction."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is claims. Training is very long. A typical day at work is answering inbound calls from medical office professionals verifying insurance, & explaining claim denial reasons."
bad,"Great employees but management was horrible. The best part of my day was the interaction with the patients, staff and medical personnel.  Learned a lot about healthcare."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Great place to start your career and learn stuff.  It was a great first job and I learned a ton. They have this program called TDP.  It was fun at first but now that I am out of that it is really just a job and not much fun.  If you are older than 25 (like me now) it seems impossible to break into next level unless you are in MN.  Very average senior management. My local boss is great and has given me opportunity to be a lead on some stuff and is very laid back about hours. Annual reviews are a nightmare for everyone. Be ready for forced distributions. Two weeks ago my boss told me on the QT that he was forced to rate everyone lower by his management.  I guess there is a push to knock everyone down a rung this year.  Not that I ever see them or anything but management talks a great game about core values but in practice they don't seem to care much.
bad,"high stress job as far as no sick pay and will write you up for anything,as far as not being able to get to work due to bad weather, or being sick and missing days. the benefits can be good, and the job was  decen tin itself just the no sick pay and lack of training really hurts the employees."
bad,if a Customer service rep needed help with a call. Supervisors would not come over till the customer was extremely irate and they would come help us. That is not helpful to the customer nor the rep.
bad,"65 to 70 hour weeks are not sustainable. Not impressed with IT Management overall.  Senior IP Leadership that reports to the CEO does not follow our cultural values. He may speak them, but he does not practice them. Not impressed."
bad,"TL;DR If you're a manager, fine. If you're a worker, leave it to the contractors. "
bad,Productive place to work. Some of the people were very hard workers and UnitedHealth Group is lucky to have them. The downtown location is not the best place to work.
bad,While there are good benefits and the pay is competitive. Management was not clear about project needs which often created a lot of frustration. you would be told that you were going to be working on a specific project and then spontaneously start receiving work from different queues without any warning. This wouldn't be a problem if certain queues didn't require certain skill sets that you would need to be trained in. I would also feel ignored if I attempted to bring this to management's attention
bad,The workload and long hours were very stressful. Management sucked. I learned a lot about the healthcare field and insurance policies. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
bad,Training was horrible. Trainers failed to make sure you understood the material they were covering. Continued to ask questions about the position and what if you were not where they wanted you to be & never got a definitive answer and was let go because of it
bad,You save money by working at home but don't expect to be promoted within because Human Capital has control over that.  You can have all the experience but if they feel you don't have the experience you won't even get a call or an interview with the H.R. which is the first step.
bad,Micromanaged workplace with work/life balance challenges. Lots of mandatory overtime on weekends with little advanced notice. Poor training with expectations of being up and running after little time.
bad,Don’t guarantee to stay here long unless your part of upper Management . Not much career growth opportunities unless you want to relocate to Optum HQ.
bad,"Company has leadership issues and work-life balance is unhealthy.  Pay and benefits are poor when measured against competition. Pace is extremely fast and intense.  However, they company is able to do incredible things and is a great environment for learning.  I would recommend to younger, healthier individuals with high ambition, but would advise them to pace themselves, and consider it a stepping stone."
bad,Essentially your day is scheduled down the exact moment that you leave. There is little autonomy. going to the rest room can be considered excessive if you don't go at your prescribed break time.
bad,"Very fast paced environment. Confusing and /or conflicting work directions at times. You must bid for paid time off that fall on holidays,"
bad,"Company works employees to the bone. The hours are long and without fair compensation. While the benefits are good, it doesn't make up for the time you spend away from family."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,I am not a sit at the desk type of person to receive calls from policy holders complaining about their plans all day long.  I am more of a people pleaser.  This was a hard place for me to work.
bad,"Decent rate of pay and location. But lack of communication from management, overbearing quality control considering length of phone calls to complete the call from the provider effectively. Call Center environment with limited room for advancement."
bad,"I was only there for six months as a temp; therefore, I really can't say much. All I remember is that it is fast paced and most of the managers are pretty nice."
bad,"Call center with very metric focus."
bad,"Trabalhar nesta empresa foi para mim de uma oportunidades muito boa até porque trabalhei como Home Based e para foi muito gratificante porque eu pude ficar mais perto dos meus filhos,e de excelencia de trabalhar até porque pode ter crescimento nesta empresa."
bad,My manager was amazing however.  Their HR department has a lot to be desired as they didn't even care I was just a number to them.  Work from home was a plus however CEO and HR Department did not care about employees just what needed to be done.  I loved my job but if you have issues please know that they all have a script and will not see outside the  box.
bad,"Unfortunately, this is so long ago,and  with the advent of the Affordable Care Act, it would not be a fair review.  I'm sure they did their best but at the end it was pretty wicked. "
bad,"The company itself is a great company to work for. Unfortunatley there is a lot of work needed in the training and leadership. Overall, that would make the company 100%."
bad,"This was a high stress job.  The 2 weeks of training I received when I started, had nothing to do with the job I was hired for.  I never received very good training for my actual job.  I basically had to figure it out as I went."
bad,"Communicating between teams, groups and individuals can be better.  "
bad,A typical day at work is very flexible although there is no communication within the management structure within the organization. The workplace culture has great standards along some are not lived up to within the organization
bad,"Difficult environment to work in, very disorganized. Working with the offshore team was a waste of time due to the time difference and language barrier."
bad,"Compensation is tremendous including base salary and bonus structure.  Dental is also impressive.  Most staff are friendly and intelligent.  Frequent social and charitable activities help morale.  Good work/life balance.  "
bad,"Immediate group good people but organization lacking unifying element."
bad,Come into work 8 hour shift ready to take calls 5 mins after the start of your shift. 2 15min paid breaks 1 45 min unpaid lunch. Learned how to be compassionate to all even if they aren't returning the same compassion. Management is horrible at the NC site. Favoritism is a big part of the company. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help people on a day to day. Hardest part is dealing with the other employees and management
bad,"I was a telecommuter and enjoyed working from my home. The benefits were quite good, the pay was very good. I didn't like the favoritism which occurred in my team, I'm not a ""yes"" person and speak my mind when I have concerned. The company was more focused on money versus providing services. I worked as a care coordinator for Intellectually Disabled clients/members, and I decided to leave when I was being told to see where I could cut services to save the state and company money. I ended up having to spend hours each day writing authorizations. I decided after  years to leave."
bad,"Very busy call center, well expected. The hardest of the job was taking the calls constantly in an unprofessional environment."
bad,"The culture is to work to the max with very minimal interaction with coworkers.  This causes a rather robotic and exhausting environment.  I worked a position that allowed me to interact with various departments and it's usually the same.  Everyone is so busy.  I realized 200k+ employees causes for a lot of moving people and people coming and going.  If all you want is a check then this is the place.  Benefits are typical.  You'd think HSA contributions or medical for the employee would be paid for from the largest health insurance company but it isn't.  I irecently interviewed at a small business where HSA was doubled and insurance paid for employee.  Given the size of the company management hears complaints, addresses them once or twice, then it's never heard of again.  I can't stress enough how this place is so robotic.  The place for Office Space would be more enjoyable.  Not sarcastic."
bad,"Great place to work until United Health Care came in a purchased the location along with several others across the country and closed down all the facilities, displacing hundreds of workers."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,No comment at all at this point in my life. The plans vary for employees and customers. I wish all companies offered unlimited infertility coverage since it costs so much!
bad,Adequate support not provided to employees to perform job duties. High pressured environment. Systems did not perform accurately as needed to perform job duties.
bad,"They will train you for another department and tell you that you get 40 hours of training. When they get backed up, they will give you 2 hours of training and expect you to perfect it. I was fired for not accurate doing something I was not fully trained on."
bad,"Well let me start off by saying the reviews can throw one for a loop. LHI is the company you would actually be working for if one applies for this position, however, the company follows UHG policies and Optum signs your check. So, let's start with WFM (Work Force Management) this is a system in place to micro-manage every little thing you do. I've worked in call centers for over 10 years now, and I've never experienced this type of micro-managing. If one is a minute late back from break you receive an email from WFM that goes to your Supervisor as well saying you were on a break for 16 minutes instead of 15. This in itself is utterly ridiculous given the fact it takes time to walk to your desk and log back in. After call work time is 3 minutes and what I found to be quite amusing is that if one needed more time to finish up work on a call (which you typically do given each situation varies) one must call the sups/lead queue to request more time to work. WHAT A JOKE!!!! So in reality one is wasting time to ask for time. The attendance policy is horrible. Don't dare have a life/kids outside of work or get stuck in traffic. ZERO understanding. LHI is a joke. In no way are we actually helping Veterans by scheduling sometimes up to 100 miles to an appointment. Imaging explaining to a 80 year old that's nearly blind to drive to an eye exam appt. that's 70 miles away. I loved interacting with Veterans and actually helping the ones I could. However, I didn't like the company. They made the job more difficult than it needed to be. I didn't like the extremely long script we had to read"
bad,Management was a joke. They don't communicate with employees often & show lots of favoritism. Your job is never secure. They have strict security & okay pay.
bad,I choose not to wrote a review of my previous employee. I was thankful to have a job when i worked there and i did my best while i was there. Every department ans supervisor is different.
bad,"Management here is selfish, self centered, and doesn't care about employees career or future, really not a good company to start your career with, quality of work is not that good."
bad,Need a better system in place to meet the high demands of the high peak of the underwriting season. Put too much emphasis on creating a call center/ Underwriting dept. hybrid when in reality probably should have invested in better streamlined underwriting software with prompts on specific underwriting questions. The nature of the job is not a good match for  meeting call center quotas.
bad,"Went to work and clocked in only to find that I still did not have any access to tools or websites that were needed to accomplish vital tasks. Talked to management about it. They tried escalating the ticket to push it along further, with little to no results. Management found work for me to do. Accomplished those tasks. Rinse and repeat for the next day. Management was professional, attentive, knowledgeable, and on top of their game. Head management seemed to be a different story. The hardest part of the job was the overly prolonged periods of waiting to get the tools needed for the job, the cryptic system putting in a ticket to request the tools, and the lack of direction."
bad,It was pretty easy to work just didn't like that we didn't get much to work with or it was very repetitive. Didn't feel like we were getting much different cases to work with.
bad,"Supervisors have their own pets & give them better raises & promotions. There is NO fairness & always being watch on whatever you do or say."
bad,Was there 6 years- terminated on a technicality.  Department was based on not what you knew but who you knew.  I hoe that it has changed since I worked there.
bad,very fast paced call center environment were i represented AArp and assisted clients with calls and payments. the reason i didnt like it was because my boss took her time to work with my school schedule.
bad,"UnitedHealthcare is a fantastically successful Fortune #5 healthcare insurer going with the flow. It clearly has built the political & market clout to demand whatever premiums it chooses on its policyholders. Its premiums are set to cover all contingencies for the upcoming year, which guarantees windfall profits. Technologies are largely obsolete due to security paranoia. Workers are complacent with very little to no interest in change, innovation, or education. There was very little movement in the company and zero professional development offered. This is not to say UnitedHealthcare is a bad place to work. It's actually a very good place with nice people & they've done a great job with remote workers. It's just extremely slow & static"
bad,"Before MedSynergies was acquired by Optum/UHG, there was a sense of family, regardless if you were in the home office or one of the service centers. At different levels, all had a say in best practices"
bad,"not enough trainig"
bad,"Some managers and departments are excellent. I just happened to have belong to a weak department. Some employees we VERY lazy, a couple of the managers I met were awesome, unfortunately the one I worked for was not very good. And one of his/her peer managers was really hated by employees. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"just a job, standard call center in a high school like environment.  Managers don't care and some of them spend their time wandering around talking to friends while the entry level people grind out 70 calls in a 8 hour shift."
bad,The management here is awful.  They do not care about family and if you have children you can never call in because of a sick kid.  OT is required all the time and they refuse to hire new people to help cover.
bad,Management was awful. The supervisor or manager is located in north Carolina and not in Colorado springs. So the person they have on site for reporting is not even a supervisor and she will tell  lies to get what she wants.
bad,"I learned a lot working at UHG. Being involved with setting up how benefits actually pay was very interesting and gave me a different perspective after working in collections most of my career. It was very fast-paced, especially at the end of the year."
bad,I enjoyed working here however it was like walking on egg shells. You never quite knew when you were going to keep or lose your job. Over half of my entire department got laid off but the at least gave us an additional 2 weeks pay.
bad,nice feeling it waz and sitll intersted to work but project going to complete and i need to manage difficult task and always taking sugesstions from seniors
bad,Pay and benefits were decent.  The expectations from management were very unrealistic and difficult to achieve. They are not afraid to fire you if you don't meet goals. Difficult to get time off approved. Mandatory overtime since they were so short staffed because they can't keep up with employee turnover.
bad,"Excellent staff at an employee/peer level, but management needs work.  Management is not flexible and penalizes staff for taking unpaid, planned voluntary time off in an emergency."
bad,I worked here for 5 months. Training did not prepare us as much as it could have and the job was not as rewarding as they make it sound. Training was very contradicting to want actually happens on the floor. You get yelled and screamed at almost every day.  Members swear and call you names. I did not feel as though I was helping anyone! You are there strictly to enforce the policies and procedures of the members plan.
bad,"Convoluted management hierarchy."
bad,"the job is not hard, the co workers are friendly and i enjoy working with patients over the phone. the hours are flexiable but the job is downsizing"
bad,"if you do not like brown nosing or telling on people, this job is not for you. if you dont like doing other people work this job is not for you either."
bad,"There is a game console you may enjoy on your breaks, lunch."
bad,"I have the pleasure of dealing with all different kinds of military people and there families, helping them to understand there benefits and to make the most of there benefits. I make several calls on there behalf if there is a claim that has not paid, I also assist them in retrieving the authorizations necessary for specialty appointments.The best part of my job is knowing that I have the ability to help and assist people with tasks that they do not understand and make it possible for them to understand the way things work. I also do weekly briefings to all the new soldiers being stationed at Holloman Air Force Base, as well and a new spouse briefing and another briefing to new expecting mothers. I have been doing this work for 3 years now and I absolutely love it."
bad,I like what I do.
bad,"Na area que trabalhei não tinha muitas coisas diferentes , era sempre a mesma coisa analisar as contas, porém era um ambiente muito agradavel."
bad,"Dirty environment, everyone sick all the time. No one likes working with the others. Management is horrible, they let the higher Executive Assistants run everything that involves the office. Back stabbing people everywhere, along with power happy managers. Just check this company's job openings. They can only keep Nurses who are working off site most of the time. Executive and Administrative Assistants positions are open all the time. The bad employees that have been there a long time stay and run all the new employees off."
bad,Lack of communication from upper management to lower level employees.  Inadequate training of middle managers resulting in difficult and more complcated investigations.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The company was great however management needed work as well as the overall dynamic of the call center it self and the benefits are very good and you are able to negotiate pay well
bad,"Very unfriendly environment. Pay verses responsibility is completely unbalanced. Simply regret accepting this position. The company as a whole is amazing however this is not a good gateway to other positions, you will not like this department. Benefits are amazing and the parking is not too bad. My training experience was fine, you sit and listen to unhappy employees share how they are desperately trying to find a new position"
bad,"OK work place"
bad,"Management threatens with write ups if you don't meet productivity however never enough work for all clinicians to meet productivity.  You can beg for more work, still not get it and still be threatened."
bad,I worked for UHC for 5 years and received high job performance scores. Automation is a key factor in their decisions to cut their workforce. You feel valued for your contributions and then you get a phone call that your services are no longer needed. There's no sense of security.
bad,"Production based, very difficult processes. Production is more important than anything to them.  Great group of people, but it's just very difficult to achieve results."
bad,"Very complex, difficult and stressful job. This job is not for everyone, as they will explain to you during the interview process. The training is even more stressful than the job itself and takes about four months to complete. You are fired if you do not pass the training period. Overall UHC is a great company to work for with great benefits. Although, the pay is quite low for what you have to go through with the job and what is expected of you."
bad,"The trainer was nice and knowledgeable, however the above management was very disrespectful to the new employees. There would be fist fighting in the training rooms and the hallways, the place itself is not clean. It was a very uncomfortable environment to be in."
bad,I was working on contract they said our contract had no end. I worked all day on a Monday then by Monday evening they contacted me telling me I no longer had a job because the contract was unfortunately ending.
bad,"Good experience can be obtained here and working hours are good if you need early working shifts, flex schedule is available as an option to those who need it"
bad,"I’m seeking new employment opportunities because of the lack of job security. The program I work for was abruptly, as in affective immediately eliminated without any warning."
bad,"UHG was embarking on a culture transformation, but a leadership change slowed down the progress and the culture work stalled. Employees began slipping into old habits of 'performance at all costs,' making it harder to find balance and support diversity efforts."
bad,a typical work day could be stressful because of senior leadership and staff complaints/issues the culture was not the best but this was because of lack of interest from staff.
bad,didnt have room for more staff so they made us work 10 hour days 5 days a week with 9 hours on saturdays made didnt rotate stations and played favorites
bad,Ok place to learn and work. Programs vary. Experience really depends on team. Big campus that makes relationships tricky to navigate. Management is clueless
bad,"Be prepared for an ever changing environment. A lot of documentation, expectations and complexity. ..................................................."
bad,"The interview was so amazing and so different than how the job actually turned out to be. After the interview I received a job offer and a date for a drug screening, they lost my drug screen after it was sent off but; it easily was fixed. Now, here is where it gets odd and way different than what i was expecting.... My first two weeks were “WebEx’s” which had nothing to do with my position AT ALL! Then the following weeks after I was put to my own devices and anytime I asked for help I was belittled and treated like I was totally inadequate for the boss‘s time and energy... In conclusion, I see why they paid so much for my position. PERIOD."
bad,I would not recommend this Employer to anyone. This  Company is very unorganized  and the medical benefits are terrible to be a Health Ins Company.  Their training is not good at all and you usually teach yourself as you go along. This is a numbers place productivity coaching all the time and nothing is ever confidential with  your work. UHC is a very unprofessional  work environment.  The pay is good though.
bad,"I was hired to help with automating some of their firewall requests.   Manager was pushy, and on edge, made several threats.   They have HUGE hurdles to getting anything done because of policy.    I was forced to wait on approvals, wait on permissions, denied access to systems, and pigeon holed.     By the time my contract was up for renewal I had finally received all of the access I needed.    It took nearly 6 months to get paperwork done to begin work.   This made me look bad because I had nothing to show for it.  I wouldn't work for them again.   There were a few good people I worked with and the pay rate was high, but the draconian oversight permeates everything you do.  If you don't like being micromanaged, this isn't the company for you - maybe it was just my manager?"
bad,"A lot of Stress, Very easy to violate HIPPA laws. It is very intense learning and mostly on a computer. Hands on would be so much better,  I don't recommend"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"UHG is a huge corporation, but it always seemed to lack a true corporate culture. That piece of it was very manager-specific. Accordingly, some people love it and a some hate it - depending on where in the company you are. It has a pretty transient employee base - people come and go all the time. My experience was that there is incredible waste and unqualified people making important decisions about the healthcare received by millions of people. It was slightly terrifying."
bad,"UHC measure your numbers (metrics) daily. If you do not meet your targets you will be very stressed out. The company will terminate you if you do not reach your expected numbers. Stay clear unless you enjoy stress. If you make one financial error per month, two months in a row, you will we placed on a performance improvement plan. Trying to get the bonus money is near impossible. Employee moral is very low. If you have a job, stay where you are ."
bad,"United Health Care overall is a good company to work for, a company that gives  eager opportunists a chance to move slowly towards forwarding their career."
bad,"Did everything that was asked of me, however was told; ""They think you don't fit here. I could go up to bat for you, but I wont."" If you're not in the click your out, not based on skills."
bad,No flexibility in hours.  Mandatory overtime January and February. Could not request certain days off. Had to be available to work any day or any shift.
bad,There is no work/life balance here. The Nurse Practitioners are treated like work horses and expected to complete a gross amount and tedious documentation on a daily and monthly basis.
bad,"I loved my years at UHC. However, even from the first week of training everything was in disarray and unorganized. It left a huge negative impression as to how I viewed this large company. Some folks weren't adequately supplied with the tools to either work or train. There are constant computer issue that they hold you responsible for. The company shines at the surface, but once you are there you will notice so much wron with working there. And the benefits are a joke."
bad,Horrible work life balance and benefits are also horrible.  The opportunity for employees to promote is also an issue.  Everything is political and they protect their senior leadership more than they value their lower level employees.
bad,"Everyon is treated like robots, no life/work balance, high stress not even needed, micro management, no room for growth, high turnover rate, pays minimal at best"
bad,"Worked in a role that was initially described as temp-to-hire.  Out of an original 40 contractors hired, four of us were strung along with a contract extension and then let go.  Subsequently, I was offered the same position at a pay cut."
bad,"I found out on the first day of my internship that my manager was going to be in a different time zone than me (I never actually met him in person). Most other people on my team also didn't work in the same office as I did. After a slow start without much to do, I found myself doing interesting but not very challenging work. My manager and his manager were as helpful as they could be given they were on opposite coasts while I was in the Midwest. As it wrapped up I was assured by both of them and others in the organization that my work had exceeded their expectations and I would almost assuredly be hired back full time. "
bad,"I had a very unfortunate experience with my supervisor at UHC, and that is ultimately what led me to make the decision to leave. I felt like myself and the other people on my team were constantly under fire for our performance without any help or coaching as to how to improve, even though we had ""coaching"" sessions with our supervisor. She made foul comments about the personal lives of people on our team, and did not have any regard for the feelings of others."
bad,"United Health Care is great company, they have a great vision and goals in place for the company to grow. It has expanded much since 2010. The early stages of certain divisions was very stressful. In building new processes in accordance medical standards, it was revised very often. The workload is steady and in most cases received in surplus.The surplus on top of deadlines was unreasonable. The management under certain divisions were unreasonable and displayed favoritism."
bad,"poor management, gave us the run around, promised we would be in 2 academies to receive benefits but upon completion let the entire floor go. we were all blindsided by this as they gave us no warning"
bad,Was a great company to work for. They were hiring a lot of new nurses and then all of the sudden with no warning they told us we would all be out of a job in a few months. Did not give us a recruiter to try to remain at UHG. Just told us to try and apply for new jobs on the company website. Just before this they hired 20 new nurses to do the job in NYC that all of us that were getting the Axe could have done. Poorly managed. Was truly disappointed.
bad,"Great Benefits but Culture is broken. Managers and Directors always ""give you the look"" you if they don't know you. Managers have favoritism. Managers are snitches and will tell on you for every little things. Very strict and will treat you like robots who has to remember anything. They will tell you ""it's okay to make mistakes"" but will immediately disregard that once you make a mistake. Lots of drama, i think starts from Managers as well."
bad,It was an unfriendly work environment with stressful work.  I thought I would be talking to healthcare professionals but ended up  talking to bill collectors all day long.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,When I worked there (over 10 years ago) the company was very top heavy with management - which ultimately led me to leave my position as there was no room to advance
bad,"Great Co/workers Life time Friends Work Balance, Great, Poor Management.  Health Insurance not the best for employees . Trainers  "
bad,I liked working for UnitedHealth when I knew what I was doing. The training programs are poorly taught and as soon as you learn one job they teach you another job that is poorly taught.
bad,Couldve been better but it was ok. They dont really pay much for the workload youre going to have. The biggest concern was the pay rate that never went up.
bad,Management varies from location to location.  In 20 years of experience typically management is very respectful of each individual.  Unfortunately when the unprofessional and uncaring are placed in management positions too many good people leave before the corporate office listens and removes them.
bad,"Managerment was very poor and the culture was even worse "
bad,It was interesting learning about the ins and outs of unions and union take overs.  I was a temporary employee helping fill data entry roll for a campaign.
bad,This company lacked formal training programs & professionalism amongst superiors. This company was under a great hat (united healthcare) but did not extend the same values as UHC does itself
bad,"I don't remember much , at the beginning of my career. Since I was a contractor i was suppose to know everything , and no help was provided."
bad,"Only work here if you enjoy being micro managed, constant turnover, high stress level, Love your work but our clients want more of your great work but want to pay less."
bad,"Great company, great coworkers, bad management. Management doesn't listen to staff, or support staff. minimally training provided. The workers are amazing and will be the only thing missed."
bad,The call center was stressful and little room for promotion.  We had to learn a lot in the training program and then be expected to answer all of the customer's concerns for phone calls.  I would not recommend.
bad,its ok to understand my postititon calling customers if they are having a problem with claims and benefits.it is a ok job but I want to do something off the phones
bad,"poor place too work, everything was handed out in packets, my boss didnt know how to hire the right people so it turned into middle school gossip so overall very poor."
bad,very unorganized place allowed employees to bring blankets from home because the building was so cold and the building became infested by bed bugs. Some employees was bitten and took them back home to invade their homes.
bad,"It was too long ago to recall enough details to give a fair rating, but indeed is making this review required so I will rate them 2 stars.  For  most things they were OK."
bad,Great company to work for but extremely stressful with the ever changing healthcare laws always causing confusion regarding the polices. CEO seems to being do a great job. Lots of layers.
bad,Enrollment process is detailed. Employee must be flexible company merging and changes occur rapidly. Must be able to retain new information for the best interest of the customer.
bad,A lot of red tape and politics. The best part was coworkers and callers. You really learn alot about health insurance so much so that you can apply it to the rest of your life in picking your own policy.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,"This was not my favorite job, however, it was the one where I made the most money.  The main priority was fast calls and lots of them. Employees are reviewed based on quantity first and quality second and I was not as fast as I should have been.  I was more interested in giving the best service I could to insure the caller was completely satisfied so it took me a bit longer to get through the call. Customer service took a back seat in my opinion based on previous call center jobs I had."
bad,"I scheduled surgeries, tests and referral. Answered phones, worked with patients and did vitals and roomed patients."
bad,"Pontos fracos: salário baixo, fora do mercado, benefícios medíocres, convênio médico - plano colaborador, ruim."
bad,"Respond to incoming provider and enrollee calls, resolves customer service inquires that could include entering in notifications, Providers status of an existing notification and determining if notification is required, completing notification wizard along with ICD-9 and CPT coding. Provides excellent customer service to both providers and enrollees. Constantly meet established productivity, schedule adherence, and quality standards while maintaining good attendance. Assist with faxes and emails"
bad,overall rating is that you can get ahead at this company if you are liked or popular but if you are not a well recieved or like by your peers or supervisor no matter how good of a job you do they will not recommend you for any promotions. The favortism is not very professional at all.
bad,"Empresa conceituada, ótimo ambiente de trabalho, equipamentos atualizados, otimos beneficios, estimulo da cultura com festas tematicas, e etc."
bad,good place to work.  12 hrs shifts.  free lunches.  good patient care experiences i dont know what else to say.  easy to get to from maryville and knoxville
bad,Not a lot of opportunities for growth. I took on this job thru a temp agency without benefits and needed a stable income.
bad,"I enjoyed Untied .. There training department was excellent, there is room for growth. Encouragement for advancement."
bad,"This company was my first experience in healthcare, health insurance to be specific. I did learn so much about the industry, we had a rigorous 15 week training."
bad,"Trabalho extressante, tipico de uma central de atendimento, senti um pouco abandonada pela supervisao nos momentos mais tensos com resoluçao de problemas com clientes, colegas de trabalhos maravilhosos e companheiros, melhores momentos eram em datas comemorativas, muita descontraçao e divertimento."
bad,"One bad call received from a member can set you back from a whole years worth of good to great calls, preventing you from getting a raise or bonus."
bad,"Depending on what type of work environment you are looking for. UHC is a great company however they could do more to satify and show they care about their employees. If you love a call center type job than this is for you. If you like change, being under pressure, stressful environment, talking ont he phones 90% of the time then you'll love it."
bad,Answering phones and making phone calls to sell Medicare insurance plans to individuals who are Medicare eligible
bad,"When i joined the UHG i found the work environment  and work culture is very different when compare to my previous organization. ICICI bank is domestic company and UHG is MNC. "
bad,answering inbound calls from patients refilling their prescriptions
bad,There are too many changes from day to day that are not explained to management so we can explain to our direct reports. This causes our Reps. to not be able to provide correct information and superior customer service on all calls.
bad,"Busy TWS environment with diverse requirements."
bad,"Huge name in the industry."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was serving patients at a very important time in their life.  Ensuring that patients received the best hospice care that gave a better quality of life was extremely rewarding.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,The workday would begin with checking e-mails for accounts that needed updates. From there daily meetings were standard for outstanding accounts and claims. I didn't learn much with this company upper management would hear our complaints but often there was no resolution.  The hardest part of the job is keeping the accounts from being outstanding and making sure that claims were filed per the contract guidelines to avoid rejection and rework.  
bad,Very stressful and systems problems and don't get all training needed.
bad,"Esta empresa é muito boa ,ambiente agradavel pessoas amaveis e educadas,aprendi a ter mais paciencia e compreensão,supervisores são super prestativos,estão sempre prontos a nos ajudar,a equipe é uma segunda familia podemos sempre compartilhar algo.O mais dificil é tentar ajudar quando não temos a solução em nossas mãos , a melhor parte é ouvir o quanto pudemos ser uteis e ajudar nosso cliente."
bad,"Posso descrever que sempre era um dia de muito trabalho,aprendi muito com as diferenças de pessoas a ser mais paciente e ter argumentação, saber ouvir,ótimo relacionamento com chefes e amigos, a parte mais difícil era que as vezes o sistema não ajudava muito,e a parte mais agradável era a sensação de dever cumprido."
bad,"It's a professional work place and its a very well respected company. The typical day at work is taking calls all day answering members questions about their prescriptions, checking prices for them, checking on account balances, etc. I've learned a lot about the medical field at this job. It has helped me want to pursue my desired career as a nurse even more. The co-works are very friendly with each other. I get a long with everyone. The hardest part is the members do get upset about their medications sometimes when they don't get their medications on time and they are upset about it. It is a mail order pharmacy so it is a more difficult process than a normal pharmacy. The most enjoyable part is when I make customers happy when their medications become cheaper for them when mail service is available for them to use."
bad,Optum started off great in the beginning then turned into a high school. By being such a big company you would think it was more professional but its not. You can complain about rude unprofessional management and HR or the director doesn't do anything but take up for them. Honestly someone should start recording some of the stuff thats said. There was only a hand few of professional leads the other hand never wanted to help unlock your system instead liked to start drama
bad,"During the summer time it can get very slow, you deal with the occasional mean customer, but overall not a bad place to work. Great benefits, other opportunities within the company."
bad,"As a single father with an autistic child, this job was just hard to manage family and my work life. IF you're single or dont have help, then look else where. But if  you have help and want a great paying job where it pays to know people, this is the place for you."
bad,"It's a difficult question to answer diplomatically. So, I'll answer it with a question. If I had a positive view of this company, would I be here, looking for another job?"
bad,I have no review for united health care for the time being they are an okay company to work for its your own experience which makes you and what you like have fun
bad,Very stressful and fast paced job. Typical day at work was answering calls from members and quoting benefits or processing claims. I did learn how to process claims for members which has helped me in regards to medical billing and coding. The hardest part of the job was answering calls from members and quoting benefits that they weren't happy about and letting them know a claim couldn't be processed and how much they would owe to the providers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making new friends that were there to help you if you had any questions. I did like knowing that I was able to process a claim for a member while they were on the phone and advising them that it was taken care of and they would be receiving an EOB shortly in the mail.  United Healthcare isn't very open to working with employees regarding medical issues or ongoing medical issues. They don't always allow the time off that you might need and aren't really willing to work with you in regards to your medical issue or needs.
bad,"In the beginning of my career at UNITEDHEALTH GROUP, I learned a lot and enjoyed my work.  But later I found that UHG don't cover a lot of employees medical insurance costing a lot for medical insurance plans.  I felt the management were not compassionate towards their employers."
bad,"The job itself has good perks but you do get penalized for being sick,  shift change almost every 3 or 4 months, and you are on a phone ALL DAY EVERY DAY and it's like roulette, you have no idea what type of person or people you are going to get that day."
bad,"A typical day at OptumRx started at 8 am Monday-Friday unless Mandatory OT, my day consisted of communicating directly with Doctors Offices over the telephone, scheduling medication deliveries, tracking lab data, billing, and prior authorization, amongst other duties."
bad,Productive day you work hard but the work is exciting. The workplace culture is very good. I learn something new everyday and I like that part of it. You get to use your knowledge and acquire new skills.
bad,"receiving inbound pone calls from United Healthcare members"
bad,"fun workplace with interesting co-workers, and the management was strict but that was just to get the best from us, and that wasn't a problem."
bad,"This is a good company to work for ONLY because of the benefits that comes along with it. If you would like to deal with an unprofessional management team along with an unprofessional staff, then this is the job for you! Have fun with constant work drama, leads telling you the wrong information and you taking the fall for it. Don't be in the bathroom for longer than they think is acceptable, you'd get emails and buzzes. I had high hopes for this company but maybe the department I was in was just horrible. Maybe it will be better for you."
bad,"the day always started great, I don't have any dirt to slang the company gave me a job and I worked. My service to UHC was part time which allow me to manage my home life better/ working three days a week was great and I would look forward to coming to work, just that I had to resign to attend to sickly parent."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Management got worse once it changed from Sierra Health Services to UHC.
bad,"United Military and Veterans has just recently taken over the Tricare contract. This change has required that I work closely with McConnell AFB clinic staff to assist with patient questions, authorizations, and benefits. Everyday is a learning experience as we transition. The hardest part of this job is to transition from a company that had this contract for seventeen years to one that is just taking over. There are a lot of undeveloped procedures and confusion that is occurring. The most enjoyable part of this job are the patients that I serve. While I may not be providing ""hands on care"" I am honored to serve the military members that do so much everyday to serve our country. "
bad,I feel as the company has great benefits but should clarify more about the point system. The training was fast paced but an overall great experience as a Pharmacy Benefits Manager.
bad,Not many opportunities for growth. Upon hiring you they promise you the world. A few months into the job you realize the ceiling when it comes to working in the service delivery division.
bad,"Constant change and re-org going on. Some turnover because of this."
bad,"Supervisors only look out for themselves and wash their hands easily as long as they are not the ones jeopardized. They have competitions among so called ""teams"" and they put pressure on you to compete just so the supervisors can acquire a higher bonus. Customer service is required and they treat their callers great, but that is all."
bad,"Very Production type job, newly company so still workig out the kinks.."
bad,"Company was great as far as pay, they offer great pay and benefits. HOWEVER, they are taking notes on you and will fire you for ANYTHING. They take notes on every little wrong thing you do and tell your supervisor. Good luck if you make it past training. This is why their turn over rate is very high."
bad,"I was not employed with this company very long due to the background company not being able to find my employment and education background. How? I don't know, but it resulted in termination. United Health Group has an extensive training program to assure that you will be well prepared to complete job duties. The management team was very helpful and the facility is very nice. My only complaint is they use a very small background company to complete background checks and they dont seem very knowledgeable of how to do their jobs. It was unfortunate, but maybe it just was not meant to be."
bad,Training is horrible. They make you teach yourself and then throw you to the wolves. Almost all the customers are calling in upset and it's usually because a customer service agent they spoke to before didn't do what they said they were going to.
bad,"o trablho  la bom  podeiria ser melçhor se tivessemos, o instrumentoi de trabalho   de acordo"
bad,"Great company to work for. It has taught me to be conscientious in my professional life. I take pride in myself and my work, and derive considerable satisfaction from completing any assignment to my full potential. I have the ability to multitask during stressful situations simultaneously and I am very detailed oriented. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you at a convenient time."
bad,I would describe them as having a workplace that some like and some may not. It all depends on the person and their expectations of finding and building a career.
bad,High volume and high stress.  Unlimited sources regarding medical.  Awesome supervisors.  They allow no mistakes.  It is like factory work at a computer.  You are expected to process many claims every hour and they audit your claim and do not expect errors.
bad,"Um dia de trabalho,tipico na amil muito agitado,aprendi que somos capazes de realizações grandiosas,sempre com muita cobrança da gerencia.Fazendo grandes colegas de trabalho onde sempre trabalhamos em equipe esse e o segredo para o sucesso,embora ha dias que a cobrança e tanta que achamos que não vamos dar conta,mas no final com o trabalho em equipe,chegamos a resolução.Onde todos saem realizados por mais uma missão cumprida.Como de siz o ditado missão dada missão cumprida."
bad,assisted retirement age members with issues with medicare part d plan and also took payments for their premiums. assisted with calling pharmacies to help get program benefits to process correctly according to each member's respective benefit level
bad,"As any call center goes it was very faced paced. The management was friendly and personable for the most part, but they had a job to do. The job assignment was very over whelming, to many applications and job functions to perform the job effectively. The company motto:"" Embrace the gray"" meant providing information to providers based on the limited imformation  provided to service the call and along with the metrics you were under constant pressure which left must room for error."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
bad,Lots of training provided by UHG. Management was good and its a employee oriented company. Life was smooth in United Health Group
bad,A typical day at United Health Care would include taking up to one hundred calls per day. The work schedule is very hard for many due to the hours of operation being from 6am-8pm.
bad,"at first loved it, my job, the place and the people, then got bought out and was promised nothing would change,  well didnt take long before everything was change.  i was let go, and within a year, my manager was moved and demoted to another department, and soon after that, she resigned, after 14 years employed there."
bad,Answering calls and emails regarding Catamaran beneficiaries.
bad,very long and a lot of hours!  My family and I moved back to Tn where our was is.  We didn't like living in Tx.  The company had a lot to offer.  They only thing was very if you needed family time for doctor's appointment you could not take if off if you didn't request in a short notice
good,"Stay away. Not a good work environment, no tolerance for imperfection. Leadership constantly trying to grow business without providing staff the tools they need to do the job."
good,I worked for a third party company that worked directly with United Health care. It took them two years to finally get me out of their system. No other comments regarding my employment
good,"I was a contractor and pay rate was very low, the expectation of working until jobs were done with no OT. My mother became very ill and I told them I would need to help with her care and they cancelled my contract."
good,"Instalações antigas, alta rotatividade de profissionais por deficiente doa gestores na questão de desenvolvimento pessoal. Zero chance de crescimento."
good,"Poor Management"
good,"UnitedHealth Group used to be a great place to work.  Then it grew too big and forgot the employees.  "
good,Poor management and very stressful. You are not trained and have a very high caseload.  Fast paced environment where you have to learn on your own. Management is horrible.
good,"If you are a single person with no kids or significant other, this is an ideal job for you. If you have a family, forget about them, you're now a slave to your job."
good,"Temp job ended before end date without notification lack of communication with the managers, the training was long and painful for  only to receive 5 calls a week."
good,The department I am in is too stressful and management does nothing to ease that. I have voiced my opinions over and over again and yet my voice is left unheard.
good,"Ask a lot of questions, see if you can ask a friend or relative that may work there. If you are interviewed ask a lot of questions, ask about scheduling time off, schedule flexibility."
good,"Very mediocre, no real management on following through on process.  No clear vision on your duties.  Going from Waterfall to Agile is a joke, it is just a way for Business and Dev to take advantage of deploying changes anytime they want without any notice or documentation.  Product Quality is not there."
good,"a typical day at work mostly busy at the end of the year and the beginning of the year customer service and how to make sure you and the customer understand their procedures,management had an assistant line at first but was discarded so no assistance was provided and department supervisors were not of good assistance workplace culture was diverse the hardest part of the job was the guidelines they set was to make sure they were almost impossible to meet it was like a drug with many side effects the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people live happier healhier lives"
good,"On a daily basis, My position was to answer and schedule appointment for customers to sign up with United Health Care. Scheduling house appointment for agents to drive to their meeting destination and time managing to next appointment."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The hours are great the job is easy but management is college age and have no real clue about supervising anyone. Just like any other call center everyone is messy
good,"At this company you are over worked and under paid,my days were unpredictable,learned how not to do certain things,management was poor,workplace was not good,the hardest part was the cleaning,I enjoyed the residents"
good,This job consisted of answering the phone and getting cussed out by people who have Medicare. The management wasn't very interested in the employees who worked there either.
good,"É uma empresa de grande porte, com a carga horário normal, porém dependendo da área é muito pesado o ambiente de trabalho."
good,The position was temporary short term. I enjoyed the work that they had me do. The staff were very friendly. I would listen to audio tapes and type word for word what the minute entries were.
good,"they lay off no benfitsThoroughly and efficiently gather customer information, assess and fulfill customer needs and educate customers where applicable regarding products and services."
good,"UHG is a good company to their consumers/members, but this is a horrible company to work for."
good,People are here seem to be Machine not Human Being. No Professionalism in management. All they know is how to compel employees to do work more than machine.
good,"I worked for their customer advocate team and for all the work you do and them preaching the ""love on your member"" and ""resolve their issue"" the pay sucked. 11/hr is no money"
good,"Would love to accelerate in anything I do. Excited about a fresh opportunity along with advances. Reliable, dependable, and team player. Ready to start tomorrow with the right conditions and schedule.."
good,"The building was recently updated and now includes a cafeteria and small convenience store, a small gym, 3 additional break rooms with free coffee and hot chocolate as well as vending machines, and an additional break room with TV and foosball table. Normal call center environment with 2 scheduled 15 minute breaks and a scheduled 30 minute lunch and pretty much tied to the phone the rest of the time. No work/life balance at all. It was VERY ""clique-ish"" and if you don't fit in with the ""in"" crowd you are pretty much left in the dark and have to beg for help if you need it. My supervisor never coached me or helped me the would chew me out for not knowing an answer that a member asked."
good,UHC is a good place for temporary employment. Certain Departments and people will have your best interest in your growth others not so much it will be a set up for failure.
good,"Too focused on metrics which they constantly change, making it difficult to obtain bonuses. Lots of moving around from one line of business to another without any choice and very little notice. Lower level supervisors are great but upper management has no idea what's going on. They claim they want feedback from employees but then completely disregard it. Lots of favoritism. Little room for advancement unless you transfer to a completely different position."
good,"was let go right before the holidays, management shows no appreciation. also held to un-achievable standards.Job is always being threatened for any minuscule error."
good,I enjoyed working for the company until my managers where switched I feel like we are being micro managed and no room for advancement for African American women in my current office.
good,"They offer terrible healthcare benefits, deductible must be met before they pay for anything! The pay is very low and the raises are miniscule or non existent."
good,"The company is honestly to political to work for. Its all about who you know and who well you can kiss up to people. I've been here 12 years, completed my degree with the promise of room to move up. I have applied for over 25 jobs internally and their poorly managed HR and recruitment system I have not received one interview even though they are roles i'm qualified for. Don't work here if you don't want to deal with office politics, no work/life balance, and health plans that you spend a large chunk of your salary just to meet your deductible. Its just not worth it if your looking for a happy medium even."
good,"I absolutely loved my job at United Healthcare - but the management was its downfall.  Workforce literally waiting outside the bathroom door for you, changing your schedule without notice or consideration, and management unwilling to back you up.  However, if you work hard and don't attract attention, you might be able to get through the days without ""coaching"" or quality checks.  In a typical day we took about 100 calls from members or providers, and they were usually very simple calls.  The workplace was not a friendly one, but the hardest part of the job was trying to balance my life with my job - being unable to get time off to see a doctor or pick up my child from school when they were sick, for example; I was told that I'd have to be written up to take time off.  There were times that it was rewarding, but that came from the clients that we helped and not UHC.  Call center management was a joke; a group of women that spent half the day on smoke breaks and the other half gossiping in a huddle room.  But once working from home was offered, it improved the overall job and made it more bearable."
good,"Most policies are manager discretion which means at any given time you can be written up or terminated. Favortism Issues amongst employees. High cost consumer driven healthcare plans that are unaffordable."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Micro mangement style in call center enviornment.  Calls with patients interrupted by Leads to end the call.  Graded daily for errors in call production.  More concerned with volume of calls than patient service.  Radiology requires, at times, explanation of preps for detailed radiology procedures.  Patients were attempting to understand, write, and comprehend instructions.  UHC (Sierra Health previously) discouraged time spent with patients on phone.  Patients waited in que often 20-30 minutes.  By the time we reached them, they were often upset.  There was time spent ""talking them down."" It was high pressure and the work was not balanced between phone lines.  Some reps were known to put callers on hold for additional time and go to break.  It was awful.  There was NO encouragement or positive input from management EVER!!"
good,"Constant changes in accounts, "
good,"The company as a whole, is a great company to work for. The work load and expectations are unreal! There's alot of pressure put on the employees because of how competitive these clinics are with eachother.  The vast majority of the people I work with are unhappy and actively seeking employment elsewhere. There's alot of favoritism as well. Management is rude, disrespectful, biased, and unprofessional. Insurance is not great. It is deductible based and deducted from each paycheck. PTO is good. Pay is very decent considering minimum wage. 2 bonuses annually are also decent."
good,"Bad benefits, no room for growth. Great coworkers. Constantly micromanaged. Managers has favorites and bases merit increases off that. Scheduled when you can take lunches and breaks."
good,Training was not the best. And the stress that they put you under I could have done without. They work by work instructions that are not very clear. They rush you though training and do not explain what you are doing wrong. All you get is read you work instructions.
good,The environment here is not what you know but who you know. The communication is horrible from upper management. the best part is being able to work form home after the first year but then you're basically on your own.
good,OptumRx is constantly making changes due to switching out management and was becoming unorganized. All the jobs are the same level same pay year after year due to the constant changes the metric are retro leaving you without a raise. They don't acknowledge you individually and use you in positions that require more pay but doesn't pay you for them because you aren't officially in the role. Overall OptumRx is making changes but mainly to benefit the company.
good,While Unitedhealthcare provides exceptional insurance benefits to members and other employers they provide very poor health insurance benefits to their own employees. Also the work/life balance at UnitedHealthcare does not exist.
good,This is by for the most STRESSFUL job I've ever had. As a CSA we are required to do TOO much! Calls are back to back. RUDE customers!Training is WAY TOO LONG. You are just another person in a seat taking calls. on a daily basis you are told about 2 Sups and a Box.
good,It was a decent job.  The site was clean and located in a great area. Management was a little inexperienced and unfeeling when it came to managing people. Met pretty good people there.
good,Lots of overtime required makes work/life balance difficult. Compensation is decent.  Hard to advance. Feels like management is out of touch with employees.
good,"too stressful for me, company promotes happier healthier work place but this is bad for my health and the cafeteria food is horrible"
good,I was given the ability to learn something new. Learn new knowledge. Overall there was not support for advancement. No career pathing. Way to many hours to work without allowing time for family and personal life.
good,"A typical day at work was full of over time, not having the help and assistance that is so promised to you at you disposal. Some days were smooth but over all hectic."
good,"Busy but productive environment with great team members."
good,Good place to keep busy. Learned a lot of different things of the insurance industry in the 23 years I have been employed there.  It has its highs and lows. Stress is good and bad.
good,SCAM.....If you have a job stay where you are this is a big scam management don't know what are they doing...120 patients to see plus the 1st week of each month the new members intakes (7 longgggg assessments) very bad company to work ...they never let you know how many patients or how many is your case load. They are always hiring because people leave as soon they find out the SCAM.............stay where you are ...unless you want to pass living hell...............
good,Ever changing and always busy. A lot of policies and procedures to remember and follow at all times.
good,"This corporation has some great people employed there, but there is too much business oriented mindsets instead of patient focused mindset. This has caused so many problems for the employees."
good,"I'm not sure what to write here.  My job is to work at the client's home, so a lot of what would apply at a typical job does not apply here. If you enjoy taking care of people at their homes you might like this job."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Our jobs were outsourced to a temporary agency and overseas. 80% of the employees in our department were fired. They kept some of us, to continue taking calls while they’re training the replacement."
good,"I was very productive. I worked with an outstanding group of Advocates and the team was always top ranked. All Advocated on team averaged 4-5 annual rating. The data supported this yet, I was penalized with lies on my reviews with statements that I was not an effective supervisor.....only because I was not part of the click in the office and did not cater to my managers personal agenda....getting her food...being one of her favorites...allowing her to bully me and manipulate me. She was not fair at all and if my performance ratings were compared to my performance, one would see that something was wrong. 15 years of dedication and was laid off......no loyalty from the organzation"
good,Hired under a manager who gave staff complete autonomy to choose schedule as long as the work was done in a timely manner.  Management changed then management style changed to micromanagement.
good,there are companies that treat you better and offer more I was so unhappy at UHC due to the constant demands and sub par systems supervisors need additional training in dealing with employees lots of favoritism definitely not a fair working environment
good,Employees get a high deductible HRA/HSA health plan.  The pay is on the low end for each location.  You must give 24hrs notice if you are gonna be sick otherwise you get an occurrence.  After 3 within a 12 month rolling period you will be terminated.
good,"Nothing more to say about working there.  They eliminated our jobs, didn't help to find another within company and very uncompassionate to all if us, which is totally again UHC core values."
good,"This is more of a starter position in the call center and healthcare industry. Training 4 weeks, go to the floor and do well, can work from home in 3 months."
good,"as áreas não se conversam."
good,"it's an overall great job, weekends off and paid holidays however you cannot have any balance between work and life due to the schedules that change one quarter you may have an opening, next you close."
good,"The health benefits are terrible, no job security,  only people the suck up to management get to advance. Just recently confirmed a downsizing in Provider service coming but denied it was this happening to this location. Will be searching for another job because this company doesnt reward loyalty at all!"
good,Good place to work. Supervisors have favoritisms and stress you out about production. Is sales position therefore as a sales representative we are already stressed. Supervisor have favoritisms on representative that create false accounts while if you do things the right way you are not seen as favorable for the company.
good,Not good about work/ life balance. All about the productivity but tough to reach becuase of constant changes to systems or tools or SOPs. Goals are constantly changing and meetings daily are used to shame employees into working better.
good,"UHC was ok to work for.  Pay was light, pay increases were minimal at best.  Quality expectations were very high, many people didn't make what was required.  Overtime was required.  Had to sacrifice a lot of time with family.  Never received a promotion, they always hired from outside."
good,"United health group is alright.  TTEC telecommunitions on the other hand is terrible, stressful, and not worth the time of day. Dont work for them.  You will be constantly cross-training inmany states (outbound and inbound) no pay advancement from day 1."
good,"Work long hours and lots of OT.  However, demanded a CPH of 5.25.  with very long/difficult charts.  If not met, no OT. Even with a seasoned coder, reason for the expiration of the contract was never explained.  Let over 25 coders go."
good,"There are more bad managers than good, which can make or break the people who work for those managers. Compassion is drilled into every second of your day, but it is not shown to all of the employees."
good,Sorry was a contract worker for them say I can't say. During the time I worked for them I was forced to train my replacement who was in either the Philippines or India.
good,"they always firingDear Hiring Manager:"
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, apenas. Falta de valorização aos profissionais médicos."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"don't like it this job at all, but the pay is good. it doesn't ,make sense don't come here go some place else. management is poor, no role for advancement"
good,I loved my job at UHG.  I was challenged on a daily basis.  I learned a lot about working with other teams from around the whole organization.  Networking is key to making your time at UHG successful.
good,"The management was not fair in giving out bonuses and who was transferred. The only thing that mattered to the boss is weather he liked you as a person or not. It was a disruptive environment and while we were at our desks servicing the customer the lead boss would scream over the intercom, it was so loud the customer's would hear all the screaming and they would get disgusted about the noise."
good,"They hired a micromanager in our department who lacks professionalism, leadership and accountability"
good,Everyone are fun to work with except the second supervisor r. I could feel that she doesn’t like me to work there.  She never talked to me since I started nor looked at me while passing in the corridors!
good,"Some days were better than others.Management wasn't much help with issues. You have to be in a click to get anywhere."
good,"Acredito que o trabalho de cada colaborador alinhado é uma forma poderosa de desenvolver a equipe para crescimento e fortalecimento da empresa."
good,"À Amil é uma boa empresa, mas penso que poderia melhorar o salário de seus colaboradores."
good,"O porte da empresa fez com que a oportunidade fosse interessante, porém, hoje, acredito ter entrado na empresa certa, só que no setor errado. A area em que trabalhei era muito mau gerida, deixando os funcionários sempre pressionados, sem estabilidade e vigiados ""como crianças"". Mas analisando dali, vi que isso se restringia ao meu setor, outros setores da empresa se mostravam melhores geridos, com funcionários muito satisfeitos, por isso volto a dizer: entrei na empresa certa, mas no setor errado. Eu voltaria a trabalhar na Amil, em outro setor."
good,I felt like I never left the office. Co worker and management were never on the same team. Production suffered due to person goals being set in place of the company
good,My department is horrible. Not paid for work and time. My manager is horrible she drives her employees away. The other departments seem to be much better. but there isn't a lot of room for growth.
good,"My experience with United Healthcare was a positive one for the most part. Towards the end of employment, United was outsourcing a lot of jobs, and my department was hit hard with layoffs."
good,Working for UnitedHealth care is great. I just wish that the management where more supportive of their employees and the benefits where better seems to be that people that don't work for the company have better benefits than the people that do work for the company.
good,"My  co  workers are very  hard working   individual   but the management  is unrealistic in the expectations on the work . No quality with home life , many feel  no  matter   how hard you try its not  good enough ."
good,"Our department has a new manager and director, changes are being made and some employees have issues with changes. Management is not very team oriented and are more worried about their careers then their employees."
good,"Low pay, unsafe environment, very stressful, and management doesn't have a clue on how to run the facility. The upper management is very disrespectful to staff."
good,United Healthcare is a good place to work. The option to work from home is great. Everyone is easy to get along with and they take the time to get to know you. The only thing is that it takes a long time for advancement. Some departments need help and instead of promoting within they just ask other employees in different departments to help on down time.
good,"i worked for this company for almost 10 years.  with in those years, the company was renamed from UHC, to UHG, to Specialized Care Services, to Optum Health back to UHC.  Management over the past 2 years has changes so much and often, employees did not know who their supervisors were.  the actual work and work load was not bad, I enjoyed the actual work part of it, but i did not enjoy how they treated myself or my coworkers, who are hard working.  lack of communication, poor poor wages and horrible benefits.  I did however, learn most of my skills i have now from working for UHC for as long as i did. I grew a strong friendship with coworkers and they were all wonderful to work with."
good,No advancement opportunities. Rotating work schedule every 6 months. Management gets left out in dark and then it trickles down to general employees.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Nice people, high demand work load. lack of consistency with scheduling"
good,"The company as a whole is a great company. However the left hand rarely knows what the right hand is doing and the employees always take the fall for it. The location I worked at was in the heart of gang land where you had to drive past  ladies street-walkers and their ""managers"" to get to work. There were often police helicopters searching for suspects in the area, and many employees reported being assaulted on the way to work. Needless to say the people who stayed there were not afraid of this type of activity for whatever reason. There was little to no diversity in the work place. In addition to risking your life to get to work, once you get there you will find the policies were put in place for efficiency before quality. I would not recommend working for this company.  There was a high degree of lack in the training department where little to no access to the actual information you will need will be given to you. This will ultimately be held against the employee. And God forbid you actually get sick while on the job. It will likely not be excused as they have no sick days. I actually heard a Supervisor tell her employee that if she is having a heart attack she better do it on the job or she will be fired for being absent. There were ambulances picking up employees daily. While they offer benefits, they do not pay for the premium or allow time off for doctors appointments. You have to plan your earned time off over two weeks in advance. Since no one takes off work for illness you can see employees coming to work with stitches, open wounds, non stable blood pressure, acute"
good,A typical day at work is all day offering candidates positions with the company. The hardest is not having a good break.
good,I have gained knowledge and experience while working at United Healthcare.
good,"I coordinate benefits for Health Insurance. I specialize in Motor Vehicle Coverage. I go over claims to see if they have any other coverage to determine if there is any other Insurance Primary other than our Insurance. I investigate by calling the member and if I can not reach the member, I contact the Providers until I am able to find the correct information to make the correct determination. It is my job to determine if it is a Motor Vehicle Accident or a Workers Comp Accident."
good,"•	Demonstrate a strong customer service focus	"
good,It was a call center. Very difficult to keep up with the different regulations.
good,"The company was recently acquired by a bigger entity, so there are a number of changes going on including staffing and restaffing. Not too much organization at the moment, but once everything is in place it may be a great company to work for. The stagnancy of advancement may improve as well."
good,"A empresa presa pelo bom relacionamento interpessoal, interatividade, foco em resultados e supera em criatividade."
good,It was a busy place to work. Constantly on the phone. Made the day go by fast. I assisted the patients and customers plus the doctors on claims that were submitted. If they were paid or not. Insurance questions on their plans
good,"Nesta empresa aprendi a controlar minha ansiedade, pos havia bastante pressão por parte dos associados do plano de saude, o ambiente de trabalha me agradou bastante os colegas mantia sempre um espirito de equipe e o que mais me marcou foi um diretor em especifico que fazia ou tentava sempre melhorar a empresa em todos os sentidos, ele lutava pela agente, sentiamos que faziamos parte de sua familia, mas por não ser o unico diretor a administrar muitas das vezes não conceguia alguns feitos, mas era nitido sua força de vontade."
good,Managers are not well trained at all.One hand does not know what the other is doing but they think they do. They give spot awards
good,"On a daily basis, I assisted UHC patients/consumers with questions about their health benefits. Advised what medical assistance was available with their coverage.  "
good,Training provided. OK to work for but job security is poor--subject to sudden business needs. Good money/benefits. Not much more to say. I did not enjoy this culture as I had in previous jobs.
good,"Management is not good, they listen to others and believes that's true."
good,the company will lay you off without any notice no matter how long you been there if the company is not happy with the money side of things and they aren't doing well with the members its possible your department has a chance to be laid off even if you are doing what is told of you to do and your keeping it 100 in all of your metrics they still are looking at the bottom line and not the front line.
good,"A typical work day would consist of you loading your system and logging into your phone on time (arriving 10 early would help in case you had system issues). Once member calls begin coming in you would need to ask them the reason for the call, acknowledge that you understood them, offer assistance to help and provide the proper solution for their call. "
good,being on a phone all day is boring and the office smelled like a salon which caused headaches and anxiety about missing work. everything is scripted for you.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I have no comment I would not recommend United Healthcare if your expecting stability, they lay you off without notification. The severence payout was not that much at all. If your looking to make a career with this company. I would not recommend it."
good,"This place is completely unorganized. The  managers dont like each other so they do not communicate effectively. Thus, creating a tense and hostile work environment for employees."
good,"it was okay. the benefits were terrible. the pay was great.  my supervisor was great, until the office was divided. and I moved to a different postion. and our supervisor where in a different state. they had no since of direction."
good,Management was rude and didn't want to help when it was needed. The pay was only $9/hour. For all the hard work you do and all the things they require in each note about each medicare patient was excruciating.
good,"The work day is very busy and more days than not you are working hours into the evening. You do not get much support from management however the co-workers are very helpful and pitch in when asked without hesitation. The pay is very generous. The company does a lot to improve on morale, it just felt like sometimes it was a little too late. I would have stayed but my husband's job relocated to another state."
good,"Company culture has changed for the worse. Poor morale, constant threat of job elimination. Employees were considered the greatest asset at one time-now if you are in the States-you are a liability."
good,"They are a lot of requirements and changes happening in the company that you often get lost and are punished for following spare of the moment changes. The managers suck and are very stuck up. The hourly pay is unmotivating, especially when they restrict overtime. The incentive program takes so long to pay out; it's unmotivating.  The health benefits suck and you are paying a lot for them out of your paycheck."
good,management has there favorites and people they just look at as outcast. There are people that speak up for themselves without consequences but others are to just take being bullied.
good,"a typical day of work was long ,I learned a lot of things about the doctor and tax levy the culture of the was not bad the hard part of the job was keeping up with new changes and productive systems."
good,The company puts you where they want you to be.....not concerned with the direction you want your career to go.  Had a great position was was doing well but someone left and they moved me into a position I did not want.
good,"I originally started as a temp employee but was then hired for permanent full time., The education and time for becoming a licensed health insurance broker was provided."
good,I worked under UHC at Optum and the best part of the job was the repoire you built with the InNetwork Providers and being able to help them.  The worst part of the job was the micro managing that constantly took place along with the pathetic benefits & pay offered.
good,I dont like working for a company that promotes you based on how they feel about you personally and not by the merit of your work. Its an okay job if you can fit in.
good,"the lead I had was not patient enough with me and she was rude, she would show me things wrong and when a mistake was made she didnt take accountability for her part"
good,Maybe it was the manager I had but overall the evaluations u received even when getting a good score on your call performance was hypercritical. That in itself made the job not to good cuz u were afraid to make mistakes.
good,"a typical day at work is normal however don't need assistance you will not get it."
good,This is your average call center job. It is grinding and soul crushing. The communication is poor and you will find yourself picking up some type of bad habit to deal with the ennui.
good,"the company doesn't give overtime or the pay you was promise , was not happy with the company at all , didn't last long because i wasn't happy or i didn't get treated fairly"
good,"United Health Group has many ups and downs, sadly more downs than up. Its compensation is below industry standard. And during enrollment, it's terrible. The saving grace is the people that you work with, and not for. There is often a fantastic culture within the office space, and some days you'll find yourself excited to actually go to work."
good,I wouldn't suggested this work environment at this time.  My manager doesn't look ahead to the future so she is reactive instead of being proactive. My manager is easily frustrated with her role.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,A very robotic work environment.  You sit in front of monitor all day and have no interactions with anybody.   The majority of staff works from home including supervisor.
good,"While working here, I was a CSR. I was promoted at one point to a Trainer position. It was a great opportunity to train others on the job that I had experience in. But the management was lacking. I eventually requested to be put back on the phones as a CSR."
good,"The training was very poor"
good,"The pay is great and you receive regular raises, however, they are not flexible with scheduling and management is very poor. If in a bind I would recommend."
good,We are consistently told there is no room for growth even though the company is growing my leaps and bounds. Our pay and benefits are not commiserate with the jobs we are expected to do.
good,"A typical day is answering calls from Medicaid/Medicare recipient's from all over the United States, You are told from the beginning of training that you can move up/ work from home in as little as 6-months to a year, LIES!! and with constant system issues its hard to met your ""goal"" (metrics) each month. Management knew little about their job but depending on your supervisor you have a better chance at some type of advancement/ time off the phone. Loved being able to help those not familiar with Healthcare/Insurance guidelines,Hardest part was telling someone no and getting back fire from them.. Good company over all IF you are not a agent on the phones."
good,"I think they try to do a good job for their clients, but are too diversified to pull it together.  "
good,"The job was okay. However, management was not the best at the specific location, the location is needing assistance with management, so they would remain a good company."
good,"For the most part it was a typical job, my company was acquired by UHC.  The previous I company I worked for was excellent, they had great benefits also.  UHC provided lip service however the results did not reflect their mission statement.  Consistent townhall meeting about the future of the firm but they did not talk about their employee future.  On the Fortune 500 list ranked at number 6 but ran the company like a D class company. "
good,Large company with many segments to work in.  Depending upon the segment and your direct management in place - could be a great place to work.  Due to telecommuting - work life balance seems to be a struggle.
good,"Fast pace company call center , working with Medicare and Health Ins , learned a lot about health ins every day . Medicare would audit your work . Each customer was different call ."
good,"Working from home as a Community Health Worker was stressful. Many times was told that our caseloads would lessen; that we would have other opportunities to advance, and that we would be able to use our PTO. The caseloads balloon and when talking to upper management we are told to do what we can. We constantly get told our team is doing to the poorest out of the whole United Healthcare organization; not a great working environment and does not foster progressiveness."
good,Management does what they want. You think that there is a stable culture of advancement and employee value but there is not. They make all this money but it does not trickle down to the ones who are earning the money for the company. They do not make every effort to retain talent..everyone is expendable.
good,"work is measured in How much and how fast.  I do not wish to  make any further comments about employment at Briova other than lots of required overtime, lacked work life balance"
good,"Lots of unnecessary meetings."
good,"It seems like UHC will hire anyone, and only people with no other options stay.  This place is absurd at the levels of micromanagement that they go to.  It is also like going back to 8th grade, the leadership and management create a petty environment.  Management was proud that they had a 98% turnover rate."
good,"its all depends on what project one is chosen to work and be a part of team."
good,This is not a work place. All managers do is gossip. If your someone like me that stays to yourself it won’t go well for you. Management team is so immature. They are miserable women.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Friendly environment and co workers are very nice and supportive when needing assistance Upper management wasn't helpful when needed their assistance. Supervisor was very understanding always attentive to help in any way possible
good,There was never any continuity. The hardest part of the job is never knowing what your schedule could or would change to. The best part of the job was the friendships that you could create. I didn't learn too much.
good,United health has good reviews but working for optum can be harsh. Unless you are a favorite then dont expect much help on balancing your life. very strict
good,I had a wonderful outlook of MSLA/UGH but once promises starting being made from management and nothing would come to pass the associates would start drama and complain.
good,"Being that I'm going on 3 years working for United Healthcare, there have been numerous internal positions available; however, as in any other company it's all about who you know. Being a valued team member or a contribution to the company, tends to go out of the window. A lot of the positions within United Healthcare are metric based, ""supposedly"" as well! If you don't like to be micro-managed, United Healthcare may not be the type of work environment that you would like to work in."
good,The only issue I had with the job is the customers who called made it difficult. Sometime they would be so upset and crying. Most of the time mad and yelling I can handle but the crying was the most upsetting. Even after doing everything within my power to assist them a lot of times it was just too much for them in the end and nothing could be done further to assist them.
good,"It is who you know -- passed over for management position only to now be managed by someone w no management experience or experience to my level - she has set me for failure and notice by team to disregard any input I have for team-stripped me of my responsibilities  as a senior. very back stabbing. "
good,Stressful work enviorment horrible management low pay. Extremley high procdution. There is not alot of room for advancement and when oppurtities due apporach management will hold you back
good,Not an organized company.  Training needs to be by actual tainers and not just regular employees!  Management gossips alot and dont keep private information confidential.
good,"United health care has the potential to be a great company but is off target when it comes to its employees, the employees are what keeps the company running and should be treated with respect. the company talks about compassion but has none for its workers. the company does not care about employees having a life outside of work and require ridiculous amounts of overtime to a job that is already stressful."
good,"No work life balance, too many meetings, pay is not great and the insurance is terrible. I cannot afford to go to the doctors because of the deductible amount"
good,"UHG as a whole is a great company to work for, but as far as the lines of business that UHG manages that is not the case. UHONE is the individual commercial insurance side of UHG. Typical call center for medical benefits/claims customer service. The day to day work as a customer service rep is as well as could be expected. Where the problem comes in at is with UHONEs inability to keep up with the times of technology. You never really get the feeling that you truly help anyone because for every issue there is you have to send it to another dept to have it done, and once it gets there it is not a guarantee the issue will be resolved. They have no sense of first call resolution at all... also the products they offer, although off market are still not very good at all... the brokers/agents that sale these polices are not well educated so either they need more training or they are purposely omitting pertinent info when selling these polices just to make a sale. Which in turn makes the customers call in and get irate with customer service reps when services are not processed the way they were told it would."
good,Worked with great people across the US and overseas. Hardest part of the job is the constant change of management. This meant new rules and inexperienced managers.
good,"The company stresses being compassionate to customers, but they themselves do not show the same compassion to their employees. The work load and pay are not equal. you are required to do much, for little."
good,"I enjoyed my time at UHC in the beginning but soon saw that if you did not know someone it was difficult to advance.  Your merit was not enough. If you are willing to brown nose and be ""clickish"" this may be the job for you."
good,"Great Company for future looks. Currently low on promoting and offering advancement to internal employees."
good,"I found the job fun but the management made it hard to work there, the fun part was finding and working out the issue that came up daily.  Not enough,"
good,Job work/ life balance is not great at UHG. Could be more of a feedback oriented organization. Coworkers are supportive but Management is lacking from a support perspective. Hardest part about the job is not having a clear directive and no feedback to grow.
good,Working in insurance especially in a call center environment is fast paced you take on a high volume of calls consecutively. You have to keep focused and very detail oriented.
good,This isn't a good fit for me. I am used to more face to face communication with a patient/member/customer.  I am also not used to being micro-managed.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"stay away..u have a better chance of making it a wells fargo! horrible training, biased managers. lots of brown nosing."
good,love the people I worked with. did not like management policies or how people were treated. the hardest part was hearing how upset members got when we did not pay a bill right and getting yelled at. the most enjoyable was helping the members and providers.
good,"the mandatory overtime since august started as one day a week and gradually increased to 5 days a week. it went from one hour to 2 hrs. the system(s) delayed responses was an inconveience of peforming job functions. the communication among departments could have been more parallel and uniformed, its an alright company to work for, just not in line with what i imagine i could/would be doing to provide a public service to community."
good,"Data entry, this job dealt with inputting enrollment applications into the system and reviewing medical conditions and prescriptions which needed to be reviewed by an underwriter for approval prior to acceptance. As an Enrollment specialist we also needed to respond to correspondence for customers."
good,"Sr Customer Service Reps are 100% CALL CENTER. . nothing ever works right, systems down daily with you being left without access answering 60 calls only telling them they have to call back, high turnover rate. Please do yourself a favor...apply elsewhere."
good,Worked with a ticketing system on tier 2-3 issues. Assisted network/security teams. Constantly went above expected job duties.
good,ok place to work. very busy department. good work schedules. over time hours. paid vacations. Thanksgiving off and the day after
good,"Every day has a challenging due to worst management, and many uneducated type co-workers."
good,"Call center work. lots of mandatory overtime. Impossible demands to keep you call time below 4 minutes when the software crashes and /or doesn't work, there is SO MUCH documentation you have to write or you get failed in quality and you have to do it on a call or another call will come in, and you are dealing with elderly people often lonely and understandably want to chat. Met some really nice people working here."
good,"My typical day at work is assisting the members with with their health care needs, I learned  how to read and understand the medical bill that the doctor's sent to the members for their medical services tat were provided..My co-workers were always willing to assist in any matter to make sure the member is satisfied.The hardest part of the job was when we had a system outage.What I enjoyed most about my job was when our members were satisfied."
good,"organization puts alot of pressure on the employers, lack of upper management keeping employees information safe. The environment is cold"
good,"Research claims processing, and provide information to client so it claims can be resubmitted for adjudication."
good,The lunches are short and we are not allowed to go to the restroom util its your break or lunch which is 30 min for your lunch and it takes you about 3 min to get to the restroom 5 minutes to the break room and then to microwave your food another 2 min then to find some where to eat about 3 minutes so by the time you sit down you have 17 minutes to eat your lunch.
good,coming in trying to work but mamagent is too busy trying to cause conflict in the office.
good,"A typical day of work for me revolves around sole independent efforts to manage the team's mailbox for inquiries, consult benefit setup inquiry related questions, work as a problem solver for benefit setup issues, work team related projects for mass updates, and test upcoming changes for the department to ensure effectiveness.  I have learned how to rely on the materials thatare available for access in order to produce the most accurate result possible.  I have learned more about time management and the ability to manage several projects at one time.  "
good,"My position at UHC was a production position, I knew that going into the job and I had no problem meeting the goals given to us. "
good,UHG is ok but you will have tough time to find time for youself.
good,"Good Workplace , of managers and awesome employee , need to improve communication with employees."
good,Acquired the skill of being a release manager.  Worked as a project manager and quality assurance manager.
good,A typical day at work includes receiving incoming calls from physicans and hospitals inquiring about benefits and claim payment status.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Avaliação Regular, Não existe (muito raro), promoções dentro desta empresa"
good,United HealthCare is a good place to start working. The is no much room to grow and the environment feels like the supervisor is your high school teacher and management is the school principal you are graded constantly and some of the grades doest even make sense
good,"I love my patients and what I do. I have nothing bad to say....other than management is back stabbing, lots of favoritism. Even when you go to work and choose not to dabble in toxic work culture like gossip, work peers used that and isolated me and gossiped about me behind my back. I go to work and give it  120 % every day, hold my head high and the vultures (Clinical Administrator who cant stand me) systematically turned everyone I work with against me.  Very high schoolish..from the PA's to the PCRs in the front. Our previous companies (GMS) toxic culture transitioned into our new company Wellmed and it makes working there very stressful. Good pay, not enough room for growth in the Phlebotomy area. They do not have a flexible schedule to allow you to go back to school to progress with your education."
good,Always preach that we are a family but would throw anyone out in a hurry. Very secretive about the behind the scenes from management. The job itself is stressful with the targets and demands they want from you. They do not seem to add up with the companies overall objectives/mission.
good,"United Healthcare was a typical job within the Healthcare industry. The department I worked in, was fairly new, and did not have the organization as the other departments, that where well established. The wage was pretty low, for the industry, but it was just a typical office environment."
good,If you are ok with doing vary similar tasks day in and out with long hours of continuous and constant overtime then this is the place. However if you are looking to grow and advance along with more around in positions this would not be the place unless you put in the years.
good,Fairly cushy job without a lot of accountability. Don't work here if you want to learn valuable skills and advance in your career -- I felt like my technical skills were stagnating after a while
good,"They are always asking for overtime. If someone is on vacation, you have to make up their work. They also make up policies and rules as you go throughout your time here."
good,Shift is always busy. The management at my time had many opportunities. The workplace culture is somewhat fun. The hardest part of the job is being left out when I was not able to meet my metrics.
good,"UHC is a nice place to work if you are lucky enough to have a good team. There are a lot of teams where people are not satisfied with the job profile, the pay and their team mates and Supervisors"
good,"United Healthcare is not the same company it once was when I first started. The company has concerned itself with being more cultured and diverse, now expanding globally that it has forgotten about current employees and members. Providers are declining contracts and it has just changed but not for the better."
good,"I wouldnt recommend working here in the quality assurance department if you have experience though. It's great for someone just starting out who need education and experience. If you want to advance in your work though, dont work here unless you plan on working in the office in Brentwood TN. Also be prepared for a director who is threatened by anyone who she thinks may know as much or more than she does,  she'll find reasons to be rid of you and may even take that a step further by putting you on a blacklist.  I know it sounds like fiction but sadly it isnt."
good,The organization is outstanding and management at the time of tenure was extremely stressful.  The company has managers that are not always helpful and during this time both my Director and Supervisor caused several issues for the Credentialing team.  This manager cursed at her employees thus causing many of the team to leave.  Times have changed and the supervisor was dismissed for cursing at her employees.
good,"Pros: many jobs are work from home"
good,"This company treats their UM nurses like robots.Today, the culture is stressful and employees and management are passive aggressive. Mandatory production and quality metrics are unattainable."
good,"My manager did not want staff to leave the department so poor reviews were given. Our department lost many great workers due to management. Only option was to leave the company or stay in the department. People start with a large company like United so they can have multiple jobs, not be forced to remain in one department. A negative review means no raise. Disappointing experience!"
good,"I'm blessed to have a job,  but I know I could do better.  They speak of room to grow,  but it really isn't.  The pay is not good for my position, they offer overtime and abruptly take it away.  Forcing you to work 2 jobs"
good,"Company is overloaded with management - generally report to 3 or more people who direct your work. Management expects 50-80+ hour work week for months at a time. Annual bonus system illustrates the culture - a manager can only distribute bonuses to a few members of their direct reports. So although team approach is preached, only manager's favorites are rewarded. There are few opportunities for promotion and middle and upper management is shuffled around 2-3 times a year. Health care benefits below average."
good,"I think United health Care is a great company, and they have great leaders however the leadership I was under was ok. They weren't really engaging and concerned with you until there was an issue or a survey on how they are doing as a leader is coming up. If you expressed interest in moving up or to a different position they would ask what department like they were going to help you, but then no follow up, assistance or advice other then keep trying. The position isn't a secured position we have to worry about layoffs and supervisors to blame it on a bad survey to try to scare you in to giving them a good survey to secure your position or call us Americans spoiled when they can pay off shores 5 dollars an hour and they would be ecstatic. I know my review isn't going to go too far and it doesn't represent the entire company just my experience. I think where United Health care is going as a company is really awesome and I look forward to seeing where they are in the future even if I am no longer with the company.  They do hire felons too it just depends on the crime."
good,The pay was horrible and management was equally as bad.  My time there was mostly stressful and not a pleasant environment to work in.  The company wanted you to a certain quality of work without the proper training.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It really depends on your manager. Often times they all provide different answers. It is difficult to get answers because you are supposed to follow the chain of command but when there are management issues it is difficult to get the help. There is a ton of documentation requirement often times it is all redundant. Policies and documentation is always changing to require more and more. The case load is extremely high from the moment you complete training. If the case load was lower it wouldn't be so terrible but I was told from my manager to spend as little time with the member so that I can complete the documentation. I also found that due to the political corporate setting, getting anything accomplished to actually help members is so difficult even though constant concerns and questions are being raised about the quality of care."
good,I worked in the call center for market place insurance. It was not a bad role. Then was moved to Eligibility for employers that had United Health Care for their plans. Got to deal with HR and third party vendors for employee health coverages. Really liked that part of my job. Then was moved to the RX part. Hated it! Did not like telling seniors and disabled that they could not get their medications. If you did not make a certain upsell quota per day you were getting talked to. Management micro-managed so much that it was hard to concentrate on helping people because you were to worried if you were doing everything right.
good,"UHG is a great place to start your career and allows you to work with very talented people, but a clear promotion pathway is rarely communicated. It is a monolithic institution that is slow to change and adapt."
good,"I've worked for this company for nearly 4 years. My current management doesn't know what is happening from one moment to the next, refuses to communicate, and gets offended when the issues are brought to light. There are regular Ethics Violations, Zero teamwork, and aggressive hostility."
good,"My most recent supervisor was good. My previous supervisor liked to take people to task, put them on the  spot, and expected performance in a fear based culture. The attitude was ""if you can't handle it, you're doing it wrong"". If you communicated being overworked, overwhelmed, or just plain bogged down by the large tasks and mitunia of every detail, you ""couldn't manage your time"", and staff were penalized. There was little to no accountability in management style, no trust, and definite micromanaging. "
good,Management is poor and no opportunity for advancement currently based on the current management/supervisor. Loved my job until the most recent 3 year's
good,"Being in claims, the training is 6 months long. If you miss or have to leave early more than 2 times, you're written up. In my training class there were a few moms who were on a final notice since they missed work due to their kids being sick or snow days. However after training when you're on the floor, you can ""flex time"" which is great for doctor appointments, ect. It also feels like they select a person each week to break until you quit. They will pick at everything until you never know if you will have a job the next day. The environment alone will tear you apart with the cliques and obvious favoritism. I will say that my supervisor at the time was great and didn't fall into the drama of the company which made the days a little easier."
good,Training covered most items but did not cover live calls well enough. Training overall was not adequate and cover the live calls well enough.  Live call exposure was too soon and management was not completely professional.
good,"The best part about this position was working remotely full time. My team members were great.  "
good,Work/Life balance at the OptumRx division of UGH is such that you work until your life is out of balance. Their attendance policies are not consistent across the board.
good,Management lacks skills to connect and provide direction for their employees. Peer to Peer relationships are strong within UnitedHealthcare. Option for overtime is great.
good,The numbers were hard to meet and the job turn around is crazy due to people getting let go from not meeting the outrageous numbers they want you to meet
good,"Not well managed, difficult to find manager when needed help and was not a customer mindset oriented. Pay wasn’t worth job stress level or work that was needed on a day to day basis."
good,Ok Place to work. Ok environment. Decent salary. Training was not very good . To much mandatory overtime. Systems and equipment were pretty good to work with.
good,"Depending on direct supervisor.  Such a huge company the culture changes from one division to the next. Some training is required annually, but there are many optional training opportunities."
good,"Typical day at work was coming in and being completely focused on production and meeting your goals, poor management and them filling positions in another states location did not provide the opportunities promised for learning,cross training or any type of advancement in the work office. The hardest part of the job was the morale of the office. I am a positive person and coming to work daily with co workers who are miserable, grumpy and unhelpful really takes a toll on you."
good,This was my introduction into corporate America. I worked in the call center and all call centers are terrible in my opinion. I couldn't use the bathroom when I wanted. I had to wait for my assigned break.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"There’s not much in great here, it’s a job. There’s not many minorities beyond desk level positions. Turn over is high. There’s not much diversity at all"
good,I did not actually work for United Health Group. My company provided customer service for part C medicare plans in a third party call center enviroment
good,Manager not willing to work with me about time missed for family illness and death. I know initial training is important but family member was diagnosed and passed during my training.
good,"Though I am excelling in my position at UHC I am unable to quickly move up in the company, it is an impersonal process and they don't pay a fair wage for the cost of living in Butte County."
good,"Senior officials are astute, forward thinking and strategic.  UHC is a highly matrixed environment with many levels and functional departments.  Middle management tends to be self-promoting and reactive."
good,"if you work for the fulfilment pharmacy backend, they have their clicks and management does not recognize you if you're doing a good job unless you brown nose. I don't know if HR knows but this is what's going on with this company... they boast about how much they made for the year.  It's the employees of OptumRx did that for them and WE do not get any of it."
good,Not very flexible and low pay. Work you very hard. Very little rewards for employees to show appreciation.  You are just a number. It could just be the department I work in though other people seem to have more flexibility.
good,"I worked as a temp for the Asian initiatives branch of United Healthcare (UHC) but I ended up working longer than I had planned. I learned about the difficulties of customer service especially when there's a language barrier. Management was directly under the senior  marketing assistant but usually I am also asked to help other staff. Workplace culture is generally laid back but there are definitely some office politics. Hardest part of the job was adjusting to added on duties that were not part of the original job description. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting in setting up events and interacting with customers, occasionally with free food."
good,I am not going to review this company as I worked for Optum which is a child company of United Health Care and I do not feel that I should review based on a child company.
good,MedSynergies was acquired in 2014 by Optum/UHG and has gone down hill.  More than 70% of the company has been laid off since November 2017 and more to come.
good,Upper management only look out for their own behinds. Starting docking is on pay. Other then that not really micromanaged which is good. Allows you to do your own work in peace.
good,"United Healthcare is a nice place of employment because they offer the option to work from home. However, the pay is not great nor do it matches the amount of work that you do for the company. I have received .23 cent raises while doing 3 people jobs and positions, they do not offer flexibility as much with the schedules it goes by seniority."
good,Managers needed to be more aggressive in client and employees management and not just more on delegation of tasks. Annual increase is not based on performance but how generous the director is.
good,"UHC is a good company to work for if you can get in a good position.  My experience is that once you get into a position, it is difficult to move to a different one."
good,"Great training! I must say. Other than that, the compensation for licensed agents was the lowest in the area. No room to grow or move up. The team leads were horrible and unprofessional. If they thought you knew more than them and could possibly move up, they bad mouth you to higher personal. Overall, not a company I would recommend."
good,"Every call that comes in, the answer is retrieved from a data base."
good,"Working at United Healthcare was a nightmare. Besides the lack of advancement, my supervisor was terrible. She had no knowledge or idea of what the work entailed."
good,"Trabalhei como jovem aprendiz, beneficios são poucos e não tem oportunidade de crescimento na empresa."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The job does offer advancement and bonuses with raises every year If you meet criteria. Management and training at this site is poorly for  DSNP plan.
good,"Uhg is cut throat especially at jacksonville location management in pa dept  are  unprofessional loud rude and disrespectful"
good,"the company needs to make adjustments to how certain departments are ran and how it treats its employees , great people , positive work environment , some of the best supervisors I have had in my entire career ."
good,My manager lied a lot.  She made her own rules in order to get her way.  She was not sympathetic to patients needs instead more concern with how to save the company more money.
good,High job insecurity and high stress environment where employees are viewed in a mechanical way. Heavy footed to get past red tape in any solution implementations. Year over year salary raises are nominal and budget constrained. Employee engagement is highly promoted however only for social responsibility events as employees do not have time or resources for many activities or interactions. Highly political but enriching to work with some very talented senior leaders.
good,"Ambiente trabalho bom"
good,"In the 3 years I've been here, i've seen only 1 person (who's been there 9 years) move up 1 grade level, whereas management moves constantly, i've had 5 different VP's in the time. The environment is fast paced- with little rewards."
good,"Clock in, fast paced, members & management can cause a load of stress, hard work doesn't pay off, poor compensation, no appreciation towards employees."
good,"Day by day it has been spiralling down. It is no more United Health Group but Optum India. Wouldn't be advisable."
good,Worked with Optum360 - division of UHC.  New startup - began from beginning.  Growing pains and employee education on products still occurring.  Very high stress company to work for due to constant reorganization and change of responsibilities and management.
good,UHC has a reputation of hiring and laying off.  They do little to redeploy staff to keep the experience in house.  It seems like the cycle is about every 3 years.
good,If you can find your place in this company it can be great. If you are trying to be the voice of change and or cutting edge be prepared. It is slow and tedious.
good,"if your just getting out of college its a great job."
good,"The job advertised to be work at home after 6 months but the manager did not allow this to happen. The environment and culture is very detached, I feel as though you are not appreciated."
good,"In one year as GR VP I had 6 different supervisors; lack of leadership and direction, constant turnover; no job security; no life work balance; isolating work experience"
good,"a big part of research and resolution was learned on this job, and that id my hearts desire that is why I am moving on to expand my education in resolution and research.  Catamaran has been a great place to learn research and problem solving."
good,"UHC was a great place to work my first few years. Once I was ready for advancement, the advancement opportunities were put on a freeze and layoffs began soon after I exited the company. They continue, up to present day."
good,"Aprendi muito sobre contratos, porém a parte mais difícil e ser sobrecarregado e não ter reconhecimento."
good,"super political and cut-throat; not until the start date did i realize the position was NOTHING like it was presented during interview process. boss seemed fair but the atmosphere leadership presented was very uncomfortable filled with weekly deadlines, micromanagement and lack of value in quality of work (and little attention was paid to the moral values/ethics to maintain compliance with the feds)"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Overall the company is good when it comes to health related issues."
good,"i enjoy my job duties, however there's so much other stuff put on you and that's what makes the job itself stressful. there's always emails of threating you if you don't do this or that you will be wrote up."
good,"They are a company that looks very good on paper, however most hourly employees cannot utilize the services they offer. "
good,this job was a lot to do with the low pay you received. the managers were unprofessional and they ended my contract without telling our agencies they fired all of us the day we came in for work
good,"Too large to navigate at times"
good,"UnitedHealth could benefit their employees by improvement  in areas such as Job Work/Life Balance, Compensation/Benefits, Job Advancement and Turnover, Management, and Job Culture."
good,"Assist doctors offices with medical benefits , Process pre authorizations ,  Log into the dialer and be ready to take calls and give information . Back to back calls"
good,The consistent focus on sales and membership took away from the caring part of the job. You had very little time for break and lunch. Just getting down stairs took 10 mins. The management was very pushy and most were out for themselves.
good,"I was very excited to join the company, however while in training, there were bumps and bruises wit the trainer, and did not feel as thought I received the best training assistance while employed."
good,"Very flexible schedule M-F. Able to balance work and life. Pay is great for someone with little to no obligations/responsibilities. Otherwise, second job or another position with higher pay is necessary. Management could do better with communication/training. This makes meeting metrics and goals difficult. Not meeting goals = no promotion. Advancement opportunities little to none. Seems to be all about who you know and not what you bring to the table."
good,"Position didn't feel like nursing at all, more like that of customer service representative. Always on phone in a cubicle and every minute monitored and critiqued for evaluation."
good,The members are not the priority at this company.  Being #1 is their primary focus.  If you are ambitious and want to move up and show a drive then you will succeed.  If you care more about people than numbers this is not the place for you.
good,"The position was great, but the expectations were constantly changing and here was little work/life balance. Management sometimes appeared to be operating blindly. Compensation was not fair for the work required"
good,"Best job ever, although my contract ended.n My coworker are really great people. I learned so much about the health industry. I met many people and had an opportunity to help people too."
good,"Looking for a more rewarding job. Work and family balance is important. Currently work days, nights and most weekends."
good,"Department manager was inexperienced, lacked direction and ability to lead. Company was great, enjoyed working there."
good,"Worked for this company a few years back, it was my first job out of college so I was happy with the hourly pay, however I did not find the work fulfilling. Nice benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I have worked for this company for 5 years and until recently really enjoyed my job. The management that I am currently under is not very effective with the management and delegation of responsibilities to team members. The overall accountability to other business partners is low and needs improvement.
good,"I worked here for 1 year period, I was moved/transferred at least 4 department in the first 6 months. Most department I was transferred to either close or change to different duties. As day past by, less people start quiting untill only 4 was choosing to Appeals and Grievance Departing which I was one of those employee. Managment in departing start shifting employees around with schedule."
good,"If you find the department you fit you in well then it can be a good place to work but the healthcare benefits are terrible, very expensive with high deductibles. I learned a lot about numerous departments in healthcare from medical billing to pharmacy. Management in the department I worked in was very biased towards ""favorites"" and did not treat all employees equally. My coworkers were great, and most offered up help whenever needed to ensure smooth process flow."
good,"This company is only focused on numbers.  Patients should come first but they only care about how fast every thing is done and ignore patient safety along the way. Staff is constantly short.  Management only has a few select employees that they actually care about.  Management has favorites. The favorites are the only opinions that matter to the management team.  Speaking of management teams, don't expect any kind of advance with this company unless you are on the favorites list.   Management has blocked senior employees from advancement or posting out to different locations, because they rather put their friends into these positions. People are placed into management positions even if they do not have the credentials to back the job.  But don't worry, if a manger can not perform their duties correctly, then they get an assistant manager to help plus a raise! Which is usually another friend that is equally not qualified!  Employee abuse is at an all time high. Abusive managers get away with employee abuse. There is a ""take it of leave it"" attitude instead of fixing the problems.  If you can keep to yourself and avoid the extra drama, you might survive. Great employees have left due to poor management and lack of a voice in the company."
good,Has great potential but is not ran by the right people In the student resource segment. Management does not seem to grasp the importance of family.
good,"the company itself is big but  its not work life balance. were ask to work more than 50 hrs in a week which is against the labor law , hidden charges on salary."
good,I have found it truly matters what department you are working for to be allowed to advance in the company.
good,"This company will tell you whatever you want to hear. Be prepared to be just another warm body in a seat! The pay is OK, but its not enough for everything they want you to be skilled for on almost a weekly basis. They switch policies everyday.. not consistency."
good,At Optum Consulting you are asked to perform duties that are not a match for your skill set and there is no training provided unless you are a college grad just entering the workforce.
good,"Good company to work for, very stress free and relaxing. Great benefits and culture. Managers are very attentive and answer questions promptly"
good,"Don't talk just work call center environment, need to meet your quotas even when there's no work during the holidays it still counts against you for not meeting your quota.  Complicit management, in order to obtain promotion, shady-shady-shady supervisors/managers.  But you knew that already. "
good,"This was an ok place to work, but they do not value a long term employee as they should, nor is the pay worth the work put in.  Not a lot of room for advancement."
good,Company was not organized and the core values they claim they stand by is not at all what the actually stand by. The money was good and the co workers where great. But when it came to management they where all about you kiss there butts and not really about your work performance and how much you actually do to keep the company up and running for them.
good,Large company and if they feel you have been there to long. They will make the rules and not play by their rules. worked 29.5 years for the company and let go  in a blink of a eye.That's all I going to say
good,"Workload greatly exceeded work day and weekends in this small department contributed to poor morale.  Overall emphasis on cost savings, not the member or provider."
good,Really great place to have worked to have become a licensed Agent and in Healthcare. I really enjoyed working here and enjoyed my job of working with and helping the clients.
good,"Daily Tasks: "
good,"Awesome start off pay, But the management could do better and very hard to advance in the company. The annoyance of not getting questions answered at the time you need them to be or might not even get one back at all can be frustrating . But its still a great company to work for, they promote awesome everyday values for in home and at work."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The company arrived in Carrollton TX with one client & quickly grew to 3 clients before shutting down shortly after. The work environment was very noisy because everyone sat right next to each with no dividers for sound control.
good,"Realistic opportunity for any advancement is slim to none. There is a lot of lateral moves but advancement or additional compensation should not be expected... I consistently received exceeds expectations and must increase I was ever given was $1500 annual raise which was an incenitive for perfect attendanc and perfect performancefor a full 12 month period, other than that.$0.00 -$0.20 an hour is what you can expect."
good,"Training was 16 weeks long.  They made sure you learned everything you needed before placing you on the phones.  Co-workers were sometimes a challenge.  That goes with the territory in any call center.  Enjoyed talking to the consumers.  Felt like the company had gotten too big and it was easy to get transferred to the wrong department.  I had a call for critical care insurance one day and after two hours no one there (even management ) knew how to contact that department.  Critical Care is like AFLAC, it pays a lump sum if you have a catastrophic illness.  What I did not like the most is that people whom wanted to have direct debit of their bank account stopped got pushed into a tornado of different departments and no one attempted to stop the direct debits, their only option was to pay $36.00 to have it stopped at their bank.This is very sad that people with little education or senior citizens would have to go through this."
good,they worked with you on things somewhat but told you one thing and then changed their minds such as working from home. it was ok but there was no management in the office so people just did whatever they wanted and it was far from a professional office environment
good,Senior leadership is weak and the one's who do all the work are not paid a competitive market wage.
good,"It was a fun atmosphere, but not much room for growth."
good,It's a job. I go to work everyday. It's a company for recovering information that is needed to submit bills for providers.
good,"each day is a new learning experience"
good,United healthcare is a fast paste inbound and outbound call center.A typical work day consist of 90 to 100 calls on a busy day and 40-50 calls on a light day.The management could of done a better job in communicating with the employees. The co workers worked as a team to get the job done. The hardest part was not having enough people to assist us in the call center. The turnover rate was very high. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co workers.
good,"Ambiente no local era agradável, aprendi a trabalhar com diversas classes sociais, como é o atendimento na área da saúde."
good,"Projects are fast paced with an emphasis on quality, flexibility and on-time delivery."
good,I was young when I started for walmart. The company offers good things like discounts.
good,"Typical work day seem like it changes everyday."
good,A typical work day was a lot of phone calls and patience when hard to hear providers were on the phone. Co-Workers were nice but management was not always on the same page. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the co-workers and learning new things in training.
good,"I have performed utilization review for UHC members that are currently in acute care hospital.   Telephonic position and work at home which has its perks.  I have learned a significant amount about commercial health care plans.  I have been disappointed with ability to grow within the organization, little room for advancement for me."
good,Ive had the opportunity to work for this company.although they say they are customer service based. It is pretty much a numbers game and how brown your nose can be to get promoted.
good,"My duties include providing customer service to a variety of individuals consisting of policy holders, agents, other insurance companies, and providers, while working in a call center.  My main job duty is ensuring all of our company’s documentation is as clear, accurate, and as up to date as possible.  I am also responsible for any insurance or legal research our company has.  My duties included answering intra-state and inter-state claim inquiries, working a variety of department reports, and having claims adjusted and processed accordingly.  I worked with several different medical providers and several insurance companies in different states to get claims processed and issues resolved.  Not only have I exceeded my current job duties, I have also been a team player by helping others in my department excel.  I have had several coaching, development, leadership, and training opportunities for other employees to help them succeed in this department.  I am also responsible for analyzing all of our documentation and documenting my findings accurately and efficiently.  My technical writing skills have helped me condense documentation, make it easier to use, and help departments communicate with each other efficiently and accurately.      "
good,The team i work with consist of friendly and outgoing people and are available to assist at anyime.
good,"I would not recommend United Healthcare. They pay very low, dont give decent raises and cancel bonuses. They are very cheap. Management practices favoritism and are basically dishonest to their staff. Hours are good, no weekends but can be very cheap in letting staff off early on important holidays like Christmas eve, New Years eve. Pay is exceptionally low but the stress is very low."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"No comment on the company itself. Experiences vary by department, supervisor and co-workers."
good,Nice company to work for first online experience
good,"The people there are great, the management is very nice and supporting, now to the bad part, the people who call you will annoy you to the point of wanting to quit, the pay is good but the insurance is way to high, over $160 a month, on a day you take 40-60 calls from doctor, old people, nurses, pharmacies and members. They make you work over time which is not a bad thing but can be hard if you have other obligations"
good,"A empresa em si ela é boa pra trabalhar,mas tem coisas q teria de mudar,regras são pra ser implantadas a todos sem prioridade,na escala de plantão não tem que cada gestor falar uma lingua todos tem que dizer sim e não igual,em relação ao aux adm ele fica no meio pq trabalha nos dois plantões,e caso paciente ele não quer saber se é outro plantão ele simplesmente que o que foi feito na outra vez que ele veio,então por isso eles tem que dizer as mesmas coisas,ai sim tudo pode melhorar."
good,"Talking to healthcare professionals regarding eligibility, claim status, and payment information."
good,"Due to my employment, I decline to write a review. I feel my thoughts my effect my return to employment at Unitedhealthcare"
good,Didn't seem to be well managed. Days were very long. Didn't believe in telecomuting
good,"I was a subject matter expert, I handled irate callers, claims adjustments, processing. I did research for ongoing member or provider issues that needed follow up. I learned most of what I know now about the healthcare industry. The management did not support its employees, it seemed as if they wanted us to finish a call within that call limitation rather than complete the issue at hand, I would rather resolve the issue to avoid further call backs and help the member to finally be satisfied and their issue resolved. The hardest part of my job was not being able to completely help my members or providers with their issues, if we were on a call for longer than the call limit we would get an instant message from our supervisor or for them to approach our desk and ask why we were on the call so long. The most enjoyable was when I actually got to reslove issues for my members and providers."
good,My first experience with Healthcare industry and learned the aspects about behavioral health.
good,"Let it slip I have a partner....and the attitude changed faster than a sneeze. Orientation was to throw you home with a massive amount of technology, and expect you to figure it out from there. Massive all day web seminars......followed by management away (mentally) for state audits....not a good time to orient new people! Also were setting it up where limits (none) on OT....and expecting one to be out in people's homes and nursing homes....then home for the ""work til 9 or 10 pm"". I had a clue when one person bragged ""I can work 16 hours straight without eating or a bathroom break !"". I refused to work under that kind of situation. I was also told my plain loop earring was ""offensive"" to some of my co-workers. How sad that such prejudicial ignorance exists.....but it definitaly does here. Office situation was territorial and presided over by a ""DO NOT CROSS ME"" attitude administrative front desk associate who also throws out snippy, fishing comments."
good,Endless 65 - 80 hour weeks that made work / life balance impossible
good,I loved the people I worked with and the job I had to perform. I was there three years and I planned on being there longer. We had fun activity days as well as free lunch on certain days of the month.
good,"I was hired by United with the promise of advancement within 6 months. This didn't happen. I was doing a job above my pay grade but not getting paid for it. The got around it by calling it a ""temporary position"" and stated that they did not have to compensate at the higher pay grade."
good,"This was a good place to work before united healthcare bought over Americhoice. The main focus for uhc is money, not about their members nor their employees."
good,"The department was constantly changing the process for everything an no one seemed to be on the same page.  It was a very difficult environment to learn the job role in.  It was also very challenging to figure out how performance was being evaluated, which made interactions with management very stressful."
good,Great opportunity for someone new to the Healthcare field.  There are numerous opportunities in many different areas and fields. Be sure you do your home work regarding the different positions
good,"Limited advancement opportunities"
good,low wages.  No chance for increases in salary.  Laid off since 401k was becoming due for being fully vested.  No opportunity for any additional education.  Tools are very limited.  Have good SDLC process
good,The position requires a lot of work it’s not just answering phones.  There is no avg handle time but you are a one stop shop.  You handle everything and you have to file grievances even if you fix the problem.  There is no flexibility with any situation when it comes to scheduling
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Not many opportunities for advancement. Pay compensation declining quickly throughout the years it seems like. Many people relocating jobs after this Annual election period.
good,"Falta Feedback, rolam muitos conluios internos, quem está dentro não tem certeza da sua permanência"
good,A empresa não é ruim. O problema são algumas pessoas que estão no poder e fazem vista grossa ou não estão nem aí. O lado bom é a experiência profissional e o plano de saúde.
good,There were Food Trucks that would be there regularly.  Processed documents and sent them out to be verified. Nothing else too exciting about my position.
good,Good organization to work for if you end up in the right group team.  Culture is good as well as benefits.  Not being able to work at Corporate may be a challenge for advancement.
good,"Huge company with misguided leadership at times - at least in my BU."
good,"This company was aware of potential downsizing, yet they told employees that we were all safe. When they did downsize, they gave no notice. I am very disappointed in how UHG has handled their employees"
good,Overall UHG is a great place to work. But they have had to many leadship changes in the few years. And doesn't communicate changes with its employees.
good,"Hugely rewarding work, difficult work-life balance.The office I worked for was multinational and had rotating overnight shifts. This simply was not compatible with my life."
good,"United Health Group provides good benefits, even though health care benefits are lacking and very expensive. Compensation is above competitors but work life balance generally challenging. As a health care organization there is constant change, but with that change comes many opportunities for growth and advancement If you perform and network. Overall I recommend this organization for an extremely outgoing individual whom is up for a gamble and whom is committed to career development. For those whom are family focused and concerned about work life balance, this organization may not be for you."
good,I appreciated the organization is very big on giving back to the local communities all year long.  Also they concerned with how they may offer benefits to local residents even if they are not a UnitedHealthcare member.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I'm making a difference in members lives. A typical day is signing on to system and reading emails then beginning work load. The culture is very relaxed laid back. Management is accommodating of the work life balance.
good,"Everything at uhc is monitored to the second, there is constant micro managing that is often contradictory to what goals have been placed infront of you. Do not apply if you have kids!!! Any scheduled time off must be placed 3-6 months in advance and you have no sick time. Constant punishment for things out of your control and nepotism is rampant. DO NOT APPLY FOR ANTHING CUSTOMER SERVICE RELATED IF YOU WANT A CAREER THERE!!!!!"
good,There is a lot of pressure to learn things on your own and if you make a mistake before of lack of training; manager and Director lectured and belittled you.
good,Work can be interesting.  I've learned a lot.   I think there are areas where Optum is a great place to work.  There are also pockets that aren't so great.
good,Very large company environment and impersonal interaction with management. Limited growth opportunity depending on what part of the corporation that you enter.
good,Have to get the systems down. Information will always change are up date. So be ok with a face pace and forever changing schedules. Always meet your metrics
good,"Performed general and high risk case management activities across the continuum of care to drive and support proactive quality, cost efficient outcomes and minimize fragmentation of health care delivery. Worked with consumers, care givers, and providers focusing on preventing avoidable admissions/readmissions to hospital, emergency departments, other facilities and high cost services"
good,"Unkept Promises "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,United Healthcare does not promote from within. Management is clicked up. The leadership sticks together and they allow the nursing staff to sit at home all day and access the patients over the phone. You cant advise o n.v medications over the phone
good,"When I started working at UHC you had to bid for your shifts, after 2 years of bidding for my shift (i had first for a year) they switched to rotating shifts, meaning you opened one week the next week you had mid shift and the week after you close and so on... the health care benefits are HORRIBLE!! ALL high deductible plans and on top of all of this they maybe moving 20 miles away from there current location"
good,bonuses are earned by meeting metrics which are insanely competitive. If you are familiar with and okay with working in a call center setting then this job with be great! Benefits are decent.
good,"United Healthgroup was an okay company to work for.  They had some ideas that they really needed to work out especially before they brought them to the table with regards to the employees.  The job was super-easy; however, there were days where you would have angry customers on the phones and want to speak with the supervisor and blame the rep whether it was their fault or not."
good,With the acquisitions that took place the company took a slight turn and left us vulnerable?  Now we’re just not sure if there any room growth or longevity
good,"Ok to work for,  Enjoyed the culture and experience. Supervisor was not very helpful.  Duties included - Responsible for answering incoming calls and completing outbound calls to/from patients, physicians and pharmacists while ensuring a high level of customer service and maximized productivity."
good,"Loved the sense of purpose most coworkers/managers had, and loved the work itself, but work/life balance was nearly nonexistent. Pro:working from home"
good,"Good place to work for benefits. Bad upper management decisions. Not a company for advancement despite your education and hard work. You need to know right people at the right position. No one recognizes your hardwork, you get fired for an unreasonable complaint. I loved my team and direct manager."
good,Very stagnant process for growth. If you are okay with just taking calls or not eager to progress vertically then this might be for you. It is better to come in at middle management level.
good,I’m a current employee and the experience that I have had hasn’t been great. I was lied on by my trainer when I first started working for the company in 2016. Nothing happened to the trainer and because of that I feel like I’m being targeted and can’t get a promotion. My teammates majority of them who I started with has been promoted bad attendance 10-14 occurrences that you shouldn’t even have you should be fired but that’s the favoritism. I have had 2 interviews with 2 different departments that were very good! The first one I was told I got the job but never heard nothing not even an email my sup had to tell me I didn’t get it even with me having good attendance and metric was meeting I was told my attendance is the reason I had a 3 when I know for a fact my coworker had 10 and got the job that’s so unfair. Then the 2nd position that I applied for back in Jan did the whole interview process and haven’t heard both not even a email. I call HR talent department to see what’s going on the only thing I’m told is that the position is on hold! So my career gets put on hold that’s ridiculous. So at this point I’m looking for another position with a better company who has better communication with their employees and actually really care!! Singed an upset current employee!!!! Plus the bonuses they say you will get well I was suppose to get mine in the beginning on 2018 and you know what I didn’t get it but everybody else did and when I said something it was oh let me look into it and never heard anything about it again!!! Poor management all they care about is the compassion you need
good,"A typical work day for me consisted of solving issues that should have ad could have been resolved on the frontline. I enjoyed helping the members, but did not like the stress of having to do my own job and take on the job of several others as well."
good,"if your supervisor likes you and you perform well you will not notice much. if you make any mistakes they will kick you out the door so they can replace you. don't show up late, but don't come in early either. Take over 100 calls a day every day. some months you will be pushing 200+ members daily. but don't worry ""this isn't sales"". but if you don't get the numbers they're are looking for they will do their best to get you out of there. if you ask the same question to any of the supervisors, you will get a different answer each time."
good,"a typical day i answer the phones and i help out providers from medical staffing with needs like benefits, claims and authorizations. "
good,This is a company that had good and bad just as other companys .Was unfortunate that my time there was only 6months . was a temp  employee that wanted to grow in this company and be the best for the company .
good,"As a new employee there, I didn't feel like management cared about me as an employee and wanted to make sure I felt good about working for the company.  I didn't feel that I couldn't advance within the company.  I felt picked on about only my mistakes and not appreciated enough about my accomplishments."
good,Management is very complacent and lazy.  Too much pressure put on lower-level employees while managers are always on vacation.  Quality of management also very poor to the point of embarrassment.
good,"I enjoyed working at the company for 7 years, however there were always cut after cut.  We were always told that people should be rewarded for excellence, however they would find ways to not compensate.  Whether through job cuts or on the fly rule changes making it impossible to advance your career."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Very stressful environment Fast pased, Customer service experience needed.  Ability to maintain spreadsheets, create informational booklets, for new customers."
good,"No início era uma empresa boa, no entanto começaram a contratar pessoas absurdamente e não tinha local de trabalho para todos. A gerência perdeu o controle, ou nunca teve."
good,"I was very disappointed with the work culture and the general atmosphere of the company. You can feel the animosity amongst peers."
good,Company offers excellent medical benefits to their consumers without reconizing the value in their own employees.  Unmotivational work environment.  Failure to dislose daily work expectations at time of hire for negotation purposes.
good,"Unprofessional management. I worked here for 8 years. I've personally witnessed at least 80+ workers come and go. Whether fired or quit. Unrealistic goals, for profit agendas. No care for patients or clients. Tell them whatever you must to get their signature. After that, they're on their own. Only the stockholders matter. If you have an expensive illness, you will be denied treatment and if you see not a member and try to enroll, you will be turned away. The company motto is, ""we don't sign up sick people"". You're individual healthcare deductible will be $3,000.00. Families are $6,000.00. You basically have no health company health insurance, although you will pay for it bi-weekly. A health insurance company should offer free or low cost insurance to its employees. If you are looking for a job that bis just a paycheck with no advancement and no healthcare, this is for you."
good,"The company is stable and its a good place to work if you want to work as a production robot. If you are good at your job you will NOT be promoted or endorsed.  They will give you great annual reviews but the reviews are not enough to move you though out the company 'but keep applying."""
good,"Expected to do the job of 3 people. Micromanaged by Directors. Manager was phenomenal and team worked hard for the manager.Team constantly hounded by directors. Large team in high productivity area did excellent job of getting work done. Micromanaging out of control. Touted to have flexibility for work life balance....only worked n favor of the company. Salary paid for 40...employees worked 60, worked on PTO , took PTO just to catch up. Not competitive pay for the position."
good,"Weren’t allowed to use restrooms without time being monitored, continuously changing procedures of work without informing employees. Being graded daily on how you compare based to others, if you didn’t work nonstop for the full 8 hours you had a hard time reaching the quota. Also everyday required a quota to be met and was judged poorly if you didn’t reach it."
good,"this might be the worst company I have ever worked for in terms of work life balance. If you have children specifically younger children this is not the job for you the rotating shifts, strict attendance policy, and just overall disregard for the well being of their employees is beyond me. The management depends on who you are assigned to some managers are a god send while others (mine) were unprofessional, very unreliable, and extremely combative."
good,Need to continue improvements on helping internal employees find and secure new job opportunities to show case the experience and learning from withiin the company. UHC does not help their employees enough with finding internal positions and they lose many good employees to external companies.
good,"Apesar da empresa ter uma estrutura impressionante, a gestão de pessoas/funcionarios realizada pelos gestores não é o ponto forte da empresa. Necessário melhorar."
good,I didn't care for the management and they didn't really help when needed. The work was ok but very boring. I had to drink a lot of coffee to keep my energy up
good,"Good coworkers but ignorant management. never noticed the qualified people on the teams,  only recognized favorites. Good company to work for but too much politics for the sane,"
good,"UHG as a parent company is great, but my department is all about who you know not what you know and its like you are in high school.- petty gossip, very clique."
good,"Processing Medicare Claims is not for everyone. It can be very stressful. You do receive intense classroom like training for the first month or so. Some people make the cut, others don't. It is a very fast paced environment. They provide decent benefits. Claim Processors pretty much work independently. The hardest part of the job is hitting your accuracy requirement and having a high processing rate. The dress is very casual."
good,"Depending on your role, it can be super stressful and not rewarding.  I felt like I was just a number working there!  It is very fast paced call center environment and you are expected to retain a TON of information in a short amount of time."
good,"good training,good co-workers, site director was crazy, able to travel, lack of promotion at the location, bonus were good, salary increase are good, overall good place to work"
good,"Some departments are better than others. But some have way too much middle management, with not enough real work of their own to keep them busy. So what do some of these middle managers do with that extra time? Well some of them become that extra cook in the kitchen of course. As if everyone they manage can’t cook at all. Even though some of the folks they manage can run circles around them in the kitchen (or whatever the dept function happens to be). Others like to use that spare time playing corporate politics. An age-old art that is so lost on people like me. And others like to attach themselves to good projects and workers like a leech and feed off of others accomplishments as their own. For a select bunch – Those are the trifecta’s of middle management. They engage in all 3. If you find yourself in that department, or even 1 degree from it – get out. Especially if you are one of those types that likes to be productive and beneficial with whatever you do and wherever you are. Don’t do what I did and hope a miracle of restructuring occurs or upper management decides to step up and do some real work removing these cancers."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Metrics were impossible to accomplish, management was not in tune with employees need, excellent co-workers, learned tremendous amount about Medicare benefits/Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D plans"
good,This job is very stressful and a very high call volume. During training your not approached with some of the obstacles that you will face on the floor. Your performance is based off what the customers feel which hurts your score if they didn’t like the automated system. Your handle time is affect when helping a customer if your Call is over 7 mins. Just a perfect way to keep an employee from exceeding the expectations of the company and customer
good,"The job itself is amazing. The satisfaction of helping other people is amazing. The only issue would be the people in charge. Job was via Phone in a call center and the managers at the call center would always be hurrying the customer service representatives, telling them that they had to hang up the call. While, we had the customer on the phone just looking for someone who would be willing to listen. Trying to be compassionate to the elderly and sick members while having them constantly telling you that you couldn't take more than 10 mins on the phone with member was very stressful. Member would be crying on the line and you had to interrupt due to the fact that you would have floor support telling you that you had to hang up"
good,A great place to work for flexible individuals that can thrive on a fast paced high change environment. A very large installation of technology provides plenty of opportunity for exposure to a multitude of IT technologies and solutions.
good,"Maybe things have changed since I've been there. But when I worked there, they was evil and not management material. Nevertheless, that was 4 years ago."
good,"Would recommend if you do well in stressful environments. Not big on moral, yet coworkers are friendly. Attendance is vital here so prioritize your outside life accordingly."
good,The class I came in with was great. Management had favorites and the pay was low. You were able to do overtime in the peak months. fasted paced sometimes gossip
good,"A lot of micro management. There are little clicks in the department and the managers only care about themselves and do not have the employees interest at heart. "
good,Optum offers a very lovely and peaceful environment to work. On the flip side the is no room for growth and the pay is not ideal for the amount of work required nor is it competitive to the cost of living.
good,I am not writing a review for this company. I don't want to send a review for this company. I do not want to participate in this part of the questioning and don't feel comfortable with this.
good,For the amount of work required from the company the pay was not good enough. The only good thing about the position was my manager. He was an amazing manager.
good,"The job was fast paced on phone referral line.  It is a large professional company fair to its employees.  The position was contract so didn't last, I would recommend them"
good,"Indeed refuses to put down the company name correctly but I worked for a sales branch of United. Management was horrid and didn't care about what they said around employees. I heard so much criticism of other people from them like gossip and there was nothing I could do. While the rest of the employees were nice, it was clear that this wasn't a good job in terms of stress and the needs we couldn't meet."
good,No advancement opportunities but the work environment is really good and the employees are very hard workers. The mission and vision of the organization is very good and the benefits are great.
good,A typical day at work is answering inbound calls from upset older people about their insurance. Their are about 10 calls a day and there is no ACH time (which is good) because all calls are long and can carry over. 
good,"My job at Optum was difficult and very stressful. It was very competitive and requiring. The people were fun, but we were very limited on expressing our passions. Overall I did not like my time there."
good,"Very fast paced, always changing.  The goal posts always seemed to move and there is a lot of change and reorganization that seems to be going on that prevents you from ever feeling secure.  It is very difficult coming in to this organization and getting acclimated without a very proactive manager and good support around you - there are so many systems and such a vast organization that it is very easy to get lost.  Loads of really good people, and most really seem to care about the work that they are doing and making a difference and making things better.  Great corporate attitude on volunteering and giving back (though unpaid time to do so); and overall benefits and compensation are for the market very competitive."
good,This place of employment was very stressful and job security was not there at all. you have to meet the requirements of the job in a certain amount of time and training is very fast and they throw you out of training to do everything they didn't teach in training and management doesn't do anything to help. In one on one they do let you know if you don't meet the requirements you wont have a job
good,"Computer systems need updated "
good,"You would think for a health care company the employees would get awesome benefits. No, we get the bare minimum. It is a very stressful environment and fast paced."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"people are great but management is a little demanding, push for high volume production, quantity over quality.  the company is separated by teams, some teams have managers that are in  different state.  can be difficult to get help"
good,"This office is NOT the place to work if you want advancement opportunities.  As is the case with many places, it's WHO you know, not WHAT you know.  You have to be in the clique to get attention for what you do, and if you believe in work instead of the clique, you will be stuck in your position for a year while you try to stick it out so you can then look to move to another office.  Plus, everyone here seems so downtrodden.  No one smiles back or replies with ""Good Morning when I smile and say it to them.  It's really sad.  And, the trainer is a great person, but the training itself leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"The work environment was decent, I got along well with my coworkers. We had a lot of fun but after training everything changed. we were expected to work fingers on keyboard eyes on the screen."
good,"I worked here for 2 years and I will say it was an experience. I encountered some of the most ghetto people in life and the management was no different. They would come in and based on how their home life was going would often take it out on the employees, if things were bad they treated us bad if they were good we were treated good. We were often told our job was on the line if we reacted to how they treated us and this caused us to not want to be there."
good,"The most difficult part of this job is dealing with management. Gossip and hearsay is common daily. When management is comfortable with the role you are in, it is very difficult to grow and move different parts of the company. Great job to start out with, however do not plan on journey with opportunities."
good,"My typical day at work would be doing the regular 8 hours job with minimal criticisms coming from any staff, done the latest reports, coordination with teams and departments. Having a company benefits when you needed on time, and having lots of company activities aside from the normal 8 hours shift."
good,"Fast paced w/great people. Reorgs very common w/minimal direction. Competing priorities, minimal investment, no focus on internal employee development."
good,"I worked at UHC for three years. Initially, the job was tolerable but I quickly noticed departments were not communicating. Once that was corrected, the managers begin to add more and more onto the Providers, as they were being pressured themselves! We became a medical clinic on wheels, while finishing your notes at home, without overtime! If you complain, you become a target by the managers! I sure did! I resigned! On another note; I can say however, I enjoyed meeting different people from different walks of life. Some would share their life experiences with you, others did not want to be bothered at all and would cancel. I also enjoyed looking at the scenery as I traveled to members homes (the seasons) etc. There were neighborhoods/members homes that felt unsafe that I refrained from entering on a few occasions. You would not be reprimanded for that! In essence; I resigned for being railroaded/harassed by the most recent manager due to me stating that I could not see 7 residents in an 8 hr day, near the Christmas Holiday. The limit was 6 and I had children to pick up as to why I worked part-time. That did not sit well.....Be careful!!! Nit picking can be huge if you are a vocal provider as myself."
good,"A typical day is taking phone calls and working with users."
good,This company only cares about their money.  They do not provide decent raises nor bonuses.  Their is no room for advancement in many of the teams.  It's a sad company.
good,"Lot of opportunities to learn"
good,Working at United Health Group has its advantages and disadvantages management is very poor and the company needs to. Improve in that area The company just need to think more of employees than job performance
good,"When I was hired at United Health Group, I was excited to hear that I have a job. It was not a bad company to work at, It was just  a program that opened up and they were not able to keep it open. I loved working with the people there, it just did not last due to not enough funds to stay open."
good,okay to work for and great benefits can be a flexible work environment as long as you know the right people and willing to put them first over everything else in your life.
good,"The company overall has a wonderful culture...but new local senior management refuses to adhere to it or maybe they don't know how to embrace it.  Upper level, regional management does not go down to lower lines of business - i.e. other states, often enough to really see what is going on and HR assistance seems ineffective and/or non-existent.  The benefit package is outstanding though and other lines of business seem very well accounted for and development programs are in place for advancement."
good,"In the 2 years working at UHG, I have been moved to 7 different managers (directors), which most recently impacted my merit review significantly.  The first half of 2017, where I had delivered a large, multi-million dollar project was ignored, and I received zero merit increase and zero bonus because of not meeting some criteria in the 6 months of my new assignment. Those people I have spoken with who did receive a merit increase also we're not happy with a very small increase."
good,I have no comment on this job. There is no review I have nothing to submit either way.  This job was not a good fit for me. Micromanaging is not for all people...
good,"There was little or no communication between management and workers or even between the supervisors themselves. Schedule changed daily. Scheduled 9-530, but would change to 8-530 before the next day. No consistant scheduling or supervision. A lot of favortism."
good,I learned a lot while working at Optum. Worked with very intelligent individuals with great computer and research skills. The direct supervision was good. The workplace culture was good. Telecommuting was a perk and made the stress of the job less. The job demands were stressful (caseloads never fully completed daily due to time and response constraints). Too much focus on performance review and producing numbers. NOT ENOUGH PAY COMMENSURATE WITH SKILL SET REQUIRED FOR THE JOB.
good,"I enjoy the work when we are doing an audit but the down time is pretty brutal. Lack of communication by management."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"a good company to work for depending on what branch . the work culture could be better , management was poor , most enjoyable part was the ability to work form home"
good,"The training was pretty awful. They really expect you to do too much for the pay, and this is a DIFFICULT job to do. The stress was unbelievable. I quit because it just wasn't worth the amount I was paid. LOTS of favoritism here. Also you will be surprised at how terrible the insurance plan is here: you will never meet the sky high deductible and will pay out of pocket for most expenses. They do offer a HSA."
good,Consultant role - short term.  Very chaotic and unorganized.  Employees - revolving door.  No stability.  Minimal training and not professionally led.
good,"United is an innovative company, but sometimes being innovative and large can be counterproductive. The system changes can be laborious and bothersome.  As Network Contract Manager, I was assigned a territory that included 27 hospitals, physician groups associated with the hospitals and Ancillary providers. The territory include 3 Health Systems that was comprised of multiple facilities and ambulatory surgery centers. This required more than your standard 40HR work weeks. There are times that you can work 7 days straight. On top of your standard workload, you will need to complete project reports. I've learned a lot there but the Job Work/Life balance is terrible."
good,"it is an ok job. you do what your asked, promised advancement and then nothing. Management isn't the best whatsoever, favoritism there as well. The highlight of the job are those few people i connect with t the office."
good,"UHC Global is a continuous ""reorganization"" and 5 or managers a years are ""reorganized"" out of the company and left without a job and misled about severance at the time in which you are being let go.  Managers are promised 2 months verbally but the severance agreement only entitles you to 2 pay periods."
good,"My direct manager was great to work for and assist in every way possible. The upper management lacked concern for staff and the job they did on a daily basis. The did not listen to concerns, have faith in their employees or the commitment employees have in the job they did."
good,I worked from home so it's difficult to speak to the climate in the workplace.  I was compensated well but ultimately laid off so that UHG could find someone who they could pay less money to.
good,The company could be more inclusive of the employees. Wages are low compared to what is asked of you to do.  As with all large companies some areas are better than others.
good,No room for advancement and very littler help with finding other positions.  No support from management and was let go the day after I had my 1st child.
good,"When I started this job with United, I was very excited and it felt like an honor. Unfortunately, once I learned that other managed care companies offered better pay, benefits, and perks, I wondered why people remained with this company. For the most part, the managers are amazing, but with little to no advancement and upper management making poor decisions that affected every day work for all of us worker bees, it did not seem like a place that I wanted to be at. Even after reaching out to multiple managers, directors, etc., letting them know that I'm looking to stay and make this company my forever career and wanting to step up into higher positions, I was still overlooked. Even with 10 years experience in this field, a spotless work record, and proven ability to go above and beyond with my daily work, still getting passed up by others who spend more time socializing with upper management."
good,Large stable company. Very diverse with Microsoft technology used for its core applications. Benefits below average - they could and should be better.
good,"Watched over in every aspect of performance. Not performing? placed on Action plan. Coaching training after initial was minimal."
good,The job of customer advocate itself is not bad but it is very stressful and negative for the most part. The atmosphere at my site that I worked at was toxic. My last supervisor was constantly picking fights with her team. When she tried that with me I knew it was time to go. My coworkers were all way younger than me and had no pride in there appearance or in the work that they did.
good,"Pay is great, management poor, high turn over rate in our division. Hard to find physicians who take our plan..HSA plans are a plus, little recognition for job well done.  Vision and dental plans are a plus!"
good,This job is easy and was enjoyable to come to once upon a time. That was until I got an unreasonable supervisor. UHC needs to hire supervisor that are fair and competant.
good,I found that I was only given access to half the programs needed to do the job and had to learn on my own how to get the rest of the information to do the job. Most of the office staff was very nice but the  Team lead talked down to the staff and lied to cover herself when asked by management. The company was bought out by Optum during my employment and management was not happy about giving up control of the office. Pay was good.
good,Management is very poor in managing resources. Resources are give no respect. They can call you any time for work. there is no life work balance. its a Tough life at work working with UHG
good,I have learned to be more self-suffient. How to multi-task and have more patience. The hours are ok if you do not have a family at home. I really enjoyed working meeting new people.
good,I love working with the members. I have been here a yr and still have not received a career path. Told my manager what my goals were. Didn't feel like they are focused on that enough. Fun part about working here is the members.
good,At UHG you work too hard but paid not fairly. There is too much workplace politics to get your work done. Your  job title plays a big role to get your job done. Promotion is based on relationship and not your performance.
good,I enjoyed working for United Healthcare when the company was fair. They have since came in and made so many changes and they don't really listen to their employees about issues and problems they have. They came in and took our overtime away and when they finally brought it back they were so strict about working weekends and I thought it was so unfair especially because I am a mother so I have to do my overtime on weekends
good,"Colleagues were very supportive, and there was much to learn, worked closely within the team which consisted of 8 people.  "
good,Limited interaction with leadership.  Lots of opportunity to interact with all levels of the organization.  Limited work / balance - lots of hours.  You drive your career.
good,Professional atmosphere with great people.  Ongoing training and support to excel at any given position.  Positive feedback and constructive review of opportunities. Overall a good experience.
good,"There was sufficient training for each skill set, but too many skill sets were added to too few people. This created a two track system where some were carrying much heavier loads and had fewer advantages. The company had great potential to be employee friendly, but did not act on it in any appreciable way."
good,"UHG/ Optum Appears to be an up and coming organization. They want to attract, of course the best and brightess (but"
good,"First, you would think working for a health insurance company you would receive great health insurance.  They offer horrible health insurance to their employees."
good,Great place to work for medical professionals. Great place to work for those in the medical research field.  Great place to work for Nurse Managers and RN.
good,Typical day begins logging on from home when I get up to communicate with the offshore teams. I've discovered that the extra effort of communicating in the early morning helps facilitate my many release responsibilities so that there is less of a delay. The management at UHG is changing again so with change comes new directions yet again and new ways of performing necessary tasks. I have to admit that there are useful new bits of information from each of the management teams that I've included in my daily routine. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom that some managers empower their teams with which often leads to creativity and productivity.
good,"A Amil possui um ambiente agradável para trabalhar. Valoriza o colaborador com ações motivacionais e de integração. Após a venda para o grupo UHG, os funcionários estão sofrendo com a mudança de cultura e redução dos custos, cortes de funcionários. A cultura implantada pelo Dr Edson Bueno o fundador se perdeu totalmente."
good,"good company but it all depends on the department that your are in. However, I would recommend the company to anyone looking for nice pay but their turn over rate is high and their job security is not secure."
good,"Work life balance was poor, was even told the company did not care if you had children or not. They had a strict point system that makes it impossible to stay hired if you have sick family.  The training is long and seems like it is not enough"
good,"I don't think that this company values its employees at all. The management here suck and are very unprofessional. They tell you one thing but mean another. I use to work here through a temp service and eventhough I really needed the job at the time, I would never recommend it to anybody or work here again!"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Answering calls about callers health care benefits and quoting them the cost of the services asked about. If you quote it wrong, you could cause irreparable harm to that person's health and finances.They don't train you fully either, four weeks in they throw you on the phones. "
good,"Too much kool-aid drinking."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"This place is only good to work at if you can get a sponsor quickly to support you. Otherwise, when there is a change in the upper level, you blowing in the wind."
good,Working at United Health Care you quickly learn that the company does not truly care about their employees. Management does not stick their word nor is really any help when it comes to helping us out. The job itself is fairly easy however training is not good and the resourses we have to work with our not helpful but confusing.
good,"Um empresa que vem se colocando no mercado como a maior empresa de saúde mundial."
good,At first I did enjoy the job. It is very fast paced because you receive calls back to back non stop..the moment someone hangs up the next call comes through. Everything is recorded sometimes the managers even watch your computer screen to see what you are doing. ( Worked from home)
good,took care of 20 to 70 people. I did productivity for each individual on a weekly basis. Corrected mistakes done by people to get the corrct meds ready and out to patients.
good,"Some managers because they have the freedom of discretion, abuse their power. Often times managers speak to employees rudely and condescending. It is hard to move up especially when managers do not like you for personal reasons. Managers don't greet employees  . Work life balance is hard to maintain at this company. The managers often play favoritism. While some employees are able to come in later and make up the time at the end of their shift other employees are given occurances for being 5 mins late. Where managers are able to come in late or leave early to handle personal matters without penalty. Unless you are a nurse or management you don't have any wiggle room, and many employees who work under Optum Health want to move to different areas in the business because of how uncomfortable they feel because managers treat them like they aren't an important part of the company. Managers have too much freedom and no one is paying attention to the way the employees are being treated, talked to or handled and many employees are too afraid to say anything or to call HR for fear of retaliation."
good,"Depending on which company you work for under UnitedHealth Group will determine the type of experience you will have. UnitedHealthcare and Optum are both companies that are under the UnitedHealth group umbrella; in reality they are all the same company functioning as their own entity at this point."
good,"account management of several statewide health systems. Liaison from numerous providers. Constant negotiating new and existing provide contracts. Problem solving, data analysis, and data management."
good,"my work seemed to be what ever I wanted it to be my bosses let me make the job my own. if it had paid more I would have stayed.i could do my job with very little supervision ,this gave  me a good feeling ."
good,the staff is pretty cool other than upper management. The work is simple and it is a pleasure to be able to assist people in need
good,Working as a licensed producer is a great challenge however as an experience professional I have found that you would have to overcome changes and embrace them.
good,large company with many layers. Salaries are low and workload is great but overall lots of PTO time for a career-life-balance.
good,"United acquired CIP in 2011. Due to this acquisition I was able to move up in the company. "
good,Lots of changes some areas are better managed than others. Jobs going overseas taking away from jobs in US. Not what you know its who you know........................................................
good,The recent changes within UnitedHealth Group have caused the department I previously worked in to become a toxic place to work.
good,The great part of the job is working with so many great people.  Being broker manager gives me a chance to lead by example and train my agents to do what I do. The UHC Broker Sales Managers are quite helpful in what they do for our teams.  They are always willing to lend a hand.  The downside is the compensation with UHC.  They have a constant stream of chargebacks and overpayments.  It not a good way to run a business.
good,"Customer Service, call center, complaints, cash management, telephones, billing, data entry, faxing....Assist instructor with daily activities, tutor students individually/groups, lesson plans, testing monitor"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Good employer but horrible management, make you seem like a robot at times,  average handle time is impossible to meet when they make you take english calls and spanish calls and expect you to meet the english call average handle time and make you act like a robot rather than a human."
good,great co-workers but the supervisers/managers need to be more responsible! they don't care about their employes whatsoever
good,"Trabalhava com total dedicação e cumprimento da minha função, respeitando as pessoas da mesma forma, independente de sua posição dentro da empresa."
good,"Empresa com bons funcionários, mas com pouca valorização do mesmo. Salários muito abaixo do mercado. Clima bom de trabalho entre os colegas. Não tem pressão e muita cobrança dos superiores."
good,"This is a great place to work if you just need a paycheck, are going to school. If you're looking for a career at UHC it's important that you network. A lot of how well you do with moving forward is dependent on who you know, like many other companies."
good,"A typical day at work is general customer service call regarding provider concerns"
good,There can be a lot of opportunity in a company this size.  A lot of training is provided to employees.  Great work life balance.
good,UHC is a for profit company and can be stingy with resources. It is a matrix organization and makes it difficult for managers to take full responsibility/control of projects.
good,"A typical day could be a little stressful due to alot of process changes on how to handle your work load. I learned to stay positive no matter what! Managment?? My co-workers...great,we always work as a team. The hardest part of my job to deal with a lot of negativity from higher up.The most enjoyable part is to provide great services to the members & providers."
good,Payment of medical claims and researched for necessary information/data needed to pay correctly.
good,"E trabalho estressante pois tem varias pessoas lhe dando ordens , sem organização pois ninguém sabe que e o responsável pelo setor e todos dão ordens, e discutem e ninguém sabe quem e o responsável pelo setor e quem deve obedecer primeiro. e cada hora você e destinado a fazer a função de outro funcionário e na final do dia e chamando atenção pois teve que correr com as atividades suas e de outras pessoas que lhe tiraram do seu setor e lhe colocaram em outro ."
good,Come into my office and code some charts 50-100 charts a day. I sometimes have meetings about twice a day. I visit an doctor's office once a month to see if they have any questions about documentation.
good,This was the highest stress job I have ever had. I am grateful they the pay was enough for my family and I but as soon as I was able to find something else I quit.
good,took calls for united healthcare spoke with providers but claims and benefits
good,"Typical day consists of processing requests for pharmacy prior authorizations, taking provider phone calls, and assisting in compliance auditing of Medicare cases. "
good,"Typical day at work would be sitting on the phone for the majority of the day taking inbound calls from members trying to get scheduled for a house call visit.  I would also receive with inbound calls from the Health Care Practitioners to assist with ordering their supplies to assisting with finding a members house.  The hardest part of the job was hearing the heart felt stories from our members about their hardships.  It was a good job, but very demanding with your time and patients."
good,"Since this location was close to work, a typical work day would involve biking to work to get some exercise and when i would arrive at the work location, i would place my items on my work station, socialize with co-workers and read work e-mails to ensure that i am current on the policies/procedures/possible changes of the company. "
good,"Work flow process constantly changing, The job teaches you how to adapt. Most enjoyable thing about the job are the other nurses who work along side of you."
good,"Micro managed daily though working at a 1:217 ratio."
good,Great company but some of the management team could use more training.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I was with this company for 3 years and in that time I had 3 different managers. Only one of those would qualify as a good, competent, effective manager."
good,"There was little room for advancement, however the hours were very flexible"
good,I had applied 5 times before getting an interview.  I was taking a step back getting back on the phone.  I really thought I could do being I had already been on the phones for so many years.  When you change your work mentality it makes it hard to go from working so hard to being a clock watcher.  Breaks lunches even the bathroom. The micro management was the worst. 
good,"My day consists of making phone calls to members and other insurance companies, reviewing claims for other insurance indicated, and entering information into various systems. The eligibility system is a DOS program that is ancient and not user friendly. There are high productivity goals that are extremely hard to attain. My co-workers are helpful and friendly, as well as my direct manager. I do not feel challenged by this job, it is very repetitive and uninteresting. I have never worked in a production based role and do not enjoy an atmosphere of feeling pressured to meet very high goals to make me eligible for raises, movement within the company, and to retain my position. I prefer a job that I am not so micro-managed. The company uses a VCC program for their phone system that tracks every second of the work day. It does not track properly, has a delay when logging in/out, and tends to crash the entire system frequently. My co-workers that have call center experience in their past claim to love this position as it is not as call oriented as a true ""call center"". I do not have call center experience and never intend to work in that setting, and this is not a job that I feel is fitting for me. I work well with humans managing me, not a telephone system. Also, my work ethic has always been based on quality more so than quantity. This position makes me feel as though I must obtain a speed that meets numbers more so than accuracy, which both of these factors must remain at a very high percentage to be retained in the position. During the hiring process, all employees were told there"
good,"* UHC talks about ""engagement"" but does not seem to follow the talk with the walk."
good,"This job started off amazing, great people to work with excellent surroundings. Made you wanna get up and love going to work. Now its under new management and its not the same, jobs are being taken away and no praises are being given to those that do amazing jobs."
good,This was a contract job that I was hired for to troubleshoot y2k issues. My contract was extended to assist in their daily needs
good,Muito bom
good,"United Health Care acquired Oxford Health Plans, therefore, had no real commitment to the staff they acquired from Oxford. Layoffs were put in effect based on business decisions and consequently many employees lost jobs and their income in a tight economy. Co-workers created their own survival and fun environment daily."
good,"Em termo de beneficio é bom,mais na parte de promocão a gerencia deixa a desejar"
good,Assisting clients with medicare part D drug plans. Enforcing and following medicare guidelines. (inbound customer service)
good,"The company I work for is very hands on. There is room for growth, however, not much. The scheduling is flexible when attending school, which is a very positive aspect."
good,Took 90 calls per day in a demanding call center. The co-workers were a pleasure to work with and always helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with sick people and there insurance claims that would be denied. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people live better lives.
good,UHC has limited advancement opportunities for those wanting to advance from an entry level position.
good,"Overall, I think the company is okay. I feel that they worry about things that are not important, over how there employees feel and there concerns. And I think to be a successful employer you have to have an open ear, especially to the people that's actually speaking with the members and providers. Other than than, that they do have good benefits and oppourtunities for you to advance."
good,Just do what you have to do and do not get in trouble  make sure you do the training and take it seriously because if not you will not know Anything when you hit.the floor
good,"UnitedHealth Care is a good place to learn and obtain experience, but needs a lot of improvement from the management side; the culture needs to be revamp to make it a great place to work."
good,"The people are great to work with, but the company has unrealistic deadlines.  It is difficult to hit a deadline when the requirements change 2 weeks before delivery despite using Agile.  There has to be proper time to vet changes and determine new approach and new deadlines.  Agile is meant to allow for changes, but it also allows for teams to provide the amount of work due to the change requests.  This step is often skipped and the additional work is often promised with the original timelines. The end result is missed deadlines which could have been avoided."
good,"When initially worked at UHG was layed off, however accepted another offer to work for them again and accepted. After seeing how much the company was unorganized and no growth took an opportunity with Anthem"
good,"A typical day included processing claims as quickly and accurately as possible. Everything a person does is tracked, how much time your mouse is moving or not moving. The co-workers were amazing and supportive. The hardest part of the job is the training process."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The hardest part of the job is making sure you communicate with confidence and ensure that you have given accurate information. Our management team is one of the best I have ever worked with because they care about their employees.
good,"I learned a lot...I enjoyed helping the people I talked to. Call-center environment. Your experience depends on the team you land on...."
good,I have been with Optum for more than a year. Its been good working here. The only drawback I found is there are different set of rules for Operations and Technology teams.
good,"The company location, pay and benefits do not sound bad (on site gym, healthy food, sit to stand desk, modern new computers, nurse on site, healthcare, clean facilities). but they recruit you selling you all the perks as a full time employee, just to find out once you start that you are just a temporary employee for 3 months, and if they actually decide to keep you at the end of the period, you will have to go thru a second tedious hiring process including background checking, drug test, paperwork, etc. they play with peoples time and expectations."
good,Set up for failure when the training class is cut short and not having proper access to programs needed to complete the task due to the constant changes
good,"Leadership that has been at United for 30 years and they dont like change."
good,The demands to meet expectations is high along with pressure to perform in situations in which one has little control (response of members).  Stressful work with very little autonomy.
good,This is a very fast paced environment that is based on multitasking and being upbeat and productive. If you can not multitask then this job is not for you. Like anything the job is what you make it to be. There are times I love it and times I absolutely hate it. But almost 3 years later I am still here. Most negative I have to say is the pay is horrendous.
good,"Working here is just okay depending on what department you get into. Some managers make it worth stating with the company, some don't. Layoffs are an often occurrence as UHG is constantly buying other companies and overflowing with employees making you wonder when you're next to go. Insurance benefits here are the worst I've seen, but you get 23 days PTO starting."
good,"Management is friendly, but is a very boring place to work. Daily work seems tedious and small. Work and life balance as well as flexibility varies from supervisor/manager to supervisor/manager; which can cause massive work/life changing when getting a new supervisor/manager."
good,"The benefits are good. Not have right infrastructure that includes parking, cafeteria and work stations. Not good work life balance. Works like a consulting organization"
good,"Great company to work for. Management addressed issues in timely manner. I had a great time learning from leadership.Overall, I enjoyed the time I spent there."
good,"I work for Optumrx pharmacy side of UHG. If you like micromanagement, This is the place for you.  Supervisors are unable to answer questions. Keep numbers good then you might be able to work from home."
good,Vida bom trabalho e comprometimento. Pontualidade é essencial.
good,"Overall working for the company was great, management and promoting from within not so much.  It seems if they like you in one department and don't want to lose you they will stop you from trying to move on and up to another department."
good,"Performance critera was not clearly mapped out. Managers were constantly changing which resulted in teams being in a constant state of underlying stress. Long term job security very poor. However UHG does provide an excellent benefits package including pto, 401K matching, STD and LTD."
good,"The culture at UHG is wonderful. Not only do they talk the talk, but they walk the walk.  The company arms their employees with a toolset that they can use in their work and also in their personal life."
good,"UHG offers above-average salary (if you negotiate shrewdly at first) and a great employee stock purchase plan.  Teams will vary and there are many great people there, but I often wondered how several VPs or Senior Directors were promoted to where they are.  Culture will vary from team to team, and my team culture was toxic: strange leadership styles, gossip-mills, and passive-aggressive tactics.  Only a few people remain on this team as all of the good, smart, and hard-working people left for other companies.  Overall, you can expect a typical corporate culture where it takes four times as long to accomplish a simple task because of the process, procedures, and bureaucracy."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,UHC is not a good work/home balance company.They required too much overtime and hardly any time off. The managers were not employee friendly and worried about numbers.
good,"The best part about UHG is that it allows telecommuting and there are tons of different jobs to find.  However, it is a very large company with many competing priorities and a large regulatory presence which makes it hard to do things efficiently.  The paid time off allowance is generous, but the other benefits are mediocre to laughable.  The work is pretty straightforward but at a very fast pace and most departments have many bosses.  There is a large variety of management styles both good and bad.  Overall, it's a great place to get a career start but moving up can get more and more exhausting."
good,"Overall work experience in the organisation is good and looking forward to grow in other mnc to build my own activities for exposure. "
good,"I remember a ton of gamification, lack of quality assurance, and sub-par benefits for being a health insurance organization.  I left this job after just one year.  It was a good stepping stone since I needed experience in the healthcare industry.  Ultimately, the organization offered me a position that was a minimal promotion and did not see my full potential so I turned to the market and found a much better job elsewhere."
good,"Oppressive metrics-Difficult break schedule-Monotonous training program-High health insurance deductible-Overall if you don't mind metrics that are designed to be unreachable that cause you to miss out on raises, then go for it."
good,Need to increase wages so employees will be able to provide for there family. More professional management and show care for employees like we do to our Customers
good,"Not an exciting place to work, culture wise its a drag. Leadership is only interested in quarterly numbers and the whole chain of command is only focused on how to land the next promotion, nothing else matters."
good,Communication is needed.  Senior supervisors are not connected to employees and are rude at times. Training is also an issue. Either not enough or not at all.
good,A lot of empty promises were made and continued to be paid.  Bonuses are next to impossible to get.  There are a lot of politics in promotions and a lot of micromanaging.
good,"long hours, good company to work for, long tenure of employees, good culture, good social environment. Free fruit, canteen, free parking, lots of sports and health and well being events"
good,The work environment is very demanding and overloaded with work. UHC work its employees for the very little you are paid. Salaries and benefits are not up to standard.
good,"Good employer if you have previous experience."
good,"Great Place to work. Work life balance is good.Easy to get work from home. People are friendly."
good,If you enjoy spending hours at your desk answering calls from sometimes difficult customers then you will enjoy this job. The plus side is being able to assist those in need and that is rewarding in of itself.
good,"Fast paced. Not a lot of room for advancement in my opinion."
good,Don’t apply to call center position. No opportunity for advancement.. you will have to resign & reapply to a higher position after 6 months! Great management.
good,"at first i liked working there but after several changes in management then the constant changes in goals and company alignment it was time to leave.  The moved to a virtual leadership.  This caused lack of communication, availability and lack of my manager setting expectations. we had to have several calls regarding the questions i had instead of sitting face to face"
good,It’s and ok place to work. If u just need a job. If you want a long term career that pays what your worth Mayb not the best. I enjoyed it in the beginning
good,A good company to work for. The pay is low compared to other companies for the same work. The moral of the company is good and a great work life balance.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,My typical day at work was fun an productive. We were always busy but we as a team made our days fun and eventful. My day would start off slow until 10:30am. That's when we packages started to arrive. I would sit in front of my computer and start logging in all the packages using our bar coding system. That way we could track all packages going in and out of the company.
good,"Great place to work as far as pay goes, the benefits could be better.  A downside if that there was a company lay off unexpectedly, where nobody knew what was going on we just received boxes in the mail."
good,"Training was tremendous fun. However, I feel it wasn't quite adequate to perform the job. I received several rewards for performance. I felt there was a bit of age discrimination where performance was concerned. Many young people goofed off and had many absences, with little discipline. Overall, it wasn't a bad place to be and I welcome an opportunity to be employed with them again."
good,"I was generally compensated well, but the development process is chaotic with middle management being a burden instead of a facilitator. Negative work culture of selfishness, lack of communication, and ""pass the buck"" mentality."
good,completely depends on what department you are located within and what location you are. The job varies very much and isn't consistent. Layoffs can happen at anytime
good,I learned a lot about dealing with misunderstood customers. There is high turnover and management does not seem to mind that their employees are over worked..... however this was in 2016. so it might be different.
good,The job is ok for a person with no kids. Not all the management is really qualified. There is alot of office politics going on. Unless your friends with any of the supervisors then you may get passed up on promotions or special projects.
good,I don't feel comfortable expressing my concerns about UHG in a public format.  Thanks for inquiring. I only filled this out because it wouldn't allow me to go any further without a comment.
good,"Nothing to say. Management is not good. To much politics and partiality. Not giving priority for people who work hard. Always give advantage who is doing butting,.."
good,Poor management no communication with the staff at all always changing your job without asking and have favoritism when you up for shift change they pass you by and give it to others employee tat haven't been there long you have so seniority doesn't play a part in it not fair and hiring people off the street making more than you do and doing the same thing
good,"I was able to move up every 2 years. however the raise had to be no more than 10 percent, and the annual raises were probably 1%.  "
good,"pay is ok, however, lower than average, on the rare occasion you see "
good,I do not want to comment. I am not going to provide you any further information. STOP making me fill this in. I do not have to offer any personal information.
good,"The company has a solid plan and clear direction - their cultural values on the surface seem very employee friendly, however when it comes down to compensation and sensitivity or value of employee's, it still has a long way to go."
good,"The Company's culture does not filter down to all leaders and all parts of the company. In my specific department, work life balance is a struggle. I am looking for a company that provides more support for working mothers and more affordable ways to cover my family with health coverage."
good,"They have a lot of potential. I can see that other states are much more organized than Florida. Maybe it's because of how FL is overall. However, they have lost a lot of contracts. Many providers are not happy. They are very very slow at resolving issues. It is often blamed on the software but that is not the problem at all. Too many hands in the pot. They are not streamlining things and are not open to feedback because when you are not management, you have to stick to your assigned role and that is the end of it. It is definitely a really good place to gain experience in the medical arena, a good stepping stone, they try to be supportive and there is opportunity for growth in the commercial departments. They just need to be more open minded."
good,Not an exciting job in a remote location which required a long travel and working in a pretty stressful environment with elderly sick people who require a lot of patience.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"poor management. no room for growth. salary doesnt compensate for all the required tasks. attendance policies are difficult to understand. many system issues, for this to be a fortune 500 company"
good,"It was great in the beginning. Training was adequate, but there were situations training didn't prepare us for. Members have been known to scream and cuss right from the beginning of a call. I'd never been spoken to like that at any other job I've had. There's not a lot of room for advancement, but if you apply, you're not made aware of the decisions made until you check your own profile. Management is ok depending on who you have. Mine very much wants things to go her way and gets agitated when they don't. Management expects too much out of employees and often make OT mandatory. Pay is good, but benefits are bad as far as there being a high deductible. It's something that gets complained about and mentioned in their employee surveys, but nothing gets done about it. So many things get brought up in talks with upper management, but nothing gets deployed and nothing changes. Daily tasks get repetitive quite often."
good,"Overly measured work place. Metrics are measured several different ways to no value. Limited support for team members struggling with concepts.  Wage increase is laughable, doesn't attract high level people."
good,"UNITED HEALTH GROUP  Offers a flexible work schedule however compensation, Employee appreciate lacking.  Pay rate way too low and do not reward hard work and commitment ."
good,A Amil vem de uma cultura de aquisições e por isso alguns processos e políticas são desencontrados.
good,Empresa nova que está se adaptando ao cenário nacional.
good,"Ok place to work,."
good,Good place to build your skills if you're coming in the medical billing career. The benefits are good. They need to focus on better training methods. Overall it's ok.
good,Working at United Healthcare  gave me a great in site on workplace Culture.  The most enjoyable part of my job while employed at UHC is knowing that the job I did benefited  our Clients  and made lives easier.
good,"Workplace culture is very corporate.   Corporate culture refers to the beliefs and behaviors that determine how a company's employees and management interact and handle outside business transactions. Often, corporate culture is implied, not expressly defined, and develops organically over time from the cumulative traits of the people the company hires. Job security is low. Management is ruthless. Very little job work/life balance."
good,"With new external leadership often comes change, but change at UHG more times then not mean becoming affected by a ""reduction in force""  as positions get eliminated due to a change in direction."
good,The case management position was not what I understood it to be. Very high turn over rate. Felt more like telephonic nursing “sales” for people who are actually sick. Response from members was difficult.
good,United Health Group / Optum has the typical passive aggressive Midwest employees in middle management which makes it difficult to advance if you are not a white male.
good,"Training is intense. The sups come in once a week and tell you how wonderful it is to work there and how happy they are that you are there. They call you ""friend"". Then when you hit the floor it is sink or swim. Sups walk past you with their nose in the air. They spend more time on their cliques and groups that you have to apply to be in than actually doing their jobs. They have fundraisers that all of the employees participate in but only the ""elite"" get to deliver the goods. They take lots of pics of them ""doing good"" but they don't let the ""underlings"" get any credit for it. Lots of turnover. They spend $15,000 per person to have them trained and $0 to keep them. If you don't like it you are told to leave. You are held to almost impossible standards. They don't have average handle time so you can stay on the phone for hours with a member. But you get ZERO after call work. If you are in after call work for more than a minute they are sending you messages or coming to your desk to ask you why. Management sucks, promises broken, you can't get a straight answer from anyone except HR."
good,Work environment peaceful Desk job friendly human resource Management changes frequently without notice Employee integrity and company mission enforced
good,"Overall this company is good. Its combination of product and service based."
good,At UHC the company focuses more on production rather than quality. I am a person who is passionate about the members that I speak to and it is hard for me  to treat them just as a number. I love working from home but there is a tremendous amount of pressure to meet a certain production. I dont get off until 6pm each day and that is hard for me as a mother and wife whos family is very busy.
good,"This employer could use better management and communication. The pay is not equal between new employees and seasoned employees. For an insurance company, benefits are not great for employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Compensation and Benefits can be a lot better. I have a great supervisor so work and life balance is a plus for me, but i have had some supervisor who have made it difficult."
good,"Depending on the department, it can be very noisy. "
good,"UHG states they want to help employees move ahead. The advancement seems to only promote the employees which suck up to management."
good,UHC offers great benefits and pay. The hours are Monday through Friday with weekends and holidays off. There is limited flexibility in scheduling which makes it difficult to take care of family needs unless you take PTO.
good,There is not anything that I wish to say about this company. They begin great but over the last several years have moved away from advancement opportunities and a commitment to employees.
good,"UHG, while giving the appearance of a well rounded company, which looks out for its employees through many training programs and in hose workshops, does not actually allow for the time for mid and low level employees to participate in these while still maintaining regular workload. Benefits are average to low pay, minuscule raises, and no bonus."
good,"Never understood the organization structure. My supervisor had very little power. Director was a micro-manager who spent most of his time watching employees like a hawk. Very high turnover rate on the team because of this issue. Also, the company does not pay well. There are very small raises at review time. They find an excuse to not give you an excellent review rating to keep from paying a higher raise or bonus."
good,A typical day processing claims was nice. I like that I had the opportunity to work independently. I enjoy being a team player as well but working independently taught me how to be more aware of my time management.
good,"My position at UHG was great, but their management was fairly bad, they used micro-management, kept employee away from growing in their career. Manager was not able to catch with team and project knowledge."
good,"During my time working with UHG there were a lot of promises made, including improved benefits, increased pay, and advancements in tech and comfort equipment. While the company made changes to these benefits, the impact on our office was a net loss, both in pay, and in benefits, and was a sad disappointment in terms of what benefits an insurance company can provide its personnel. There was one change made to improve equipment, though that change had been on the agenda for over 4 years by the time it occurred, and did not produce a significant improvement in productivity, or turnover."
good,Sem mais...ja foi muito bom trabalhar la. Pois agora eles não valorizam mais o funcionário
good,"I witnessed some trainers provide special treatment toward other new comers. Human resource manager lied on several employees to have them removed company. The benefits offered were great,"
good,"they changed the grading for competency two days before after 13 weeks of training, one error caused by the client washed me out of the class. totally unfair in my opinion."
good,"micromanaged and unfulfilling, not challenged but dont feel acknowledged and very passive aggressive management. Other places might be better within the company"
good,"Working in a fast paced environment, but treated as a number.  Management was located in different states and salary was on the low side.  Enjoyed working with the appeals on the behavioral health side."
good,"Empresa está passando por fortes mudanças e trocando a cultura interna, expectativa de melhora só para 2020, onde todas as mudanças estarão finalizadas. Fora isso a empresa é muito boa."
good,"The job was stressful due to provider representatives had limited time to be on the phone as well as answer any issues for the provider. My manager was definitely helpful. The training was 16-20 weeks so UHG made sure we were trained correctly for our job and knew what we needed to know. However, once your schedule is picked quarterly, your stuck with it and no changes could be made. Overall I enjoyed my job because I enjoyed helping people but I do feel we should have been paid more."
good,Started working with  United Health as a temp and was hired on with a perm position that ended up being far from what I wanted or what was promised to me.
good,"+ Autonomy of practice."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A typical work day consists of speaking to members on the phone, reading off claim and benefit information and constantly being micro managed. Handle time of calls is scrutinized and you  are to help the members as much as possible but with limited time to do so. Adherence to schedule is scrutinized and you care coached to get down the call times, but are still supposed to do the most you  can in a span of 5- 10 minutes on a call."
good,"I work for Teletech and they have a contract with United Healthcare. "
good,"Company take over was brutal on everyone and management just did not know how to handle all the changes or how to inform thier employees of the changes.its a call center changes are to be expected, but they wherent ready."
good,OTs are compulsory and there is no prior notice. Applying leaves is a big challenge. Night differential and OT reimbursements are reflected after 2 payouts. The company is into delayed gratification.
good,Changing Culture where the company seems to value younger employees more than experience older employees.  Lots of experienced older employees laid off or encouraged to take severance package.
good,"A typical day is working on computer all day - meetings, work.  Since resources are spread out world wide, not much direct interaction."
good,Its okay to work at this place. I didnt have a great experience but I heard it changed. I wouldnt know but if it did change then that would be great. Better leadership was needed.
good,Work life balance is progressive but job security and advancement is weak.  People work hard and compensation is lower than average industry.  Management displays great profits but do not reward employees with bonuses
good,"As a prior authorization technician, we review the cases the providers and members submit and attempt to obtain any missing information. The most difficult thing about working for this company is the fact that things are always changing and it is not always communicated to the entire team as quickly as it changed."
good,"I thought that working for one of the largest health insurance companies in the USA would offer great health benefits, but it does not.  In fact, my medical benefits went from a copay to high deductible plan causing a lot of stress.  I am afraid to go to the doctor because it will cost me so much out of pocket deductible before UHC pays anything.  They even hit you with a high deductible for prescriptions.  How is the middle class person supposed to pay $500 for a on month supply of medication?"
good,"Good company, treats employees well, but expects a lot from individuals and depending on what you do, does not always provide a good work/life balance. Disappointed in their promotion of growing current employees in career development."
good,"I enjoyed working there until I had to take a leave of absence due to personal medical issues: i returned and was not taken seriously and was treated differently and never advanced after that, while i saw new employees receiving positions i worked very hard for and my numbers proved it. we would receive monthly quotas of our teams work and of our own, i received 100% and our team received a 96% so some of my co-workers were slacking and not completing their daily tasks. i never received recognition nor the opportunity to advance to a different position, possibly the position that was being done insufficiently. i had my manager do a check in on me quite a few times which was not normal, she only did that if you were doing your job poorly and your stats were low, she for some reason saw that my tracker showed that i was never on my computer and that i showed idle time and that i was never typing????? it did not make any sense, i received 100%. our monthly came out, i saw the others and so many were below me but i got a phone call from HR saying that i was on probation. So, they had a vendetta and got rid of me, i still do not know the real reason, but I am glad to be gone, besides the money loss, they paid very well, except the fact that they took my bonus off of me at Christmas because of the probation period (terrible), who does that to someone? Lastly, in office I was bullied, and brought to tears by quite a few women. I wore perfume and was unaware that it was potent, so instead of politely coming up to me and saying that it was a bit much and asking if i could use less next"
good,Saw an incredible amount of project money wasted due to wishy washy management and management from different areas pulling in different directions. Politics ruled supreme from the Program management level up.
good,This was the job that made me realize I wanted to get out of call centers. The micromanaging. The meeting of metrics and changing them in order to get bonuses.
good,"A typical day at work was 9+ hours of getting yelled and screamed at by customers due to employees not following the process, giving incorrect info, or just outright being apathetic to help patients."
good,"Good benefits, low advancement opportunities and pay.   There are many business units within the organization and there are telecommute opportunities as well."
good,Company was ok to work for but it was hard to advance up in the company from the inside. They seem to hire people from off the street to positions higher than to place people who had be proven loyal associates to the company in those positions.
good,"If you are in school and you need a job to just get you through that deals with no structure nor progression, this is the job for you. A job that I felt like I was over qualified for."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Management not to familiar with my job"
good,"It was a good place to work. the people were very nice . it is walking distance to local food places. It was a clean and secure. It is a fast pace ,fun, exciting place to work"
good,"If you can not say anything good, better say nothing at all. "
good,This was a contract position with no opportunity to be hired.  I thought the training was very good.  I didn't like the way they treated their contractors.
good,"You have great co-workers and they do try and make the workplace enjoyable with activities (at least during the time that I was there)"
good,"Role is very boring, dont really feel like a nurse. You have to wait 12 months in order to change roles. There are a lot of adherence policies in terms of time that you have to follow and it feels like micromanagement. Feels like a benefit/clerical role."
good,"On October 30th, 2017  over 20 of us IT desktop support staff around the US were downsized.. with severance.   Culture is good... Never saw the layoffs coming.   Great co-workers   Upper mgmt. has issues and short sighted."
good,"Ok, but be prepared for red tape. The job provides steady work and decent pay. The type of work is very detail oriented which gets to be tiresome when business demands are high."
good,Very unorganized since they hire about 700 interns the team is not as organized as another team place. Not much worked to do and very slow.  I worked as intern
good,"I like the job at United for some time, i was really good at it and my co workers and manager where great. It wasn't until after being there for a  few years with no advancement that i finished college and moved on to another place to work. the day to day was extremely stressfull as i routinely took up to 100 calls a day. Everyone was graded on metrics , call time, ticket closures, Q&A of calls, which in the end killed it for me, they would rather i spend a few more minutes talking about the end users day, then getting to the point and fixing the issue."
good,this company was very unfair with doing overtime when it came to computers and system failure.  Their expectations were unreasonable and not family friendly.
good,"Training was quite deplorable , not organized or structured at all. Initial on the job training was in adequate as there was insufficient staffing to support new hires,. Training  Documentation , modules presentations were severely lacking and lack luster as they were not aligned with the actual description of our day to day job duties .."
good,"log on phone taking calls every 3 min ,take break  log back on take calls log off lunch log back on take calls break log back on taking calls then log off go home stressed to the max.if you log off phone to go to bathroom supervisor asking why you got off the phone!"
good,"Little to no room to advance, Management only look out for themselves. Attendance policy suck. Even if your child was in the ER and you have a doctors note they still take points off of your bonus. The highest you can bonus is a very very very low dollar amount."
good,Contract is folding 12/31/2017. If you are a contract employee for UHC you have no guarantee of a job after that date. I would not waste these last view months trying to work there.
good,There is no way to advance. This is a temp position. The pay goes down every year. little to no way to make extra money in sales position. More education than sales.
good,properly trained for prover service rep but not properly trained when expected to do other positions...   i was trained to deal with medical providers.. after about 4 years expected to deal with members which required additional time on the phones ... The company mostly cared about the number of call received not the information given to the members..
good,"Not a bad place to work, Little non job security. The work life balance is not good either most of the time you will be taking work home. Great flexibility"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Although united healthgroup is a good place to work with prmosiing benefits, there is not much of a balance of work and family life there. The Greensboro location is one that has gone down in previous years due to changes in management as well as the environment."
good,decline to elaborate upon issues confidential information needs to stay within company management and higher ups. Workplace issues need to be addressed for both staff and customers.
good,"The position was a contract to hire and in my final 30 days before hiring, they pulled the funding for my position and let me go. They have several layoff every year."
good,The training program is very intensive.  However this job is not for everyone.  Depending on which supervisor you have you could receive little to no support.
good,"Assisted provider with payment of claims. Learned more about how Medical Insurance works in detail."
good,"Goals for employees were confusing, and the quality assurance on calls was difficult to attain at 98%.  We were told the standards were set by Medicare, but did not know if that was the truth or not."
good,"Before Alere health was purchased by UHG, the focus on our work centered around customer service. very quickly after the purchase we were morphed in to a Psuedo-sales force where the work load was significantly increased and goals became unattainable within the 40 hour work week. This was not such a bad thing when you appreciate a challenge, however the company was unwilling to compensate this new ""sales force"" like sales people. In my opinion .001% total compensation for a sale is unacceptable, but that wasn't my main reason for leaving. Being unable to move laterally within the company and take full advantage of tuition reimbursement due to department restrictions was an unavoidable eventuality. At the end of the day Alere health was the company I loved , and the UHG purchase changed the culture in to an unrecognizable quagmire of greed and mismanagement. As harsh as that sounds it was full of really good people, and I was willing to endure the transition with the belief that I could make a positive impact on the culture and possibly see it turn around. That wasn't the case, but for someone looking for temporary work its probably a decent choice. Just not for me."
good,"The company is good but lacks in organization and management. There's no team work what so ever and everyone works and learns own their own."
good,Sometimes this company would not allow you to have that family time. It would get to a point where there so much OT. You forgot you had a family at home.
good,"Foi bom como experiência de primeiro emprego de carteira assinada e é só. Já se vão 10 anos, a empresa foi vendida e nem posso me posicionar hoje de forma justa sobre como é agora o trabalho lá. Passei um ano e foi o suficiente pra mim. Voltaria a trabalhar lá? Não sei, precisaria refletir."
good,"United is a fast pace workplace. Remote jobs are available. "
good,Learned that the job is not for everyone. Incoming calls monday through friday from 9am to 7pm got to be much during the busy seasons. Especially since there was mandatory overtime for everyone there.
good,"Work is quantity (numbers processed) driven."
good,"Foi muito gratificante trabalhar nesta empresa,cresci muito profissional e como pessoa"
good,"ok for some people but there is a great degree of micro-managing which can be over whelming at times."
good,"The small department I worked, everyone worked easily as a team.  The focus of the work was small it was satisfying.   The hardest part of the job was the DBAs were remote in another state."
good,"A typical day had an average call volume, anywhere from 36 calls each day to as little as 10 calls depending on the nature of the call and the need of the member. There are many systems used in the effort to handle members issues. Complicated systems often lead to ineffective resolution."
good,Director and management was very hostile towards employees with threatening meetings without any balance or meaning. they only focused on production numbers
good,It was an honor to work for UHC through a temp service for a year. I was responsible for registering all outpatient procedures for infertility and bariatrics procedures. I enjoyed talking to most the patient as they always had a great story to tell me. I would become so excited to learn when a patient finally conceived through the In vitro fertilization treatments. UHC had some of the best trainers.
good,"In a typical day at work I would take calls from members with a variety of policies and coverages and it was often confusing as to what the true coverage was.  I learned that even though an insurance policy may cover things this year that next year, even though the member may have been told there were no changes, the same things and prescriptions may not continue to be covered.  The hardest part of the job was finding the correct answer to give members and the most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to assist the member with correct information."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Lots of opportunity within UHG, poor pay if you stay in the company. Management doesn't walk the walk, they talk the talk though."
good,"attendance policy is one of the worst. do not accept dr's notes. "
good,"I work from home, the hardest part of this position is the high standard of metrics you must meet in order to maintain employment they change daily. You cannot take off work unless you were approved two weeks in advance or longer without receiving a point. 4 points is an immediate cap. Time off requests are in PTO bids against the rest of your teams and seniority always receives first bids. Shifts do  change and have to bid on quarterly. If you have a family this may not be the place of employment for you. The job pays very well even if you only have a HS Diploma and yearly raises are an option based on performance levels."
good,"very stressful position taking call after call. learned to navigate sytem and new updates on protocol and benefits updates and changes."
good,"Very disorganized company.  Training is insufficient.  Management is bogged down in production numbers.  They talk a  good game but the follow through is not there. You have to be willing to work in frustrating conditions, with many gray areas as far as decision making."
good,"This is a great company/ healthcare network to be a part of. They are constantly growing and improving and look for individuals who will help them in doing so. Prior training and experience is almost a must as their training programs can be rushed or change a lot, but plenty of work, good benefits, and many opportunities await!"
good,"Good culture of people, the training for the position was really bad.  Did not cover anything that we actually do; so not prepared once we got started.  Very punitive in nature regarding these issues.  Employee accumulates ""defects"" for items they were not trained on; they call it a ""coaching opportunity""."
good,"management can be hit or miss."
good,Wouldn't recommend to anyone looking for easy advancement or great benefits. The pay is OK but the mandatory weekends and point system will make you reconsider.
good,"Is a great company for entry level Customer service Reps does train "
good,"mixed reviews on staff and managment. Staff was nice, managment was ok. Long hours when working from home, no buddy system  when on vacation. Heavy caseload for some and not others during new products and pilot programs."
good,"they are ok to work for, they are good at picking favorites. Coworkers are great to work with. The phones are non stop expect a call every 6 seconds."
good,The organization is very hard to navigate and employees are not rewarded for hard work.. ONLY A SELECTED FEW. Many bad and Managers
good,"I seen so many friends and family members getting hired without experience."
good,Management and co-workers are good. Benefits were ok. If you can be uncaring and only concern yourself with getting people off of the phone you will go far. If you can get a non-phone job the company is fantastic.
good,"This job is perfect for people who are fresh out of school. It is the perfect place to learn and develop an idea as to where to go professionally. I enjoyed meeting and working with most of coworkers. Management is hands off unless something is wrong. There aren't many team building opportunities. The work environment can go bad very quickly due to lack of team work. Once you have your experience, you must leave because they are not willing to pay you competitively."
good,"New facility and new contract with over 200 new employees to work on the state of Iowa. Daily changes to state regulations and health benefits. I enjoy the environment, people, and the customer focus."
good,United Healthcare is a place that does not pay you for the jobs you do. They will overload your responsibilities without financial compensation. The training does not include all that you will need for the job but you are responsible for knowing it all.
good,"This is a huge company that promotes diversity, integrity and other company values. This is a great company to work for if you don't mind being micromanaged by several different systems that are put on your computer to know exactly what you're doing every second of your shift and now requires that you click your mouse or it will allocate idle time which is time where the company considers you not to be working."
good,"A Amil me proporcionou experiência com análise de risco de contratos, foi uma grande oportunidade que me possibilitou realizar o sonho da minha primeira pós graduação. Um dia de trabalho no meu departamento é tranquilo, sempre tenho muito a fazer, incluindo atividades de envio de informações ao departamento jurídico. Meus colegas de trabalho são pessoas educadas e receptivas e minha gerência é focada no lado humano das pessoas."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A busy call center"
good,"Empresa onde aprendi tudo que sei hoje na area administrative, com profissionais abilidosos e muito prestativos a ensinar."
good,"Low pay, bad management. Broken processes. Large company, good espp benefits. Difficult to be promoted from within. Needs a lot of improvement in the management style."
good,"Blame game culture, no support, systems good process in place which is good but no induction no training, hardest part of the role is the lack of support from the Director level, no idea how they get they got the job"
good,"O ambiente de trabalho é tranquilo, aprendi a utilizar o sistema ERP, negociação com fornecedores e atividades do departamento de Compras, Recursos Humanos e Financeiro. A gerencia não estimula os funcionários e não da feedback. A parte mais difícil da empresa e por conta dos funcionários antigos não possuir qualificações para o cargo ocupado. Gerando retrabalho. A parte agradável é o acesso a outras áreas."
good,"Call members from the plan to schedule a house calls visit for them. I enjoy and feel good when it comes to help others. I always try to my best and make sure to satisfy our customers' needs. I like my teammates who also work as hard as I do. The most difficult part of the job is maybe engaging the member and make them understand why we ask for personal information over the phone. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is when the member calls back and tells us how wonderful the visit was and how professional and knowable out nurse practitioners were."
good,Benefits are lacking for such a huge insurance company.  Too many changes and your boss changes way too much.  Easy to get lost in the shuffle.  Had to advance .
good,Management and work force were both friendly but processes were broken.  Limited compensation at all work levels.  Training not up to par with short staffed transition to production.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management, Constant change of policies. Plenty of red tape and politics. The people that you worked with every day became family away from home. Every I day I had an opportunity to assists consumers to help improve their healthcare situation with the Medicare Plans we had available to offer."
good,"the job is steady work, atmosphere is very demanding, its all about the numbers, have to make sure you meet your quota everyday, might as well work in a sweat shop....I do not approve of the CEO, who has no inclination as to what our job entails, we have to be fast and be accurate ALWAYS or you're gone....three strikes your out!!"
good,"Acesso ruim"
good,"It is best place to start career , But they don't provide proper pay . So for initial stages of career  you can prefer. Hikes are  very very less. Don't expect. They will make you work for 16 hours a day"
good,"Very stringent dress code.  After all ,we work in a call center and have no face-to-face contact with the customers.  Also, recruitment for lateral movement and advancement is a joke (and not a very funny one, at that.)  VERY strict schedule adherence and attendance policies.  The money may be marginally better than entry-level, but not by much."
good,Fielded calls from members regarding their benefits and trained UHC staff regarding Provider Services and answered questions from providers regarding members' benefits.
good,"The company does a lot for the employees the job is very demanding, but you do receive ample training. I feel the  is decent but there should be more bonus incentive"
good,It's a good place to work if you have nothing else out there. Go the other direction of you can help it. I believe in the interview they sell you the company verses the you selling yourself to them. Only been the 9 months and already looking for something different.
good,"Ability to work from home (at discretion of manager)"""
good,"You cannot balance your job and personal life. Management in most of the process is pathetic. At the end of the day, Management only wants to fulfill their needs keeping aside Employee wishes. Salary was good initially but as the organisation is tenured, everything is cut back. "
good,"Typical day at work: Boring"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"There is too much inconsistency, adapting to change is one thing but not having a solid foundation is unacceptable. Meetings are had daily that are repetitive and unnecessary. The co-workers are great but the most satisfying part of the job is knowing you are helping people in need."
good,Optum is an ok company to work for. They do offer benefits such as medical/dental coverage which is always great. The Operations Manager is awesome and he does work hard to have unfair policies changed/addressed.
good,Had some issues with upper management after not being allowed to advance after 4 years with the company.  Couldn't work for a company I didn't respect any longer.
good,the daily work is highly stressful. learned a lot about the health care industry. this is a very diverse working environment I had great co-workers. This employer does not support work/life balance.
good,"Changes happen quickly and people move around quickly, unfortunately that also means that job security always seems to be in limbo. I also find that the insurance benefits are terrible for employees however that seems to be the standard these days."
good,enjoyed the job and the members who called in were more fun than anything. i would work here again due to having a good expierience
good,"Worked in the call center which is automatically a stressful and demanding job, but add to the fact you have poor management and it makes it worse.  Newer reps taking back to back calls with only seconds between each while others sat and had personal conversations, constantly up wandering around, doing ""projects"" when there were calls in queue.  Call Centers are meant for everyone to be all hands on deck which management preached during open enrollment; however it was not adhered to if you were a ""favorite"".  Training was good, but there was no leeway for one to actually learn the job when released to the floor.  1 single mistake put you back 10 steps, written up or fired.  Not a good company if you want to keep your morale up.  Definitely a morale crusher."
good,"Empresa não me passou estabilidade. Aprendi muita coisa sobre contratos e normas, porém ainda muitos assuntos para serem aprendidos."
good,United Health is not unlike most major corporations it is what you make of it . Overall UHC is a great place to work. Our commitment to customer satisfaction is unmatched in the industry
good,"Processing is the name of the game. You have to know how to jump from screen to screen in small time frames, as well as how to adapt to new teachings. This is not the kind of position that you can question yourself in, because you need to be able to make a firm determination based on the standard operating procedures. If you keep your eyes open, listen well, and learn to sway with the ever changing tide, you will learn a lot with this company."
good,This is a wonderful company with a great vision.  The employees are exemplary and really care about people.  The Senior management is political and disengaged in the overall workforce.
good,"Corrido mais Agradável,todos os dias aprendíamos um com o outro. Coleguismo a tu ava em geral .muitas amizades do menor ao maior,sem exceção ."
good,"Passed over continuously when certified and qualified for positions, but other folks are in the same role with less competency."
good,I enjoyed my time at United Health Care despite the mandatory overtime that frequently can turn what should be a typical 40 hour work week to 50-60 hours a week.
good,"Great Company good benefits great team , good overtime hours,Nothing else to say good company to work for.I  enjoyed working for this company was there for almost 5 years decided to mover to a different company but it was not a good fit for me wich i could go back no hiring ."
good,"constant job responsibility change with limited notice, employee engegments, strict security"
good,"I work from home."
good,"Nice place to work, good work life balance with job security, but there are less learning opertunities for fresher."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Sitting at computer for 10 hour days working with claims and providers to assist in making sure were processed according to members benefits, provider contracts and company policies."
good,Helping my clients is the best part of my day at work. The hardest part of my job is nothing. Everything is easy to me because I'm a quick learner and I love fast past high volume of inbound and outbound calls
good,"Pros:"
good,United Healthcare is a healthcare company and there is no place to grow.. Give promises they don't keep and working 3 positions within the company and will not hire others
good,"I love the people here, everyone is very friendly and helpful, but in my department there lacks job advancement opportunities, pay increases are given rarely or not at all. The job changes constantly, it seems like I am doing a totally different job from what I applied for 3 years ago.. with so many changes there is very little training available for us and expectations are still required to be met."
good,"One hectic training had attended with all head office people."
good,At work the typical day was anything but typical. We never knew what was going to happen. We were given projects at the last minute to complete with little time to spare. Everything was a rush. We never had time to do work that was wanted by the provider.
good,"É uma empresas competitiva que esta em crescimento, esta inovando com o trabalho em home based, foi comprada recentemente por uma empresa Americana que entendo que pode melhorar ainda mais."
good,This company has high turnover for a reason. They have unreasonable expectations for a customer service business.
good,There is lots of change constantly going on at this company.  Leadership turnover often.
good,Learned lot of new things. which i can enhance my skills in any other company . If i got an oppurtunity in any other organisation i will utilize my skills and i will be the part of company success.
good,"Great place to gain experience.  Lots of mandatory overtime, and hard to maintain work/life balance.  Lots of training hard to learn but interesting job once you learn it."
good,"Corporate environment, was a telecommuter. Did intake and review, correspondence and participated in meetings."
good,"Customer service calls, Insurance and Billing"
good,"My review is NOT about UHC perse, it is about their affiliation (Connextions) whom I was hired though, but placed on the UHC account. When I was first introduced to Connextions it sounded amazing like there would be job security; however, shortly after starting training for UHC sales I learned that Connextions has a HIGH turnover rate. What happens is they place you on an account and make you believe that is where you will be working permanently but then after the AEP/OEP season is over they put you on a new account or in a different department and sometimes with a lower pay rate."
good,"Great pay and and advancement opportunity "
good,"Been there for 3 years, good place to work. It is a very busy call center."
good,I worked on the computer all day long making changes to the insured's policy as they request
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Little supervision on a daily basis. Recieved phone calls, emails, and faxes. Along with helped pharmacists and also nurses with patients meds."
good,"Former Claims Associate Rep. (16 years experience/6 with Sierra/United).  Although earned, no chance for advancement.  Disparaged by management when I applied.  Others advanced 2 - 4 levels not doing anything better (And sometimes less) than what I was accomplishing.  Apparent that politics (Who management liked) played 99% into promotions instead of documented job performance.  Bottom line:  Management did not know their personnel and who could do the job....   "
good,"This is a place that has a lot of opportunities but I feel that there is a constant confusion as to what the ultimate goal should be and therefore a lot of problems happen between the employees and management, especially since I am a telecommuter."
good,The company I worked with is a TPA and had it's own values sometime not matching UHC's . Neopotism is very prevelant there. Half of your yearly review is based on how well you are liked by your manager not your work.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy being an automaton. Valuable input on standard operating procedures isn't really listened to. Individual employee value isn't recognized by and large.
good,"A typical day consists of fill prescriptions,taking payments, contacting doctors and updating insurance information."
good,"Was a great company to work for, as in the job itself. Management was horrible as well as senior HR representatives."
good,I love working with and helping the elderly. Helping them makes is that much easier to go to work.
good,"Empresa que vem passando por mudanças constantes, que deixa a desejar quanto ao salário e benefícios oferecidos aos funcionários, espero que se organize logo com essa nova mudança."
good,Able to work independently. Co-workers are friendly. Professional environment. Management styles vary from dept to dept.
good,I am very thankful to have worked and UHC. I learned a lot about the COBRA process.
good,"The most difficult thing about the job is that I am highly skilled; have years of experience, yet am unable to use any of that or advance in the corporation because I am not ""licensed at the highest level"" according to their guidelines----so am very limited there and performing duties which could easily be performed by someone with little or no education or experience."
good,"Ok place to work, my only complaint is the pay. Time off and scheduling time off is pretty flexible, but PTO is used for everything, leaving you with unpaid time off by mid year if you're not careful (raises hand in shame). Actually enjoy talking to the pleasant providers, but the not so pleasant ones are a thorn in the side. Calls are always recorded, so the best thing to do is kiss their backsides and give the people what they want all the time, or else the infamous survey monster will siphon your blood. They have a great way of pumping you in up in training, but when you get out in the real world (the floor) it's a dog-eat-dog world. If you're looking for a right now job in the healthcare ind, this may be for you, they're always hiring. However, if you want to be paid based on your skills and expertise and are looking for something remotely related to what you got your degree in, find another job."
good,"Very busy, lots of keyboarding, did claims processing of medical and dental. Sources - Paper claim forms, HCFA's. UB92's, Dental claim forms. Inpatient and outpatient using cpt codes and icd-9 codes; entered other insurance EOB's; did claim adjustments."
good,A typical day at work is recieving back to back inbound calls about healthcare plans. What I have learn is great skills and training from rx drug plan to medicare advantage plan to asst customers with there benefits. My co-worker are great but i mostly work from home. The hardest part of the job when going over the cost of benefits with patients that caint afford there benefits and they sometimes cry over the phone which makes me sad. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping member understand there health and rx plans.
good,"I beleive there is so much to be learned @ this company for the management, and the employees."
good,Get work list for day
good,"Overall a good company, however the management is lacking direction."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I needed to be very detail oriented in the legal area. There was no room for creativity of course. I realized that this was not a good fit for me and went back to school to earn a BA degree in Writing.
good,"The environment at this job and any job will always be different, but I have learned that jobs that have no work/life balance will not be the opportune job for me. This job was very strict in regards to their attendance policy but a great company to work for overall."
good,"Ensured smooth client transition from previous carrier to UHC, provided necessary enrollment materials, conducted enrollment orientations/process, worked with clients to resolve claims issues, and prepared renewal"
good,"If you're into call centers, that is what the atmosphere is like there. Amazing training and gives you tons of tool you can you in the future. Great benefits are also a great plus. If you're fine with making a call per hour quota and the constant answering the phones, this job is perfect for you."
good,"Empresa não tem proposta salarial adequada ao mercado, quadro de funcionários não é completo em nenhum setor sobrecarregando os funcionários durante os plantões."
good,worked as a Specialty Nurse Case Manager and the work was challenging but the rewards were great. Parents were a great population to work with. I  did learn a lot in this line of work
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I was able to work on a lot of rewarding and challenging projects and met some great people. I also had the opportunity to work from home which is a great perk.
good,"work / life balance is very difficult, but the United culture (based on The Human Operating system), actually does help by providing everyone with a common framework to discuss needs and priorities"
good,There is little room to grow in this exact position. Management tracks every move you make and your computer including bathroom breaks. Not allowed to leave your desk for more than a few minutes at a time.
good,"I started working for UHC in the HouseCalls Program in 2015.  During that time I felt I was making a difference in the lives of our members.  I was offered ample time to education members with multiple chronic, comorbidities to enhance the overall quality of their lives.  This company is constantly changing and over the course of the last 5 years I have seen a drastic disappointing decline in their care model.  More and more tasks have been added to the assessments leaving less and less time for actual patient / practitioner interaction for education and resource management.  The company has become very task driven and has placed much of its emphasis on the quantity of visits a practitioner completes to meet monetary quotas rather than the quality of the individual patient encounters.  They will say that an assessment should take between 45 and 55 minutes to complete in your interview process but be aware with all the new advancements assessments take between 60 to 75 minutes to complete.  You are expected to see 6 members in an eight hour day with long travel distances (sometimes 60 minutes between members).  There is no time allocated for administrative activities therefore practitioners are expected to complete charting, call pcps, attend team meetings, and complete mandatory Learn Source modules on their ""free"" time.  The pay seems generous until you add in the ""hidden hours"" you are expected to work above and beyond your salaried commitment.  This job offers very little work / life balance although the words are past around the company like it is a core value however the"
good,"- Colleagues were collaborative"
good,I personally do not feel comfortable with giving this company a review and not sure why I have to complete this section.   I would prefer to keep how I feel about this company to myself.
good,Work is difficult because the branch office is not held accountable for doing their job. Branch office frequently fail to obtain authorization when needed. This made it impossible to get payment.
good,I was told we get a yearly bonus and I was short two months from a year and they said I didn’t qualify. I felt my boss Was not fair with me. Not much flexibility even working from home
good,overall good. Salary is good. Work Life balance is good. But no job security. enough work to keep your self busy for entire day. learning is nothing only work.
good,"UHG is a very fast paced company with strong financial results.  The long term value in the company is utilizing all of the different strategic assets they own.  However, each business operates in a silo, and a lot of the value is untapped.  Given the current incentive structure I'm not sure how the silo's will be broken down unless the UHG C-suite helps to align the incentive packages for all businesses."
good,I was actually a vendor worker for United health group so this was not based on the actually company United health group but the 3rd party vendor I worked for which was teleperformance
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The hardest part of job is tedious work"
good,"The option to be able to work from home was the main perk of this job and why I stayed there for so long. However, it was so hard to move up in the company and the raises were terrible. After being here for 4 years I still haven't received a complete $1 raise."
good,"Regardless of work ethic and performance, which are measured metrics 24 7, there was no moving up in this company.  "
good,"Leadership is issues, eamils not answered, calls not getting returned. Leader ship unable to connect or speak with employee, management in meetings 99 percent of the time."
good,They offered work from home positions which truly was the best perk of the job.  Loved the work life balance and flexibility but there was some aspects that were difficult towards the end of my time there.
good,This is the good company for the beginner and provides all the facilities what a employee should get but after the certain time of period can't say about the future. That's the risk factor is there
good,"I used to take pride in working for UHG. In recent years there has been a push, by executive leadership, to save money by moving jobs over seas, despite making billions in profit every quarter. Workers now have to worry about job security every year, regardless of their productivity."
good,"Intense, fast paced environment. Opportunities exist for those who thrive in a corporate environment but little work/life balance. Benefits are decent but health insurance is very costly."
good,"The NESTING process, on the floor training is to learn the material, make mistakes and be coached on areas needed to be able to progress after that phase of the training,  is unjust. Meaning this is the process you learn from, so after you're nesting to be great on the phone and knowledge of products and benefits. Favoritism over Experience, is at an ALL-TIME high. Greensboro Site"
good,This position requires significant amount of driving and copious amount of documentation.  Applicants must be comfortable with EMR and frequent changes to requirements for in home visits.
good,Must be able to keep up with the demands of the Health care industry.  Must be able to communicate and be aggressive about work flow.  Understand the changes that may take place and be able to adapt.
good,"Office culture is juvenile, employee events are geared towards employees with small children. Many employees feel overworked and micromanaged. Many in management positions who are not qualified to be there."
good,There is no work life balance in UHG. We need to sacrifice either family or career.if you sacrifice career then family will be in stake so no option to work for 16-18 hrs.  Indian leadership is not good
good,Fun place to work but employees are not treated well. I was there for several years without receiving a pay raise. If you work for any company there should at least be the possibility of raise increases.
good,All the building blocks for a truly great organization are there but they never get assembled properly.  Goals were never well stated which made it very difficult to meet the demands of management.
good,"UHG is first and foremost a high-performing financial company. Beating quarterly and annual targets are far and away the top priority. Investments in mid and long-term needs are continuously shunned in favor of low-cost band-aids. The current company culture is focused entirely on cost cutting to perform better in today's healthcare, rather than innovating or becoming a business people enjoy working with ."
good,"Busy, stressful, fast paced work days with many ongoing changes. Busy season was from October to June with much of the work being on a deadline with many re-evaluations."
good,"The company is based on some very good core value which, once adhered to, makes the organization well balanced with good customer service and employee satisfaction."
good,"I liked the job, not the management. Micro managers. Job was fast paced and the day seemed to go quickly There is nothing else to add. I left this job because of the manager"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I really enjoy working at UHC.  Although I have enjoyed my experience, I am looking to advance my career and broaden my work experience.  I like to travel and I love to learn.  The only negative feedback I have is that I, at times, do not feel valued. Also the health benefits are not good.  The deductibles are very high and the cost is very expensive for a family.  I have definitely learned a lot about management and leadership.and I have had some great leaders to teach me!  I enjoy being a leader.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with different personalities of my direct reports. I very much enjoy seeing or being part of a success story where we are able to provide a member with help that they may not have otherwise received."
good,"I am in the process of resigning, but I currently work as a senior pharmacy technician for prior authorization. Worst department ever! I previously worked for mail order with UHG for 2.5 years and it was great experience, although sometimes hectic, but leadership for mail order is great, as I developed great relationships. Leadership in prior authorization are not very helpful because they spend all their time telling us to look at job aids, when sometimes it's not clear. There is little to no advancement in this department, unless you are a favorite. LOTS of favoritism and unprofessionalism from leadership. Work schedules are fixed and inconvenient. They will not work with you if you want to further your education and pursue school, as we were told something different during training. I definitely felt like a statistic in this department and always seemed to be about numbers rather than my best interest at heart for growth and opportunity. Barely had meetings with my supervisor about leveling up or what my status is. UHG overall is an excellent company to work for, but I will never work for prior authorization again. Too much of a stress for no reason and leadership needs improvement indefinitely!"
good,There is still much to be done in regards to merger the organization and uncertainty regarding how the culture will evolve. There are directors who are still evolving as being new to their role. It has been challenging to get adequate staff to achieve some key objectives. All of these items will likely improve over time.
good,I worked at Optum360 in Rancho Cordova. I learned a lot working here but the managers were micro managers and it did not sit well with me because I am a grown adult.  They timed me every time I went to the bathroom or stepped away from my desk. The department culture was really bad and I hated coming to work.
good,"Dont even bother on applying for this company, they been laying off people every month! Going overseas. Appeal department closed layoff 120 employees, recovery department closed layoff 20+ employees! And those are the departments closed to me."
good,"The company is not a horrible company to work for it is an ok place but I am fully aware of why the turn over rate is high. they need to get management on the SAME PAGE! Also they need to work on people skills and showing appreciation for being hard workers. It is not an easy job and is mentally draining at times, so being appreciative of your works would be a good thing."
good,A very large multinational corporation. The culture they try to create is a culture of respect and diversity. The truth it's only concern is  a high profit.
good,"not a lot of support from management there is really, it can get very political . To many changes without the proper planning makes it very challenging. Also when you work as a call center employee you literally are connected to your desk and taking breaks makes you look like you do not work and that you are a poor employee."
good,"There has been some lay-offs occurring recently, so job security is not too good.  The work is lessening with the many changes management is beginning to implement.  It is a very stressful atmosphere."
good,"Repetitive work once you learned your job"
good,Able to fill the day with task.  lack of information/education on necessary systems.  remote co-workers mostly helpful.  This was a new position that was implemented quickly.  and terminated just as quickly.
good,"UHC is an ok company to work for but one can not raise a family in the wages. They talk a lot about advancement but they don’t promote within a lot."
good,Very disappointed. I thought such a reputable company would be very organized and excellent benefits. My manager was in my orientation class so that explains that. And benefits were the worst of anywhere I've worked in 23 years of nursing.
good,Its hard to balance work and home life.  I like the individual and team effort.   Its really hard to network and move to different departments once you get in.  Sometimes its seems like its mini companies instead of departments
good,The job is stable but they have a lot of mandatory overtime and a lot of micromanagement. Flexibility in schedule and working from home is nice. Not very social though. Good for people who are analytical.
good,"If you do both sales and service you'd better understand how IKE works or you'll never learn."
good,"it was good just didn't like the management, they had a lack of team bonding between the supervisors and employees, but over liked the job its self. just hard to get the correct help for the job"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Uma empresa que esta passando por mudanças culturais.
good,"UHC was NOT a fun place to work. It was very stressful and I personally felt like they didn't care about their employees only the numbers of metrics we were to meet. The customer did NOT come first, only the metrics, once again. "
good,"Empresa boa, com cultura e visão bem definida, local de trabalho excelente, porem o corpo gerencial deixa a desejar por falta de alinhamento com os valores impostos."
good,"It's a just an ""okay"" place to work.  Very demanding with little training. They expect a lot from you, but don't provide much guidance.  They also have a lot of different systems with several different SMEs whom often don't agree on the best approach to solve problems to the point that it often slows down the progress of projects."
good,Large corporation that is often disconnected from those not at the home office. If you are at one of the regional offices your chances of being managed remotely are very high and you will be expected to meet certain metrics.  If your manager is local there is a higher chance you will succeed and do well.  If they are remote there is a higher likelyhood that you will be out of sight and out of mind until they need to make changes. Remember that in the end they are an insurance company and their goal is to make money.  Their platitudes of wanting to change healthcare are nice - but in the end their goal is to produce a profit for their shareholders
good,"Ótima empresa para estágio. Ambiente agradável, pessoas dispostas a ensinar."
good,"The job is not, but its hard for career advancement and the pay is not that great,but other than its pretty much an ok job. The people there are great, I like my coworkers"
good,"It a okay work place. the hours are not consistent.  you may work 1 day 4 hours but the next day 9 hours, but you do get you're 40 hours each week. It was okay."
good,Large well known company with opportunities to get great experience.  Toxic meeting culture. You can’t get any work done due to crazy number of meetings.
good,"A typical day at work is preparation.    I learned quite a bit regarding how insurance works, how HSA and HRA's work.    The workplace cultural structure is intact.  Its execution needs work with the company structure.   The hardest part of the job was mandatory overtime for 6 months."
good,Overall I enjoyed working here. I was able to telecommute for a bit. Nice structure for working with other workgroups when necessary - able to warm transfer calls
good,"I worked at United Healthcare for about 6 years in different positions.In general, looking at  my prior positions, I was very satisfied. But my current position is not so good.I walked into a bad situation where the nurses were complaining about the high expectations and problems with the team's progress in general, Many nurses left during my rather short time in this position.Very difficult to get your time off as well. These are the reasons I am leaving as well."
good,"Work life balance is good with sufficient work to perform on daily basis. Trainings are provided on regular basis, however, there is no implementation of the work in the projects. Management changes every year, sometimes in mid year too. Change is good, but when it takes it right direction."
good,"If you are ok with only getting a 1-2% raise each year.  "
good,Boa empresa para quem está ingressando no mercado de trabalho.
good,"I had a lot of high hopes starting this job.  I worked my hardest and was not able to meet the highest expectations.  I tried to do so, but there is not a lot of negotiations with quantity vs quality."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Great work environment  yet hourly pay rate not enough for the are to make it. Supervisors are great. Training process needs work. Most of what you learn in training you do not use. Should be completed on the floor if New employees are proficient customer service agents
good,"Leadership is out for themselves, really no other way to look at it. Unless youve been there for 10 + years there is no way you can ever think about being late or asking to work remote. They try hard to make their PMO look mature but they just cannot get the support from the top and the buy in from the staff to ever make it a effective PMO."
good,"Management is friendly, however the bad part of about the Management is they will take the feedback of the employees about the performance and job continuinty"
good,UHG has a lot of opportunities and offices but advancement is not an option if you don't have inside connections. Choose your  field of employment wisely you will be there forever.
good,"helping members order medications over the phone, which is repetitive and is an easy task, however, "
good,"I have successfully provided five years of excellent customer service and support to customers. I have supervised over 30 employees effectively training and motivating them to provide excellent service as well. I have strengths in account maintenance, problem-solving, trouble-shooting, sales staff support, and planning/implementing proactive procedures. I possess the ability to work independently while providing high quality service. I have advanced computer skills and knowledge using both IBM and MAC systems, Lotus 1-2-3, and all Microsoft Office Products."
good,"friendly and supportive coworkers"
good,"never worked for company that says you have to have PTO hours to take time off or ask for an hour off on a weekend for kids sports game and was told would be working phones and faxes but mostly phone and when asked why no faxes was told this is a ""Call Center"" which was not on application & had to average 10 calls per hour which means you had to type fast but also was no asked on application or during the interview"
good,Has its pros and cons. Very repetitive position. Not any room for advancement which is why I left. Mostly women over 50 co-workers. Takes a long time to build time off.
good,"The position was on going self development. multi tasking / self analysis..... loosely defined."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends for life that I collaborated with and worked along side. I learned that I can do more with my skillset and I was laid off
good,A typical work day would include multiple meetings along with working through lunch usually. One of the greatest perks is the opportunity to work from home.
good,There are many options to work from home. They micromanage you to an extreme.  They claim to advocate promote from within.  The tuition reimbursement policy is a joke.
good,The company is ok if you're just trying to work just to make money and go home. The manager I had was a trip. There was way to much call center drama for me.
good,"benefits were great, pay was decent.  management was awful, they did not take care of issues within the office.  There was a lot of bullying that went on"
good,"Was a nice place to work and had a lot of room for advancement. It was a fast past Environment, that requires undivided attention to keep up with the daily tasks."
good,Frequent change in management and inconsistent leadership.  No training direction and unrealistic expectations for new hire employees.  Mismanaged and inadequate training program (outdated)
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Okay to work for but not a lot of luck advancing and the pay is low unless you come from the outside. Managers can be bad in some departments. Jobs are exciting.
good,"A lot of opportunity to advance, the pay is fair. I was on a team of around 20, and four of them were promoted during the 8 months that I worked there."
good,Been here for one year. Work overnight. Do not recommend overnight schedule. Telecommuting is convenient. Job is highly customer service based and micro management is very high.
good,Great organization with opportunity for those with the latest skill sets and determination to drive for results in an Agile project management environment.
good,Working there was all about customer service over the phone.  Answering phone calls up to a 100 a day and filling orders.  It was stressful but worth the knowledge.
good,"Nice place to work, just unsure at times if I will have a job within the next year or so. Nothing else to say.  no more comments to make here.  Have a"
good,"The company is so focused on how often our mouse is moving, during a medical review, believing we aren't working, you cannot focus on your job. I was constantly worried about whether I was moving my mouse every 60 seconds. The overall environment is not one of team spirit."
good,The job was fairly easy but what they ask for you do was too much for the $10/hr. When it was slow they would send people home regardless if they wanted to or not. Me personally stayed but there were others who needed to stay for the cost of living.
good,"Service UHC  providers from 9:15 am to 5:35pm answering questions regarding claim denials, eligibility, building authorizations, quoting benefits, transferring to the appropriate department. Sending claims back for reconsideration, verify appeals information, and quoting turn around times for issues."
good,"A typical day at work would include self direction.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that each individual's job truly effects members, for either better or worst.  United is moving in the right direction to make healthcare more manageable, however much like all large companies it is difficult to move anything through quickly."
good,i guess it was great nothing bad to say. I left due to the lack of management engagement. I just hope that  management improves and enhance their communication with their employees
good,The job was okay but I did not feel like I could grow there. I was in the same spot when I started and they were basically selling dreams. There were a lot of skills we had to learn and were not being compensated for it
good,didn't like it...gloomy atmosphere....lack of help on the floor by team leads...not a friendly place to work...lack of training even if you are there 6wks....they rush through the training process
good,"United has some great leaders depending on the organization you work in. Ealier when I began my career the leadership was open, honest, cared about the team and worked in a collaborative manner on all projects and allowed for ideas and open communications to ensure everyone understood the challenges put before the team. As newer management came in and wanted to prove themselves, the open honest culture began changing and all decisions were dictated from them without much input from those that new the work best and work in the drenches daily"
good,Big company means a lot of red tape and everything moves slowly. There are alot of projects you can work on but many get scraped. Management is also slow.
good,"This is overall not a particularly bad place to work. I would not work here if you plan to have a future with a company though."
good,"As a senior business analyst the work is less prescribed and so each day is a little different. In my role I do a lot of reporting and data analysis. There's a lot of old school mentality of being in the office despite there being very little to no in person meetings. They are not flexible on work times despite being told I could work my desired shift, I was later asked to conform to the rest of the team. Working from home is frowned upon and getting a promotion is near impossible. Getting a new position is also challenging because a lot of the positions are already spoken even though they're required to post the job requisition. "
good,It's hard to move around in the company. Management played favorites.If you were not one of the favorite people they would not let you transfer out of the department.
good,"If you don't mind being constantly watched and don't care about customer service this is a job for you.  I am very patient with my elderly and all they cared about was getting them off the phone, regardless of the issues the customer was having."
good,"it was a good job, my manager was not helpful and also i feel as though there were favorites. only certain people got opportunities. It was not an equal opportunity"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The area I was in struggled with non-exempt employee retention and frequent reorganizations, making it difficult to establish solid teams and putting a lot of stress on middle-managers to be successful.  The workplace culture seemed to fluctuate between team-building centric to fire-drill pace daily, creating conflicting messages.  The most enjoyable part of the job was collaborating cross-functionally with areas that were empathetic to our immediate culture and short-staffing.  The hardest part of the job was being held accountable for issues that rose despite open communication and recommendations to improve the environment that were not typically implemented."
good,UHC was a stressful place of employment in the Call Center. Production numbers needed to be met continuously along with particular and detailed information on each call. Changing systems was clumsy and the system and programs went down often making the representatives hand write the detailed information and transfer all of it between calls when the system was eventually back up.
good,"I was brought in for a project (IT).  I had a couple of managers during that time and liked them both.  They hired me on as a full-time worker, but then (one at a time) project members left.  (This was from attrition or their contracts expiring.)  By the time I left, I was attempting to do the work that was previously being done by several others.  It just became too much."
good,"What i thought would be a great opportunity for advancement in a large company, only ended in a monotonous dead end position with mandatory overtime and a revolving door of management.   I was with this company almost 4 years and annual raises did not exceed 35 cents, which would not be an issue if the benefits were not so expensive.    Posting out of your department is nearly impossible and likely only ends in a lateral move."
good,"The benefits are fantastic, but the culture fostered by management is not so great. Projects are often mismanaged with scope, budget and timeline defined by senior leadership without consultation with implementation groups, resulting in high burnout amongst the developer groups."
good,This company offers many great attributes and learning opportunities. There is also a huge opportunity to invest more in its employees. The workplace culture is diverse and does encourage feedback.
good,"Some of the managers are great, but most of them are ""so busy"" they will never take a supervisor call. In fact, my own manager would send you the info back, and tell you to contact the caller yourself. Otherwise, the job wasn't too awful, mostly just usual call center work."
good,"Management ask for the employees opinion but retaliates if the opinion is not to their liking. The work environment is tolerable, but management is terrible."
good,training could be better express problems in my training class and nothing was done about .from equipment not working properly and made me fall behind
good,It was a call center position. The job its self was easy but there wasn't even staff to handle the call volume but they were downsizing/letting people go.
good,I have been on a couple different teams and all throughout the management isn't really there to manage you. There's not a lot of direction either from them which can be hard.
good,"It has been several years since I worked at UHG.  At the time, I had to find full-time employment because I had just gotten divorced.  The pay was fair and they offered health insurance."
good,I would dread coming to work every day. I'ts not that its a bad place or bad management but the job just wasn't for me. I didn't see any roads forward to advancement.
good,Fun but alot of work for little money expensive benefits like the health insurance being over $200 every 2 weeks. Leadership was somewhat descent when i was there.
good,"Great place to go when you're ready to settle. Most people who come into the call center get comfortable and remain there for years. UHC is a wonderful company to work for, but if you want advancement, Member Services/Customer Services is the wrong department to be in. Advancement is based partially on metrics and partially on favoritism. "
good,"UHC Medicare and Retirement was a great place to work until the current business manager took over. The atmosphere was pleasant and inviting. The culture was great, I learned valuable information regarding insurance, and the ways claims process. The teams actually felt like teams instead of who can be better than who. However since the current business manager took over. We all became numbers instead of people over night. The only people that are raised up and promoted are the ones that were in good with them before he became business manager. Everyone on my team was at each others throats over metrics day in and day out. The workforce crew that staffs the lines you will be taking calls for, cant do their jobs to save their lives, so chances are your line will either be steady incoming calls, or in queue for the majority of the day unless you work the night shift. The amount of complaining that goes on throughout the day is horrendous. I'm surprised this department doesn't have a higher turnover rate than it does. The management is the type of management that makes sure you are meeting goal, so they can get their bonus. "
good,"As a full-time developer, you'll have some job security. However, the pay is at or below industry standard, salary increases and bonuses are infrequent and small until you reach management, medical insurance actually costs MORE than at other companies, the technology infrastructure is behind the times, and performance reviews are graded on a curve. In addition, if you include your spouse on your medical insurance when s/he is eligible for employer-provided coverage, you'll pay a penalty of $1800 per year. After 6 years, my net pay is lower than the day I started because it did not increase for 4 of those years, and I'm actively seeking other employment as my pay is now roughly $15K-25K below the market."
good,UHG is a large company where you are just a number.  Most of the managers are just wanting you to put up good sales numbers and if you don't they keep pulling you into meetings.  Sometimes people just don't want what your selling.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Chefia de enfermagem inerte, escravista, omissa e amiguinha de aduladores, gosta de colocar técnicos em situações constrangedoras e nunca respalda sua equipe nem mesmo quando cumpre as regras delegadas de cima pra baixo."
good,"Everyday is different, working with different issue, different work flow and troubleshoot meeting. I learned a lot, working in security career. , it  need  patient and understanding . Understanding the work gives me prospective what I m  working with it and let me glide through issue instead trying  hard to solve an issue."
good,"I enjoyed the travel, the work and my teammates. I would have preferred a much better communication between management and the field team but I guess that they did what they felt was best. I was able to meet people and se different cultures and enjoyed EVERY moment of it."
good,"I was employed with PacifiCare when they were acquired by UHG. It used to be a great place to work but since the acquisition many changes have taken place, some for the better but some have not been better for the employees such as the continuous hikes in premiums & copays with mediocre coverage.  The whole annual review process is also a joke.  They expect you to provide a lengthy self evaluation each year and for what?  It's not like it's taken into consideration or anything.  Management is instructed to only give a certain percentage of staff an increase and everyone else is SOL.  Even if your manager gives you a good review an increase is not guaranteed.  Fortunately I was never one of the employees which is one of the reasons I was blindsided by one of the more recent re-organizations that resulted in my lay off and several others from my team...and in true UHG fashion, the remaining employees are expected to take on the additional work from those let go.  Overall I'm sure it's better than a lot of companies but with so much profit year after year you would think they would be more generous to employees."
good,"Opportunity to have learned the many different jobs in the fulfillment department."
good,I enjoyed my job but the lack of balance was difficult along with the low compensation.  I felt as if I was doing the work of 3 or 4 people.  I would start at 7 or 8am CST and would work until 6 or 7pm CST.  My direct supervisor was great but it was exhausting and again for the compensation wasn't worth it.  I enjoyed my time here and the clinical leadership program but work life balance was difficult.  I would recommend UHG but I would suggest they reevaluate pay and expectations or they will continue to lose great employees.
good,I enjoyed working at UHG. The people are awesome and working in a team atmosphere is really great. I enjoyed traveling to NY to work with the Long Island Jewish Hospitals.
good,"When they feel you are of no benefit to them, you're out.  They don't try to find another position for you, when you're out.  As large as they are (175,000 employees) you would think they could find another position for you, but this is a service they don't provide.  Not a bad company to work for provided you live in a 2nd or 3rd world country.  It is all about their bottom line.  I trained staff in 2nd and 3rd world countries and once they were train, I was no longer needed.  With my manager it was always suggested to bring up thinks to make the company and department better, but it was rare that took place.  In most cases it was the mangers way or the highway."
good,"UHG offers great training opportunities.  "
good,"Change happens at breakneck speed and you have to be ready to deal with operating in a lot of ambiguity.  Quality of manager varies widely.  "
good,Work was rough at times but it was a nice place to work. Management seemed to be very understanding in the beginning until you actually had gotten the chance to know them and realize that they’re just playing a role.
good,"While working at United Health I was in the call center environment. Some of my previous jobs at call centers knew how hard it is to be sitting at a desk all day and would try to make it fun like playing games, and giving you Incentives to do better at your job but while at united health they didn't do much to try to do much as far as making it a fun work environment. The managers weren't trying to coach you and make you better at your job. The worst was when I was a new hire. My first day the trainer showed up 30 minutes late. They didn't tell you what floor or suite they were in so it was confusing trying to figure out where you were supposed to be. Once the trainer was there he was very unorganized. He was jumping all over the place as far as what the job entitles and what training was going to look like. There would be days the trainer would show up hours late and you wouldn't know where you should be or what you should be doing. They told us that we would get paid the next week but when it was pay day we found out that wasn't happening. Once they believed we were ready to go out and be on the phones, we would answer the calls and have no clue what we were supposed to be doing. It was basically just throwing you out and it was a sink or swim situation. We were supposed to have someone there helping us if we had any questions but they were never there and you had to just search around and figure out what to do. One of the most stressful and unorganized jobs I've had."
good,Great management but some has the inability to conduct need based assessment before making critical change that affects front line Long-term care managers
good,"Department was not well coordinated.  We were moved to an outside call center.  Was not a professional environment.  At then end of open enrollment, the loaded us into a buss, drove us to a hotel conference room, and proceeded to announce the department was closing, and we were all laid off."
good,"I been working in this company for more than 2 years, in general is a stable place. Good for people close to retirement. If you want to improve your technical skills, better change. Growing here is hard, you provable move horizontally instead of going up. you can take extra courses or nano degrees, but they will prefeer somebody from outside with more experiences instead of you."
good,"The consistent organizational changes can make it difficult to gain the traction needed.  Encountered 5 major leadership changes in 2 years, resulted in frustration and low trust and inconsistent cultural values."
good,My typical day at work was to manage a team size of 15 to ensure the highest quality was provided to our member who haven't scheduled their call house wellness visit in the past year.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It is a decent place to work, hours are good, location is great. Raises are below cost of living no matter if you are a good or bad employee. you get 1.5 and less."
good,"It was great to be able to work this job from home, however the pay was not competitive. The job was very stressful most of the time. My co-workers were the positive on this job."
good,Even though I was hired as a remote worker and the director and several of her managers are remote workers the company is not allowing for positions to be filed with remote workers.
good,The benefits are bad and too much paper work. There is room for growth that is one thing i like about the company. They need to provide the nurses with support.
good,"Middle management needs better direction, on many issues in communications and leadership for global teams in the company.  Great team of people to work with, but poor direction communicated by middle management.  "
good,"I worked in IT and instead of creating a streamlined processes and ultimately better experience for customers, managers would rather  keep current inefficiencies because ""thats the way we've always done it"". Tons of similar data and engines that could be integrated but teams would rather preserve themselves than create a more efficient product. This is NOT how a healthcare company should opp  "
good,"Very high demand job, mandatory overtime during the month of January. Hours were not the best for me since call center is open 24/7. Very fast pace and a lot of information"
good,"If you have a family, they are not very flexible. It is hard to get days off. It is hard to get a good shift where you don't work until 8pm or later unless you've worked there for years on end. There are 2 or 3 good supervisors, but the bad ones make it not worth it at all."
good,"Reviewed and monitored opened orders. Updated members daily on current status. Provided technical support to physicians and members. Learned ServiceNow ticketing system. Hardest part was not being able schedule personal appointments without changing shifts with coworker. Being employed, the location and very clean office was the best part."
good,"The company would be a great company to work for, if they had competitive pay. I currently work for Carolina outreach LLC and make $5.00 more, as a salary worker with less stress and strain than at UHC."
good,"Fast paced, collaborative work environment with plenty of opportunities to sell your ideas. Management is supportive, and for compliance areas, failure is not an option."
good,"They track your every move, no promotion potential from within.  very low raises if any.  No room for any mistakes or you have to stay  with the same pay for the entire year and some people haven't had raises for years because production and quality is very strict.  Sometimes you feel like a number.  The place is so big each department has no clue what other departments do or how they operate."
good,"UHG HR recruiters lack insight , they prefer to go with outside candidates than promote from within"
good,"You would think working for an insurance company that you would receive excellent benefits at a good cost. This is not the case. I received better insurance at a lower cost at my last company. If you expect an annual raise of 3% if you meet expectations, think again. The average pay raise will be around 1.5%. "
good,come in set up computer and take calls all day long.  Follow a schedule all day long.  Management differs from department to department.  There are some managers that go out of their way for the peers under them and then there are other managers who will throw their peers under the bus and look out for themselves only.  Hardest part is being told one thing and then the complete opposite happens.  A person should never be told stuff about a job and then the complete opposite happen.  Makes a person hate their job and want to leave.  I have loved my job with the company.  Just recent activities have set me looking for better opportunities.
good,always on edge never know what is going to happen when they call you into a meeting . they give you a week to meet metrics no right they should not expect a new person right out of trainging of all whom had a new trainer to be 100% - especially when half the class of 16 was doing poor and only 5 were released to the floor and the rest remained in training till the day I was let go and some still are in trainging
good,United Health Group is an excellent company. They care about their employees. They uphold all policies and procedures as directed by guidelines. Lots of room for growth and improvement.
good,"The numbers are so important in many departments that the ""human"" aspect of health insurance is removed.  The thought of being on a warning is always in the background."
good,"I really enjoyed what I did as a PBM. I chose to separate from he company due to an integration and merge that was, in my opinion, not well planned. The rate of procedure changes was overwhelming to say the least and company went from being customer driven to numbers driven"
good,UnitedHealth Care is a huge company.  A great benefit of working for the company is that you are given work from home opportunities.  You get to work with very talented individuals.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I joined this company in 2015, very open minded and eager to contribute. I started in customer service as a CSR. Every quarter I was a top performer, which I felt really great about until I noticed that management wasn’t living up to the company performance values. People who worked half as hard as you earned promotions due to who they knew. Supervisors and managers had their favorites. Reporting unethical acts in the workplace is encouraged BUT nothing happens or changes. Expressing yourself during vital signs, was pointless. The work environment became unhealthy for me once management knew that I was unhappy.. it’s like things got worse. They totally ignored my performance and continued with their favoritism. "
good,"the pressure to be perfect was too high which caused increasing amounts of stress. always had the fear of my job being given to someone else in another country, forcing me to learn an entire new processing program from scratch. on the other hand my coworkers and immediate supervisors were wonderful to work with but the job overall was too stressful."
good,I was hired as a telephonic health coach. That department was eliminated and we were transitioned into telephonic triage RN's. We were given minimal training during this training.
good,"Open over 5 software systems and multitask during the calls, jump from one system to the other. Handle over 60 calls per day in and out bound. Timed during the calls and expected to finish in a few minutes providing accurate benefits and authorizations.Stressful inbound calls and no cooperation from care advocate staff during the warm transfer process."
good,"I enjoy working for UHC but it is very hard to move up in the company career wise unless you know someone that can help. Health benefits are not the best, they can do better"
good,"company is good to sustain but salary is not providing according to metro city,as office is situated far from house, "
good,"Honestly, I loved working at UHG until the last couple of years when it became clear that work/life balance wasn't something they supported, when it became clear they did not reward loyalty (saw too many good people escorted out due to politics)."
good,coworkers are not the most cooperative. the company does seem to care about the staff but the coworkers do not respect themselves or other and are always putting drama first
good,"Overall the company is a great company and has plenty of jobs to choose from.  Problem is that they'd rather hire externally than internally.  Management is also a joke and beyond horrible.  They usually bring people with HR issues over to a new department and think making them manager will fix their problems.  If manager positions could actually be given to people who have the skills needed, that would change the entire atmosphere there."
good,a typical day at UHC is checking your planner and emails. Attending meetings and webnars 2-3 days a week. The experience was fun and learning different things was more exciting
good,"I am constantly busy at work, which I like.  I split my day in two parts.   Mornings I process pharmacy claims. In the afternoon I work Correspondence to various departments.  It is fast paced & I have daily goals to meet in each area. Everyday is a learning experience and everyday  I come across something new.  We have had a large turn around in supervisors & in the 5 years that I have been there, our department has had 2 managers. Things change fast & rapidly & I have to be able to be flexible & adapt to the changes. United Health Care  is a very giving company, encouraging social responsibility to those less fortunate.   "
good,it was a good company and i learned quite a bit about technology and management approaches.  My previous manager (not my last one) wa very handsoff but appreciated the effort that i put in
good,Excelente empresa mais depois que foi vendida ficou muito difícil de trabalhar devido aos novos gerentes que assumiram.
good,"UnitedHealthCare, particularly Optum was a good chllenge to learning new technologies and however it is a fast pace chaotic environment. If you can handle that then it is a great place to be."
good,"constant change, raises typically less than 3%, high turn over rate. "
good,I worked as a vendor. It would of been really great to have worked directly with United Health Care. Working as a vendor you are never really secure with your position.
good,"Large corporation where the exact culture varies by specific office location, management and leadership style. Note there are several office locations across the twin cities area."
good,Nothing to say. We were hired as advocates. We are based on numbers not advocacy. Our management has not for one day ever done our jobs but yet tell us how to do our jobs based on the numbers they get.
good,"•	Proactively contact external resources as needed to address caller questions/issues (e.g., providers, labs, brokers)"
good,"This company has a big focus on performance management in all areas and has moved to a production based review in all areas, including back office work."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The job itself can be very difficult and high stress, however the major problem is caused by management. We are unfairly audited and expected to confirm to typical call center standards although this is not a typical call center role. I have never received a raise or bonus during my time with this company. There is a lack of support/sense of team spirit."
good,"The problem here is you are dealing with people, their health, and money.  Not a good mix.  Management is paranoid, and doesn't mind walking on people to succeed.  If you work here, proceed with caution."
good,Received calls from providers or brokers to verify claims.  I learned new software.  Management was supportive.  Workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was learning the various software and when to use them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know people in a new state.
good,The best part of the job is helping people .The downside of the job is not able to get time off when needed for medical appointments. I learned many aspects of United Healthcare on the business side. Sub management needs Improvement in assisting agents. Typical day at work answer anywhere from 50 to 100 calls per day trying to resolve callers  questions
good,"This job paid well, everything was done fairly, but not much mercy for when your life needs to take precedence.  Also HR issues were outsourced to another company, so understanding of real personal issues was non existent."
good,"Seasonal work opportunity, for agents, semi regular work for WorkForce and support teams.  Typical day, monitoring and optimization of center metrics, including real time, adherence and scheduling."
good,Very good company only if got onrolls of United Health Group that is Optum Technologies. contract basis not okay unless required a job on urgent basis. cabs facility- home pick up and home drop.
good,I think United Health Care is a great company to work for but the location that I was located in wasn't a great experience for me. The management wasn't professional nor trained.
good,"UHC is much more than a call center. The company has core values that we abide by to make the members experience one to remember. You receive one 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks while being a phone agent. Management is numbers driven, meaning you have to meet your metrics before even thinking about advancing to another position."
good,"Good opportunity for entry level. Classes were taught well and thorough on how to do the job correctly. A lot of changes made daily, unfortunately the program is no longer with Optum"
good,"You will find a few very good and kind hearted people working here. Unfortunately you will find more people that spread gossip, lie, are a little cold to people, and are not good coworkers. It makes the culture toxic and stressful. Management tries to help improve the culture, but what they do isn't close to enough and they tend to override any of the little good thing they do by making rules that make things more stressful, or not being fair in certain situations."
good,"Although the company professes an open door policy, it is debatable that it exists for all employees. If you follow the documented protocols and keep documentation on all things requested of you, you can do well and advance within the company.  There is room for advancement, the company is top heavy with management."
good,"My day usually started at 7:45. Shift began at 8. To start the day I would log in to computer and set up all of my systems(9). The main system held all member information and that is where our workflow come though. The atmosphere is generally laid back. Management was great, really cared about the success of their employees. Then hardest part of my job was trying to get other insurance carriers to give me information in order to coordinate their benefits; also it also hard to get members o call back after calling them to get benefit information. What I enjoyed most was that I got to help our members with their insurance in order to save them from getting caught with the unpaid medical bills"
good,"good company to correct your salary package"
good,"I believe they would be a good company to work for if you were employed by them.  If you are a consultant you always have an uneasy feeling.  I was in a division that our group was the first group and the education and knowledge of management with the people in the group was very similar.  We learned together, which is frustrating if you need an answer.  I did love the remote part and the pay was awesome."
good,My immediate team managers were responsive and open. Higher up management was not responsive to them regarding feedback for improvements in process and communication. Directives from upper management were always from top down with no lower management feedback considered.
good,"If you like constant change, change at UHC is constant; policies, job processes, formats for documenting can change weekly, sometimes daily. Management positions are few and difficult to get into."
good,"The job sounds simple at first  providing benefits information to members. However, you're basically the punching bags of uneducated rude and disrespectful customers from the Northeast."
good,Manager was aloof to what his assistants were not doing always made excuses for them. The assistants were not competent with the project at all. Need more direction.
good,United owns the company I work for. so United it sell is a great company but WellMed treats there employees terrible. The workplace used to be a fun and great but new management took over and drove the moral into the ground.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Big Fortune 500 populated with micro-manager, 80+ hour per week supervisors with no children or family responsibilities.  Lots of 10 to 12 hours days and office politics.  Would never work there again.  I sold all of my stock and would never consider them for health insurance again."
good,The quality in the management and upper management needs a significant amount of improvement. This review is based on the department (PRS-Optum) which is within United Health Group.
good,"I have nothing to say, I am able to feed and cloth my children from this job. By the grace of GOD.There is really nothing bad or good that I want to say."
good,"Company was just bought over, work load has changed with very little training. Promises from new company have not been carried out. Management is not available when needed."
good,My experience wasn't that bad. Technology wise they were better than most other companies I have worked for. They have remote access setup so if needed I could work from home. For the most part the management team were helpful but not when it came to advancement. Once you work collections it is extremely hard to move up. Plus other surrounding departments seem to always be negative about the work culture so coming to work wasn't always great.
good,Currently under new management  its hard to give a review  so far no feed back good or bad. more communication is needed for improved employee morale.
good,"Optum technology is the IT arm for the largest Healthcare business in USA. The IT landscape is quite diverse and the workforce is global. With that sense, its a really big organization to work with."
good,I truly did not appreciate management's antagonization of me.  I only want to go back to make a change.  They accuse and do not have any substance in their arguments.  I feel like I'm talking to eight year old children who love to deceive and impose their selfish will.
good,"A successful company struggling in IT with issues from expansion via acquisition. Considerable IT/Business rift in some areas.  Technologically significantly behind the times, yet working to improve."
good,A typical day at UHC is work your hardest and do your best. At some point they will tell you that you are still not doing enough even though you had very little training on what it is you are actually supposed to be doing. When you do need to ask a question then answer you get is when someone has time we will get to you.
good,I have been working with UHG (OGS now) for almost 5 years. I had a great time working here for initial 2 years but things have changed dramatically in last couple of years. I wouldn't say that the whole organisation has issue but there are some departments which surely needs modification.
good,"Please ask me if you have any questions. It would be easier to explain instead of typing everything."
good,"This place I had applied to became an opportunity to me Nov 2015. Initially it seemed like the ideal job but as I grew to know the place, their processes & how they treat their employees, it became a growing headache. The work was easy but the job was hard. You don't want to go to work everyday dreading the 8 hrs you once were very grateful for. That became my life until January."
good,"For over a year and one half, I worked up to and over 60 hours per week due to management promising clients access to my department when we did not have enough people staying in the department due to the work hours.  New hires were not informed of the overtime and quickly left after a 3 - 5 month training period. Supervisors were not helpful and updated training was not offered to seasoned ( over 1 year of employment) employees. "
good,UHC was a fast-growing company evolving from a local HMO to a national insurer.  Work life was fast paced and there was continual change.  This position allowed a tremendous amount of professional growth for me having evolved from secretarial to executive secretarial to supervisor to provider relations representative
good,"Probably the only place I wouldn't want to go back to. Pay is horrible but helping someone felt good. The only reason they got me to stay was for the medical benefits. It's alright if you're single. Horrible if you have dependents, coverage would be too expensive. The trainers are great and I bet the only reason why they are is to get the bonus at the end of training for how many people they can get onto the production floor. Management can be VERY petty..."
good,"As long as you can keep your head down and not expect too much, the work is fine. It's monotonous, but steady. The holiday season can be exceptionally busy, and mandatory overtime was standard a few times a year."
good,"Is easy to get lost in the large corporate office politics.  The lack of yearly review compensation makes it hard to gain any kind of ""real"" advancement in compensation."
good,"Great co-workers, like family. No rewards for dedicated staff going above and beyond. Mid Management's hands are tied."
good,I worked for 5 projects in UHG and it is good organization to learn new  technologies with minimal time. we enjoyed nice when go with team outings.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Everyday was very busy, which is good to learnning experiencie to interact whit diferent people everyday."
good,Bad communication regarding hiring status and inequitable evaluation of candidates. Not completely fair in evaluation of candidates
good,"Responsible for developing the provider network (physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, ancillary groups & facilities, etc.) yielding a geographically competitive, broad access, stable network that achieves objectives for unit cost performance and trend management, and produces an affordable and predictable product for customers and business partners"
good,"Loved the team of people that I supervised but the management team was green and lacked ability to properly assess and make decisions. "
good,Its a pharmaceutical company. Their only client is IBC. its an ok company to work for not many room for advancement. I rather not say anything else.
good,"I have learned a lot here and have enjoyed my eight plus years here, but I do feel it is time for change and look forward to moving onto another place where I can share my knowledge in Medicare and Quality Assurance skills"
good,United health states that you will receive full time(40 hours) but after the training class you are reduced to 20 hours or less.
good,Good benefits and pay. Nice Coworkers. Love talking to the members when they call in to the call center everyday. Management is not very respectful and it is not a family oriented company to work for. Management plays favorites but I loved the members.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management."
good,Afforded me the opportunity to experience telephonic case management and work from home and to obtain my CCM. Can be difficult for some reason in this culture to know who can be trusted.
good,"Not my cup of tea, they have a great mission statement and if they would only run the company with the core principles they post on every wall of the place it may be different"
good,"Fast paced environment working in a call center. As expected, too much politics on getting things accomplished especially when upper management is in another state and lacking knowledge when creating policy to the staff."
good,United Health Care is an ok organization to work for not many opportunies to advance. The start rate is not very competive.
good,The College of Insurance program is a great tool to get licensed and have an opportunity to work with an awesome client in Kaiser Permanente.
good,"Its good at times nothing i would expect"
good,management is not great and compensation is low for the amount of work you perform. However you will meet great people. Extremely fast pace environment.
good,"Worked remotely with offsite management as a front-line liaison and resource for members and providers. Ensure detailed and efficient processing of claims through detailed knowledge of insurance guidelines and policies (corporate and governmental).  Liaise with other departments to Investigate and correct discrepancies.  Maintain calm phone-demeanor in the face of member or provider frustration. Meet daily claims processing quotas. Serve as Home Customer First Representative (Home CFR), taking emails and phone questions from a roster of specific clients assigned to me."
good,Great company to grow in and move around with great benefits.  Management has great leadership and are open to discuss career paths and help you get to your career paths.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The management is not supportive. The job security is poor because if their are financial cutbacks due to contractual issues jobs are cut with minimal notice.
good,On the phone from time start to end of shift. Help member with there medical plans. there is very little interaction with coworker as worked from home
good,"A typical day at Work is to review and evaluate the charts and provide the appropriate Diagnosis codes. What I learned at UHG is being patient and having a good judgment."
good,The company is a pioneer in the healthcare arena with numerous awards to its credit. I have learned much in my tenure and hope to continue learning.
good,"fallow a script on phone with customers and Pharmacy. mandatory over time, schedule based off of performance.   Stay a part time employee for longer than agreed before becoming a full time employee."
good,Good company with opportunity for growth for health care professionals looking for entry level position work in Life Health Insurance.
good,If you have a great manager it won't be that bad.  They follow the VEPS management model and don't deviate from it.  There is a lot of room to grow but you need either an internal referral or they almost always hire managers externally.
good,"Case Manager for pediatrics to geriatrics. "
good,"Being here now. Working is about working, always be willing to research for help where ever you can and my team mates are who I  enjoyed."
good,"Call center enviornment,More concerned about making sales not about the individual,Micromanaged,Will make you work every holiday."
good,"Pay is low, benefits are mediocre, work atmosphere is alright. Any mistake can get you fired under company policy. Favoritism exists, but is most prevalent for long time employees. Older, tenured employees make multiple mistakes but never see corrective action."
good,A typical day at work consisted of being on the phone all day.  I learned a lot about billing and coding.  My co workers were awesome. There was nothing hard about my job.
good,"High Volume Workload"
good,There's always change with the company. It's constantly growing.
good,"A great learning experience.  This company provides the opportunuity to develop the necessary tools to move into leadership.  This is a fast-paced ever changing environment.  Flexibility will be key to any role at this company.  As with any call center, there is high turn-over.  This could work to one's advantage or disadvantage."
good,"Escort residents in single line fashion from dorm to school and back.  Monitor dorm area, no recreation area in dorms but they have a large gym and an out door pool.  Also, basketball courts and two large ponds to walk around."

good,"Management is disorganized with the many changes the company goes through at the Cypress Location.I loved working for the Irvine, Costa Mesa location of the Company. The Cypress, CA location still has a lot of PacifiCare management style which is not good."
good,"Take customer calls to assist the members with benefits, locating providers/specialists, locate facilities, answer general questions."
good,"Experienced and dedicated professional with over 20 years of experience in customer service. Demonstrated strong growth within our organization, including advancement from customer service representative to quality review specialist. Proven technical expertise with ability to creatively solve problems and develop advantageous organizational solutions. Exceptional quality, production, and product quantity standards. Serve as a leader and mentor to other employees while demonstrating a team-focus that illustrates cohesiveness."
good,"•	Receive inbound calls from participants with regards to Medicare Plan or other supplement Plans "
good,"Aprendi muito com a oportunidade de atendimento que obtive nessa empresa sobre planos de saúde,pois,pude ver com outra visão as informações e regras que esses planos tem.Também pude observar que cada gerencia/supervisão tem seu modo diferente de trabalhar,cada um também tem suas regras seus modo diferentes de pensar no bem de cada equipe,para que assim sejamos uma equipe melhor.Pude ter vários colegas de trabalho na qual pudemos compartilhar nossas duvidas e conhecimento.A parte mais dificil do trabalho é que você tem que identificar cada jeito do seu cliente,podendo analisar e atende-lo de forma digna e educada,cada um tem um jeito e você aprende a lidar com eles,porém não é uma parte difícil e sim de adaptação,e se adaptando com ele se torna um atendimento agradável e fácil,tornando o seu atendimento melhor e sem estresse no dia a dia."
good,one cannot sustain in this organization for more time. Management would not give importance to new joiners.
good,Average Healthcare filled will constant changes located north of Greensboro.  The commute was very long.  Some management is in need of skills while other is supported the entire team.
good,"Great place to work, but not alot of opportunities for advancement"
good,Good place to work although expectations are high and compensation does not show it. Departments are stretched thin. Lack of communication with upper management.
good,"Great pay for what you are doing, however the company doesn't take care of you and the management doesn't care about you. It is the typical ""bottom line; numbers"" kind of position. If you enjoy that type of office work, great, if not, it will be tough to work there for long."
good,"Initially, I worked in the office. The company provided continuous training for new upgrades and assistance learning how to navigate the various hospital facilities we worked with. The company was good at keeping team spirit up by providing things like free lunch friday, games and events geared to competitive productivity, opportunity to obtain sports tickets and providing events for golf and other activities. I learned important things regarding the healthcare industry.  The most difficult part of the job for me was keeping my productivity consistent. I was then able to apply for a telecommuting position with evening hours."
good,"•   Inbound call center providing customer service regarding dental benefits for various dental plans, ensuring a high level of customer service and maximizing productivity."
good,They portray it as a great company but once you get in the door it is a completely different show.  You are not allowed to go to the restroom when you need they give you a certain time frame through out the month.  If you are helping a member and you go over your break they will not let you adjust your break you just missed it then you are out of adherence and then in trouble.
good,Fun place to work but little to no room for advancement. You're also never sure of what you are doing from a day to day basis. One day they will have you on one line of business and halfway through the day put you on another line. Getting time off can be a nightmare and calling out for an emergency or illness three times in a year gets you a corrective action plan up to and including termination.
good,A typical day is answering calls from individuals 65 years of age or older to assist them in choosing a Prescription Drug Plan. You must speak clearly and be easy to understand. Management is full of nice people who want you to succeed. The hardest part is struggles in communication and relaying information in the best way possible. What's really enjoyable about this job is knowing your efforts have helped a person in need pay for their dire medications and to relieve them of the burden of highly expensive drugs.
good,"I learned how to work in a fast paced production driven environment. Also I gained extensive knowledge of state and federal compliance rules and guidelines. The hardest part of the job was not getting emotionally involved with the member's situations. This position required that I deal with people who were at difficult times in their lives(substance abuse, mental illness and children with disabilities) which required compassion and patience."
good,"Currently working as Assistant manager at United health group "

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Fast passed work enviroment,with policies a procedures changing daily. The job requires daily eligibility verification of members and schdueling services with providers. The hardestpartabout the job is knowing that a member needs a serivce that they are not eligible for.

good,"Bom lugar para se trabalhar, apesar da empresa apresentar dificuldade na relação entre as pessoas."
good,The job as a telecommuter allows a nurse to work from home but there are alot of job responsibilities
good,"We all had our shift bids so came in at different times during the morning, I worked 8 hours Monday to Friday. I would come in, log in, get in the que and wait for the calls to come in, when I wasn't on the phone I was training myself, reading, learning. My Supervisor on occasion would get with me to discuss my metrics whether or not I was meeting them that month, and we would figure out where I could improve. I learned that I do not prefere Call Center work as a job it does not suit my personality. The hardest part of the job was the metrics staying within their idea of a time for a call especially when we were also to provide the highest level of Provider Service. "
good,Gleaned additional management perspectives that can be referenced in my future career path.
good,I good place to learn customer service because of the constant coaching and training for the customer service dept.
good,"I will work there again.  If you like to learn new procedures and ways to manage your time, this can be a good company for you"
good,I answer 30+ incoming calls for MS and TN medical plans. The company offers Work At Home opportunities for employees who meet their metrics continuosly for 3+ months. You are fully vested within the company (401K) after a year of employment.
good,"Os dias tipicos de trabalho eram muito corridos e super exaustivos pois o quadro de funcionario nunca estava completo então trabalhava-mos por 2 ou 3 funcionarios.Tudo que aprendi a respeito de medicamentos e a importancia de um excelente atendimento devo a AMIL,sempre tive um otimo relacionamento com meus colegas de trabalho pois a todos os momentos trabalhava-mos em equipe.A parte mais dificil de trabalhar era a falta de materias ou medicamentos e claro o quadro de funcionario incompleto.A parte mais agradavel do trabalho era a sensação agradabilissima de saber que  havia chegado o medicamento  nas mãos dos paciente no horario designado"
good,"I log into my computer, check my emails , review my task list to see what I have to review, begin my review by reviewing clinicals, pull mbr up in C1, check eligibility, pull up TMPPM criteria, based on guidelines approve or send requested services to MD. If denied a letter will go out, if approved a phone call will be placed to provider notifying of approval. I constantly research and find ways to improve process and flow w/ co workers and manager"

good,A proposta de atendimento à pacientes enfermos em home care proporcionou a experiência inovadora de acompanhamento psicológico domiciliar aos clientes e seus familiares.
good,"A day at work consisted of taking about 100 calls from members/non-members looking for information on medical plans for the health coverage; we explained the medical plans we had available in their area. If they were interested and the plan had all the issues covered they were looking for, we enrolled them over the phone."
good,"Trabalha muito,aprendi a não confiar nem nos proprios colegas de trabalho....uns querendo pisar nos outros.A gerencia favorece uns e prejudica outros...formação de ""panelinha"".Escalas de trabalho puxadíssimas, tendo que trabalhar até 7 dias direto ...muitas vezes plantão dobrado porque nao contratam folguista.Médicos mal educados e grosseiros só porque são médicos acham que podem pisar nos outros que não são.Farmaceuticos jovens e inexperientes que não sabem lidar com situações conflitantes.Salario e Beneficios ótimos, mas não leva em consideração que o funcionario tambem tem uma vida fora do hospital."
good,"I speak with members, family members, pharmacist, doctors, social workers and lawyers regarding health and prescription plans.  I have a sense of satisfaction when I have helped someone with their problem and/or issue.  I have coworkers who I can reach out to for assistance when needed.  Since I work at home we communicate thru the company MOC Microsoft Office Communicator.  The hardest part of my job actually consist of a few issues, but the most urgent one is the time allotted to address the issue before I take another call.   It simply is not enough time to explain the many complex health and prescription plans.  Since these calls are for the most part seniors, many have a difficult time understanding how their plan works. "
good,"Job security and good working environment."
good,A lot of pressure to be fired and a lot of favoritism. There were good times there but mostly felt like rules were changing everyday and if you made a mistake you were gone.
good,A great company to work for with very generous benefits. I was lucky enough to work with a supportive staff and to support a group of people that are very detail oriented and self driven which made our days and work very sucessful.
good,My co-workers were willing to help when needed. Learned to load benefits.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"No início do dia, verificar e-mails e fazer contatos com os prestadores da Rede Credenciada."
good,Good Company as a brand name.
good,"Great company to work for great benefits, I enjoyed helping others my days went by fast. I learned a lot about insurance plans coverage and EOB. The hardest part was knowing the position was contracted not permanent."
good,"Overall, the experience with working in insurance was great. A typical day included sitting at the computer the entire day, while processing medical claims. I learned much relevant information about insurance. The most challenging part of the job was the required overtime. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
good,"United Health Care is a huge company that provides job security and competitive compensation. However, a lack of opportunity for advancement and employee health benefits have resulted in me desiring a different employer"
good,"I am a claims processor. The most enjoyable part of this job is it is very flexible. I can adjust my schedule whenever I need to accomodate other activities in my life. I can work any time of day or night. I even have the option to work from home when the weather is bad or if I have an emergency. My day involves reviewing claims at my desk all day. I take breaks and we have daily meetings, which break up my day. It is very repetitive which can make it difficult to remain focused. This is a production intensive and quality driven role. I am expected to processor a certain amount of claims every hour (usually about 20).My performance is measured and my job and compenstation are directly linked. Claims are audited and if an error is assigned, this negatively impacts my performance review. Consistently making errors can lead to corrective action and/or termination. This is definitely not an easy job!"
good,"Built trusted relationships with members across their health care lifecycle. Assisted in plan selection and enrollment, educating members about the management of their health and well being, helping members to maximize health plan benefits and personal health care dollars and owning customer service inquiries through to resolution."
good,I was let go along with 2 other of my co-workers and am currently looking for a position that will be stable so I can stay at this company. We were let go because the state of WI owes the a lot of money and the state did not renew their contract with UHC in the RFP area.
good,"In the three years that I've worked for United Healthcare, I've learned what it is to provide in the corporate culture dental assistance for multiple clients. I have leaned what the differences between HMO's and PPO's. How to read dental denials and procedure codes to dental offices. How to give a insurance breakdown to provider, and what it means to be out of network. I've leaned what it is to be a teammate and what it means to provide the best service you can to the member to reflect the client, and benefit the members.The most difficult part of the job would have to be when there's nothing else you can do for a member, when all avenues have been exhausted and they have to pay out of pocket for benefits they thought they had. The enjoyment you receive from helping a customer receive, and educating a member on how to maximize their benefits."
good,"I have had the opportunity to learn how different platforms of health insurance operate. United Healthcare carries private, medicare, and medicaid insurance coverage that spans over numerous states and is rapidly growing. The work environment is very flexible with opportunities to work from home. The people I have worked with are helpful and have years of health insurance experience. The only thing that could use a make over is the health insurance offered. The health insurance is not the best I have received from an employer and to work for an insurance company makes it pretty bad."
good,"Working hard with tough deadlines, the heavy load of job, ambiguous areas"
good,New department
good,A typical day at United Healthcare was to be sighed into your computer and phone at your expected start time to be available for the Customer. Each call I was responsible for answer all questions asked accuratly. Also responsible for accuratly documenting every question asked and ever answer givin.
good,"typical day, taking 70-110 calls, each unique."
good,Pretty good company to work for. I loved the benefits package
good,"ok experience, typical call center environment, little growth"
good,"This was a great place to work depending on the team and business manager you were assigned to. Not all the managers operated the same. Some ran their teams as a straight business, while others were more human in their approach. The salary was far from competitive considering the stress related to the position."
good,"I thought this was the perfect job for me, but I've come to find that I don't like being yelled at through the phone for things that are truly our of my control. I realized I wanted to go back to providing one on one personal hands-on care with humble people."
good,The company is fairly ok but employer should be more understanding of employees have lives outside of work and the way pto personnel time off and No sick days separate makes it very hard to enjoy yr pto days
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,poor management always trying to do more when that is not always possible.  They don't consider the employee point of view.  You can only do what they want their way.
good,"Great people not so much great pay.  Hours flexible, work at home opportunities.  Benefits are good and you have to start entry level to get in  but then difficult to move up quickly."
good,"Telecommuting allows great autonomy.  You are given the chance to use your professional experience to do your job.  Executive leadership is savvy, energetic and committed to their mission and goals.  Local leadership is less consistent, less clear with communication and more unpredictable.  However, job security is non-existent.  The most unlikely candidates get promoted and consistently productive and engaged employees are unceremoniously cut or pressured to resign.  I loved my work with UHC but - while it is rewarding and satisfying - the pressure to perform at an exceedingly high (and uncommunicated and obscure) level is intense.  I would not recommend working here unless you have a solid back-up plan."
good,"It depends on who your supervisor is, it can be an enjoyable job . Raises are not always a reflection of the work you put in but you will always get one. The Health insurance is too expensive , time off is plentiful if you can get it approved."
good,"Enjoyed what I was doing."
good,"I had a bad training instructor who wrote us up for everything so I had poor attendance even though I didn’t call in.  Late from breaks count as 1/2 a day and I had 4 before I knew this.  So no promotion until the 12 month rolling ends, I can get great stats otherwise but no bonus or move to a better position until those fall off.  It stinks when your customer ratings are 98 percent but I was late on breaks 11 months ago."
good,"Company offers good benefits and lots of flex ability.  Ability to work from home , offers healthy food and drinks . Emphasis on self care . "
good,Currently laying people off includes nurse practitioner under going changes. Outsourcing jobs to middle east.  Successful brand but always looking to save money. current environment metric driven.  Punitive threatening environment currently.  Was pleasant and supportive but huge change in direction in past year not for the better.
good,"Decent place to work, but you have to be your own advocate and change positions to advance.  Positions can be eliminated at anytime by someone who knows nothing about what you do."
good,Environment was pretty cool I guess good people pretty cool pay starting out I would have to agree and ok supervisors not worse workable with I’d say.
good,"My overall experience with United was good. I was lucky enough to report to a manager who was thorough and understanding. I learned a great deal under him and was grateful for the experience. Unfortunately, he decided to leave the company and ultimately I proceeded to follow suit a few months later so I could be closer to my family."
good,Overall UHG provides good work benefits to its employees.  There are opportunities for advancement.  UHG also encourages talent development for those employees interested in advancement.
good,"No work life balance. but secure interms of job. overall its good , you can get direct client interations which will help in your career growth as you are increasing in progress"
good,You would be getting a chance to learn the different aspects of Health care industry. Finance team is small if you want to get into the different fields will have limited choices
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Flexible schedule, allowed to work without being micromanaged but environment is messy and people gossip a lot. Raises are low and no career advancements but good PTO and paid holidays. Good work/life balance but will get written up for anything."
good,"You may be expected to work at night and weekends to complete your work. Management styles vary across lines of business, as does flexibility to work remotely."
good,"We were asked to commit 2hours of overtime work every day which really drained our body and mind. Hence, the pay is good and I had never experienced any delays."
good,"If you thrive in corporate America settings, this place is for you. It's a production machine.  You'll be held to metrics and deadlines, always.  Most facilities have a cafeteria.  They also offer a work from home option for most positions."
good,"I was just laid off so I am very dissapointed as I just spent the last 10months from the point of applying for the position in Jan. 2019 then got hired in Apr. 2019, then just finished training for my position and was about to be on my own to work from home and received a call from the director saying they are cutting position.  Sorry, they said."
good,"Good compensation package.  The culture is strong, and most organizations allow flexibility to live your life.  The flip side to that is that if you are salaried, you will be working about 60 hours per week. The culture, however, is not fully adopted across all organizations so your experience may vary from department to department."
good,"When I begin working for United Healthcare I absolutely loved it. I worked in the hospice division and we had a great team. It was stressful but rewarding. When Optum  purchased our hospice group things changed for the worse. They did not make any changes for two years but after they did customer service, patient care, and management all became poor. The let many long-term employees go and the ones that they did not fire eventually resigned because of new leadership. I would have recommended them in the beginning but not now that they are part of Optum."
good,"Working with UHC is a great way to get your carrier started. They are a great company to work for, offer a lot of benefits and work well with their employees."
good,"Most jobs are being outsourced to India or the Phillippines. Very hard to find work here in the United States, particularly in my area. Work was great here in the USA however"
good,"Being able to work remotely is a plus but schedule is not that flexible when you need an emergency time off. "
good,"I will not review any previous company, i liked working for them all and would still be at UHG had they not downsized me.  But I can neither praise or denegrate them"
good,"Due to a health issue I was out on short term disability and even though I wasn’t released to go back to work they pressured me including when I was still in the hospital, instead of reaching out to the doctors office they called me non stop . I left because I couldn’t take the stress when I could have legally stayed on short term disability"
good,It was always a night shift job catering to UnitedHealth insurance members from all over United States. Basically they would want you to know it all which I think will not happen since we are not robots to memorize everything from A-Z.
good,"Anyone that is salaried is required to work more that 40 hours a week."
good,"Job is very stressful. Not interested in commenting on this position. I worked there for 2 years and am no longer employed there. They seemed to have trouble retaining staff.Typical workday research close cases for members. search claims, contacts members."
good,"Individuals who have never done the job are setting the metrics and expect you to meet all goals when they are not reasonable with the actual work (handle time, after call work etc.) Raises are not aligned with performance nor do wages reflect cost of living increases."
good,"UHG likes to pretend they have a culture, as they call it, the  ""5 Core Values."""
good,"Typical call center environment  if you're in the restroom for more then 5 minutes outside of your regular break your supervisor is notified. No sick leave, if you are ill and call in you get an automatic occurrence and they stay on your record for a full year. Scheduling time off is almost impossible. Benefits for working at an insurance company are surprisingly lack luster. High deductible plans where even an office visit goes towards a deductible instead of just having a flat copayment. The facility is nice with a cafeteria and the people that work there are easy to get along with."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Do not want to comment as I worked there for a very short period of time. Too short of a time span to make a fair assessment of the company.  So it is unfair to provide a review.
good,I made many great working relationships while I was employed there. I enjoyed all of the people I encountered and made lifelong friends. I would work there again as I left on great terms.
good,"Decent bonus potential. Quality grading needs to be "
good,The pay was not enough for the requirements that we had to perform. They wanted us to complete so many call within an hour. They trainning was not details enough to learn how to perfom the job
good,"The billing customer service role is an ideal entry level job that is a good introduction to the workforce The work is oftentimes repetitive, and after the first year you are really looking to expand your horizons"
good,I enjoyed at work place in my company. I got very gud support from my team. I am very thankful to my company.  Every one in the team helped me in work. Management also so supportive.
good,Management isn't always fair. It's all about who likes you and who doesn't. It's possible that you will work in a great area with great people and it's also possible you will not like the people you work with AT ALL.
good,"Case Management offered to members - including assessment, member focused concerns, education, coordination of services, assistance with health as well as insurance claims issues.  Workplace culture is very strict time oversight, metrics valued more than quality of work delivered.  Working with the members could be very rewarding, knowing you are assisting them to have, or to reach their health potential.  To do your best work, to truly case manage - you will most likely not reach the highest of metrics so your end of year evaluation scores will not reflect all that you have actually done."
good,"overall an ok place to work. It's subjective by division. Some are great, some not so much at all. Good work life balance ie: work from home. Decent benefits with excellent ESOP for ownership of shares."
good,"Working at United Health Care was an amazing Opportunity but management lacks compassion. Management does not care about the employees they just want the job done, no matter what the situation. If it had better management it would be a great place to work."
good,"We have rules in place for our work from home, but we can't change things when life gets in the way.  However, seems managers can change their schedule anytime, but we as ""peons"" can't.  Just not a really fair place to work."
good,I've gotten all the experience needed for all the positions I've held at the Lake but sometimes it became overwhelming by balance with everyday life. Sometimes the capacity of the load of patients will become overwhelming for some.
good,This place will drain you dry if you let it they care nothing about you as an employee they only pretend to very well. And everything is extremely unorganized and it starts in training and never ends! Many people stay only for the pay!
good,"Atendimento a clientes do plano Amil. Alto volume de ligações. Ótima supervisão mas pouca possibilidade de crescimento,"
good,I enjoy working for for UHC but it is very hard to get promoted most of the time you have to post out to another higher paying position with in the company and most of the time that position is already spoken for before the position is even posted. The pay is just enough to make ends meet.
good,"Based on all of the ""hype"" of working there, the only thing I liked was the people and the pay. you were never treated like an actual human being with a life outside of work and you were definitely not fully informed about major issues until it was too late to do anything about it."
good,I am so ready to ready leave that as soon as someone calls. I am gone sad to say because I really like my co-workers. I enjoy the flexible scheduling.
good,The management is poorly structured. The advancement opportunities are non existant. The transparency is non existant. The bonuses are based on department and most are way to low.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It was ok while I was there until I found out that I was getting paid a dollar less an hour than the lady next to me, even though I was better at it than she was. The manager was tolerable, I was able to listen to audio books while I worked so that was good. The main issue was the other people I worked with. No one could just do their job and leave it at that. They had to talk bad about everyone, even if that person did nothing to them."
good,"Fast paced, more stressful than not, micro management, unrealistic expectations regarding completion of tasks, enjoy working with the people, like the work hours."
good,"Descent place to work but sometimes customer focus gets lost in position justifications, meaning that providing quality customer service is more of a slogan than a reality"
good,United health care showed me a lot about health insurance and what kind of benefits you exactly have .. What’s paid for and what’s not paid for under your insurance
good,Productive work environment in the presence of your home.  Adequate equipment to complete job.  Supportive team for questions and answer. Frequent contact with managment and other support liasons.
good,As an analyst a typical day at work consisted of solving business and technical problems.  There was sufficient support within the company for you to be successful  at what you were doing.
good,"Employed as case manager for a year with UHC. Too much to do, not enough hours in the day to finish. Too many case managers donating their time to finish up tasks into the early evening. If you do not, you won't get finished. UHC keeps you even busier with mandatory trainings which may or may not have anything to do with your position. Constant changes with job tasks and systems were difficult to keep up on due to the fact you have monthly deadlines and high caseload.  High turnover rate with case managers due to this fact resulting in hiring workers with little or no experience in this area of Medicaid. Meaning-frustrated new employees calling experienced CMs to ask for help, taking more time out of your day. Tech problems are a constant which only took more vauable time out of your day.  During my employment, I had 4 changes in managers. Upper Management is positive but clueless about how stressful the position really is. Management is top heavy with special project groups, trainers or authorizers who could easily have taken 5 to 10 cases to make case loads lighter.  This position by far is the most stressful one I've ever had. They say they are open to criticism within the company, but I never did receive an exit interview.  The pay is great but my health and personal life suffered while working there."
good,"Productive, challenging,fun , friendly environmental, , security and management should  be improved and must be taken seriously in this company not that satisfied on these areas."
good,Fast paced call center. High call volume especially at the beginning of the year. There is mandatory OT and no vacations in the month of  January. Very laid back work environment but can be stressful meeting numbers. Would work there again and recommend as employment. Benefits are good and will work with employees.
good,"Manager was unwilling to help. Used former team member to Qa a team member who needed extra help ending in her dismissal. "
good,"You work as a team and build long lasting relationships.  If you want to move forward do your job, keep out of in office mess, and you will be rewarded."
good,"I thought I was getting good training since they put you in training for near 4 months. After 3/4 of the training was done they then tell you that what they trained you on is not what you will be doing for your job and to forget it. They then trained us for our actual job duties for the small remainder of training time available and even released us to the floor early. They spent a month of the training going over the company values , it could have been covered in a day."
good,"While working at UnitedHealth Group for 11 plus years, it was the most difficult position(s) I have ever had, but at the same time, they were the most rewarding."
good,A typical day at work involves lots of people telling you 10 different things about what it is you need to do. I learned to keep my composure and to pay attention to what I was doing.
good,C3 and TTEC could use better management. Some of the managers aren't that bad but they could use better managers. They also giver better pay. Nicer people
good,"UHC is a huge company, so there are opportunities for lateral and upward moves. However, there seems to be someone who is pre-destined for a certain position, and UHC only goes through the motions of interviewing other candidates to say they went through the proper channels for their hiring process."
good,United health a great l place to grow. Offered telecommute position which eliminated travel but increased the chanllenge of work life balance with task increasing exceeding the ability to complete the job in 8.5 hours.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I felt like if you didn't my supervisor favoritism then you didn't go further with the company.  I am not a racist person, however, many of us noticed that if you were not the same race as our supervisor or same age group, you were forgotten about.  When job cuts happened 4 ladies of my age range and race were let go from the company.  We put in for job changes and were told no."
good,Management will overlook your experience and years of professionalism you have just to rank you according to your acceptance with peers.  You can be there every day and still come up short not because of your effort but because of your acceptance among peers that judge you according to there opinion of you; not based on your efforts or experience and meeting there expectations. They create reasons not to give you quarterly bonuses as stipulated upon your employment there. This is on top of not paying you according to your experience.
good,"Besides the pay and benefits, job security was my only gripe. Unfortunately UHG have little respect for one's tenure or skillset. It seems to be all about saving and making profit (at the expense of its own employees.)."
good,"It was okay nothing more nothing less, I don't really feel like listing one hundred reasons why this company was less than optimal to work for but the thing was they paid well so it doesn't much matter."
good,I worked with a great DBA team and everyone would work together to accomplish the companies goals. The communication from management was a little weak.
good,"Strong team oriented, strong values, and is very dedicated to the communities that we serve. Company is environmentally friendly and focused on improving our communities."
good,Have to know somebody to advance and work the people around. And have to come in with good vibes or else it will be held against you if you don't. Very stressful if you are working on the phones. members can be very nasty.
good,"Sobre carga de atividades, porém, ainda sim esta em alta comparada a outros telemarketing."
good,I needed mt job and when I had some personal issue to come up in my life I told them about them. they in turned terminated our relationship after working there 1 year 10 months. I thought I would get support but i got the boot. It's ok life went on...
good,United had a great work life balance. Some of the management team were unprofessional. I felt like I was working with a whole bunch of kids from highschool. No one took anything serious on my team.
good,"I have been with United since 2015, but was part of a merger. The insurance is amazing, I am able to work remotely, I have the ability to make my own decisions and schedules. Overall I am satisfied with the company, yet they lack the drive to promote within and pay a competitive salary to their log time employees."
good,"Opportunities for learning is great, you get to learn a lot of things in the beginning but it dies out very quickly. You constantly learn about the industry, however. Although it depends on your team, its an okay place to work. Not great if you're shooting for the stars but a good place to start working. The worst thing about working here is you're constantly pestered about things that are not nitpicking perfect, but you aren't complimented on good work. You don't feel very important and you'll always be in question whether your performance is good or not. Most enjoyable part of the job is having good co-workers if you manage to get a good team."
good,"they paid well, the schedual was flexible, plenty of PTO and vacation time offered.  You'd think an insurance company would offer it's employees better benefits, but this wasn't the case.  weekends off."
good,"At United Healthcare i assisted providers with benefit coordination questions, medical claims, prior authorizations and eligibility. I worked from home and it was inbound calls only."
good,"My job had flexibility for me to work from home some days, which was a huge plus because I live an hour from my office. The people I worked with were fun and smart."
good,The upper management in this company has lots of problems and has changed several times in the 2 years I've been here. I feel like I have been treated in such a way that I have lost most of my confidence since I've been here. I need to leave and get my confidence built back up.
good,"Need to focus on employee satisfaction along with customer satisfaction as both work hand in hand. Also, current management need to be unbiased in terms of promotions and appraisal."
good,"high call volume, lots of overtime, paid training, friendly staff, lots of pto accrual. Basically, they'll train you through all of the basics but any shift the carries through after 5 to 6 pm, good luck to you."
good,"Primary focus of IT is delivery of IT business solutions driven by short sided business programs in very complex infrastructure and stove-piped business organizations, all competing for limited funding.  Little IT governance support provided to manage an effective Enterprise Architecture organization."
good,"UMR is a division of UHC. It was a high stress job, dealing with people's money, health, and families. I would only recommend this employer to those who have a good handle on stress and work/life balance."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Being that the core business is Health Insurance, the organization is a bit risk averse and does not invest heavily in modern technologies, so the tech stack is pretty standard."
good,"Its quite a decent place and a great culture promoted internally... but the leadership's focus on maintaining Wall Street Approved growth rate has led two inhumane things:"
good,"United Health Group is a excellent company as a whole, but unfortunately the management I am currently under prevents me from enjoying my position. The position is easy and very informative. I had a minimal experience in the medical field, but working UHC/UHG I have learned so much. The role I have I do have to be knowledgeable of all departments. Which is great which sets me up to be able to move around once I can. Which I am looking forward to because my SUPERVISOR IS HORRIBLE!!! With that being said please always keep in mind that your current leadership is not a representation of the company itself, just one bad seed."
good,Working for UHC was very accomodating to the schedule that I needed and preferred. I was able to learn a skill set that I had never learned before which was Vision and all that goes into making eyeglasses. During my tenure at UHC I was able to be apart of rewriting policies and procedures for handling different types of calls.
good,"UHC sets up unrealistic metrics that most employees can never meet.  The next step is to put employees on a corrective action plan where they are not eligible for advancement, bonuses and raises.  It's actually brilliant; they either keep employees at their lowest potential or fire them and keep the upper management fat.  Disgusting morals and work ethics."
good,was employed there a long time ago and don't quite remember the details of this employer. They had a typical benefits pckg. I was not able to bypass this review.
good,"This organization seems to be in a constant state or reorganization.  The people I have worked with are great; however, it seems the only way to get ahead is to leave. People coming into new to the company are getting paid higher than employees who are already there and have more experience."
good,"would not recommend for anyone who is looking to build a career however the pay is reasonable , I worked there for 2 years however the space for advancement is not there"
good,"UnitedHealth Group was going through growing pains when I was there including a new GM brought in from another state. Lots of change, tension within the offices, etc."
good,"Overworked underpaid"
good,I was able to do what I love which is to show compassion to members and educate them on the importance of going to the doctors office on a regular basis.
good,"I really loved working for UHG from a Cultural perspective, so much so that I became an Employee Cultural Ambassador volunteer to encourage and collaborate with my peers to ensure employee participation in driving excellence and being respectful of each persons contribution."
good,"United Healthcare Medicare and Retirement supervisor's are the worst I've ever experienced in over 20 years in Corporate America.  The majority of the supervisor's are micro managers, they don't think so."
good,I am choosing to leave the company.  I am unable to work the required schedule that was provided.  I am relocating and need to find something closer to home.
good,"United had good benefits, good hours, decent pay, but they were not at all accommodating when it came to systems issues that were out of our control as processors. It was made even more difficult if you got a supervisor that refused to help you."
good,"The position was good, but the pay could have been better though. Customers called and complained about the company's unwillingness to pay certain benefits."
good,"This company is good to  work for throughout the open enrollment season,but after there are guaranteed job placements that give employees a sense of security."
good,"•	Responsible for pulling daily work from data base."
good,"Co-workers made job enjoyable as well as having the ability to listen to music. Very strict work environment focused on producing numbers, with little to no variation or different work assignments/cross-training. The company did have a gym facility and a Cafe which was nice. A good company to hammer overtime and make some money for a year or so but would not utilize long term or develop into a career."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Empresa agradável com um projeto a ser implementado como o de plano de carreira
good,"Ok place to work, you'll have to be proactive in your learning - everything is not up to par and definitely can be better. Management need to be trained."
good,"It is a fine place to work"
good,"A empresa não está com um plano de estratégia com seus funcionários, porém não há estabilidades. Vários cortes estão acontecendo todos os meses."
good,When I started there no one knew what they were doing. Only had a 30 minute lunch and was not paid for. Not enough time between calls to be able to write everything down.
good,Solid company and good place to work. Had a great team and everyone was very helpful. Diversity was important in this company and opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"I love United Healthcare as an employer, but the pay is not competitive with the cost of living in Miami, Fl. They give a lot of work to people overseas and that causes us here to lose the chance of overtime and other positions"
good,United health is a good place to work. It has a friendly atmosphere with a variety of employee activities. It is however not easy to advance and they are not consistent in the advancement process
good,"Optum is a place to hide and collect a paycheck for 30 years.  If you have ambition, look elsewhere.  Leadership does not have the courage to do what is necessary."
good,"The mission and the vision of the company is something I believe in. The company as a whole is so big, and there are so many different departments, and divisions, which leads to a lot of silos. Within those silos, the core values of the company are consistently exhibited. The integrity is questionable. No transparency from leadership. Little accountability is displayed. As a Cultural Ambassador, I dedicated my work to helping to create the culture that has been envisioned. I did get an opportunity to develop into a leader, which is invaluable. At the leadership level is where I began to have a different vantage point into how the department operated.I believe that with MAP (Maximizing Accountability and Performance) goals, it should be the mission of leadership to hold those that report to them responsible for accomplishing the individual, department, and corporate goals.To not get the proper support from direct leadership combined with previous experiences within the department, it was clear that the culture of the department lacked leadership that knew how to effectively hold people accountable through coaching and feedback. The integrity of the department was questionable as well. How promotions were given was done in poor taste. I believe that departments outside of this have to operate better. Unfortunately the  previous department is still a reflection of the company, thus it impacts the ratings on this survey. Overall the company has a plethora of resources and benefits available for someone who is interested in bettering themselves financially, health-wise, career-wise"
good,"This is a CSA job. A term most used for this position is a boiler room call center. You take calls from Doctors off. and patience nationwide for specialty medications. This is and entry level position with high turnover. Fast passed, stressful and must preform to meet quality and number of calls. The software used is dated and cumbersome to use. There are many holes in the system process to completion. Good days and bad."
good,Overall good company to work for. Must be a fast learner and be comfortable working alone. Must be computer savvy and stay up on the company policies due to constant changes.
good,"A typical day at work is being on the phone with the insurance companies 24/7 and trying to figure out what to do with the claims due to scrambled up notes."
good,the company has a slow software to pull information from. then they want you to type a number of prescriptions in a certain amount of time. if we had a better software to pull from it would be much more efficient
good,Unable to complete work in 40 hours;  physically impossible. Managers were pressured so they put pressure on staff.  Driving in 2 large counties with significant case load.  At the end I was covering 4 counties.  Everyone was so stressed; many of my colleagues also gave notice around the same time I did.  Their demands were too great.  One positive thing I can say is I learned quite a bit in this environment - but it was not sustainable.
good,Did not have a great experience here. Worked as a consultant for a low hourly wage with promise of permanent position. As role came to a close I applied for full time position that I did not get.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,My leadership team was awesome in allowing me to learn new things and take on additional responsibilities.  My direct boss (director level) was open and easy to talk to.
good,they dont care about your life outside of work. they want you to work horrible hours for the rest of your life without competitive compensation for all the extra work you do
good,Poor staff treatment. Poor benefits. Micro-managing. Management training needed. Standard operating procedures need to be consistent. performance goals are not attainable.
good,"BUT they have become to big- they are the ""monster"" of healthcare insurers and as a result, have lost sight of the members and providers.  Leadership has also deteriorated; becoming ineffective, hands-off and all about getting it done as quickly as possible.  Sadly, the days of thoughtful, hands-on management wanting to really move the needle are long gone...."
good,"There really is no room for advancement. The host career fairs to which none of the other departments are hiring so it's really a waste of time. When you apply within, it's still hard to get an opportunity to interview with another department. The have an on again, off again mentoring program that really has no use as they rarely let you off the phone to get the mentoring you need to move forward in your career. You just seem to be stagnant in your position and there is no one making a change towards making this part better."
good,"great company to work for."
good,"At the end of the day, UHC cares about itself, even though it pushes culture, it lays off good people and has leaders that only care to advance over others. Its employee health insurance is awful."
good,"Coworkers make it worth going to work.  The job is fast paced, high case loads, with more work piled on.  Frequently understaffed.  Multiple learning experiences/trainings available as needed."
good,"Supportive coworkers, extremely high case loads with more work piled on, constant changes, fast paced, a lot of process support, not enough help with high case loads."
good,"Enjoyed working with supportive and diversified fellow employees (on-site, remote, and off-shore).  Health benefits for employees were not the greatest."
good,Yours hours are not set...the pay is low ...Loved my trainer ..are was nice ..the pay was the reason why i left..need more for my cost of living.. if the pay and hours were good i would have stayed
good,"Cons) I wish United Health Care pulled good contract employees into there permanent jobs postings."
good,"Would encourage people to apply and work in a health industry. A typical day at work would be answering incoming calls nonstop. Solve insurance benefit questions regarding their health plans. Inform,customers of what they want and need to know. If it's either of their copay amount, deductibles, health insurance co-pays."
good,"I enjoyed the job itself and working with customers, however when you have children with health problems they were not willing to help accommodate with fmla and caused those reasons to avoid giving a raise"
good,"heavy volume call center, automated dialer work, fast paced, handling  back to back calls, metrics to meet at a high rate, little flexibility. Overall it was ok."
good,"My typical current day of work is to care for chronic patients and improve their quality of life. My days are always very full, run and with many tasks to be completed on the same day. The most difficult part is managing conflicts between co-workers and to invest in an institutional culture of involving everyone to the importance of patient quality and safety. The most pleasant moment is to receive a word of thanks from the patients."
good,"1.  Most supervisors and managers are great to work for."
good,Visiting nursing homes on a daily basis and seeing the residents being neglected by their families is sad and depressing to see. I wasn't told about this when I applied for the position.
good,***Great if you want to telecommute. 
good,"I worked for Medsynergies for 9 years, and in the beginning it was an awesome place to work for and an enjoyable place to go, but things began to change,  however it was poor communication and inconsistency.    There was a lot of work for less pay.   Management wasn't always true about information but we got through it.  The company has now been sold and no longer exist."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Optumcare is too unorganized and too poorly managed to keep employees with years of experience. With the constant change in management there is too much confusion and too many factors that were missed or overlooked.
good,"Not a very healthy enviorment. You can advance but it is by who you know not what you know. Very sad, after 11 years of employment and additional education I chose to leave for career advancements. I would not recommend this employer."
good,The job seemed to have a lot of contract work but no permanent positions. The job was always being threatened by downsizing. There was always a shift bid every few months for a new schedule.
good,It could have been a great job but my time was cut short due to an administrative error on their behalf  also kinda clique-ish. If you don’t know the right ppl you will be pushed out
good,United healthcare is a very stressful place to work. We are always short staffed and we still have to meet our metrics. There is no teamwork on the team that I work. I love my manager but she can only do so much.
good,"I worked in United Health Group for seventeen months and overall i liked about the company is the salary they pay to Physiotherapists working as a clinical investigator, which is almost double the amount compared to working as a Physiotherapist in any corporate hospitals. "
good,"It is a fast paced, competitive environment. Pay is pretty decent, but with the bonus structure, it can increase. There are days were sales mattered the most and if the minimum was not met, you could find yourself on thin ice with management."
good,"Although the pay is low, and the requirements are high, its a pretty decent job for the area. "
good,"There is no appreciation for workers unless you are a great salesperson. Even if not licensed in the states that calls are received from, failure to enroll customer counts against you. The call filters are not up to par."
good,"Company has very strong set culture values. Innovation, Integrity, Performance, Compassion & Relationships. Learned to have compassion for certain customers."
good,"Must be able to communicate and multi-task by using multiple systems. The Customer Service Representative assists  potential providers by answering claims, benefit and notification questions."
good,I would get to work and get into the queues to see how much work there was. While training I would get the training room set up and get the materials created and printed for the trainees.
good,A good place to work if you are family oriented but constant change at top level management makes employees uncomfortable and uncertain which affects production.
good,"A typical day at United Health Group involved focus on productivity and accuracy. The workplace culture was competitive, however the company was very involved in community activities."
good,"Your a health insurance company, insurance companies only make money if they take in more than they pay out. If you pay claims for said insurance company you feel like the devil delving into the details for a reason not to pay."
good,It is a good company to work for and they have good benefits. The pay was average. It was a very diverse company.  I feel like it is a good company to work for and grow with.
good,Life is grand if you stay in your own lane! I will say that what supervisor you get can make or break you. However it still goes back to minding your own bees wax. The employees have a real problem with this here and it makes it hard for everyone!
good,"Can be stressful at times, very detail oriented.  The people are fun and direct managers seem to want to make things easier. There doesn't seem to be an even balance between work/home life."
good,One gets to learn different aspects of health domain. It is one of the biggest health insurance companies in the world. It feels nice to part of this organization.
good,"I have enjoyed the years working here, however, certain parts of the company are bias and they single out teams and departments in regards to disciplinary actions. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Working here was fun and educational, however, almost everyone there is contract and getting hired permanently is slim. You are definitely a number when you work here."
good,UHG provided equipment including monitors and an RSA token. I was introduced to using dual monitors and the snipping tool. The $35/hour salary was fair.
good,"Here job makes you lazy in life, if you start you career with optum you will become very lazy. If you have a goal/dream in your life dont start your career with uhg, If you dont have any goals in your life then this is the superb company."
good,I've been employed with United Health care for over 15 year's and I've learned a lot and its has been a journey I've been there through four name changes and an management has changed it has been great and also. Challenging and rewarding as we'll. And now it's time for a new adventure and career change.
good,The company never kept customer service up to date on protocal on processes on who what taking care of what type of callers. Management didnt even know how to take care of all types of consumers
good,"United Healthcare is a good place to work because of the salary and benefits.  The company is progressive in the healthcare and medical IT industry.  The company is a world wide based organization and provides many opportunities for advancement."
good,"It's a nice place to work but I feel my position is not paid for what we are worth. For the calls that we deal with and the pushback from some members not wanting to provide info and the escalated calls, we should be getting paid more."
good,Working for United Healthcare is good and ideal for people with flexible schedule who can work overtime and Holidays who like a faced paced call center environment who can work with little to no supervision.
good,Working in the telecommunications industry was a good experience. I was trained for the job prior to being put on the main production floor. Was given tools to help preform the job properly. The hardest part of the job was to deal with a customer who did not feel they had gotten what they signed up for when purchasing health care. The best part of my job was the people I got to work with on a daily basis.
good,"Leadership was disrespectful, more focused on MBOs than the employees. In order to get good work done you need to care about your employees first and foremost. "
good,"Great agency and there is a lot of room for growth and promotion, detailed training and very hands on. There is always someone there that can help you."
good,Management changed frequently. Recent acquisition caused me to leave due to job was no longer available/needed. Learned a lot and environment was laid back .
good,"Great people to work with. "
good,The initial training was done well.  Once on the floor it was a bit hard but the floor managers were very helpful.  Lunches were given on time and the floor was friendly.   The schedules changed to having night shift and late evenings.  I was hired for mornings and was never told that shifted could changed.  That made it difficult and stressful not knowing what shift you would receive.  I enjoyed talking to all the nurses and doctors and helping clients.
good,my experience with UHG was a different experience that taught me some thing that has helped in my career in the Healthcare Industry. Learned more about the claims process.
good,UHC is a good place to work for. The workplace culture is very stressful and requires more interaction activities. The management I worked under need further training  on understanding different types of employees to help them grow.
good,This is an organization that uses all the recommended words about human beings because like other large organizations they have hired teams with the responsibility of coming up with the right words. In reality they are a profit driven company and operate at a national level. Individual employees and local regional consumers are simply data points. Salaries increase well below the cost of living so it becomes necessary to obtain promotions and increase one's paygrade in order to increase one's salary. Otherwise the accepted strategy is to leave the organization and return at a later time.
good,Work overall is good - there is lots of opportunity to learn but you have to be proactive because management is located around the world -------------
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"United health care as a company is a thriving business. I was initially excited to work with the company and try a new experience. My position i was a community health worker, as a telecommuter. I worked from my home office, and in the field making home and facility visits to high risk members. The job requirements seemed to be constantly changing. The position itself was a social services type of job, but it is ran by a business minded administration, causing a rift in the ability to meet numbers and provider quality care to members."
good,"At UHG, as with many other companies, your manager and your manager's manager can really make or break your experience. I have worked in the same department under two different managers and my experience has been completely different for both.  It is imperative to ask questions of your future boss to ensure that you two get along and have work ethic that will fit your needs."
good,Pressure to get assignments done quickly and accurately.  Reviews done based on comparison with other people doing similar tasks rather than fulfillment of job requirements.
good,"Not really a bad place to work, but atmosphere is not ok. Also, the superiors seem to look down on employees, its almost insulting. I did have a great supervisor but I noticed others who weren't so fair."
good,"Ok place to work, large company, departments did not know what the other was doing, relied on management to keep each department updated in a timely manner"
good,This company started off as an amazing place to work in terms of learning new technologies. As time went on I received more and more responsibilities which was great. I was learning more than I even dreamed of learning and I picked things up so quickly. As the workload increased I even had people reporting to me on different projects. The only problem I had with the company was that I was continuously given more and more responsibilities but my compensation did not reflect what I was doing. Upper management recognized the extra work that I was doing but still did not seem to care about giving me the proper compensation to match the work that I was doing.
good,I had to leave due to the outsourcing American jobs to India and leaving the American workers to fight for the entry jobs that were left. Management was subpar and unknowledgeable which had the company instituting mandatory overtime which included Sundays.
good,UHG is a relaxed environment with innovative projects continually being started. The culture is comfortable and encourages new ideas. There are some very creative minds at this company.
good,"Working at UHC has been a great experience for me.  A typical day is never the same from day to day as a Care Coordinator.  The workplace culture is great and can provide a backbone to a person's work.  I have learned about the MCO world, more about insurance especially Medicare and Medicaid including what is covered and what isn't.  The most enjoyable part of my job has been working with the members and helping them get through tough times along with assisting them to find providers that are competent and willing to work with the members as a ""team""."
good,"Overall, okay organization. With luck, one can work with the multitude of good teams. Has the challenges of working for a multi-national organization. Has the opportunities of working for a multi-national organization...to have various technology resources available."
good,"The job responsibilities and expectations are clearly defined for claims analysts.  A typical workday is very predictable and repetitive.  Some people enjoy the stability of the work, even for somewhat meager wages.  The opportunities for career advancement are less than ideal for a company of UHG's size.  My coworkers are very nice and hard-working."
good,"very high pacing and stressful environment with very short notice deadlines and change of plans, understuffed, too many changes at once and there is no consideration on how employees will handle it."
good,"under staffed, calls were reaching 40-50 per day staff was quitting regularly over worked. paid time off had to be scheduled if you called in sick was considered an occurrence and went against you even if you had sick days."
good,I  worked at UnitedHealthcare full-time (More than 3 years)productive and a fun workplace. Also co workers are helpful pto is great and paid holidays are great too.
good,Daily speaking with customers or members to assist with questions and concerns with plan.  Phone calls and doing some data entry work    spreadsheet building.
good,"My day consisted of seeing 4-5 members with multiple disease problems in their home for history and physical exams. "
good,"I have worked fur the company for 5 years we have gone through 3 acquisitions this far leaving many people without jobs.   This company focus on health care and I supported onboarding over 2000 employees during ramp time, working with HR, Talent acquisition,  WF staffing team And the operations team along with partnering with the training department to ensure the employees profiles are set correctly and receive the proper client system access required.  Also work with HR and operations to terminate the access as employees separate from the company."
good,"Just another ordinary company. I stayed almost a year and a half however they do not strive you to the great things, a company should push you to do greater and not just go to work because of the money"
good,"Worked there for 3 years and was constantly lied to schedules, compensation, and bonus structure.  Management is hard to work with being that they are located remotely in Tennessee"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I was not very happy with this company. At the time I was hired I was 7 months pregnant and was led to believe that if my stats were above average I was have the opportunity to work from home.  After returning from maternity leave I was not thoroughly trained on the changes that occurred during my time of absents and the company was not very supportive with my unexpected absents due to baby's medical issues at the time, and was let go."
good,"Salary very less,  work environment is good.  But nothing new to learn in particular claim Adjudication process. Overall its a very good workplace to start career in healthcare."
good,US Bank is just like all of your typical call centers. There is always an opportunity for extra hours and overtime. The demand for work will always be there.
good,inbound calls for medical insurance. handled over 50-60 calls per day. work place culture was great! The work place culture made the job worth while.  very hard to advance in the company
good,"Busy place, works starts as soon as you sit down. Which makes the day go fast. "
good,United Healthcare was a slower paced environment making it difficult to remain engaged.  It did not seem as though the employee talents were being utilized to the extent they should have been.
good,"The company has some good staff member, nurses' therapist are very knowledgeable. The management is very power hungry, a lot of neparatism as well as 85% of the office level management teams bully and threaten their staff"
good,"This company is no longer opened. It was an ok job. It was the basic home health, were sometimes you had patients and sometimes you didn't. So many times you were sent back home."
good,"While the company stresses life balance, if you are in the technology field, expect long hours and working nights and weekends (you're expected to work 44+ hours/week while being paid for 40). Bonuses and pay raises are stingy to the lower ranks. Unless you work 60+ hours, chances of getting a raise or bonus is small. Layoffs are common, especially before the end of the year when management wants to make financial quotas. Telecommuting used to be welcomed but now the number of telecommuting (remote) positions is slim."
good,"In order to do a good job you have to work beyond your paid hours.  I got tired of hearing  here add this to your day , it will only take a few minutes.  Nothing in healthcare ""only takes  a few minutes"""
good,"I believe that if the company was more organized everything else would run smoothly, but because I feel as though it isn't everything is done last minute."
good,Good company just need to work out the wrinkles.Ive experience non employee relationship favortizm. You have times when action come together but I prefer company that have a family value to it. Helping one another catering to the less fortunate.
good,"It is good to work with UHG. Good infrastructure, salary. I experienced a lot here. looking for MIS IJP's. many things to understand and explore. Thanks."
good,"co workers make the environment so much fun and the work day less hectic. As far as job advancement , it Is room to grow in the company. the life balance is okay but could be better."
good,it was ok. great hours no weekends.  Placed outbound calls to verify information also assisted peers if any help was needed. With any job I feel there is room for improvements..
good,"Great place to grow, plenty of opportunities for employees. Fast paced environment but can be a little stressful. It provides an environment for all individuals to be accepted and be themselves"
good,Assisted members with Medicare Advantage plans with regards to their benefits and drug coverage. Many members were not aware of their coverage in a Medicare Advantage plan. Brokers would not explain the donut hole with regards to their Part D.
good,"por ser privada tem uma ótima estrutura e equipamento e alguns protocolo dos quais adorei ter conhecido e aplicado, uma pena o salário muito baixa para uma empresa particular e suas exigências"
good,"Managed Community and State Medicaid Files and investigate coordination of benefit from other payors for cost savings, Ensure accuracy and financial gains through performing research and determining financial development and resolution."
good,"UHG is a fortune 6 organization that is very dynamic and successful,  unfortunately work/life balance does not exist. Expectations are unreasonable and the culture is not ideal. They have made positive changes to impact culture, however, I still find the culture very stiff."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The job in itself is not so bad, although they tend to not hire on. So if you want a job where you will work with no benefits and no chance of getting hired on then this is for you."
good,I paid insurance claims insurance claims correctly and in a timely manner.  Training wasn't as great as Bluecross and the program we used to pay claims was outdated.
good,"a very good organization for the Beginners to learn the work culture "
good,"All high lrvel managers are being selfish and money minded, very conning,, and very partiality shows between the employees, in every event the are manipulated.. showing dummy accounts.  And sharing the money.. no satisfaction of employees....."
good,"I love the work that I do in regards to helping members understand their benefits, how claims process, finding providers in their plan and just being able to help the get the care they need. I understand and have learned not to take things personal when members call in frustrated because they are upset with the situation. The hardest part of the job would definitely be telling a member their coverage is denied or not being able to help solve a problem because of being unable to reach a provider or approve an authorization request. Often times, I feel like the man in the middle because there is only so much I can do as an Advocate. The work schedule conflicts with school schedule due to mandatory OT, so finding balance is a little difficult."
good,"•	Respond to and resolve on the first call, customer service inquires and issues by identifying the topic and type of assistance the caller needs such as benefits, eligibility and claims, financial spending accounts and correspondence."
good,"Insurance was great"
good,"was very happy to work from home, position not the best for me in terms of hours and ability to take accrued time off, did not appreciate benefits.  very small department and could not get help I needed to be successful.  was not able to take off accrued days if you were not completely caught up on work, but not allowed OT to get caught up and made to feel like you were putting others behind if you needed help.  only a group of 10 people and in 6 mths I am the 3rd person to leave that department and I know another is leaving now."
good,UHC Oldsmar is all about your call numbers not about its' employees.Management at best is very young with no experience. It's a good old boy network and if they like you your are not written up with below standard numbers or the days you miss don't count toward your attendance. If you like being a robot this JOB is for you.... If you don't kiss a** you will not be in the click!
good,"I've come to learned during the years that i was with the company that  corporations do not care about their employees. All they care about is making money. If u are a yes person,  you will make it far within that company until u disagree with something that is going on and even if you are right about what u disagree with, they will find a way to make you leave."
good,"A professional business setting with high expectations."
good,every thing is fine and good in UHG management is also friendly but there is no growth in UHG co-workers are very friendly i had all lot of thing in uhg like excel work distribution to sub ordinates and i will do 100% audits for recently joined employees in our process.
good,"The management constantly changed, which caused for loss of jobs. I did not like the duties of soliciting older members for products."
good,"If you want to work for a company in which you can grow stick with United Health Care. Training is very long, and there is a lot required rom the employees however if you can stick with it you can grow."
good,"Good Pay and decent place to work at 1st. dislike how rules constantly change and how management wants you to go above and beyond  for customers but you cannot get management to do anything for you other than provide excuses. "
good,"The job is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Autonomy is a benefit in this role. Case Managers works on teams that focuses on the same goal and outreach plan."
good,This organisation is good for work but i want to job in Dubai that's why i want to leave this company. Co-workers are good but not mangement
good,"Mandatory Over Time, 50+ hours per week was very difficult to maintain. Overtime began when we began on the call floor till the day I left 7 months later."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Variety of area's to work which includes adults, adolescents and substance abuse clients. Communication among staff and management is slowly improving. Generally co-workers act as a team. Opportunity to educate clients and families about medication and resources available. Positive working relationships with numerous Physicians and staff to benefit client care."
good,Able to obtain my insurance sales license.  It was a fun place to work . I wish the open enrollment period could have  been longer.
good,"Fast-paced and hectic.Training is bare bones and you are thrown to the wolves with only a rudimentary knowledge of your position. Calls are graded during training, and you are pushed to earn as many positive surveys from customers as possible. Every second of your day is timed and graded, and you are not allowed off the phones to go to the bathroom if needed. Company has a ""will hire anyone"" vibe which is reflected in the classroom. Trainers and management are impatient and treat you like children for asking questions."
good,"Our volume of work varies each day by the amount of change and renewal requests the company receives from our customers.  The work is then distributed into our individual work ques for the day.  The complexity or simplicity of the work is only known once we open the company's information in the Unitedhealth Care system.  There are constant systems updates and, constant regulation changes we must be kept aware of to maintain our customers and Unitedhealth Care in compliance."
good,"This company was very innovated, unfortunately depending on the manager and supervisor you had the experience could differ. My first supervisor was excellent, the second one was almost never available and coaching were never completed. Our company believed in values such as integrity and compassion and I feel my immediate supervisor lacked that."
good,United Healthcare really does care about their employees and I loved that. However I felt very stifled and micro managed. Your performance was based on stats and not you as a person.
good,"The environment was a fun place to be to daily. The pay was excellent. However, some of the business decisions was not black and white"
good,"Good Company, innovative, Management can be pushy. Great program to take care of patients in the community and in nursing homes. The hardest part is keeping up with documentation. I love interacting with patients and families."
good,"Work day 8:30 - 5 pm 7:00 pm - 8:30 pm Monday thru Friday"
good,"inbound calls assisting customers with payment and plan details"
good,"I have stayed with this company for over a year now. It has been an honor and a privilege to be employed with UHG as they are a very compassionate employer. Priority is people and their growth. "
good,"took incoming calls 8 hrs a day"
good,"I was well paid for this job, and as a consequence faced high blood pressure and weight gain, stress-related headaches and a resurgence in migraines, and intra-office dramatics."
good,"Um dia de trabalho típico envolve atuar junto com as lideranças, buscar as melhores praticas de RH para atender as demandas."
good,This was a very rewarding position dealing with elderly members and making sure their needs are been met. No amenities or good benefits
good,"Strong metrics requirements,work performance demands are extremely high for entry level employees. There is room for advancement and incentives are given to those who meet metrics. Employee benefits are good."
good,Quality work vs quantity makes this company excellent. They have come a long way comparing to when I worked there. Working from home was a bonus.
good,"Great co-workers/benefits, learned a lot about Insurance companies and how they deal with hospitals and policies. No weekends or holidays."
good,United Health Group is a great company. The training is well tailored to the needs of the consumers. The trainer's go through a train the trainer process to make sure they are prepared and equipped to educate and development new employees.
good,"I visit members in their homes, assisted living facilities, homeless shelters and skilled nursing facilities to manage their Medicaid LTC Plan. I completed a series of assessments for each member as it relates to clinical pathways. I adhered to State compliance with Plan of Cares, initiate waivers and hospital/nursing facility admission protocols. Provide a complete continuum of quality care through close communication with members via in-person or on-the-phone interaction. Provide members with continued clinical education, medication reviews and connection with external community resources. I collaborate with multiple agencies to design an effective plan of care to meet the needs of the Member. I work directly with an interdisciplinary team and other ancillary staff to make sure every treatment plan gets carried out effectively after discharged from a skilled nursing facility or a hospital. I attain services for Members to improve their overall quality of care in the community to decrease complications of disease processes and to decrease hospital re-admissions/emergency room visits"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Professional work environment with lot of overtime available due to high demand of productivity. Metrics are very important and has an important role with yearly raise/bonus. A typical work day consists of me generating denial letters for Medicaid members. I currently work along size 4 other co-workers who look to me to answer questions daily that they may have in regards of the job roles and processes. The most enjoyable part of my job is the that I can be as productive as I want. There is no limit on productivity and that guarantee job security. There is never a boring/dull moment for I learn something new each day. Whether it's the new applications/new project pilots being rolled out, new tools with Microsoft application as well as the many other applications I utilize to complete my job tasks."
good,uhc is not terrible but I personally I am not happy right now I would recommend others to work here for the pay.I have worked here for 2 years almost and still I am unable to move up.
good,"United Healthcare was the first type of job that I had working with health insurance. "
good,"I worked at UHC for approximately five years and the pay was fair; however, I think that they lack organizational structure. Working as an outside sales agent there was a lack of communication from upper management on organizational changes that affected an agent's ability to perform sale duties effectively."
good,"Typical day consisted of entering data from paper or electronic documents, updating group information for year to year renewal, terming groups & reinstating when asked."
good,Love working in this company but when comes to compensation it is not worth it.It has very good work environment and co-workers are very friendly in nature
good,There were a few issues with the culture we were expected to live under and accountability for everyone abiding it. Overall the job was not terrible but the environment could be better.
good,"It’s all about Call Quality, Audit the call and send the feedback to the managers."
good,"A qualified Information Technology professional, I bring with me over 9 years of IT Projects experience, and am currently with United Health Group as Engineering Lead."
good,"É uma boa empresa, mas não remunera os funcionários de acordo com o nível de cobrança dos resultados."
good,"My typical workday begins with me gathering all the claims that have came in for our assigned states and assign them to my co-workers to complete. I have six states that I pull inventory for on a daily basis. I am also responsible for assisting with the processing of those claims as well. I work closely with my supervisor to ensure that things run smooth throughout the day and if anyone has any problems with claims, I assist them with their questions."
good,Lot of learning on technologies and about healthcare insurance overall. Enjoyed teaching people new things that they were not aware of.
good,"Even though this job is stressful, I did not have a problem with that - that's the nature of working at a call center. However, there are so many issues with management that it makes your personal life suffer as a result."
good,"Minha avaliação é positiva."
good,"The Company is really worth a try. Employees are real friendly."
good,Was a new division of UHG. Promoted the Prescription Solutions by OptumRx® Mail Service Pharmacy line of diabetes supplies and services to Healthcare Professionals. Gained Healthcare Professionals commitment to start new patients on Prescription Sales force was let go due to industry changes.
good,the lack of compensatons period is the reason for a job search. and that fact of non production of movement with the company
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the management and leadership at UHC, but it was very difficult to balance work and home life. The position offered PTO, but after trying to schedule doctor appointments and vacation time months in advance only to be told no can make life a little difficult."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A typical day at work answering phones and entering prior authorization requirements. I enjoy talking with providers and researching information regarding ICD-9 codes and procedures. "
good,"production based position. not a bad place to work. work from home option is nice. they are sending a lit of jobs offshore to India and the Philippines. Optum, which is part of UHG is growing, not the UHC part"
good,"Being in a team leader was doing management task when the main manager wasn't at work. I would hold team meetings, conduct training for new material, and held one on one coaching with each team member. When i wasn't doing those task, I was on the phones speaking with customers about mail service pharmacy. Setting up mail service accounts so that individuals do not have to go to a local pharmacy we will get there medication sent to them by UPS."
good,"Reviewing applications for new Provider to join the managed care insurance company."
good,Good job while in college (sales job). Friendly co-workers and management. We worked hard and played hard as a sales team.
good,Call provider offices to relay recommendations made by Pharmacists and Dietitians to be faxed and documenting the outcome in the pharmacy documentation system.
good,Answer in-coming calls about Health plan benefits or Claims issues based on the Member's policy and coverage.
good,I am a self driven person. Love to work my way out without any supervision. I am very creative and a quick learner.
good,"Meu dia de trabalho é voltado em analisar recibos enviados para Amil (consultas,exames,internação) entre outras atividades como por exemplo questionamentos direcionados ao saque e direcionados para nossa administração."
good,"Empresa de grande porte, dinâmica. Gostei de trabalhar na Amil, pois tive a oportunidade de conhecer um segmento que não conhecia que o segmento da saúde. Aprendi a valorizar a vida, a me colocar no lugar do outro sempre em qualquer situação, acolhimento e atendimento 100% humanizado."
good,As long as you do your job you will be ok. There is no stability
good,"For the industry of work, overall good employer to work for."
good,convergys was ok to work for they were very organized.. the scheduling was horrible because I had a newborn at the time and no child care but other than that it was ok had great overtime and great coaches
good,"I've never been a phone person before and definitely am not now after working this position. I am typically a compassionate individual but working with members for 8 or more hours a day, 5 or more days a week takes it out of you. I will not be applying to anymore call centers in the future. The company seems healthy itself and provides some decent benefits but they do not seem to focus on their employees as much. Incentives and bonuses are offered however the constant changing of rules and regulations make these bonuses almost unattainable. I am also a disabled individual. I do not expect for someone to pity me or give me a lot more lead way than others, however it is nice to have management who is understanding of how difficult certain things can be with a disability. Upper management does not extend any compassion whatsoever. If you're sick, doctor's note, ER note, or not, you're going to get an occurrence on your record and possible termination."
good,Not a job for someone who cannot adapt and think quickly. However if you are always up for a challenge and can consistently make metrics this may be a good fit for you.
good,A typical day at UHG is interesting at times.  I have learned a little about managed care.  Management at UHG is sometimes overbearing and controlling.  My co-workers are teamplayers.  The hardest part of my job is being micromanaged.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work from home.
good,"People are friendly, Management is not great at communication."
good,"Calling member engaging them with nurses, to ensure members are using their benefits, and practicing preventive health."
good,"Como abordar e atender cliente, como entender o momento e o que esta precisando, nestes anos tive varias gerencias, umas mais presentes e outras não, mas atenciosas ao problemas para trazer uma boa solução.O mais difícil era as mudanças pois estava na empresa desde AMESP depois passou para MEDIAL e então AMIL, por isso foi desgastando e muitas coisas que tínhamos foi retirado ou diminuindo . Aparte agradável era que estavamos sempre unidos e dando força uns aos outro."
good,Great place to work with a family Great benefits. Laid back environment.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Gave me great experience working with heath care and medicare part d plans.
good,"Good place to work, not for everyone. The money is good for many of the representatives due to endless overtime if your meeting your numbers. Don't feel like their is much room for growth within my department unfortunately."
good,"On a typical day I would arrive early and have coffee in the clean break room. Afterwards, I go to my large desk space, put my things away in my personal closet or drawer. Then typically i'd trade good morning with my neighbor and get my computer started up and ready to work."
good,"For myself, the work environment was not satisfactory.   I had computer issues with system failure constantly it seemed. The staff was 95% good people that I enjoyed being around! We had alot of side activities to break up the tediousness of processing claims and I was part of one of the activity planning groups. "
good,"The Hooksett location is not a strategic site. This building is used primarily for operations; customer service or claims processing. If you are hired as a customer service agent, you will be working in a call center. Many reviews have concentrated on the negative aspects of a call center such as the schedule adherence. This is typical of a call center; that was the job that was accepted. "
good,I loved it.  My position did not let me work from home. the was a freeze on hiring and my travel was 2 hours one way.  Management was closed to new ideas but they were always working on moral and worked hard.
good,I run a machine that inserts mail into an envelope. I do quality inspection making sure that it is acceptable to go out the door. When the machine stops you have to hurry and figure out why and start it back up quickly. I work off two computers that control the machine and a laptop to input data.
good,"very poor management, everything is taken personally, some staff mistreat consumers as well as take personal belongings from them via money"
good,"Needs to be more focused on employees. United Healthcare is great, but the smaller departments under them are not concrete enough."
good,"Interesting mix of Employees. Sit for 8 to 10 hours a day on the phone. Management was different, I saw some come in from the outside they did not last long. Some that gave their all, and deserved to be management, but passed over, and asked to train or do the job for the new ones. But they were not part of the tight knit group, so they were always passed over. Most enjoyable was helping the customers."
good,Phone case manegment of numerous patients lab value and adjusting dose of medication related to patients diet and other meds.Other RNs with same case load. Friendly environment with ability to discuss difficult patients. Very difficult not having face to face discussion with patient.
good,"United was an okay company to work for. Unfortunately due to my own personal and health reasons at that time, I left the company."
good,I enjoyed working with clients and assisting with their service issues. I made visits to the client offices quarterly or whenever I was needed.
good,"United does care for their customers! As an employer, for as big as they are, they are no big deal. They have to take of stockholders first. You'd think they would have great medical benefits for employees, HAH! I know of people on their spouse's benefits plan because they are better than United's. They prefer to hire from the outside at lower pay than promote from within."
good,United Healthcare is a decent place to work for a person that is just starting out in an entry level postition.
good,"O dia trabalho é normal, passei por vários setores dentro de 05 anos que tenho na empresa como por exemplo: call center, atendimento presencial ( recepção ), perícia médica, autorização de exames de pequenos e grandes portes e no momento gestão de redes ( credenciamento )."
good,Performed Citrix Farm and server health checks on regular basis.
good,"I did customer service for the company in their call center FSA department. There was micro management the most ive ever seen with an employer. No flexibility for college schedule, no flexibility for part time. No flexibility to move within the company unless you have been with them for one year. Forget trying to get out of the call center positions if you were initially trained in for that position. They were obsessed with tracking time more than actual work."
good,"Has wonderfull management, great work environment, very fun place to be"
good,"uma grande empresa. tem uma rotina bem dinamica, fiz grandes amigos."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I was not able to perform my daily expertise as a Medical Assistant.
good,UHG is a great company for nurses. They attempt to offer flexibility and they have a great list of core values.
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers, but the job could be stressful at times because of ever increasing pressure from management to reach new production goals."
good,"The environment here is one that recognizes they're dysfunctional, as most places are to a degree. However, they are embarking on a new culture that encourages people to just treat everyone like they'd like to be treated, with integrity, compassion and to be present in all aspects of your work life. It is a great place to work, although for me there is not much room for advancement, other than outside of my department in areas that just don't appeal to my skillset."
good,"Loved the environment, but no chance for advancement in the company!"
good,"A typical day would be taking back to back calls from people about their insurance, there was no time for any breathing room in between calls, and managament only allowed you a couple seconds between each call, and if you went over that they would get down on you. I did enjoy the people that I worked with, but for training they had soemone that never did the job before so it wasn't very organized and I didnt feel very comfortable being put on the phones. There was a lot of information to take in, in just a short amount of time. It was a good company that tried to reward their employees and they did their best to help everyone be comfortable within the positions they held."
good,"United Health Group is a good organisation. I have learn lot of things there, the support I got from my Mangers and colleagues superb."
good,Flexible hours and ability to work from home but very little room for advancement
good,"Good luck advancing or maintaining work/life balance. They pretend to give, but quickly take it away. No room for advancement. Very hostile environment. Incorporates use of spyware to monitor activities and pressure employees. Very stressful and compensation is hardly worth it. Not beneficial if you arrived healthy."
good,"A typical day, consisted of me receiving various faxes or taking calls from various medical equipment companies who needed to get approval for equipment that was being ordered for members of the healthplan. Typically, equipment was ordered after visits to the hospital or post surgey. It was fascinating because in the job prior to this, I would be the representative calling the insurance companies to get authorizations. I think being familiar with medical equipment allowed me to do my job with a great deal of ease because I already knew what functionality the equipment was to serve, and having already been familiar with the guidelines, also made it quite easy to perform my job well. I believe in being a team player, and being able to perform my job with such ease, allowed me to be able to assist my co-workers in performing their jobs as well. That is how I learned the criteria for providing medical necessity review for the outpatient therapies."
good,"Love the people I worked with, the lack of training was very unexpected in a company that size."
good,"I learned from this employer the details of dental insurance. A typical day at work was busy, call after call assisting members/dental providers. My manager was willing to go above and beyond to assist me with my work/life balance. It was almost impossible to get a day off or even leave early to catch a dr appointment or run an errand. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers. The hardest part would have to be maintaining a positive attitude with stress of the job. It was made possible by my manager and my coworkers."
good,"The typical day in UHG used to be the stressful one. However, management was good at the time when I was working when it comes to supporting the team members. Time to time fun activities was also one of the things I liked about UHG"
good,"I really enjoyed my team.  Seeing the growth of my agents through Coaching, training and one on one's. "
good,"Pay is very competitive. Work from home options provide flexibility, but you are micromanaged so much and not treated like a professional. They are very metric driven and focus more on numbers than actual work being done. The culture has really deteriorated. There is no job security as there have been many lay-offs. If you advance then you are first on the chopping block."
good,They provide great benefits and work life balance. The culture is very welcoming and they have great technology for the workplace. Management could be more motivating.
good,"Great benefits, work life balance, good pay, training availability, scope for promotions, flexible working hours, get to learn many things , productive and supportive environment"
good,"Was working with XL health when UHG acquired them. Everything was okay but eventually, my initial role was omitted and our department had to reapply for other positions...this was over 5 years ago. I don't know how things are now.."
good,"I was laid off after 19 years , so job security isnt very high at this time.  Very flexible with work schedules. Training available when needed. Multiple locations"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Moderate, friendly culture. Nice campus depending on the locations. "
good,"The job is not hard to learn. However, every day something is updated in a manual you will be using. You wear too many hats and your pay remains the same. The one thing I enjoy about the job is I do not stress about my job once I get home."
good,"you have to be flexible enough to adjust with the changes regarding the work standards that are set by the company but all in all, the environment is friendly"
good,I love to assist people but company is definitely one sided and does not think about no care about the wellbeing of their employees. You make ok money but very stressful
good,"Not much room for growth but a great place if you want a relatively stable and slow work life. For instance, if you have a family and do not want to spend too much working, then this place is for you."
good,"Attention to detail, scrupulous adherence to schedule, ever increasing performance results, embracing change, ability to learn completely new computer software systems and platforms with zero tolerance for mistakes of any kind are paramount to maintaining your employment."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Recently renovated office with cafeteria, gym and wellness clinic, covered parking and security. Recent lay-offs nationwide in the Claims and Adjustment Departments. They have been very quiet regarding the exact reason and number of employees affected. The company recently purchased new auto adjudication software, which means less staff will be needed. Communication from the top has been lacking lately, leaving the remaining employees unsure of their future with the company. Disappointing, because this used to be a great place to work. Things are definitely changing at United Healthcare!"
good,Call center environment : This is an ideal place for students . The supervisors are nice however there are too many restrictions on taking personal breaks.
good,"Global organization with excellent business growth, Job security, being part of Healthcare itself is good. Employee wellbeing, work life balance, Transport Service."
good,This is a great company with great benefits. Management are good and work very well together. The shifts are good and the employees are a joy to work with. I recommend this job
good,"A pleasure assisting pts and helping others obtain the information that they were seeking. Great pay, great co workers and a overall great work experience"
good,Opportunities for growth. Leadership profound. Workplace culture experimental.  Travel and remote work plentiful.  Learning opportunities plentiful yet segmented.
good,"Some of the initial training practices were lacking, but I found my way. The people were great and I worked from home. I also was able to work in my own community with people I already knew and cared for."
good,I was able to work from home sometimes with unrealistic productivity numbers. The company acted in an unethical way during a transfer of employees to another department which was never addressed.
good,"poor management, drastic changes continuously. loved working from home. Need to work on training. They throw you out to the wolves. Company does not care about your personal life. only business"
good,"Telecommute nursing leadership roles are amazing. I brag about my job to all my friends and family. If you are organized and can be flexible with your hours within the day, this job is for you."
good,"The place I work at, is a very fast pace environment. Every day walk in volume around 400, sometimes reach 600. Huge amount customers. Staff work at this place, support each other and encourage each other."
good,"It was ok to work for. The company not management was not veru accommdating during my pregnancy with twins. Worked in the call center in oldsmar , fl. My supervisor was great just company policies were not strict."
good,"Hours are flexible. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Empresa desafiadora ambiente bom entre os funcionários, benefícios e salario bem abaixo do mercado"
good,micromanaged and strict time constraints. Take calls to resolve issues in a timely manner. Escalate issues and provide description of issues for tier 2 support.
good,I learned a lot In this position as a medical claim adjuster. The training was the gateway for my medical experience in claims processing. Learning and growing in a field that I really enjoy
good,It was a mediocre work environment. Not a lot of team players. Work culture was stressed. No sense of personal input included in interactions with patients.
good,"It was fun to start with but it really wore me down after awhile. The supervisors take on too many employees and dont ever have enough time to really get to know anyone theyre over. We started off being told that there wasnt a call goal and then as we get comfortable we get told we have to make X amount of appts (not calls) per day. Anytime you have any issues with anything management related, its like pulling teeth to get anyone to deal with it. its a good job if youre okay with being bored and ignored. the benefits are great healthwise and being able to have a 401K, but its almost not worth it."
good,"Apesar das dificuldades com a transição dos americanos na direção geral vida empresa, no geral é agradável."
good,With every job their are so pros and cons. I feel part of a team as in supervisors will jump right in to assist when workload is overwhelming. If you have to take off there is never a pile of work waiting for you upon return everyone covers for eachother. They pay could be better I took a substantial pay cut and recruiter lied about rates and bonuses during hiring process.so be very careful with thatWhich was only relatively important negative.
good,"Is like most big companies where there are many good work groups and some that are less good...find the right coworkers and a job that matches your skills, and go from there!"
good,"Its ok, not much to say, most of the people are friendly, they pay well and some training is provided."
good,it is not as the commercials describe. they do have great benefits and offer employee benefits as soon as you work your first week. as the following weeks occur they are very admit about compassion.
good,"Decent job, nice people, it’s like any other company, it’s better than retail. Just do your work and keep to yourself and you will not have any issues."
good,Good environment to work great coworkers stressfull at times but keeps you busy being part of management high turn over but employees were happy and productive to meet deadlines
good,Depends on Supervisor if you will move up. It’s not easy getting a lateral move but they make it sound simple. All I can say is make Snip tool your best friend and keep a trail on everything.
good,Fast paced many different positions quotes to meet and they provide inspiration for employee's. Good place to work if your prepared and serious. Type of company where you have to really want to work and are good with time management and are organized.
good,Leadership should listen more to those doing the actual work. A typical work week is 50-60 hours per week. Only 40 hours of vacation time roll over at the end of the year.
good,Learned alot of insurance information. had alot of training in prior authorizations. Health coaching. Customer service. Worked with different types of computer programs
good,"Fast placed, but you have to be part of a group to be considered for better opportunities. Employees have to spend a year with the company before being considered for a job"
good,"I worked for Optum, benefits are good, opportunities for growth were great. They provided support for professional development in leadership. Great opportunities for new grads."
good,"no support in trying to relocate, and very few chances for advancement.  only did one thing all day, Bored even while frustrated.  few chances to expand skills by working on special projects"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Give us your opinion about a typical day at work, what you learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most emjoyable part of"
good,The pulse of the work environment was very stressful and ultra competitive. The managers were not helpful in advancing your career as their main concern was metrics for the company.
good,"It's a good place to work. There are  opportunities for overtime and bonus, also having a flexible schedule. A lot of opportunities to train in customer service and the insurance industry."
good,"Pros - work from home, new equipment"
good,Improvement required at team level. Management should be better .team should maintain its decorum on the floor.seats were not available for employees.
good,"I would come in  login to their system and  immediately  start taking calls"
good,- Sempre tem muito trabalho a ser feito mas o ambiente nos torna produtivos;
good,They over hired staff then had to lay people off.  That's no way to take care of the people already working there.  I wish I had something else to say but that is how it went for me.
good,"Fair and generous.  Good work life balance.  Culture is very top down, though they have a culture initiative it does not seem to be working.  Pay is generous"
good,"Hard to say no to members. When members called in with necessary equipment or medication needs hard to tell them no. Some management good, some not. Many changes"
good,Love being able to work from home. Telecommuting has lots of benefits. A con is you never really see co-workers or supervisors to connect with. Everything is virtual.
good,good start for freshers and friendly environment. Monthly recreational activities and yearly sports activities makes job interesting. Hikes and growth is very slow.
good,"Ambiente competitivo e estressante, já que o suporte nem sempre acontece."
good,I do not want to have anything online pertaining to my thoughts about this company and do not like that this is a required field. Indeed should change this.
good,"A typical day at work included 2 visits per day.  Initial, reassessment or CIC."
good,"Management - some are good people, other's are only there for themselves, not wanting to help their team move on within the company.   Other managers are there for you and encourage you to succeed"
good,"Full time Prior auth specialist , work with a great team of people. We all work from home remotely. I would rather the office setting. We work long hour 40 to 60 hours a week."
good,"UHC is known for innovation of health care products. Working environment is strongly influenced by the department's management style and culture. Can be very good, or very poor working conditions, as most places any where."
good,"Its a call center environment. You take calls all day. Medical insurance related. Review claims and eob"
good,UHG was a great place to work for my area.   The pay and benefits was completive.  Management was always easy to work with you if you had a issue inside work or family life.
good,"The work environment is fast paced and good people, not happy with how work schedules are done and the fact that you can't rely on a schedule that you were hired at makes financial planning difficult if you need a second job to make ends meet."
good,Feeling stagnant is no way to feel and no room for advancement. I room to advance and show leadership or be at least trained to advance within a company i know has longevity.
good,I enjoyed my experienced  working with United Health Care I met some wonderful people with in that company who I have grown a outside friendship with.
good,"•	Trained 1000+ new hires, including traveling to out of state offices growing offices with effective office support.    "
good,The job is really easy once you come out of training the company is always updating the process just not sure about job security just be the best you can be to go far
good,"Great company, worked from home, enjoyed my time there. Can't complain. Great supervisor in my first position. Great team members in my first position."
good,"I cannot provide a fair review for this position.. I work independently from my home in Jupiter, Florida. I report to an Agent Manager in Miami, Florida."
good,able to move through the ranks when you know what you are doing but it is very fast paced. There is a lot drama when it comes to some individuals but it can be expected anywhere people work.
good,Very productive workplace. Management is very hands on and hold staff responsible for their productivity. Overtime is always offered and usually required
good,I worked there for a while but I hated there training style. I would not recommend this place for a career. Calls can become repetitive and draining as you will take 100 calls or more per day.
good,"Growth opportunity internally with large representation of internal organizations, for a wide variety of roles and experiences. Advancement and experiences available."
good,MCO Plan dedicated to providing health services that allow the community to live a healthier life within the comfort of their own homes.  Good place to work.  Good place to start your career goals with opportunity for growth.
good,Was able to learn a lot about group and individual insurance policies. The hardest part of the job was the regularity of it which is why I decided to leave.
good,If my manager at UHC did not change to a new position in the company I would still be working there.  This is all I have to say.  UHC is a fine place to work overall.
good,UHG very much cares about its bottom line. All employees regardless of seniority or time served can be let go at any time. You get as much or less back what you put in.
good,"Very flexible- can easily rearrange schedule as needed within core business hours."
good,"Not a good time right now."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"There were many groups to assist participate. Very work friendly."
good,"I worked for them for a brief period. Alot of great structural components to the team work involved at the company. I enjoyed my manager. professional clean, fast paced ,"
good,"O ambiente de trabalho é muito dinâmico e agradável, porém a transição que a empresa estava passando na gestão acabava se refletindo em metas de trabalho difusas."
good,"long hours, good company to work for, long tenure of employees, good culture, good social environment. Free fruit, canteen, free parking, lots of sports and health and well being events"
good,"Worked on a great team but was extremely lucky, not all managers were as interested in staff as much as mine. Some opportunity for improvement in position however some bosses want to hold onto good people"
good,This was a very busy call center. Calls were back to back all day everyday. It was ok but being bust made the day go by faster. This was a place where change happens daily
good,"It is a great place to work and learn, Problem is hiring thorough consultancy for contract hire position, They don't either how long that would be there, I worked for four same condition after over i left that company, But have learnt many things over there,."
good,It was a decent place to work. The employees were nice. Training could have been more thorough. The office is a nice building and it was close to nice restraunts to go to for lunch.
good,I loved working there. The work load was simple and professional. Everyone was willing to help. Management was helpful and allowed employees to be flexible when needed.
good,"Uma boa empresa para quem curte call center, bons benefícios e salários."
good,Assist inbound callers to sign up for Medicare supplemental policies. Pay is not that good. Call center work with two fifteen minute breaks and a short half hour lunch. Seasonal job.
good,"Typical day would be arriving to office space , at home, about 6am EST and making sure that work was assigned out and people got on line at the time that they were supposed to begin.  Making sure that my team met, daily, key metric indicators (appeal OT, ATA, VPH) on a daily basis and met with upper management and team daily to deliver the prior day's statistics."
good,I was a contract sales support rep in the medicare and retirement division and it was essentially a glorified call center job for agents and brokers. Insurance sales reps could be the worst people but there were some really nice people. Sadly this was my first job out of college so I didn't have much bargaining power and it eventually launched me into an infinitely better role.
good,"I didn't have any problems while working there, but several days I could go to work, do my job, and leave having never spoken to anyone. I was frequently bored there."
good,"Overwork employees - tend to have several employee burnout.  I tried to help via contacting HR. Good people to work with, but again, concerned how they don't value employee's / contractors health via stressing them out.  Not unusual to see staff come in evenings and weekends bot complete what I consider busy work - - - just because."
good,low complexity high volume. great benefits cool place to work. There is in house training and the company has oppurtunities for growth and advancement over time
good,"Good company to work for. Has many perks and benefits, excellent learning and training opportunities. Work-life balance. Employee and parents covered in insurance. Few projects are not so great with monotonous tasks and bad management."
good,"Whether you’re trying to impress a date or your professor or your friends, these 50 cool Latin words will definitely give you the edge you need in your next conversation, term paper, or text, making you sound a lot smarter than you probably are."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"UHC had great employee culture, challenges as a start up in our state, poor management experience in our field. I enjoyed being able to telecommute.  Executive leadership made drastic decisions affecting the positions of 500 employees in my state and 400,000 members-seemed to be a quick and hot headed decision."
good,"Overall its a good company. There is a good learning opportunity."
good,"It was an educational experience working in a call center, however, they decided to change their system and as time went by it became disorganized. My supervisor was good however it was lacking structure and support from other management teams. The pay was good and benefits but its like clockwork and you are stuck in a desk for 8-10 hours a day."
good,I was glad that UHG gave me the opportunity to work with them and learn and trust me to do the best. I enjoyed working with the different teams and vendors and we all worked as a team to get the job done correctly and on a timely manner.
good,"Too many chiefs, departments do not speak. Ton of manual reporting, Often there duplication of efforts from multiple departments. Pay was decent but they make you really work"
good,Pay is lower than other companies. The company has points when call out sick. No sick paid days.  You will get points and paid as unplanned top time. They make changes consistently and you don’t get the updates prior to the changes. More work added to you however no pay changes. Getting other opportunities within the company are hard.
good,"fun environment, mandatory overtime. Only thing is that you have to compete and bid for hours as well as compete for the vacation time or days off. Great benefits"
good,"I loved what I did at Uhg but my compensation of my pay was very unappreciated with in the 7 years I was with them.it was always an excuse as to why I wouldn't get a raise, it's got played out until I started looking for work else where that paid me per my worth and Experience."
good,"My days were busy seeking new marketing opportunities and enrolling new prospects. As  a DSNP sales agent, I needed to be in the right spots ( poor neighborhoods, food pantries etc)."
good,"It is a great starter job, it is mostly who you know and how much you want to put up with unpaid work to advance. Jobs are boxed in levels and regardless of skill set you can’t leap through pay grades. There is not enough training for something new."
good,"I worked on a team that was ok; although, towards the end, it was becoming an environment that fostered micromanagement and some toxicity. It can be strange how one or a few people can alter the dynamics of a team."
good,"Research escalated cases"
good,I have been trying to move into a new role for a year now and I am getting nowhere with this company.  If you plan to work here early in your career make sure you are in the role/career path you want long term because it is near impossible to move to a related field with how they handle internal job applications.
good,"Project work normally includes variety and challenge for operational efficiency and customer improvements."
good,My job at UHC was a remote DM. The expectations were very high. I had close to 200 clients to keep up with. We used a calendar which helped with scheduling. We were not monitored on the telephone which was a plus. We developed care plans and used motivational interviewing to help the client meet their needs.
good,"metrics to meet  are unreasonable, not told full requirements to be met in interview, hard to sell products to elderly, confusing management, supervisors hard to contact for help"
good,Lack of communication company shut down shortly after taking over a previous company within a year time frame the executive side was apart from all other employees from the warehouse
good,"Implemented new or updated patient demographics in a 8 hour shift. making sure to add any  family member into the guarantor insurance plan, Made change to an insurance plan example a specified event, marriage or child no longer under the guarantor plan"
good,The benefits were not really an issue but the hour and that fact that we had to keep all calls under 8 minutes instead of truly helping out the people that were calling in with problems with their healthcare such as benefits not working or unable to get prescriptions that were needed sucked. The management was trying to keep everyone on the team on the same page but that fell short more times then not.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Low pay, expect employees to be extremely fast at reviewing claims and medical records. You have to meet a certain quota to get a bonus on your check."
good,"The best part of my job was helping others and the salary. However, management was poor. There was little guidance and feedback was hardly accepted. There was also little room for advancement. "
good,Do not do duals you will regret it.  Always make sure this is what you want to do not everyone is cut out to work from home.  I wish there were better training and too many meetings and computer issues.
good,"The job itself is a good job because of who you are helping and how you are helping the customer make healthcare decisions. The issues come from commissions, they are ever changing, career development is hard."
good,I like the level of transparency and willingness to work within the Agile Framework. There is flexibility to work remotely and good support for technologists.
good,"Aside from being good at your job, make sure you are a favorite in your manager's (and their manager's) eyes. Multitudes of people were passed up for projects and advancement for people who had poorer job performance, but were liked by management."
good,"good place, first time manager who didnt know what she was she was doing. The pay discrepancy between us was ridiculous as I ran basically one half of the wellness department but only paid 25% of the afforded budget because she had ""manager"" in her title. Ridiculous."
good,"unprofessional atmosphere, no flexibility, no chance for advancement, constant micro managing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being off.  The culture in my department was horrible."
good,My first opportunity to work remotely with a company. A great perk at the time. Great team and management to work for who did encourage growth within the company.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty is pretty decent, you are not overloaded with work. They are currently using latest tech stack inline with the industry standards. The HR at UHG  are really unreachable."
good,I was hired by United HealthCare when they were involved in the administration of Medicare benefits.  Within six (6) months of my employment they announced they were getting out of government operations.
good,"Hours are 8-10 hrs a day depending on your shift. Pay needed to be better and benefits were expensive. The job was fine but during open enrollment time, there was mandatory overtime. If you have good numbers, you become eligible to work from home."
good,"Great family oriented company, I will say there was a lot of information that lacked through out the company. you would constantly be on a phone call with a member and not have the information and then have to look around or call someone who did not have said information also. the pay is decent but not good enough if you have bills like rent, car payments, car insurance, phone and more"
good,"call center call flow, inbound and outbound calls working with providers and members with claims benefits and authorizations. work at home option available"
good,"The busy season is Jan-May, and the hours are very long.  Communication from management is not as good as it should be.  I had a great group of colleagues and we were very cohesive."
good,There is little opportunity for advancement . Good management that supports subordinates. Micromanaged daily. It is nice to work remotely from home. Love the locations flexibility
good,"United Health Group was a good place to work at. Stress-free, learned to be relaxed and work. There were events to enjoy as well, as cultural events, etc. Fridays ans Saturdays were good days to work, as weekend was much chilling."
good,"I learned how to assist customers with their health insurance benefits, assisted in complex claims. set commitments to review complex issues and resolve them."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,never worked here just putting in text to fulfill the requirement. this is wierd that i must put this in but here it is to meet the required field. here is some more.
good,I was transitioned to this company in October of 2018. I liked the fact that we were able to have a login and explore a lot of things on the uhg/hub. Unfortunately I was employed long enough. I was laid off on March 20. from the Houston location.
good,Good company. It can take awhile to advance or find a level of consistency in management. Compensation is exceptional and healthcare benefits are good
good,A normal day at work is a set schedule. It changes daily so it is not set. Very hard to plan anything when schedule is changing. I have learned to work under pressure. The work environment is friendly but not much interaction because you are focused on the work that has to be done.
good,"Working for UnitedHealthcare is not bad. It actually is a good place to work; there are many good people. However, work-life balance is not the best. Also the pay is not in the higher edge of the market proportional to thier place in the market."
good,"I worked at United Health Group for approximately two years, handled inbound calls regarding detailed benefit information and answered questions from medical providers."
good,"UHG bought the Advisory Board Company and is slowly divesting it product line by product line."
good,In this position I was part of a brand new department and it was very disorganized and misleading. The management staff was very unorganized and confused.
good,The best part about the job was being able to work with a team of great people. It had a welcoming culture and was able to learn from others. Management was adequate.
good,"The building is located in Mckinley Taguig. It is very clean and security is 24/7. The agency who handled us, are not paying our SSS, PAG-IBIG contributions on time. Over time pay took months to be settled."
good,Multi-taking skill is important!  Many tasks assigned but not all needed. Management needs to review strategy and implement strategic approach. Work/home life balance needs improvement!
good,working in healthcare is challenging and satisfying for me working for united health services was a good learning experience working in a doctors office
good,"Great place to work, everyone is friendly, and its a great environment  to learn and grow in. I have had  a gratifying experience overall and I would recommend this job to anybody. Great Company!!"
good,"They lure you in and keep you with high pay, great PTO and flexibility. High case loads, unrealistic deadlines, high priority emails delivered mid or late day with expectations of resolution by ""end of day."" Insurance coverage is mediocre and very expensive. Preach that they want to be the leaders in the State on Monday and announce they're ending their agreement on Friday. Chaotic and disorganized environment,  changes in processes that made no sense or made the job more difficult than what was necessary. Gave 2 days to 1 week of training for orientation."
good,"Very laid back, great renovations recently. Managers are sometimes very accommodating, people there are very friendly. They also have a cafeteria that saves you from having to go get lunch."
good,I would prefer not to say anything one way or the other.  Wasn't the place for me.  Might work for others..  I have moved onto to a different place and thats all.
good,"It's pretty fast paced"
good,"I continue to learn to help advance my career. "
good,"When I was a supervisor for UHC I managed 25 people both locally and remotely."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"While I believe there are plenty of opportunities to grow within the company, it depends on managements willingness to help you with that growth. In my experience during my year, my manager did not want to take the time to help develop me in my role, which made it difficult to succeed within the position and grow within the organization."
good,"UnitedHealthCare/Optum is a pretty good place to work, but your managers and administration make or break the job. It is very hard to get your bonus. Most of the administration is amazing, but some are cruel, ""pick on"" certain employees, and are just down right unprofessional. They also state upon hiring that it is easy to move around in the company, but that is far from the truth. I don't believe that they really research who they promote because some clearly have issues with all of their staff and are still allowed to have administrative authority (they seem to be appointed for high performance but have poor people skills). The health insurance, also isn't that great (go figure). I have to pay for a lot of things out-of-pocket, even though all of my providers are in network."
good,The experience at Optum Health Insurance company was beneficial to my future endevours. The atmosphere was very professional and management were very helpful
good,"Job is decent-  You would think working for an insurance company would make the benefits ‘second to none’ but no.  I suppose advancement opportunities are there but highly competitave because there are so many employees stirring the pot.  Pay is not competitive.  Management do their best with what upper management provide them with, which is not much....In essence it’s a type of job you would take to build your resume so that you can pursuit your career goals.  I don’t hate it and yet I don’t love it. It’s just muh."
good,"Gerência fraquissima, falta de comunicação com os funcionários, área de TI deixada em segundo plano."
good,"Uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, com salário competitivo e benefícios alinhados com o mercado."
good,"The projects and the company had the vision.The company was well managed and the projects were well funded. "
good,"Had a great training program. Gained a lot f knowledge in health care insurance claims processing and benefit coverage. Also, had the opportunity to work at home."
good,"For a health insurance company, their health insurance package is bad. You must spend 3 THOUSAND dollars before it even kicks in. SO essentially you have no health insurance. Yes it is an HSA but this is a saver for the company."
good,"A typical place to work, decent pay, schedule, healthcare exc. fast paced a lot of change, However career advancement was unlike I have ever experienced to be blunt and honest if you were not teachers pet so to speak or it seemed to be hard to advance although all deadlines and company  stats and requirements were met and exceeded."
good,"United Health Group would be one of my most recommended company to work in, in my opinion.  Management sees to it that their one downs have exemplary work/ life balance."
good,"It was good company, good management, supportive supervisor and "
good,"For the most part, it was a good experience, just be careful if you go on medical leave it could lead to the end of your time there. Otherwise, the benefits are good and there is room for career advancement."
good,You are expected to keep daily production numbers. Ample training is given for all jobs that are worked. There is clear guidance of your performance and it is a very quality oriented enviroment.
good,The requirements were not realistic in real time to assist customer needs.  Too much stress to take calls and not have time to assist the customers on the help they need
good,Good place to work. friendly upper management. nice work atmosphere. friendly staff. not enough pay. great benefits. two 15 minute breaks one 30 minute break
good,"Handled patients inquires,complaints, billing questions and payment extensions/service request. Mange hig-volume calls."
good,The benefits and pay structure were decent. I understand the nature of corporations and their “bottom line” but it feels like a bait and switch to be hired as a nurse but expected to perform the role (mostly) of a tactless sales rep after a member called for advice regarding their recent Cancer diagnosis.
good,"First job in the health field and it was a great experience for a beginner. Not a lot of room for employment growth, but very supportive staff. Would recommend to many people."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Fun place to work with. Campus is high standard and break rooms are awesome. Nice restaurants ans covered parking lot."
good,"I valued my telecommuter experience (9 years worth), which allowed for a desirable work/life balance. I learned its critical to keep skills current, embrace new methodologies and change.  Management made efforts to connect and communicate, but often fell short of earning trust.  Challenges included internal communications (or lack thereof).  Most enjoyable was the team I worked on at the time of my layoff. Having 17 years in the company, many relationships were formed and will stay with me as I move forward."
good,prefer not to say in this place as I would not want to influence anyone whether they should take the job with united health group not to take the job with united health care
good,"Management makes a difference in guiding the mission by laying out clear expectations. In addition, to set standards, expectations, advice, and support to help agents be better."
good,"If you like a job that pays the same low rate for 5 years, and nowhere to go, yes why not. But don't be deceived by the company's big name and hope for advancing higher. The management  enjoys keeping you under their wings, even if they see potential in you they will break you to keep you."
good,Good place to work. work life balance optimum. Friendly atmosphere.Typical day at work will be looking into day to day activities of performing projects end to end.
good,"I do not like the way they hire, This company has favoritism not loyal to longtime employees, Seniority has no place in UHC. Which just like the customers we to are customers. So if you treat the employees the way you treat your customer. Where would we be?"
good,the company always promoted first call resolution but also you were penalized if your call times were below the regulated time and it wasnt easy to be promoted due to it was always the supervisors pick
good,"temp position - did not meet anyone other than trainer and immediate supervisor so hard to comment about the company. "
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was coworkers. Typical day was busy. Teamwork helps out alot. No hard part about the job. Friendly working atmosphere. Customer Service plays a big part in the overall success of a business.
good,Company is focused on growth and development as well as profit.  Structured so that there is accountability and reward for good job performance.  Overall good company.
good,"great company terrible endangerment, wouldn't go back  need more people do not like the hours and the people are slow workers and the pay could be better great location"
good,While it was an interesting experience I never felt that I would be able to grow in the position that I had. There were many aspects of the company that I would have enjoyed learning but was never given the opportunity.
good,Time at UHG has been average.  Working remotely has proven to be a challenge with maintaining relationships with team.  I like to work independently but also like the feeling of working as a team.  This has been a bit disjointed of late.  Our team is extremely busy and need to find a way to stay in sync with all on the team.
good,"it was an ok job, I had to clock in before 9 am everyday, I was able to take breaks and lunch when I liked. I enjoyed parts of the job, and I really enjoyed some of my coworkers a lot."
good,This job allowed me to gain patience and further my experience. Being able to speak to some of the nicest people while learning to have patience to deal with the no so nice people. Gained knowledge in insurance.
good,This job was good but I needed a change. I worked for great nurses and great patients. The management was not great. Bean counters is what they were and really didn't care about the workers
good,I enjoyed learning all the software programs.  Assisting the customers was fun and rewarding.  I did not work there for a long period of time because it was seasonal.
good,"The only thing constant is change and there is always something new to learn. Great management , difficult to move up once in the customer service role"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I loved working here but the they had very poor management i would work over a 100 hours and never got recognition,  they had to let me go because i had got injured and had to go to the chiropractors office and they said i missed to many days"
good,"great stepping stone into many health business careers. The hours are great for students pay is ok typical call center environment. younger employees, management seems to care"
good,I sold medicare advantage plans via incoming calls to eligible customers that met the criteria for medicare.  I recommended products on specific needs of the customer through a needs analysis.
good,"UHC us a good company to work for, but management in individual offices can be based and demotivating. However, you can still make  your money and try to advance in other departments."
good,"I worked in the call center ( Benefit advocate) and if you enjoy clueless management and only focusing on numbers and stats, instead of actually helping people-- this is the job for you."
good,"United Health has competitive benefits which was great. Working from home probably would have been great. United Health Optumrx was a little stressful for me, however my o workers were amazing.  United Healthcare isn't fr everyone."
good,Great benefits and hours to work however management is not to keen on current updated information in which slowly stifles their advantage to compete with similar companies.
good,I was a claims adjuster. You had to be completely quiet up to 10am every day. I was trained to process claims then as soon as I finished training I was put into training to correct or adjust claims. I did not have a choice on the training and had not even processed claims before thrown in to correct claims.
good,Did not enjoy work life balance with UHG. Meetings over the lunch hour are a regular occurrence. Head down at all times kind of job. Business's have consistent change.
good,Good company to work for but not so for career advancement with the company. The benefits are great but the flexibility not so much. There is a lot of lateral move but advancement more for my career.
good,strong company to work for with good benefits but can be very stressful but will get good training some department have flex schedule which is a fringe benefit.
good,"It was an interesting place to work.  Very cutthroat in some ways, but also very team oriented in others.  It is far away from st. louis proper, which was difficult, but they do have work at home options."
good,I was a customer service rep. I helped  people on medicare get health coverage. This was not only for medical but also getting coverage for prescription medication.
good,I liked this company. It was  very comfy atmospher and I was comfortable. The job did not allow too much advancement however and there were not raises for me after being there for 2 full years.
good,"For the last two years of my employment with UHC I was a telecommuter. I started my day @ 6:00 AM most days although my work hours were 7:00 AM - 3:30 PM. I was doing telephonic Case Management originally and then became full time Utilization Review for Workers Compensation for the Clark County School District, State of Nevada and Benchmark Administrators out of California."
good,"My job had a remote option, very nice team to work with, professionalism, average compensation, my manager was decent man, good professional but very worked out."
good,"I'll say that my department has terrible management and pay that's below the industry standard locally despite what they try and get you to believe. That said; the benefit package is awesome and I get about 5 weeks of PTO (give or take a few days). Also, most departments really do make an effort at employee engagement and to foster a positive culture. I would actually highly recommend this company but steer clear of the claims department."
good,"Not my favorite place. Decent scheduling and salary. Production requirements compromised quality. Good benefits package including vision, dental, life and retirement."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"United Health Group overall is a good employer. The department I worked for was continually understaffed and employees were expected to work overtime. The pay for my position was not competitive with the market and I left for a $9,800 increase and less hours."
good,Loved the working environment and the employees. Wonderful company and benefits..received training constantly to help me be successful. Great leadership team
good,I worked at United Health a long time ago.  It was a great job to do when I left college.  They gave me the confidence to get into the work force and meet new and exciting people
good,This was a temporary assignment.   I will say they provided a assessment test prior to working the assignment.  The test consist of ethics and empathy dealing with customers.
good,"Good work environment to go to everyday, had a blast working there, and was really sad when i had to move, i would recommend them to any of my friends."
good,"Merit based on production only. I was a non-exempt employee. I was not allowed to log in early or after my shift to review emails or study job aids, etc."
good,"Big, matrixed company: slow moving and hard to navigate.  If one is resourceful, there is good potential for a good career.  HDQ is based in MN, not attractive to many."
good,"Constant organizational change and job eliminations caused stressful work environment.  Focus on culture of Integrity, Compassion, Innovation, and Performance in work and personal life was refreshing."
good,"During training you're taught a lot about the company as a whole and wind up forgetting most of it, on top of that there is the continued issue of the trainers equipment failing so that they are not able to train properly. By not having the proper equipment, or at least the equipment they had, maintained properly they provide a bad  learning experience for the subject matter at hand which is one dealing with peoples health care and therefore their personal health."
good,UHG is the leader in health plans.  Clear direction from senior leadership.  Strategy and org structure is solid.  Disadvantage to this is upward mobility is difficult.
good,Breakfast and lunch setting business dinning account. Improve P&L performance. Little upper management support / oversight. Great workplace culture.  Leaving was the hardest part of the job. My team was the best part of my Job.
good,"typical insurance company, lots of cogs doing their job."
good,It’s been several years since I worked at this organization. I changed jobs because of the increased pressure and workload. My manager because someone in a different city whom I’d never met.
good,"2 15 min breaks and 30 min lunch. No other time off phones to use bathroom."
good,"heavy case load, 24 hours turn around on all calls.  Need more support from manager.  Need more training from the company.  IT was difficult to reach at time."
good,"The company has bad medical benefits for empolyees, not enough"
good,"UHG can be a good company; however it is quite stingy with its compensation like most giant corporate companies. When it decided to hire  new people with higher salary than increasing the salary of current employees, that's when you know you have to go..."
good,"I was excited about working for United Healthcare when i started, i love my co-workers and the company itself but the unrealistic expectations set by management and the micromanaging style i loathe. They set performance goals that are unreachable due to the amount of work we receive daily it would only make sense to lower the number of completed task expected, but instead we get emailed constantly about how were not meeting expections etc. The job itself s easy and laid back but the unneccassary pressure and constantly being told you’re not doing enough just makes u want to go elsewhere."
good,"No raises, management sucked. it was a lot working for Wipro. They had bed bugs and still expected workers to come in. Just a disgrace. The people that I met while working there made the job worth it though."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,busy and  recurring meeting. Lots to learn and improve the system. Transformational programs in transit and get to work on new and exciting technologies.
good,"Fast paced, nice people, very good training process. Learned a lot about insurance! Was relaxed and we got to wear jeans! Hardest part was keeping call times low."
good,"Loved working at the incoming health care call center. It was fast paced, friendly, competitive place. Employer s could win awars if they applied they self in many different ways. It was also a very team going place."
good,The Ingenix organization was never certain what they wanted to be. A seller of consulting services to companies re: workmen compensations issues or the seller of the software that may help these same companies with their workmen compensation processes
good,"United is a great company to work at. They have great leadership. I work around 65 hours a week and I am exempt, so no overtime. They are always changing which makes for a good change agent skills."
good,People in management don't understand the daily tasks of employees under them. Work with your people to get a better idea of what will make them happy.
good,People were nice and good benefits overall.  Plenty of opportunities for advancement with multiple locations. People move around internally often. PTO are generous.
good,"I was a temp waiting to get into school. The job served a purpose and I wasn't there for long, but I liked the people I worked with and for. I've know others who worked for them longer and really like the culture."
good,okay place to work fast paced Monday through Friday job with the occasional Saturday. a lot of great training to help you along your way. must watch for errors very closely. very good job for a detail oriented person
good,"Pros"
good,It was an average company to work for...the employees were great..the Insurance premiums for employees were great as well....I never had a problem with my immediate manager either
good,There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Just a regular office job. Just was not a good fit for me. Management was ok. Typical day at work was what I would assume any typical office job would be like.
good,The job description should have  been better defined. Once hired it was different than how it was described. Scheduling was determined by how well you did in training which could be a disadvantage to those who may have struggled a bit.
good,Good Managers with strong technical skills and domain knowledge. Very kind manager and senior Management is very open to ground employees. Place where family can work together.
good,Great place to work if one is either Brilliant performer with exceptional Sales Skills or someone who can withstand and manage the Management with a Yes Always attitude.
good,Its an okay environment. You will be working from the time you come in until the time you will leave. You receive 2 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch.
good,"Very good Medicare/ Medicare Plus products for seniors"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,very nice company to work for. enjoyed every aspect of my position. prepared for future jobs in the health insurance industry. wonderful management and colleagues. always sympathetic to life situations.
good,"UnitedHealth Group is an enormous and growing company with a diverse set of businesses spanning Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare plans."
good,Good job but very stressful at times.The rate of pay isn't where it should be for everything you have to do and learn on a continuing basis.Has a nice cafeteria.
good,"The company's culture is great, but they do not really apply their culture to call center employee's. If you get a job in their call center you can expect to learn alot, be challenged more than any other position, and to be completely drained after a busy work day. Taking back to back calls and upper management not caring at all about anything that could help make your job easier. When we complain of c all volume or policies that make the position more challenging we are basically told to get over it as we work in a call center. Benefits are great, but the job itself in the call center is stressful."
good,Everything was computer based.  Call center work having ti related to people from all over the country and handle their needs. Being able to relate to people i quick conversation.
good,"The nation’s premier provider of high quality, personalized public sector health care programs. Supervised and developed a team of 20-25 Member Service Representatives that provided customer support to members, customers and providers"
good,"all kinds of calls and they want sales and do member services transfer which supposes not to be part of our job."
good,UHG is a wonderful place to work at. This company gives me the confidence that I need to go for a lead position. I had some of the most experienced people at my
good,The culture at United was poor.  Lot's of back stabbing and cut throat environment.  They really don't look to develop talent.  Just use them and through the employees away
good,"The San Antonio location was ok. Typical call center setting, very micro managed and employees never had a voice. There was a lot of quotas to be met and when they were not met, you were treated poorly."
good,Unattainable goals.  Making the job stressful and daily leaving you feeling  inadequate. Collaboration start but rarely are finished in the direction that is was started in.
good,A typical day is between 8-12 hrs a day depending on if you have business required overtime. I learned how to pick up information easier and learn my systems and process of how to get things done more efficiently. Depending on the team the workplace culture can be quiet or loud from being on the phone with customers and providers all day. The hardest part about my job is when things change and it isn't communicated effectively and one must learn to adjust as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part is see the people who are willing to help you get through your day with a smile and a better understanding of how to get your job done.
good,I'm interested in all aspects of healthcare working here helped me gain a better understanding of insurance which in turn would help me realize I wanted to work directly with patients.
good,"I love working with customer and helping as needed, but the job training was very accelerated. Had to learn a lot of information in a short period of time."
good,"Good company to work for, but stressful. I had a great supervisor who was willing to put in the work to get me to where I needed to be in my stats and to advance in my career."
good,United Health Group is a nice place to work with solid values and a broad mission to help people live healthier lives.   Busy fast paced environment that focuses on the customer.
good,"They are ok to work for. I was hired as a contract employee and they try to make you a part of the culture however there is a difference made between contract and non-contract employees. Training is not that great if they do not ""like"" you. There is preference given to some but not all."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Process AZ Medicaid Claims in a fairly relaxed environment. Management is always available for assistance and guidance. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a constant pace while processing.
good,"While working at United I meet some nice people , but the job is very stressful. You can't spent to much time on the phone with the member because you get counted against. More word load is piled up and constant calls non stop."
good,"Nothing to say about this company, Tell you that you are working for a dept but then you go some \I have nothing else to say about this company at all"
good,Great place to work! I love the work environment. People are great to work with and the benefits are nice. They should pay a bit for the work but the benefits are good.
good,"good job. I learned a lot"
good,I was brought in as a contractor to work the annual Medicare part D program. I was originally brought in for three months but continued on for 6 months.
good,The job is a pretty good place to work.  They do have some challenges but they are an overrall really good company. They have good hours and are flexible. You can be comfortable as well.
good,"The company is fine, small team although an international company. Very varied, dealing with clients needs and contractors so every day can be different."
good,"I believe that the company could do better. I would love to write a good report on how the company operates. Nonetheless, there are consultants that get pay to do reports on companies"
good,I really enjoyed working there. I was only a temp for a six month job during their busy enrollment period. The lunches were great and the facility was always clean.
good,"I was able to work in multiple areas, including appeals & grievances, Inpatient Case Management, High Dollar Case Review, and Project Management. A typical workday is a telecommute position, starting at 8 am - 5 pm with around 1 hour for lunch, Monday through Friday. "
good,"They were ok to work for, the hours were really tough with having a small child though. The management is nice, the people who work there are really friendly."
good,"Good company to work for, performs well in stock market.  "
good,"Nothing special about working here compared to previous employments. It is a job, and can be made into a career. Some people will excel, others can use this as a medium between jobs. Nothing sets this particular job apart from other large companies offering the same type of employment."
good,"In the beginning, I had no idea about the purpose of being a telephonic Nurse case manager but I found out that it is both fun and challenging and sometimes even rewarding. We get to create a relationship with both colleagues and patients and help them deal and eventually manage the condition they have or at the very list listen and try to assist them in achieving the goals and reinforcing the ones in place."
good,"Oversee the registration and admitting department at the Emergency Room of California"
good,A very nice place to work and very clean. Everyone was helpful with everything. Training was hard. I worked there through a temp service. Pay was very good. Hours and schedule was excellent.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"My job required me to contact customers and resolve issues for the applications assigned to me to support.  At 3rd level support, these are tickets that 1st and 2nd level are unable to resolve.  The hardest part of the job was switching of management.  In my 9 and 1/2 years, I had 6 different managers.  It was exhausting having to constantly adjust to each manager's style of supervising."
good,"Averaged 70-80 calls per day. A certain amount of your calls were audited. Dealt with a lot of angry customers. Complex computer programs, double monitor."
good,"Not prepared for the amount of work that was needed. So there is mandatory overtime at all times.  Because of the need for work, proper training has suffered."
good,"Company is fine. Not good regarding work life balance. Salary is fine. Rest , you will get to know once you are selected in the company. It is in the multiple locations as well."
good,It was an ok job Telecomunnication  using computer and calling the elderly about their health insurance they always didn’t understand which was hard to explain to them sometimes
good,it is ok....ok work environment the people are great to work with. I just did not like the supervision or upper management it was a little to political for my taste
good,"You will learn a lot about healthcare insurance working here. It's so much information It can be overwhelming. Your day can either be relaxed or very busy. Overall for me, it was just what I needed being my first call center."
good,"UHG offers stability, and good structure. There are pitfalls in the organization. Work life balance is a huge part of culture; however, I don't see this happening on my current team. Salary increases for excellent performance are not as large as they should be, and are not even consistent with rising inflation. The opportunity to promoted from within is also very difficult."
good,"I worked in callcenter environment and it was fine if you like working in that type of atmosphere. There was a lot of"
good,United HealthCare is a very fast paced company with many processes and procedures that change constantly. There is not very much room for growth or promotions.
good,"Good place to work. I was part of their CareTracker team which was sold. From what I remember, the corporate culture was descent.Good place to work. I would recommend a friend."
good,"The environment is good, people are either really friendly and helpful or completely opposite. There's no in between. Same with managers, really  great or really awful. There are a lot of activities and ways to get involved. The most difficult aspect is the work/life balance ...or lack there of. Most people about a certain pay grade put in much more than 50 hours per week. On a slow week I usually worked around 60 hrs/wk."
good,"This was my second tour with UHG.  My first was years ago and I LOVED IT!  My manager was awesome, my team was awesome.  I only left when they decided to leave Atlanta for a short amount of time (I was offered relocation to Albuquerque, NM or severance).  "
good,"The training was intense, a lot to absorb, however the trainer made sure every new hire in the class was comfortable with the content of the training. If anyone had a question, he would slow down or go over the topic with the whole class."
good,A decent place to work.The balance of work/home is off balance at UHC so keep that in mind when applying there. It is best to be computer literate BEFORE starting to work there.
good,"I enjoyed my time at UHG, I wish there were more accommodations for those needing to work at home. Seemed to be a lengthy and based on favor situation."
good,"The transaction department has become very rigid. Employees must account for time spent away from their desk outside of breaks and lunch, this includes using the restroom outside of those times. The employee must account for ""idle"" time which could be explained when an employee needs to look up and read the documentation on how to process a claim correctly.The transaction department is treated like robots. It was not always this way. With new management came a lack of understanding and compassion towards employees needs. Other areas of the business are able to work from home 2 days a week, do fun team activities and volunteer work on company time. "
good,Working for United Health Care can be very stress full. There is a Leet team that plans different activities for all the employees at United Health Care. This activities help with the stress level at work.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The Fellow Software Engineers are very smart people, and it is always a pleasure to collaborate with colleagues there."
good,The most enjoyable thing about this job was helping all the customers.Also the time can make your job go by really quick because you are explaining prescription drug plant to customers.
good,I've worked there for 5 years and I've seen people come and go. If you're looking for something that meets your essential needs then work there. But I would not stay there for too long. Turnover is high in some locations and they pick who they want to move up in the company.
good,Originally hired as a temp for a Monday thru Friday position.  Once hired pay rare went down and hours included weekends and as late as a 11:00 pm and changing every quarter based on your performance.
good,The very busy office handled incoming Customer calls regarding their health insurance policies. Employees were helpful as were the team leaders. The office was easy for me to get to on a daily basses. Overtime was offered.
good,I enjoyed working here.  I had a great time in training and in class and working on escalated calls.  But Management is cut throat when it comes to production.
good,"Great place to work, lots of opportunities. I have enjoyed many different roles while with the organization. As with any company, there are great leaders and those with opportunities. Overall great place to work and advance."
good,"It was primarily about the shareholders and the C-Level prosperity.  lower minions were not really given much consideration (e.g., for being one of the leading insurance providers, their own employee coverage was lacking)"
good,Average company - it is very stressful.  I am not going to get into any more detail at this time because I currently work in this position and I am not going to jeopardize my job.
good,"good company, however, expectations of minutes to be on a call were unrealistic.  it seems mgt more concerned about statistics than member care.  mgt  allowed employees to be independent when handling customer service calls, and usually were available if we needed help."
good,They provided the classes for the CPhT. There had been a recent merger so the workplace culture was still evolving. It was a call center so typically day was assisting customers with questions and medication orders.
good,"A typical day for me is in front of two computer monitors the entire day processing commercial and medicaid claims.  I learned a lot about claims and different provider contracts.  The management is cool, I rarely see my managers because we're all typically at our desk all day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is not having someone looming over my shoulder all day or feeling like my work is being picked apart for all the wrong reasons.  I can come into work, do my job in peace, and go home."
good,"fast paced, unpredictable, management is not stable but it provides a good place to work for some type of money. it will help you to build customer service skills."
good,"typical day can be stressful , if you are on the phone with a customer and your morning break in due you usually will lose your break as you cannot take it later.  Same with lunch and afternoon break."
good,"I learned alot there with medical, dental and vision benefits. I would have liked to spend more time helping our patients, but we had a matrix with call times. Our hold time was very long."
good,"Change is inevitable and to be expected, but almost too frequently and this causes a lot of confusion in daily workflows. Upper management seems to value quantity over quality when it comes to performance, and do not seem to understand what are practical/attainable daily job expectations to meet the needs of the members.   Some of the newer performance demands put extreme levels of stress on employees to compromise their company core values of integrity and compassion for the sake of meeting metrics and matching the bottom line."
good,I feel that they can improve there social skills and treat everyone fair in the work environment and being apart of the team felt like I a great opportunity.
good,Got to learn a lot about new technology and health-care domain. Great addition in my career path. Enjoyed working and learning. Good management and teammates.
good,Inbound Call Center. Worked with senior citizen concerning their benefits and their claims.  Helped the caller set up appointments with their providers or specialists.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"United is a great company if you want to move around the country, but that is challenging. The coordination of benefits dept is redundant, lots of meetings."
good,"Not enough progressive culture changes. Company lacks strong leadership that supports middle management. There are high expectations in a fast-paced, ever changing environment. They are technically advanced, but lack the right amount of people skills to retain quality employees."
good,"Lots of incoming calls comes in. I learned to multi-task with eight systems in order to do my job. Management help to answer question with the different insurance laws that was change. The work place was good, and lot of nice people of all ages. The hardest part of the job was answering every questions that marketing insurance agent had for their customers. I enjoyed learning different insurance policies."
good,"My experience I obtained with working with UHC; was self-motivation, organization, time-management and accuracy.  I also was able to relate well to people from a variety of cultures and social backgrounds."
good,I enjoyed working at UNH.  the location was too far at the time and I had to leave and find another job.  it was a great plan to work for and it was very hard to leave the company
good,I enjoy working for UHG but you have to be ready to deal with the constant changes and the workload. There is a never a dull moment and you have make sure you balance your personal and work life because they can become enmeshed with a job like case management. It is enjoyable being with the members and helping them get services they didn't have and needed. The expressions of gratitude are priceless. That part I love!
good,could be stressful at times learned a lot about health care insurance an policys enjoyed talking an giving excellent customer service to our customers
good,I liked the fact that it was a safe area and that there was security on site. Even on the weekends they were there to make sure we felt safe and protected when no one else was around.
good,"ok place to work, some good people but job is fast paced and can be stressful and not a lot of room for advancement. The work environment is constantly changing."
good,Very large company. The stated objectives of the business sometimes  seemed to be at odds with what the development teams were asked to do. More clarity of goals and getting that information disseminated would help.
good,"A empresa cumpre com os benefícios estabelecidos em convenção , plano de saúde com coparticipação, paga em dia."
good,"Management was not good in the department where I was. However, this is a very large company and I know it varies widely and I may have stayed had I found a better job with the company."
good,I was a subcontractor so I really didn't work for UHC. thus my input is not really relevant in this situation. I was a Manager for a Sub Contractor to UHC.
good,"Being that it was a Insurance Company you work for, The Medical and vision Benefits were horrendous. Obtain Benefits elsewhere. You were mico managed to the extreme, i.e breaks, work activity on your system. It was bad."
good,"It is a great place to work. The environment is relaxed and the employees are nice. They have great benefits, such as a 401k and stock options. I would recommend working here."
good,"*Less Salary"
good,"The salary for this position is not competitive for the number of enrollments we are expected to get.  This department, ESS,  should be sales since the quota is so high and their should be an achievable bonus structure for all employees."
good,"You undergo 6 weeks of training which does not help much on the floor. It is pretty much a sink or swim environment you have to learn from your mistakes, but you are held accountable for those mistakes. Co-workers are friendly. Depending on your manager will determine how much help you receive if you're struggling. It's a high call volume position that can be a little stressful. The building/office is nice and clean."
good,When at work we usually solve problems or issue from clients or insurance customers about their pharmaceutical needs. We also check what program is good for our clients.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I loved my manager but it was very low pay, hard to move around within the company, and we had to pay to park in the garage.  The health insurance was expensive too."
good,"I experienced discrimination because of my age and skin color at UHC. My work was not appreciated.Working for this company would have been fine, if not for Management. I went to Training twice and tried to tell them that there was aproblem. I was ignored."
good,every things is very unpersonable and you cant not get the answers you need. must be willing to figue things out on your own with little to no guidance
good,I enjoyed working for uhgtfor 24 years. My position was downsided which was completely unexpected. I am hoping return uhg or find similar position ASAP.
good,"Working at UHC further strengthened my organizational skills.  In order to succeed at UHC you must be highly organized due to the day-to-day volume of work.  "
good,A lot of Micro-Management within the company. A lot of things that they do is not necessary. I guess it is good for people on the phone doing Customer Service. It is hard to move up and move around to other departments .
good,"Enjoyed the home visits, determining needs of the members and locating any resources. Case loads become high quickly and you find yourself working evenings and weekends. I had a great mentor who was helpful with all aspects of the position."
good,"United healthcare is a fast paced work place. United healthcare put the member, the insured first, with the member's satisfaction as a priority. The company is strong on integrity, compassion an innovation."
good,Stressful with much 'expected' overtime.
good,"process prior authorization for commercial and medicare patient s in a timely manner , always exceeding quota. Taking time to meet patient needs going above and beyond . If medication could not be approved technician level sending to pharmacist or medical director"
good,"High call volume with minimal breaks. Not recommended for those who can not sit in one place for very long. Management leaves something to be desired and unless someone leaves, promotions are nonexistent. Unfortunately the supervisors that are there, while are severely lacking in leadership skills, unless they do something really heinous they will not be leaving anytime soon."
good,Nice place to work at the staff was friendly.  Would have like to worked there on a regular basis.  I learned a lot about different insurances that are offered to the public.
good,"I think it really depends on your drive as well as the department and office building you are in. In Minnesota I was in call for years with no advancement though worked many skills. I moved to a different location and was up 2 pay grade levels in 5 months... it can be exhausting because there is a lot of ""who kisses butt better"" but so is corporate world I guess"
good,The work load was heavy. Took many incoming calls back to back. The hardest part of the job was talking all day long and having a dry throat by the end of the day.
good,"Fun, energetic work place to be in however personal accomplishments and goals are not acknowledged by upper management. It is very very hard to grow within the company."
good,"UHG is very progressive in its work from home policies (pay for employee internet, extremely trusting of WFH employees), which is wonderful. Roles also tend to be relatively stable and folks often work there for many years. But UHG can be extremely non-competitive in terms of salary, raises, and actual bonus payouts, which is very disheartening in the long run. They are also very dependent on a number of older technologies, and this concerns me as an IT professional -- am I learning what I need to learn to stay relevant and hireable in the future?"
good,Uhc is a good company to start with but had difficulty in cultivating employees that were great at 1 or 2 tasks because they spread there agents thin by placing duties of several different departments upon you. It makes for a high stress situation but it doesn't have to be this way if they work on having this balance.
good,"The people were great, but the pressure to perform and the stress that accompanied that pressure was unbelievable. Having to, occasionally, call elderly people and ask for money was too much."
good,The place isnt that bad per se. It has its advantages for a healthcare facility. The work and systems in place are easy to learn and take care of most of the work. The culture is definitely who you know and how much butt to kiss if you want to advance. Definitely will get overlooked if you want to be judged on your hard work.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Optum acquired the company I worked for.  The workplace culture is dry and uninspiring; however, the stress is low.  I feel like a just another number in the Optum world and all the creative intellect has left the company."
good,requires staying updated on all policies and procedures.  Multitasking is key.  Fast paced environment and requires self motivation and self learning.
good,"This ""big"" company uses Video interviews even for management levels, which is lazy and silly."
good,"UHC is a good starter job for people looking for job security and develop work experience. Once you are ready to make different career moves, it becomes a bit more challenging of a job, as opportunities for growth aren't readily available."
good,Answering incoming calls of insurance members and doctor offices to advise what insurance benefits are.  Would go over claim information with clients.
good,"Did Not find efficient growth."
good,It is hard to make a living on commission even if you work extreme hours.  I have a hard time making a living on commission.  I need a job with hourly pay.
good,answering questions as the ojt coach making sure the trainees understood their jobs.  worked with management to make sure policies where in place. workplace was mixed culture.  keeping up with all the training classes. coaching
good,"The Company is a good company to work for, i however feel that they give the supervisors a little too much control, so if he or she does not like you then it becomes a problem."
good,Very little interaction with others. More of a quiet and secluded work environment. Not much oppertunity as this was a temporary job assignment. Once need was over job ended
good,"Great company great environment great location"
good,middle of the road call center that offered good bennefits but relatively low pay at the time. not much else to say and things have probably changed in the 6 years that I worked there
good,Challenging work; learned a lot.  Demanding on the executive level regularly worked 12-15 hour days and on weekends.  Experienced and caring colleagues in the C-suite.  Changes at the corporate level halfway through the contract raised the challenge level as perspective shifted from maximizing service to members to generating profits.  I watched entire divisions eliminated because the return on investment was not high enough to meet corporate demands.  Disappointed when contract ended as the change from implementation to maintenance revolved around profits and not member's needs.
good,"It has some shortcomings in implemented software databases.  The code was developed by non-programmers and is difficult to work with in given time frames.  However, the business gave me a fair paycheck for the work I performed and for that I can be appreciative."
good,"Empresa com uma boa remuneração, ambiente bom para trabalhar"
good,"I never once worked at United Health Group, so there's not much i can say in regards to the work environment and such. Please take my review with a grain of salt."
good,"UHC provides excellent training and technology. Typical day is long and exhausting. The most enjoyable part of job is the members who need help, the hardest part of the job is the members who do not really need the help and take advantage of the services provided."
good,"taking incoming calls "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,empresa boa para trabalho não tinha o que reclamar .
good,"United Healthcare is a very good company to work for. My experience here is very positive however, I feel that the job security and advance is lacking a little with this company."
good,United HealthGroup is a fun place to work but some of the companies under their umbrella do not possess the same work ethic.  The hardest part of the job is management.
good,Big company with some really good pockets and some really horrible ones.  Really depends on the culture within your area and leadership.  Not the best but not the worst
good,Benefits at par with general competition; career path lacks rigor and structure; feeling of nepotism on certain teams which is demotivating to passionate high performers.
good,"Back to back to back calls mandatory overtime great pay, constant changes. there is room for advancement, paid vacations. optin to work for double pay"
good,"Overall the company is just ok. They have a decent track for advancement, but it really depends on what part of the organization you work in. The pay is not competitive nor on par for a company of it's size and profitability."
good,"There were no benefits offered as we were causal employees. The training was eight weeks and it was very informative but the on hand experience was limited because not able to hear calls or shadow, we were experimental group in Atlanta"
good,"It has been 10+ years since I worked for UnitedHealth but based on it's current performance, it is clear that it has strong leadership. The company has grown it's technology force and is clearly the industry leader."
good,"Frequently the path to true success was blocked by the unwillingness of management to embrace the NEED for complete resolution to problems.  Further, that failure clouded their ability to be agile and responsive to an ever changing landscape,"
good,Working at United Healthcare was a challenge due to the efforts made to ensure accurate information was provided in a limited and fast paced environment.
good,"The job is a inbound call only job, unless you're working in sales and its during Open Enrollment. The job mainly employs temps for Open Enrollment period (October-December), but you are required 4-6 week training prior. The payments/billing part of the job is easy, once you cross into claims and dealing with providers, it starts to get stressful as you're getting yelled at often. The main customers I dealt with were Medicare insured members with AARP. You are supposed to hard sell/renew AARP memberships as well. Because its mainly temps, the management between the temp agency and client was extremely unorganized. Schedules were full of miscommunication, as well as the incentives and bonuses. It was just too much. Overall, the building and grounds are nice. It has a marketplace in the cafeteria which is great if you don't drive, since all other fast food is driving distance away. Not the worse job in the world, but not my cup of tea."
good,"The job requirements are unclear, what is clear is that this company cares more about their profit than they do their employees. They make their call time frames unattainable and do not give their employees the needed support"
good,"Not told when being moved to another position, not discussed ahead of time. Alot of stressful situations throughout the day. It's a huge company,  so you do feel like a number to them and not a person"
good,"if you are looking for a job and you have little or no desire for advancement then this place is for you. If you have a desire to do NON call center related work then do NOT take a call center job believing the promises for advancement. The call center at UHC is a dark abyss were there is no escape. Does it happen....yes.....but there are those who hit the Power Ball  .... There are positions within the call center that are attainable but you are STILL in the call center.  Personally, I have earned my degree while working at UHC, I earn Top Performer status the majority of the time, other times being very close and have never been on any type of disciplinary action for any reason. I have applied to dozens of positions over the past two years and have never gotten one single interview for jobs outside of the call center!!!"
good,very face passed constant phone calls coming through needed to be very productive or your numbers would go down and that wasn't tolerated by your supervisor
good,"When I worked there, United Healthcare had recently bought PacifiCare and were still going through major transitions.  The culture had shifted.  It felt like it was less about people and the experience and more about metrics.  Lots of people were laid off in every department and it was very chaotic."
good,"high stress, management is not very understanding or available, employees are  not paid based on customer service role or seniority, imply family oriented but some mangers/supervisors are not, give raises to employees that are  not upper management material"
good,"I left there long time ago when Catamaran had not been bought by United Health Group, so I cannot give a review about UHG. I still have some friends working there, they all work from home..."
good,Fast paced environment with mandatory overtime and hard let downs.  The most enjoyable part being helping an elderly person get that coverage or medication that they need and the hardest part is not being able to do it for them despite them having paid an exuberant rate and or jumping through a series of hoops and runarounds.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Great Benefits and pay. Company moved 3 times in 2 years - roller coaster. When I began there - I was working there, I began as a Travelers's employee, they merged with Met Life, then Met Life was purchased by United. So much change in a short period"
good,I did not enjoy the process. I was hired to help with the transition to a new medical coding and billing system but I did not have much to do with the process besides porting issues with it. I was not directly a part of resolving issues. This was boring to me.
good,Glad Im gone. It was not the best place to work at but Im glad for the information I learned and the people that I had gained as well. Just because my time wasnt the best doesnt mean that someone elses isnt going to be better than mine.
good,"This is a good company for a step up from phone customer service. There is a good chance for telecommuting but not too much room for advancement. The company is based back East so for individuals located on the West coast, it can be challenging. For management, it is hit or miss. You are assigned a supervisor and hopefully, they are a good one."
good,"The company is not about the people or community it serves, it is about the dollar figure at all times.  Most companies take disability's of there employees as they care, this one does not."
good,"A empresa bem agradável,   boa para o serviço de atendimentos ao cleiente pronto socorro ,  Agradável com bons companheiros sempre disposto a ensinar , serviço com horário agradáveis e bem versátil."
good,"It was a fun and quick paced job. The only issue I had was it felt as though I was selling people their free benefits, if they said they were not interested in the benefit we needed to push back and try to convince them. I am not a sales person so this aspect of the job was difficult for me."
good,Contacting  the elderly to speak with a doctor in regards to their medications and current aliments. Making sure that their insurance was still in good standing.
good,"There really is no such thing as a typical day.  Every day poses new challenges and issues with patients, coworkers, and providers. I have learned to take constant interruptions from providers and coworkers with questions and assistance with things. Hardest part of the job is being able to multi task efficiently.  The most enjoyable part for me if the patients and my coworkers."
good,It was difficult at times to meet the handle times and other performance factors and provide the type of customer service I felt should have been delivered.
good,"Um bom lugar para trabalhar, ótima localização com fácil acesso a linhas de ônibus."
good,They could have a better atmosphere. Management didn't really check on you when you're new to make sure that things were going okay. And there were times that I had to wait 10-15 mins for management to help me with a customer.
good,"Because the work is data entry, it is a heads down environment. You are expected to meet metrics every day.  Work is based on production, which is reward every quarter if your metrics have been met."
good,"The company does hire within, which is great. You have the ability to work from home in certain departments. Management only seems to care about numbers and numbers alone. The pay is very much on the low side. Job duties that are outlined are not the same once you are hired. As a Clinical Admin, you have heavy phone work with little to zero downtime. Your entire shift is monitored in the system. Goals seem unrealistic. I wish it was more about helping the member with their condition vs. getting an enrollment for a goal."
good,"CFO and CEO left much to be desired"
good,"High stress level, competition was high. Long hours, working weekends. Team oriented. Fast paced, fact learning. Independent roles and responsibilities."
good,Do your research thoroughly. They do have a ton of positions but not many for management. I do enjoy working for them and the convenience of working from home.
good,"From what I could tell working here could be great although I was a part of an acquisition and was laid off before we fully integrated, so am unable to speak on it further."
good,inbound call center providing quality customer service to consumers. Learned about the insurance claims de-escalating calls lots of room for advancement
good,I enjoyed my time at this company but due to promises that have not been kept from upper management that was my reason for leaving the company. Otherwise great place.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A good place to learn and grow."
good,"Working as a department assistant and had more to offer.  However, the experience i received from working there helped with my office skills.  Better opportunities where to come."
good,handling patient billing regarding claims that may have paid incorrect or not paid at all. sometime providers called for billing information for the pt
good,"The skills I developed while being employed with UHC are unmatched and I am forever grateful for the experience. Management made my job really hard, my immediate supervisor was all about making herself look good no matter the cost. I held two positions within this company ....within a 3 year window I went from earning 13$ per hour to 18.50$ per hour before quitting. The pay is satisfying but the culture became unbearable to deal with. Change is sometimes good but a lot of times changes were made to my job roles without any formal training or real hands on efforts to ensure our jobs were done effectively."
good,"I have been working in united health group from 6 years the salary hike is very average and work experience also not that good,  transport facility is bad"
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and get to your desk and ready your self to answer phone calls. People there are friendly. The hardest part of the job would be upset callers.
good,A typical day at work consists of phone calls and speaking with providers to ensure that the daily tasks are completed//////////////////////////////////
good,"No room for advancement, tied to a chair with lots of micro management. High productions requirements with a lot of expectations. No management support."
good,"This is a national company that has opportunities throughout the U.S.  they offer great salary, but I'm finding it difficult to advance in Ohio.  I think there will be a greater opportunity advancing in another state"
good,I have not worked for this company in over 11 years and it would not be fair to the company to rate them based on my past experience which has been quite sometime ago.
good,"They do help the community in local charities to assist needy people.  This is a very large organization in which at times an employee can feel lost in the system. It is based largely on culture to help the senior citizens or members which are on Medicare to have a trouble free  membership. It is very heavily based on teamwork within the smaller areas like updates from government reports, as well as each larger area like enrollment or billing. The hardest part of the job I'd have to say would be in working each members issues to be correctly reviewed and updated or answered correctly if I wouldn't be able to assist with their request."
good,"Not likely "
good,I worked as an App Developer supporting mainly two different systems. One was an older legacy system running on VMS and the other was a web based system running on WebSphere on Unix servers.
good,"The pay, benefits and hours are great. However call center representative jobs are  extremely stressful and overwhelming mostly due to the significant lack in meaningful and applicable training experiences. I went onto the floor feeling extremely unprepared for what was expected of me. It's a sink or swim mentality that leads to high turn-over rates. If you stick with it, it does get easier, but the lack in communication and inconsistent information being provided raises stress levels and takes away the ability to feel successful. "
good,I like the company until my position was eliminated. A typical day at work was not stressful but well balanced.  The company supports a life balance work environment.
good,Stressful enviroment. You are only allowed to use the restroon during your breaks.The calls are timed and if you are unable to meet that you are written up even if it meant you spent a little extra with a client so they could understan their benefits a little better.
good,"This is a good company to start at if you are newly getting out into the work field."
good,"was a good place to work with decent benefits. the other employees were easy to get along with as well as management. they have a fitness center, cafe and doctor on site."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Faced paced work environment. Leadership at the time had the ability to help mentor and develop talent. Tuition reimbursement was very helpful in furthering my education.
good,Great environment work place with no cell phone policy. Solved problems in under 10 mins with great call handling time. Computer savy and typing under 65wpm while multitasking
good,Good job to learn about insurance and many aspects of healthcare. Management should learn how to have less of a micro managing attitude. Should have more positions for support staff.
good,Mundane work unless you were favored by management and could work projects.  Most supervisors were not capable of handling their positions.  No opportunity to move into other groups within United Health Group.
good,"i love working with the people there include my supervisor, but not so much about management. That's all i have to say. In my opinion and the opinion of so many employees that had left before me. i think they all will feel the same that management never had they back. But don't get me wrong it's a great place to work."
good,Because this was a third party biller we were divided by Client. Our client was leaving and management had a meeting with the team and told us they were not. In our client management meeting they told management they were leaving but we were not allowed to tell employees.
good,"I started off in the Pharmacy Department,  at OptumRX, and worked several department that entails data processing, Claims Adjudication, Traditional Mail Prescriptions, and prior Authorization.  After 3 years in Pharmacy Department, I transferred to the Military and Veterans Enrollment and Eligibility Department, where I am more exposed to the insurance and benefit sides of the patients.  The Military and Veterans UMV will end its contract by the end of this year, which is the reason I am seeking for a new position.  I enjoyed working for UHC / UHG company and I hope to continue to work for this company."
good,"Management here at UHG is not a flat architecture which is the biggest disadvantage."
good,"Company was good for a bit, then like every Corporation it began to become just about what money the company could make and less about keeping employees happy so they make customers happy and then money can be made."
good,It is an interesting place to work and you need to be careful of management. It has good qualities and bad qualities it all depends on what your willing to tolerate.
good,this is not a place where what you know helps but instead who you know.  The people are friendly and everyone is nice it's just not the place for you if you are not willing to bend.
good,"typical day at work, as Utilization review, checking the pends, obtaining clinical information from the hospitals, calling for discharge planning to assist in any way possible. Also prepare reports for Length of Stay meetings, or Readmit discussions with the Medical Director. Have good communication with manager. The work culture is awesome, we care for our members and the staff is  there for each other when needed. The staff participates in charities, we also celebrate and acknowledge when people do anything extra for the members or company."
good,The company does a decent job with pay. I do wish there was more of a work/life balance. Some days you would have to work 12 hours and would be expected to work regardless of other outside commitments. If you are a student working here will not be the best option for you. The point system would hurt anyone with children because if they are sick you would have to take care of them in risk of losing your job.
good,"I have learned an exceptional amount about the health insurance/health care industry. "
good,you sit in a cubicle and deal with unhappy people who were given the run around before talking to you.  the company doesn't provide enough training to handle most of the situations that members call about.  you are encouraged to give members the run around in return.  the managers are nice and pretty amendable when time off is needed.  the work at home option is nice for when kids are sick.  the hardest part is that there are constantly software problems.  Get used to calling helpdesk at least once a week.  the healthcare benefits are limited and very expensive.
good,Typical day making outbound calls via an automatic dialer system to members to schedule their in home visits with a physician or a nurse practitioner.  Answer inbound calls from members and assist them with their inquiries.  Route calls to the appropriate departments as needed. Update members records with accurate information obtained on the call.  Resolve any scheduling issues or concerns.
good,"Typical day consisted of opening and sorting patient invoices to scan into in-house software for payment."
good,"Management team at the time I worked there, lacked in leadership qualities and did not understand the work/life balance since overtime was encouraged since salaried position."
good,"Every keystroke is monitored and even when you don't.          "
good,it was ok to work you have to deal 130 phone called a day end the day you have no voice to talk. You have to solve the customer in less 4 mins.2 break and 30 mins lunch
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Good culture and colleagues. Lots of turnover whilr I was there as well as downsizing of remote positions. Hours were very flexible outside of scrums and meetings and the work was diverse and ver interesting. Strong project management but sometimes a lack of undestanding across silos. Overall, a goid place to work."
good,"The company is a good one all in all, however there should be more interest in advancement for the support staff (Admins, Coordinators etc) A push for more education to move up would be nice."
good,"it was a very fasted paced place. slightly unorganized, but I place to work if you are in need of employment. hardest part of the job was remember all of the different medications provided"
good,"UHC has been a solid company to work during my tenure.  The most enjoyable part of the work experience are the colleagues that you interact with on a day to day basis.  Associates in Mid level management positions need to be  prepare to work a minimum of 10 hours per day, in which case the work-life balance does not necessarily exist. The company offers competitive pay in the industry, management is loyal to employees, and good benefits.  On the flip side, the benefits do come with a hefty price tag for employees.  Overall the company is a good place to work."
good,meeting goals productivity helping and assisting the providers and making sure the forms are accurate for processing. Completing in a timely manner to be viewed.
good,Position where I was primarily on the phones taking inbound calls. Learned a lot about the Medicare market as that was the division I worked under. Management was good.
good,"Enjoyed working here if you don't mind being on the phones, the schedule and hours were good. During peak season there were opportunities for OT. Hardest part was listening to disgruntled customers."
good,It was a very fast pace workplace. Learned to talk to prescribers and Pharmacist to get medications for the 65 years and older members. Helped them get the most out of their insurance.
good,"Work life baoance is maintained and you get to. Learn  lot. "
good,great place to work; learned a lot; always a learning environment; management amazing; call center environment; can be stressful; production type work
good,"I love working here. My colleagues in my department are smart, supportive and compassionate.  The work is challenging and directives for work flow change often.  Working here is very rewarding."
good,"I am thankful to my previous organizations because i have learnt a lot of things from there. according to me changes are necessary for everyone to enhance your skills, knowledge for personal for personal growth and financial growth."
good,"The  job was fast paced , but repetitive and kind of boring. It seems that there were always people coming in and out. The job didn't seem permanent for anyone."
good,"Many opportunities to learn"
good,great fun environment. loved the people. management were great. the scheduled breaks were the hardest. typical very busy it was open enrollment time hen i worked here.
good,"Overall, IT at Optum is very stressful if in anyway connected to A&D work (software).  One common complaint is that UHC/Optum fails to plan effectively for everything. resulting in layoffs all too often."
good,"I am just looking a job in UAE for Back end executive, so just waiting a opportunity to work with UAE and also my it is my dreaming city so don't want to miss the chance."
good,For a non public facing company we had to wear business attire when most IT departments the dress code is more relaxed. No extra benefits and not working remote.
good,Very nice support from the onshore. There will be a good support from the onshore at all times.  I like working in the company as it is rare to see such a nice onshore partner.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,For the most part it is a great company to work for. The benefits could be improved.  I have been there for 2+ years and I have learned a lot. It is a good opportunity.
good,"Uma empresa que dá oportunidade de crescimento."
good,It is  decent place to work. Can expect tons of work allocated to you. Good team work. Will get good opportunity to utilize project management techniques.
good,"There was no place to see personal and career growth. Workload depends on the department, it would be alot and it could be very limited. They didn't seem to care much for their employees. You come in and work and then leave at 5pm."
good,"Growth is unattainable in this company, which is very frustrating for someone who would like to climb the career ladder. Management is unsure of promotion, even going as far as demoting employees from their current position and returning them back to level 1 agents but retaining same salary."
good,"Working for United Health care was a challenge, the environment was hostile, and lacked proper tools needed for position, the building where UHC is located is in a very inconvenient as well"
good,"a typical day at work for me is very stressful, busy, overwhelming. I have learned how to handle medical claims and accounts as well as understand medical insurance better."
good,very stressful company to work for however the pay and benefits are great would recommend to someone who can deal with the stressful work type  and can work all kinds of hours and weekends
good,Is an insurance company that is fast paced. They give you a large work load and a laptop. Not a bad company to work for. Very busy. Good benefits nice Boss
good,Great liked the people and helping others I learned more about Medicare. I learned about community resources and how it could help others in need. I also learned about pharmacy guidelines.
good,I learned you can never be to comfortable. You always have to stay on your feet and watch your back. They only focus is the members never the workers.
good,"After a 2 week training program, you are placed on the phones working with associates. I was not there long enough to gain a strong enough opinion on the company."
good,"Training is pretty much non existent, although offshore office offers classroom training in important skills like SQL.  Sink or swim culture. Great opportunity to learn about various source systems that are upstream and downstream to system that you are working on."
good,"Verify patient insurance benefits to include applicable co-pays, co-insurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket, appropriate service facilities, services covered, and if any require prior authorization. Contact patient when necessary to correct/update insurance information to include policy holder demographics and information."
good,"AT UHG, I handled client queries with daily interaction with them and my onshore partners. I learnt some effecive ways of handing customer queries.My Manager is very helpful and the hardest part of the job is nothing as such."
good,"Since I have left they have been bought out by SMMC so I am not sure how it would be to work there now."
good,What I learned was how to improve being a team-player to complete the job accurately and in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.
good,"Custermer care agent, answer inbound phone call, assit members with ordering there perscriptiond. solve customers issues on medication and their insurance."
good,"decent environment to work in. Depends on management and team. My team was great and very friendly. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Great work balance, low pay for hard work and no acknowledgment. The training is very minimal. Its rewarding to help our appreciated customers who are thankful we are there to help."
good,Overall experience wasd a good one. I worked on many projects which helped me to resource other projects with team memebers. I would work for them again.
good,After working there for 2 years I aquired alot of skills working with insuranceb the do's and don't. The turn around rate for employees is very high at my site and training was not long enough nor was the pay was good for the amount of work you do. I love the job and what I did but management drives a lot of employees aways when ot comes to staying and completing shifts for the advocates.
good,"Very fast paced, a lot of mandatory overtime.  Being that it is a call center it feels like you are chained to the phone.  They did have a LOT of potlucks...ughhh"
good,"Manager of my team was adequate. I enjoyed helping people understand their policies and speaking on their behalf to healthcare professionals. The assignments were challenging yet fun. I really enjoyed working with my teammates,"
good,The environment is not family friendly. If you are newly out of college or single this would be idealistic. Management was not clear nor professional at all.
good,"This company works very hard, and plays very hard.  They have a very challenging environment and you will spend many hours working.  But you are working for a good cause."
good,I have no complaints about this company. The culture is not too bad and management is pleasant. Scheduling is limited and shift differential wasn't available as promised. There's a bit too much vto available in my department.
good,Unorganized with high turn over rate. Unprofessional co workers including management. No teamwork; every man for themselves type of attitude. Resources and tools needed on a daily basis are vague along with having constant technical issues.
good,"a typical day would be resolving claim issues from customer, patients, providers with payment issues of incorrect billing for services and the payers."
good,Again a company for startup after college to get some experience....good foundation to rely on.... The company had a good investment in their employees... And help them to learn a lot about corporate world
good,I do not feel there is support to advance within the company. Overall the department is small and feels overlooked sometimes. As long as you meet your metrics that's all that is needed here.
good,"Apesar de muito trabalho ,quantidade e fluxo muito elevado de pacientes ,foi muito bom ter trabalhado nela."
good,"You are only a number here; very easily replaced, and your higher ups are not afraid to let you know this...frequently; works on a system of metrics, meaning if you don't produce, you don't work here.  This company is definitely not afraid to use technology, but this sometimes makes for an ""overengineered"" feel."
good,"This job provides decent pay in comparison to other jobs, but it requires a lot of work with little teaching. While you're in training for about three months, there are things you learn much later on that might have been useful in the beginning."
good,"Uma empresa ótima de se trabalhar, com um boa remuneração e benefícios, te da muitas oportunidades de crescimento."
good,Great place to work.  Great opportunity.  Balanced work environment  Great team.  Flexible work environment.  Great opportunity.  Opportunity to develop new skills.
good,there was no where to grow here I learned about medications and helped people with billing  and drug rx plans loved working on a team with people and help the customers
good,"Had the opportunity to forge great working relationships with very intelligent, dedicated colleagues."
good,The people are kind and friendly. They help with whatever a person may need in a pretty efficient way. The management seemed professional and the workers were also well groomed.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"nice breakroom, I feel the amount of work is not worth the  pay very complex data entry and I feel I was misled by the general job instruction. good benefits"
good,Work life balance was hard since most teams on-shore have to coordinate with off-shore team members. The work entailed full time presense at a very fast paced environment
good,I have nothing negative to say we just disagree on what happened but the people there are not bad and my supervisors where always fair when it came to time off.
good,"With a company of this size, there is opportunity for job exploration and change.  The work environment is pleasant and attractive.  Onsite restaurants and exercise facilities."
good,"Customer Care Professional"
good,"I have nothing to share, my tenure there was only six months.  You develop relationships with the patients and family member.  I made my own schedule, I had time to spend with the families.  "
good,"had great middle managers at UHG but there is no job security, here today gone tomorrow, but the team will be missed, some of the greatest people I have ever worked with just watch out for the Minnesota nice"
good,"Harken Health is a part of United.  I love working here.  The patient centered care is great.  As a Health Coach, I am able to impact patients lives.  We work as a team (Doctors, Nurses and Health Coaches)."
good,The job is a great way to add skills to your resume but the work team could use some adjusting. The people that work here make the place unlikable. The union and the rules make it seem like they dont care about the employees. i believe they dont
good,UnitedHealth care is huge so it all depends which department you work in and who is your supervisor. Some have a good experience and some don't. It all depends who you end up with.
good,always making sure employees are meeting goals and following all prodigals. very divers and fun work environment for all employees including holiday contest.
good,Loved working here. Great people. Moral was good. Mgmt was nice and patient. Trainers were great and everyone was willing to step in and help when needed.
good,United Healthcare was a easy place to work but had little compensation extended job requirements. Bonus program needs to be reworked. And benefits were ok first year of employment but got somewhat better second year.
good,"A lot of micro managing, and a large workload on a regular 8 hour shift, with overtime denial. If overtime was allowed, a lot more of the extra workload projects could actually be accomplished."
good,"I don't think the training is adequate enough for the types of calls that you are getting. You are expected to answer calls for other departments, like the claims dept."
good,A typical work day was busy but effective. management was excellent. The work place was very diverse. I enjoy the workflow and the teamwork among my coworkers.
good,"Day was non stop and very busy, management gave us room to work on our own as long as we did our job, lots of holiday celebrations as a group, and team pot lucks."
good,"This is a very stable job with a low stress atmosphere. You can easily leave work without taking it home with you. The job may require you to learn multiple computer programs and a lot of pharmaceutical knowledge, but you'll never get paid what you deserve. Raises are infrequent and very low. After receiving the highest rating possible on every review for 8 years AND being promoted 2 positions higher... I only made 4 dollars more from the day I started."
good,Consultant for 7 months. Fast paced and stressful but worked with some really smart people. The program I ran had high visibility so lots of cooks in the kitchen which sometimes got in the way. Learned a lot though.
good,"Professional colleague."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"Good company to work with. Nice work culture, friendly atmosphere. Flexibility and perks depend on your team. Work is generally good in all the team.."
good,"During my time there the company was in an aggressive growth period that was both exciting and exhausting.  Good, smart people all working hard to achieve goals."
good,"Apesar de ser uma grande empresa, tem alguns processos, regras e rotinas tipicas de uma empresa familiar. Falta flexibilidade no horário de trabalho, principalmente na área comercial."
good,"This was a call center and employees were required to keep their customer service calls under 7-10 minutes, which sometimes would not allow the proper resolution for customers"
good,"good technology, fast-paced environment. a typical day of work includes meetings. learned new business, projects and technology; management is ok. flexible work schedule."
good,"Good job, but hours change every four months.  Slow call volume and a lot of mis-directed calls.  Management is good, but could be better. This role can be very frustrating depending upon the call volume and type of calls you get."
good,Uhg is overall nice place to work..you wil get good learning. Hard part is hectic long working hours and travelling. Learned managementskills. Targeted day work is quiet hectic to achieve. Learned to be more practical and manageble.
good,"fun workplacce and average work experiance,"
good,"Work with excel generating work for members of my team."
good,This employer was a wonderful place to work. It displayed team work and gave a very smooth and calm work environment.  The managers were very supportive of one another and encouraged each person to not give up no matter how difficult things may have seemed.
good,"At UHC, we had a very stressful job.  We were constantly being told what we were doing wrong instead of what we were doing right.  It was a very difficult place to keep our moral up.  Although very rewarding to be able to help my Medicare patients, the environment was hostile. The diversity was amazing.  There were people from all walks of life that work there.  I met and am still good friends with a lot of the employees.  There was one supervisor who was always on my side and coached me when I needed it.  Bonnie Arbuckle.  She is an amazing supervisor and I thanked her dearly when I resigned."
good,"I get to telecommute 3 days out of the week. I've learning Price modeling in the Network Pricing Department. The hardest part of the job is everyone is in their own world ,not much interaction unless needed. It's a rollercoaster on being slow and busy. Enjoyable part is the flexibility and telecommute."
good,"Lack of good training programs is a hinderance to a new employee."
good,"Answering phone calls come in to assist agent, make adjustment, overrides completed, update accounts, help to assist customers. I enjoy talking with a large variety of people. The culture is diverse, i have learned back office duties, customer service all office work."
good,"Good place to work but unable to find growth "
good,Started there as a customer service rep for the mail order dept for cvs/caremark pbm they trained me to get my health and accident license when the season was over my pay dropped.
good,UHG is good work place and it is always challenging and it's make me strong and deliver the things on right time. The management is always supports and encourage us in all circumstance.
good,"it is a good place to work if you want a career growth. In my case i just need to leave the company for personal reason. The management is good, also the working environment is nice."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The team I work on is great however the benefits could be better as well as the structure of the training/operations. I don't actually work for the Cedar Sinai hospital but for the company Optum under UnitedHealth Group.
good,Excellent opportunities for growth with very competitive salaries.  Very nice place to work if one enjoys assisting elderly members/ community.
good,Its not worth the pay. They don't put there best foot forward for there team. The job shows no compassion to others. A lot of work with lack of training.
good,"No decorrer dos meus 28 anos tiveram varias mudanças, na qual foram ótimas para meu desenvolvimento profissional. Apos sua venda, deixaram de investir, incentivar seus colaboradores. Trazendo um maior fluxo de rotatividade e consequentemente, processos e tarefas inacabadas ou de  péssima qualidade."
good,"Lots of opportunity within company, but not a very ""promote from within"" friendly company. Semi-relaxed culture. Professional atmosphere."
good,"the pay is okay the job is terrible. The office is dead, people think they are better than you are when you begin working. The manager have selective few and have their favorites. It was not enjoyable at all working here"
good,You spend 8 hours a day on the phone taking call after call. You have set hours and your lunchtime is scheduled for you. The best part was I was able to work form home. Hardest part of the job is not being able to take time off when you need or want it. Only so many people can be off on any given day and your request for time off may not be approved.
good,The supervisors are very accommodating when comes to schedules. The work is the same every day. Our team is very close and work well with each other. I overall like working here. There is room for growth and advancement.
good,"I was very excited to be hired for the company because I wanted to work for a large company that had opportunity for advancement. However, the point system and metrics system was much more difficult to meet than I had expected. I was very dissappointed with the healthcare benefits for the employees, I found them to be very expensive with high copays and deductibles. The bonus system was almost impossible to meet. The work environment was very pleasant and there was help available when needed, however I found myself uncomfortable when asking. I guess it just wasn't the job for me.."
good,"No geral e uma boa empresa de se trabalhar mas ao meu ver falta organização, não há nada claro e com isso acaba sobrecarregando alguns funcionários."
good,"Learned automation testing after joing united health group. Work place is preety good. The most enjoyable part will be the team work."
good,Professional place to work and nice friendly people. They keep up with the latest Tech/Good benefits great opportunities. Work balance and family. The really care about their employees and family. I wound recommend friends to this company.
good,Call center environment makes the day go by fast but you need to have the ability to be off the call in a timely manner while juggling compassion.
good,Position is no longer available. The contract has ended and the program has been discontinued. UCH was the ASO for CMS and LIHP government programs in preparation for ACA implementation.
good,Very watched over while on the clock.  Need to account for every moment not working to management.  Some managers a bit immature and not good at communication without pointing fingers or blaming.  Personally have had no issues but am close with people who have had issues and left because of it.
good,Left company over a decade ago and therefore I am not sure my review would be of any value.  My suggestion would be to look at current employees or those who recently left firm.
good,"Some people love and some hate it. I dislike the commute.  My department is new and it pays we'll. If you have a great supervisor,  the job is great. If not, you may want to leave sooner than later."
good,"I do not have anything to say about the company good or bad. It was a call center environment which is metrics and quality driven,"
good,"Accurately enter provider facility, group and individual practitioner information into Payor system."
good,"Its a call Center so on a typical day you can experience up to 70 calls a day maybe more. Its Easy to make friends there from the start the training instructors are very fun, down to earth, everyone there is very  nice and friendly. Supervisors are easy to talk to and very relatable. I would say the hardest part of the job is the hours, and the Mandatory overtime. When you take the position they will ask you are you available between the hours of 7am and 11pm? Then once you get out of training you are subject to a shift bid and what that is basically your shift is based on your performance in training, your attendance and your adherence, you are ranked among your peers in your training class. So your shift will vary. The environment can be stressful at times your dealing with pleasant members and sometime rude member on the phone daily. I will say that the benefits are good the pay was good as well as some of the work perks. But if you have a family at home the hours may not be conducive to your family life as you will be working late the majority of the time."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Learned a lot about healthcare, but questionable management. Was presented the opportunity to travel, which was an amazing experience. However, manager was completely out of touch with my role on the project & wasn't aware of my constructive career growth."
good,"Professional Company, Health Care Benefits are expensive, Job requirements increases every 3 months, with any salary increase.Weekly and daily call evaluations, calls will get marked as failing for one minor mistake."
good,"Start the day with a briefing about the process updates "
good,"day to day phones, long periods of sitting, short lunches, great benefits and time off package, great co-workers, ideal location"
good,Handles in-bound phone calls professionally and provide excellent customer service. Researches and Resolves Sales Agent’s questions relating to medicare products
good,"Only during open enrollment.  This limits how much money you can make and also resets you every year.  As a captive agent, the company makes most of my due money."
good,"I enjoyed the work I do and put everything to what I did, but the management was really unorganized. I think it needs a little bit of work but other than that, work was easy and people were nice."
good,A workplace that allows you to learn a lot professionally and grow in your career. People are willing to help and want to see you succeed. Happy and productive workplace.
good,Empresa agradável de se trabalhar onde se tem oportunidade de crescer. Dias que trabalhos intensos pois o hospital está sempre cheio. Ambiente agradável.
good,"•	Understanding client requirements and project functionalities."
good,This was a good company to work for.  Good work hours and flexibility.  Nice Management team with lots of experience amongst them.  Not sure how they're doing now.
good,"It is an ok place to work.  There is nothing spectacular to say, you log on the computer, you work, you go to lunch, you log back in, you work some more, you log out and go home. You come back the next day and you do the same thing. The end."
good,Great group of people.  Lots of competition to grow. diverse in coworkers and management.  be willing to adapt to all types of personalities and work shifts
good,This particular location was purchased by UCH just before I began to work there.  This location is closing it's doors this year.  Operations have been moved to other locations.  Most of the employees were let go.  It was a very difficult environment.
good,"Work with a great team and manager. Love working autonomously, but can get lonely. "

good,My co-workers are mingle with me very well and they are very supportive with great team work and i love working with them.They encouraged me very well.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I work in the call center. There are other positions off the phones, but you will not start there. They are very difficult to migrate into. Management wants to keep you on the phones. It's not a hard job, but dealing with upset customers all day on the phone gets old."
good,consolidated their call center/benefit center in Hamden to several states. at times claims manager was rude. many changes in personell over the years.
good,It was a competitive environment. It was a regular job. Lot of meetings to attend. Work life balance is not a priority. Have to be committed to work. Nice colleagues.
good,Room for advancement if you are career driven and know where you are wanting to end up. Land a good salary because you wont move far from what you start with.

good,I have worked at United Health Group for 20+ years. It was a learning experience and I am looking to expand my knowledge with a new career.
good,"I learned a lot about the medical field such as health insurance information. It was really interesting to know about different medications. Although there was good days, there also was low pay, with a lot of restrictions"
good,UnitedHealth Group is a good place to work. The colleagues here are very supportive and helpful. I have learnt a lot of things and improved my knowledge.
good,Faced paced environment.  Always needing to adapt and be ready for changes.  Can be high stress at times but satisfying to help the customer.
good,"Management is great, they are very involved in what you do everyday. The training is extensive and supplies you with a lot of valuable information. The hardest part of the job is learning all of the information if you have no insurance or call-center background. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help those who need it most with their medical problems."
good,"A typical day at work here is very quiet, nobody speaks, even he supervisor, you come in and get on the phone, no motivation for the day, just work. management is nice however nobody on the regular, you can go a whole week without speaking to your sup. co workers are okay, a lot of group talking. Nothing really hard about the job, just has a lot of info to learn"
good,"Good pay. I don't like the environment. I don't feel that the supervisors are willing to help and they aren't as ""compassionate"" as they say they are."
good,"Management seemed to have favorite associates based on senority and gender, other than that coworkers were great to work with and had flexible hours and had growth opportunities"
good,Good company but struggles in compensation and benefits extremely. work life balance depends on management but overall culture recognizes it.
good,"There were definitely pros and cons working for UHC, the job paid very well but it was a very difficult job to do day in and day out"
good,"almost impossible to meet the call center metrics. mandatory overtime. schedule changes every 3 months, one must bid on a schedule and is assigned according to job performance. attrition is extremely high. "
good,"I enjoyed this employment a lot, close to home, and I was there everyday on time.  We had to be at work early in order to sign in to all the applications we had to use during our phone calls, After one week there, everything was easy after that. Love talking to people"

good,"Good at facilities and for with additional OT money "
good,Terrible health benefits.  Very high deductible  You would think a health insurance company would provide good heath insurance to its employees.
good,I learned how to navigate using two computer monitors and more about health insurance benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I had been able to resolve the member's questions and concerns effectively with a first call resolution. The hardest part was making sure I met the job metrics consistently and the on-going mandatory over time.
good,"Good sales manager enough resources ,poor training, the hardest part is cold calling, the best part is traveling to trade shows. The support office is good. The overall benefits are good, I learned a lot about the healthcare industry."
good,"We have been recently bought out by UHG, I am very disappointed in the health benefits they are not very good. But they do have a good 401k and Stock purchase plan."
good,"hard to move up, one of the hardest companies to move up in no matter how long you stay there, or no matter how much education you attain. I find this to be very unmotivting."
good,"its been long, it was good working there. the only thing was was not able to learn new things was not challenging. not good pay and also less PTO/vacation time."
good,"The environment is relaxed and easy going. However, the pay is not that great and its extremely hard to get raises. They will do an annual review and the most raise you will get is about .30. There is a lot if room for growth. But you have to walk a straight line. There is not a lot of room for error."
good,"atendimento ao cliente, solicitações de consultas exames..."
good,I had great support from my medical directors and enjoyed the culture at UHC.  I established many professional rapports.

good,"Good Experience "
good,"very busy working environment.. flexible working schedule, opportunities for transfers to different sites. nice company"
good,"i learned so many thing  in UHG."
good,"Face paced production call center, always processing new updates/skills. Training to learn new skills to handle more calls to better serve the customers."
good,"The establishment itself is well known and respected with high praises for it's corporal accomplishments. The facility is continually ranked high  when compared to other regions as being the most accomplished at it's multitude . The management could use a better coaching technique, and some implement of a ""check and balance"" system could be of use to better the communication and productivity between the employees and employers. There is little room to advance in this environment, and fresh creative ideas are not encouraged unless it is from management."
good,The highlight of the job was the nurses that work there. They are some of the nicest people that I have ever worked with. The management were often divided and each one has their own way of doing things. Constant changes and often hard to keep up with all of the of them.
good,"- routinary job"
good,"my job is answering phones all day to help Hospitals and Doctors offices on information on Health insurance, I learned a lot about how health insurance and how it works. We were in a new market and our information was changing often and it was very frustrating to have information change while being in a position of teaching the Doctors and Hospital staff out to process health insurance claims, The hardest part of the job is having no time to take a breath between calls at times."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"I really enjoying turning a sad moment to a joyous moment for all of our customers, just being able to interact and engage with people I don't and connecting them on every level getting to personally know the customer is such a thrill for me. I just enjoy people and working under diverse pressure is what I love and I'm able to do that with United Healthcare"
good,"Not interested in going back, but the company overall is ok. You will just have to see for yourself. If you decide to work there, just do your job."
good,Era um ambiente tranquilo de trabalho com alguns pequenos problemas
good,"Generally the pay was good, and the work levels expectations were manageable, but incentives to exceed were pretty low.  Kinda like, bring in an extra million dollars in revenue and you can get a coupon for a free fries with any order at Wendy's.  Heavy bureaucratic red tape also pushed work levels down.  "
good,"Okay company to work for entry level!"
good,"The work environment was good because of the people I work with.  Lots of growing pains for fairly new company (Optum).  The lack of supervision was also a concern.  Lot of times when something needed to dealt with by a supervisor, they were not around"
good,Its really a great company and it has good name and fame in society but internal management  especially in Indian management spoiling work culture by implementing local thoughts and HRD not in a position to handle all the situations except that its is good company we have more job security and Job Work/Life Balance also excellent
good,"Company does not provide the complete resources to complete job to the best of your ability. Long hours, multiple job duties, a lot of responsibilities"
good,"Accommodating request from VIP clients as well as delegating duties among at least three other runners. This position also required maintaining communications and good relationships with chefs, matradees, player handlers and in some cases, the players themselves. Outside of the kitchens and suites, many tasks took place in the open, among thousands of patrons at the arena and maintaining professional and friendly service to any one of them was a must."
good,"Overall, United Health Group is a great company to work for. I have learned the overall health insurance business and made a lot of contacts. Management is typical with the pros and cons but overall decent. I am a supervisor so a typical day would be to check my emails and begin to run reports on my staff from the number of pre-service authorizations for the team to process, to attendance to team audits."
good,UnitedHealth Group is a company with a strong focus on building and living cultural values. UHG is a place I would recommend to work.
good,"Proven written and oral communication skills"
good,I have enjoyed my tenure at United Health Group and I have learned a lot.  I welcome the opportunity to work for them again in the future.
good,"The job was great, the training was the issue.. Not enough computer to do the training .... The training had to set up two person to a computer... It was not enough supervisor in the afternoon"
good,My job consist of satisfying our customers needs and wants. I work in the Grievance and Appeals department for Retirees.
good,A great company to use your skills and experience to advance opportunities great co  worker and managers its a great place to work

I never slept with anyone at this job so it took me twice as long to get  to my position, but I know plenty of qualified individuals who were overlooked for positions because there was a prettier candidate. Needless to say, they were pretty, but had no knowledge of our systems. So members would be calling for resolution and there would be none because good looks cant resolve insurance related issues over the phone! Dont believe me? Try calling Unitedhealthcare to get an issue resolved. Someone will pretend to take a ticket and document a ""fake"" grievance that doesnt go anywhere!

Co-workers/colleagues were a pleasure to work with. Attended weekly management meetings to discuss Core Values and ensure execution of workload and responsibility was being completed. Shared best practices with co-workers to ensure all opportunities for success were being explored. Corp Management had set expectations based on compliance requirements set fourth by The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services also known as (CMS)and as a Supervisor in a leading roll made sure to meet all required expectations within my realm of work responsibility. The best part of my job was getting to know my direct reports on a professional manor as well as understand their personal life events to ensure a proper work/home life balance was available to employees.. I enjoyed birthday celebrations and employee recognition events which to me was the most gratifying part of my role.  I enjoyed assisting employees with their career development plans within the organization or assistance with coordinating employee work schedules to accommodate work schedule and/or school schedules without compromising set Corp. Metric goals. "

good,"Good company, centrally located in greater Chicago area where I learned a lot about a new company culture."
good,"a typical day was answering phones on multiple lines,processing claims. I learned a lot about the the claims process from providers office to the handling from the insurance company.

good,"Schedule house call visits for plan members ."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"People are great.  Change is ever present making for a stressful environment most days.  Management lacks timely communication skills, and work groups are siloed making progress somewhat difficult.  No HR on sight, and they are not responsive when contacted with issues or concerns."
good,"A typical work day consists of a partial day of taking escalated issues from customer service which may require extensive research or medical claims that need to be adjusted.  The other portion of the day consists of completing clerical and administrative issues,  following up on issues that require additional research, and processing medical claims.  It's nothing like having great co workers who are willing to work as a team.  My co workers are like family we spend so much time together and at times have to work very close knit to resolve issues that are more than complex.  I've learned over the years that hard work and patience pays off, dealing with anything surrounding medical issues requires empathy and understanding.  The best reward of all is to be able to resolve an issue that is complex in nature, however at times the best reward can also be the hardest part of the job."
good,"Responsible for answering incoming calls from health care providers while ensuring a high level of customer service and maximizing productivity."

good,"This job was very fast paced, upon arriving they were desperate for help.  I was given 1-2 days of training and was then primary MA to a physician.  I learned very quickly, and actually think this is the way I learn best, just being thrown in.  The hardest part of this job was the managed care, taking care of every aspect of the patients' healthcare.  The most enjoyable part was knowing that the patients' counted and depended on me to coordinate all their care and them having the confidence in knowing that it would be done in accurately and in a timely manner."
good,This was a productive workplace.  UHG is the 23rd largest company in the country.
good,"Working for this company is rewarding especially when customers call in concerned and able to hang up the phone understanding their benefits.

What I have learned from the company is how to provide excellent customer service. My co-workers are extremely friendly and helpful when needing assistance with anything. The most enjoyable part of the day is in the morning when things are slower and we get to kind of talk about our calls. See if anyone has came across any issues that  we may need to be informed about.

good,This job keeps you up to date with how insurance companies and how Medicare handle new drugs coming into the market and what to do with constantly changing drug lists from each company. You learn to go through each persons drug file to see if the drug selected can be allowed and possibly a less expensive drug used. Price is not always the issue safety comes first.

good,Gain Experience on Tri-care project.
good,If you enjoy the work you do United is not a bad place to work. The main frustration that I have is that I have developed several skills during my tenure and HR will not take factor in for promotions. For instance if you start at $40k and develop skills that qualify you for a $60k position they will not want to pay you more than $45k even though the position has been approved for $60k and its in the hiring manager's budget to pay $60k HR will cap your offer according to their own metric. I have been promoted 3 times and still make less $10k less than the going rate for my area for the work that I do. I feel like I am being forced to leave the company meanwhile they are hiring less competent people off the street for more.
good,This company gave me the tools I needed to progress in an office work invironment

good,"Vendia planos de saúde, porém, não tinha um salãrio fixo, apenas comissão. Se um mês fosse fraco, eu acabava por não ter pagamento. Os benefícios também eram vinculados à metas de vendas, isso dificultava um pouco, visto que muitas vezes era obrigada a gastar o salário do mês anterior para me movimentar no mês seguinte, e não conseguir arcar com minhas contas pessoais direito. Por isso optei por sair. Sem problemas, sem dramas, e sem criar inimizades, tanto que se quiser, consigo voltar"

good,"Worked as a processing specialist working on the mainframe, SQL talking with clients pulling records as requested."
good,"Muito boa a empresa flexível, onde deixava o funcionário trabalhar a vontade visado o bem estar de cada um, sabendo -se que lhe entregaria um bom resultado."
good,"Begining most days with a short meeting, then we'd each return to our cube's for processing medical claims. This was my first job in the medical claims business. I learned how much I have to be thankful for, and learned ways to help others in the community by getting envolved to make a positive difference."
good,This job was ok. Many of the members had the same problems so it became easier to help them as time progressed. This job taught me patience.
good,"Answering 60 to 100 calls and advising clients of their dental benefits. Management has many different faces, however at the end of the day you are still an expendable asset. Co-workers help make the day go by."

good,I only worked there a year. I thought they did a good job of doing things to keep moral positive for the employees. The training was good to prepare you for the position you would be taking. Normal office atmosphere and conditions. Flexibility in hours was a great incentive.
good,"I have not learned much here, or been able to advance (at my last job, I did both of those things)"
good,"Long work hours, multiple projects, production and quality focused environment with daily, weekly and monthly metrics. "
good,"Coworker and staff are very friendly most everyone works from home so you will only speak to them by phone call, management needs some help but overall  a growing environment with a lot of potential"
good,"They have awesome benefits such as 401K match, maternity leave, HSA contributions, and flexible scheduling. The quality of people are sub par at best. People will throw each other under the bus in an attempt to advance."
good,"My current position is telecommuting and I work from home. I have learned alot in my current position, but miss utilizing my clinical skills and therefore am looking to return to direct patient care."
good,"In United health group you can live your life with work with balance. Only problem is about the hike and appraisals. They are very low "
good,"United Health Group is a functional matrix work environment where a team of 60 telecommuting individuals nationwide were working autonomously as ""individual contributors"" while still measured for quality and quantity production. Communication across the organization is open given some restriction on emails to other unrelated company subsidiaries."
good,"Great W/L Balance, but no real direction from Leadership"
good,"Great company to work for, but they don’t pay you because they downgrade your title, example.... analysts to representatives.... so they don’t have to pay you as much"
good,It's difficult to get information especially from other departments. There is no communication between the different areas. Other areas could be working on the same project and you would never know.
good,"If you like to problem solve, this is the company for you. The company gives back to the community. Frequent team building exercises done to keep employee moral high."
good,"Ok place to work, flexibility is dependent on your management. Some departments are open, others more strict. No real sense of community, just a job. Lots of bureaucratic hurdles EVERYWHERE. Solid job just wouldnt say the greatest"
good,"UHG is a very large organization and some work streams have opportunities for growth.  The division I was in, I had maxed out the career path.  I enjoyed working with the different departments and learning more about their role in the Healthcare delivery system"
good,"I have enjoyed the work that I have done at the company but the company's definition of work/life balance does not jive with my definition of work/life balance.  They believe that I should use my pto to maintain that balance, I believe that if I end up working long hours, that I should be able to comp those hours somewhere else (as an exempt employee)."
good,"The SOP change so fast, sometimes too confusing. It cause a lot of problems, especially since the  incentive is based on errors.  Turnover of employees is quite fast, since many believe the hourly pay is not commensurate to the effort needed."
good,I worked for the company for 2 and a half years. Its a great place to work. The employees are treated well and a great environment. Most people i know have been there 5 or more years.
good,"Good work from home job with decent pay, but horrible health benefits.  Few advancement opportunities unless you ""know someone"".  Working from home provides flexible scheduling."
good,"A typical day is routine as we hardly get any different problems to solve."
good,My immediate supervisors were great but the company itself was lacking.  I was not impressed with the benefits or pay scales for the complexity of the work required.  Everything is micro managed and it is extremely high stress.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,It was a great place to work when i was there. I really enjoyed the work i did. It is a shame that the eliminated my job to send to India. I reviewed medical contarcts for 6 states.
good,"I would like to stay with UHC, but the opportunities for development are not the same as when I started. And the job is also not as stable as I thought it would be."
good,"The VP of our department would change almost yearly. That meant the focus of the program would change almost monthly. Executive management change our successful program into a debacle of continuous uncertainty. Needless to say the program wasn't able to survive the continuous lack of vision by executive management and it was eliminated, along with hundreds of jobs across the country. They gave us a two week notice to let us know that we were let go. This company claims to care about people....  actions speak louder than words. The executives make millions upon millions every year in salary... not to mention bonuses and other perks. Greed is a terrible cancer that has obviously infected this company."
good,Management is bad. My manager never cared about anything other than if I made him look good on paper. I was placed on projects that didn't require a college degree so I feel like I didn't use my brain in my year and a half there.
good,"•Administers the contractual and demographic data setup for the provider network (Physician, Ancillary, FQHC’s etc.)"
good,"Productive workplace, private areas for phone calls. Manger had open door policy. typical day is busy. high call volume. the most enjoyable part of the day was helping a member."
good,Workdays were filled with challenging opportunities to learn new aspects of the flow of medical insurance claims and how the individual plans were applied.
good,UnitedHealth Group is a great place to work if you are looking for a telecommute job in the healthcare industry. UnitedHealth Group is a very diverse company with many opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work is taking incoming calls from Medicaid recepients. I assist them in answering questions ranging from how the benefits work to finding them a provider best suited for their immediate concern. "
good,"Besides breathing down your neck for numbers, it’s a good place to work. Growth opportunities available, schedule fluctuate, great luncheons. Moral is overall good!"
good,The ususal 8-5 with ot avalible on the weekends. Initial interview was not easy to due lack of communication between Recruiter and hiring manager. Management were pretty good about keeping us on our toes and Hitting goals
good,Good place to start and learn the PBM business.  I worked in the finance department which was stressful and fast paced but you had a lot of exposure and would learn much from the management team there.
good,Excellent PMO office practicing agile and waterfall methodologies in project management.  Strong steering committee practices to approve capital projects.
good,"No holidays off, mandatory work some saturdays, no recognition for good work done, some people are lazier than others but it doesn’t matter because management has favoritism."
good,"The company made sure I was able to balance my family and work like appropriately. As long as my work never suffered, I was able to adjust my schedule to participate in my kids' activities."
good,A hard job entering information and making a insurance choice. The costs of each program were high so it was uncomfortable making a choice. Some evening and weekend work.
good,I was only there for 6 months as I decided to retire but have since decided this was not a good decision and looking for a similar position either within or outside of UHG corporation.
good,"A typical work day is a busy day. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different personality.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when a patient is happy with the company service, and my customer service skills."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Once training was over you had to try to get assistance from the employees around you to find answers."
good,Not the worse experience but not the best. A lot of change in the short amount of time that I was there. Pay increase was a plus. People come and go for the most part.
good,"Had to come in 10 minutes early or was marked tardy. Company cared only about the members not their employees. The managers were always in meetings, did not provide feedback or questions answered."
good,"Overall,  an OK Co to work for. Need to offer better raises & pay which should include a cost of living raise. Medical benefits could be better, they honestly suck! They don't show their appreciation for the employees as they should."
good,"...my department was eliminated and there was no effort to re-deploy over 600 people who found themselves in the same position. We had the opportunity to apply for other jobs, but preference seems to go to outside applicants."
good,"The culture at UHG is great - everyone is really rallied around the mission and purpose.  It's easy to see how your work ties into the overall direction of the company.  It attracts the best - super smart and highly motivated people.  The downside is the lack of work/life balance.  This works for some people, but not everyone.  As a working mother in a finance function, it didn't work for me."
good,"The hardest part of the job was using multiple software systems all at once while providing the best service possible to the customer.  "
good,"good to work but lot of politics in teams, pay is less and long working hours, very tough to grow in organization, a company for managers only, cab facility is there"
good,"Other than the daily grind expected at work, the political machinations of other leaders might be a deterrent."
good,"I loved what I actually did (getting to help people enroll into insurance plans), but the hours were right in the middle of the day, which meant that I could go days with only seeing my son for 1 hour in the mornings. They also had me working every weekend and my days off were never together, so I could never go out of town or on a small vacation. Also, the pay should have been a lot better for what we had to do in order to be able to do this job. You can't just walk in off the street and do it. It takes a certain amount of intelligence and hard work to pass the state exams and then to go through the training."
good,"I enjoyed working at UHC but the position I have is very stressful. Posting out to a different position is very challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference in a member's life."
good,"UHG is a very large company with a solid product.  I believe UHG needs to focus on the IT infrastructure for it's data repositories.  Healthcare, as well as many industries, is a data driven industry requiring focused reporting technology.  While I believe in the company and the services provided, the data technology is lacking.  I've enjoyed working at UHG but it is time to try something new."
good,"There is a good PTO package and the company is flexible with allowing you to work from home, but it's hard to get promoted from within the company. I've been at my current position for several years now and am finding it very difficult to advance within the company."
good,"enjoyed the company before they sold out. the company didn't notify the staff of the changes that were coming. "
good,UHG does operate according to their core values. UHG also promotes work life balance for the employees.  Pay could be better for frontline staff. More career pathing courses needed.
good,Overall this is an okay company to work for every job has pros and cons.  I have seen a lot worse.  The do offer bonus and raise every year.  They also so employee appreciation.
good,I learned that I really want to get into Health Promotion and public health. I also really enjoy educating and coaching employees about living a well-balanced lifestyle.
good,Senior management is all about changing the company culture for the better and it's too bad that the lower level managers and directors aren't on the same page with how that works.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Company culture is excellent when adhered to by front-line managers. Work atmosphere varies based on project assignment and project manager(s) involved. Company is still on its journey in instilling its culture and values throughout a very large organization.
good,"I Love the customer interaction and helping to resolve their issues, qustions and concerns. The hardest part of the job is handling the customer whose is irate, frustrated or confused. As a experienced agent you can not react, you have to listen and be that person to make things right not add to problem."
good,Lots to learn. Fast-paced environment. Micro-management. Pay for parking. Located in downtown Pittsburgh in busy area. Heavy traffic. Strict HIPAA policy
good,Middle management was very good at promoting company culture.  Upper management used it as a ploy.  It was meant by upper management to be used as a tool to control.  Middle management saw that it could be used to encourage and promote good work.
good,Company was always stressing to spend more time with natural supports to assure that clients had home based help during their time in and after services
good,"The salary is good but there are staffing issues which makes work difficult.  "
good,good pay but the training is almost 4 months long I couldn't stay due to health issues but I did noticed there is a lot of people leaving the company.
good,ok place to work.  I am not enjoying what i am doing there right now.  I am not having work life balance.  My supervisor very unprofessional. I don't enjoy working for him.
good,Due to significant increase in business training and change was an issue.  Culture is pretty good but not all levels listen to their own culture.   Difficult situation
good,United Healthcare is definitely about workplace culture. They fully provide you with all the training needed to keep you up to date with the proper protocols.
good,"Management tries it's best, but very demanding and very competitive job.  You bid for your shift based on your job performance.  Newer employees are usually stuck with the less desirable shifts."
good,Great company honestly to be a part of - too many hours of working to keep up with your matrix.  Management could improve - there are some great managers and some managers that need help in terms of improvement in their leadership skills.
good,"Experienced lack of communication from the get-go, starting in training and moving into being on the floor. Had multiple trainers that didn't communicate with each other what was being reviewed and was expected to know materials or information that was never discussed. Was told we would be receiving help and support but never really did and was often told we could be replaced if we left."
good,"high production required and 100% accuracy is required.  "
good,"UHC was a great place to work at with good people and great opportunities.  I worked in both customer service and claims processing.  I found Claims processing to be the most flexible for my work/life schedule.  They are very open with when you can work as long as you get your 8 hours in. Pay was good, not great and benefits could have been better."
good,"Is not for everyone. Working on the phones is challenging. They expect you to take certain amount of calls per day, but demand great service while you deal with very demanding customers that can be at times very rude and difficult. Management is pro-customer and blame everything on their employees. This is a Corporate environment, so do not expect any type of sympathy from the company, just mere PR efforts to try to cope with so many employee complaints."
good,Just ok. Decent work life balance... Most work is done in an office away from the other team members.  Never met my boss in person the three years that I worked there.
good,"Great people to work with, however, no advancement opportunities and I wanted to get back into the life insurance industry. Due to being laid off by Metlife, UHC was the first offer I receieved."
good,The short version. Working at United HealthCare can be nice. The managers and supervisors do a great job of interacting with employees and making everyone feel like a team and bringing that family friendly vibe. With that being said... the job is stressful as literally every second of everyday is accounted for and monitored by a small group of people in a room somewhere that you never get to go in. If you do not adhere to your schedule within a certain percentage you can get in trouble. Even though you get a decent amount of paid time off (PTO) its nearly impossible to take the time or get the time you need without having to call out (which obviously is a cause for disciplinary action) or having been there forever to get priority.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The advantage of working for United is that most often you work from home. Their insurance plans offered to employees are okay, nothing spectacular. There is however 401k and PTO, HRA... standard large company benefits. The draw back is that United is a huge company that has taken on a lot of other smaller insurance companies and organizationally it's a mess, or that was my experience. No one knew who owned what process, which department to reach out to and then often your contact person was laid off or switched jobs. Also, there was the constant threat of layoffs and reorganization."
good,United Healthcare is a great place to work in my opinion. It's very stressful at times but they do take care of their employees and the pay and benefits are good as well. United Healthcare also allows a lot of their employees to work from home which is a great benefit to have. They are also good about promoting people fairly and in a timely manner.
good,"Optum is generally a welcoming place to work, people are polite and friendly. Ability to sell a subscription service on calls is a must, pay should be higher given the position. Hardest part of the job is the training which is often mountains of irrelevant info. Most enjoyable is talking to the customers."
good,High volume of people per day. Office performed pre employment physicals and drug screens. Good clinical staff for very stressful environment.  Enjoyed most of the varied people who came in.
good,"When I worked for UHG I was always unhappy because they micromanaged us and didn’t appreciate us. The management team were BFFS and if you weren’t in the circle, you knew. But you have an opportunity to learn A LOT about the health insurance field . Take the good wth the bad..."
good,Job culture and the work style could have been better.The work timings and the work place could have been better. There is nothing much to learn apart from the existing products of the company
good,Only people that are well-liked by management are promoted. They are extremely strict and cause too much stress for employees. They micromanage everyone
good,great place to start if your looking to get in the insurance business.  The company has a very good moral that will keep you with them. they need more room for advancemnt.
good,I enjoyed working for Optum/UHG. My coworkers there were the reason for family and team work. When this company does not need you anymore. Your out. They told us that we were secure in our positions and then the next week they were walking in with packets stating we were being let go.
good,"The company offers most employees to work from home on a daily basis, which is competitive in this current market.  "
good,"It is a very large organization. So, every position is different with different people and a different experiences. The environment I was in was a bit challenging. They have older 2008 technology trying limp along and not plan for proper upgrading. There is not enough time to stop and ""do what is right"". It is difficult to tell those who have been there forever when bonuses depend on saving money that they need to use to pay for current tech. There can sometimes feel like a lack of guidance."
good,"ok place to work... hours were not realistic for a call center ."
good,"Great environment,opportunity for advancement. Flexible Learning experience. Communication with Director was great he was advice able with all changes."
good,UHC was a great place to work.  I've made many life-long friends working there.  UHC is a national health insurance carrier which afforded many opportunities for an employee to grow in their career.
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Offers stability and flexibility. Some opportunity for growth, but limited. Work at home opportunities in some roles offered to the best of the best employees."
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho era atender 70/80 ligações ao dia, agendando exames, consultas e procedimentos em geral para beneficiários do Plano Amil. Aprendi o quão difícil é trabalhar para um plano de saúde, pois muitas vezes você tem a vontade de ajudar as pessoas, para que seus procedimentos sejam feitos com o devido prazo e a empresa não permitir. A direção/gerência eram acessíveis porém quando alguma reclamação era chegada até eles, a demora para resolver era grande e muitas vezes eram reclamações sérias. O ambiente de trabalho era agradável, as pessoas faziam o possível para ajudar quando havia alguma dificuldade. A parte mais difícil era pessoas, já com uma idade avançada e não poder marcar uma consulta para quando ela desejasse ou quando era lhe pedido retorno, pois as agendas eram muito escassas. Ou uma senhora pedindo reconstrução da mama devido um câncer e o plano permitir marcar porém, no ato o próprio plano desligava o médico por alegar ser um procedimento muito caro."
good,"Job is home based. Isolation was a factor. I prefer to be hands on care and interactions with my staff and patients. Working out of the home, then staying home is ideal for some candidates, but was not a good fit with my personality."
good,This job gave me the opportunity to see how hard work and dedication could pay off. But at the same time some of the tactics with paying out or approving claims left me more than uncomfortable when dealing with families with ill family members.
good,"Management was below par."
good,"This company offer you opportunity to work home,Top 10 Fortune 500 Company, lot of diversity, opportunity to gain experience and knowledge in order to get  promote.  Opportunity to relocate nationwide."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Too much work. Caseloads are very high and they continuously as for more paperwork. Expectations are too high for the amount of members that each case manager has.
good,"Depending on the Manger, they really believe in work/life balance. This is also a very fast past company so you typically work through lunch if you want to leave on time or not stay late."
good,"UHC is new in the Medicaid market with ongoing changes in management, structure and programing. It is fast paced and requires over full time hours for completion of job responsibilities effectively. I am looking for improved life balance."
good,"The overall job was pleasant, however, they stated they were more focused on quality than quantity and I don't believe that was correct. There were some unrealistic metrics which in my opinion lost them quite a few competent employees to other companies."
good,My job at UHC was to manage a sales service team of 21.  The department was loosely managed and processes were changing constantly.  The hardest part of the job was to interpret the changes and communicate them to the team.
good,"I work in a quiet office setting in a small team within a mid-sized department.  Pleasant working environment.  Very corporate culture.  Management is okay; some supervisors are wonderful, some not so much.  Work load varies; sometimes it is very doable, other times it's a bit too much."
good,Some like it some dont i enjoyed getting the experience. Really helps with getting better jobs and call center experience. The company so far has been bought out by United healthcare and called Optum RX. Things may have gotten better.  Unlimited OT during peak times.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Working for UnitedHealth Group was very rewarding, helping member get the best service possible while assisting  with their benefit needs.  However, management and work culture was less rewarding, it was a very stressful environment, management and upper leadership would  micro-manage and have favorites which was very mediocre in the work place."
good,"Great staff and environment is very cultural.  Everyone is excepted regardless of ethnicity, gender, hair color, tattoos, piercings etc. "
good,"Best thing is the opportunity to work remotely and transfer out of state. Also, you can make a decent living working there. You have to basically know someone to get promoted from within."
good,It is a good place to work. People are very friendly. Employees work very hard and focus on accomplishing company goals and objectives. Compensation is not bad. Employees are encourage to participate in stock purchase.
good,Smart people but very click oriented. They need some more cultural diversity. The raises or not more than 2% and if you don't get your cash on the front end then you will probably miss out based on the bonus structure which is dependent on the market.
good,Rarely any work to do and management is clueless about what is going on. Not a meritocracy. Company culture is fun if you are or were apart of TDP program. Unsure what experience is like if not. Very generous stock options and work from home policy. Get at least 23 pto days.
good,Too much to learn putting things mildly. You are consistently verifying eligibility with multiple insurances providers and no direction from managers.
good,"Overall OK, Management hierarchy is not good, a lot of partialities "
good,Great Benefits  for the amount of  work youre doing. The people are friendly and they make you feel right at home. The company works hard towards collaboration and improvement
good,"UHG is not a bad place to work,  the paid and benefits could be better for the type of work that is being done there.  "
good,"As with any job, your direct manager dictates much of your experience. I had horrible managers within one area of the company, moved to a great manager, was then re-organized under yet another person. Absolutely respect my direct supervisor, but feel this person is not supported by our more senior leader. Seems to be an existing network of people who climb, and are given opportunities to climb. Then there are those who are incredibly disrespectful to others and  the company culture, and leadership allows them to demoralize the rest of the team."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"UHG is a company you can advance in. It is good for entry level employees who want to learn at a face pace, eager to compete with their peers for positions and contribute to the community with volunteer events."
good,Overall it's a good company to work for once you are able to find an area that you fit in with.  Ther performanced based pay and benefit offerings could be better.
good,"The company offers a lot of perks and benefits to make the company seem more worthwhile, but the management is the issue. It's unfortunate to have a company that offers so much to be lacking in such an important area."
good,"I was not pleased with the silo'd culture and really poor benefits.  Working for the largest insurance company in the country and I had the worst benefits while paying the most for them, than for any other company I have ever worked for.  "
good,"Management did not do what was promised. Company culture was not comfortable, promotion given was on false pretenses. Employees were not equally held accountable."
good,"Poor management skills, the job has great benefits and good pay. However you don't have a schedule option you work when they want you too. the culture can be very fun and team oriented."
good,I feel like although the company has really good principles and standards for quality of service to members they do not have those same principles practiced with their employees.  Employees are not recognized as individuals but more like numbers.  Very sad.
good,Fast paced job with a lot of room for growth. Hours very and shift is usually set to work every other weekend. Job pays well but can be stressful during peak season
good,a typical day is nice your not micro manage they give you a daily goal and a work instruction to follow and you process as many claims with very little to no errors as possible. you have audits and weekly meetings. 
good,United Health Group is a large organization with many options for employees.  The programs and offerings to employees are just some of the many perks to working for this organization.
good,great place to work. Great atmosphere flexible hours while have long days and over time opportunities. Tuition reimbursement and travel opportunities. The well program is a great benefit.
good,"Typical day at work starts with flexible schedule, but a certain time to be in by. logging in, reviewing emails received, making sure what the daily itinerary was and proceeding with team and solo projects."
good,Hourly desk job. Low stress. Low expectations of employees. Indeed will not let me say less about this job. Not much chance at advancement within the company.
good,It's important to watch your time on the phone because it will affect your statistics for the month. It's also important to watch your schedule adherence. If you're late to lunch or break you have to email your manager with the updated time and reason why you were late with proof ( screen shot of the call you were on)
good,"I had the best manager, even when I left we are still friends.  Always looking out for the best interest of her employees.  She always made work enjoyable.  Thank you Melinda Dey,  you are the best!"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job at first was us working together as a team. collaborating together to get to resolution of issue. enjoyed learning and overcoming challenges together.  the hardest part was getting though the expectations of new management with very little communication.
good,"The building is state of the are w nice amenities.  Workplace culture is what you expect from a corporate company.  Desk job, on the phone over 50% of time."
good,I was a customer service rep and would sell insurance or make appointments for some one to come to customers home to fill them in on what plans that were available in their area.
good,"Good product knowledge.  Classes offered monthly.  Instructors are knowledgeable.  Straight commission job, you need to find prospects on your own.  Work from home."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Strong company, good benefits, but they will cut your position in a heartbeat without trying to move you. Compassion is supposed to be a core value, but Upper Management appears to have never take it seriously."
good,managed territories each day that were anywhere from 2-3 hrs drive one -way.......affected sales production . Hardest part of job was everyday travel and lack of marketing . most enjoyable part of the jpb was the pay/benefits and flexibility . Interacting with the clients/customers and being able to serve them.
good,"I addressed benefits, medical and financial account claims inquires and processed flexible spending and health reimbursement account claims in a all center environment."
good,"Nothing to say here."
good,"É uma empresa que atualmente não tem plano de carreira, com isso gera um pouco de insatisfação.O salário também é baixo comparado a outras empresas do mesmo segmento. Oferece beneficios, como vale alimentação e refeição, convenio médico e odontológico."
good,"am a part of the Devops team which has almost 250 – 300 production servers. We are having a lot of clustering environments and to be precise, I am part of the team which is handling lot of deployments on all the environments. Part of my role is to monitor the performance of the servers and to do any clustering on top of them, if needed."
good,"Its a nice place in general, typical call center environment. Very stressful , good training, great managers, for being a health insurance company the insurance benefits for the employees are very high   which result in employees getting health insurance somewhere else . In general not a bad job but keep in mind is very fast pace and stressful."
good,I was laid off and hadn't even made a full year. benefits were great and I liked what I did but no job security. Overall good place to work and I would  go back if rehired.
good,"UHC gives new hires very thorough training.  After the training  you advance to taking actual calls from specific queues and if you master those calls you earn a place on the floor at your own desk.  The job is interesting but very fast paced and very stressful due to call volume, the amount of information you have to continuously learn, and dealing with frustrated callers."
good,You have the ability to work from home if you are approved and prove that you can do it without a negative impact to your work. Management is mediocre and always changing every few months.
good,"typical day at work was 10 plus hours a day processing claims for Medicare/Medicaid that are 30 plus days old."
good,"a typical work day is to arrive to log onto the phones 10 mins prior to scheduled shift, received 50 to 75 calls daily to either take payments or contract knowledge."
good,"Constant changes, micromanagement. You are able to work from home 20hrs a week after a probationary period. It is really a sales job because it is all about the numbers."
good,"While the team in itself has a vision and a visionary leadership to back it up, the overall work culture of the organisation can be improved by focusing on softer skills of the employees- which needs to be evaluated better at the time of hiring."
good,Nothing special. Just an average company with average benefits and compensation is slightly below industry standard. Generous PTO and work from home policy is a huge plus that keeps me around for the time-being.
good,"United Health Care was a decent place to work for.  Was difficult to find areas for advancement, it just depends on your location.  It all just depended on who your manager was and the potential they saw in you."
good,this company is a good company to work for if your starting of in the pharmacy career the good thing about this job is they assist you with getting you Pharmacy tech cert
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I was a telecommuter, for over 5 yrs worked as an auditor. logged in started working and did not have to wait for directions or instructions on how to do my job. worked from a queue that was assigned to me and had different work items to audit through out the day. Job was enjoyable and challenging, because every claim was different and had to focus on the job. Making sure claims were linked to the correct provider or facility, verifying billing info if it was updated in our systems and notes were added stating info was verified ."
good,I left UHC because I was offered a role in their sister company Optum. I enjoyed my time at UHC but thought Optum would provide greater growth opportunities
good,"Good exposure, good learning skills,  agile methodology implementation and execution is very good, good exposure new technologies, good encouraging in learning new technology"
good,MedSynergies is well known in the industry for vetting processes within the revenue cycle and identifying opportunities to improve processes and reducing the cost to deliver. I learned accountability and integrity.
good,United Health care was ok to work for. Just not enough team work. Co-workers not very friendly. Management not always available. No training at all. A lot of meeting during the day.
good,"IT group is a horrid mess; third party facilitator of our UM/CM system cannot handle or fix existing issues. When one thing gets fixed, something else breaks as a result. A vicious circle with no real skill on the part of the third party to get ahead of issues as identified."
good,Pretty good company to work for. Pretty good work/life balance. Training could be better and micromanagement is as a minimum. Beware of Clinical Managers who have favorites.
good,"The company expected strong work ethics and provides an fast paced work environment. Uses the team concept in all departments."
good,"When I worked there the atmosphere was very stressful. The Supervisors and manager did not seem to care about the mental or physical health of the employees. There were many people who suffered from extreme anxiety and heart issues due to working at this job,"
good,"I handled the Accounts for the Federal  Employees, and some small groups.. the environment here is very competitive.. I am glad I "
good,"Nice being at home, able to save on gas, travel time, maintenance on vehicles, but I do miss seeing my coworker.. "
good,"Good enviroment culture abd job balance, data transparancy is most important on this organization."
good,"As a person who would want to make sure their employees are happy with their current day to day activities, I think the up head management at the time needed to pay a little more attention to those who would work and put more effort to make sure everything goes smoothly around the clock. My team, I was training was amazing to work with.I'm sure by now everything is in place when I was working them they were going through changes of ownership."
good,"Things change and if organizations don't adapt, then it's a problem. UHG was a is still a great place to work if you work with the right people. People spoil the culture and unfortunately, that is happening here."
good,"UHG offers great benefits, but overworks their employees and are very disorganized.  Leadership is constantly pressed to save money, but rarely take the time to see where they can achieve more cost avoidance rather than cost savings.  They need to learn to work smarter, not harder."
good,It can be a little politically intense but there's variety of opportunities within the organization.  It's diverse and can be a little chaotic but not from lack of diversity in technology
good,The job is fast paced and we never really get trained properly in any of the roles we are promoted to. There is little room for advancement no matter how hard you work. The only growth is being forced into another stressful role.
good,Working environment in united health group is not so good shift timing are odd but incentive are good a person who wants to make money can go in united health group management is very slow especially separation team.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I am thankful for the opportunity that the company has provided me with. This position has allowed me to provide for my family and understand the culture of the call center environment.
good,I loved my job and most of the people I worked with however management leaves a lot to be desired. I would go back under different management in a heartbeat.
good,it is very good work/life balance. You need to have contacts to move within the company in different departments. there are lots of locations and commute is good.
good,Answer calls from members and help with their medical insurance needs. Research and resolve issues as needed per the member. medicaid/medicare commercial.
good,"Working in a cubicle for 8 hours a day was not for me. The amount of micromanaging that took place made it very hard to be yourself and do your best at your job. I say that because I believe what makes a person great at their job... is the ability to bring to the table what makes them a hard ,creative worker,... the ability to be yourself without the restraints of this type of harsh corporate environment."
good,"My work week was very flexible on what hours you could work.  This was great with dealing with family issues that came up.  I worked 4/10's so left me with plenty of time."
good,UHG is a great company but there isnt enough consistency with how the job is done and training is horrible. Its sink or swim. Everyone is nice but everyone seems to be on a different page when it come to the job.
good,"Communicate effectively by interacting with the provider group and health plans daily  regarding referral authorization issues. Maintain patient confidentiality so that HIPAA compliance is observed at all times. Process request that are approved, denied or deferred and bring them to resolution."
good,"Existem alguns problemas no que tange a capacitação e treinamento, pois eles implantam novos métodos para o trabalho e não capacitam o colaborador com antecedência, ou seja, vc aprendi ali na hora, na frente do cliente."
good,UHC is a great company to work with emphasis on customer service. Very good benefits and competitive salaries. Diverse employees in terms of ethnicity. With new push of creating more profits and wall street ratings employees have been pressured to take more caseload because there were less people in the dept. compared to the increase in business.
good,Empresa que visa profissionalismo.Não oferece benefícios algum.Profissionais terceirizados
good,"I worked for this company for seven years and wish I had moved on long before I did.  There were certain managers I really liked over the years, I only have one or two work place horror stories in seven years, so have no personal complaints, but they simply are a business first, and the 'talk' about taking care of their patients was very much geared only toward meeting industry requirements and not a true sense of caring for the people."
good,"Flexible work schedule but you find yourself working 50-60 hours per week.  However, you will be learning new things because management likes you to be cross-trained on other functional areas."
good,"I love that they really push working form home so that way you are not having to deal with any time away from family unless absolutely necessary.  Their pay structure is OK, but based on my experience, and the cost of living doesn't quite match with their pay rate."
good,"Good job security and pay as per the market standards and one of the best healthcare insurance company to work with but long office hours, growth is slow and work pressure is more."
good,Working for United Health Care was a very helpful experience. It help me gain more patience when dealing with member/customers. It also help me broaden my vocabulary to different empathetic ways of customer service.
good,I would refer someone to work  with this company I really learned a lot of helpful work lessons to help me with other jobs. I have nothing bad to say about the company.
good,"Very fast paced, with a heavy workload. The company has a good atmosphere, private workspaces for all employees. There plenty of room for advancement within the company, within a short period of time."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Just joined in January 2017 here in UHG and not started work at all. For the people who love technical job it is not a best place to work.  So I want to migrate from this. As this is a product based company, the people who worked earlier in service based, cannot get used to this."
good,I worked as a temp there as a receptionist. The boss that I have was such a great mentor. I could not have a better mentor than any other boss in the world.
good,A typical day at  United health Group can be sometimes different everyday because your job can change daily depending what is needed and what team you are on.
good,Good job opportunities with good salary....friendly working environment...more challenges with fruitful rewards...
good,Great place for telecommute roles. There is a lot of flexibility and work-life balance. Many different career options that individuals can explore as well as training.
good,"Good job if you only have a high school diploma. However, the company tracks everything you do to make sure you are processing a claim per minute. Training is less than stellar."
good,great company to work for if you want to work over seas. They were flexable for doctors appointment and vacation. The only reason why I left is because they sent my job to India
good,United health group is a very large organization that offers many opportunities and areas for growth.The most enjoyable part of my day includes caring for patients and interacting with families and staff. I have learned a lot working at united health group working closing with NP's and MD's.
good,"I was in Customer Service,and they wanted us to process claims between phone calls.  This pretty much impossible to do and keep up the stats for both customer sevice and claims.  Very stressful work enviroment where monitors would IM us when we were not in compliance with finishing after call work so we could be available to be on the phones again.  Benefits were good, but the stress was just too much for a lot of us."
good,"Answer incoming calls and help to resolve members questions, find the right dept that can help, schedule appointments, verify insurance, basically help the members with whatever they need."
good,"easy work "
good,"I had worked for 1.11 years ,one should join at the end of his career."
good,"Great work/life balance.  Healthcare is always changing, so having a creative mindset and bringing new ideas to your managers/peers seems to be encouraged.  If you are a 'self-starter / go-getter' you will succeed.  Promotions typically come later than expected, but it is usually rectified at some point down the line - if you expect to stay within the company for your career, it seems as though they'll make it right."
good,"multitask is a typical day at work"
good,Sitting at a desk all day following strict guidelines and being yelled at or expected to process a certain amount of applications per shift isn't my nieche.
good,Great place to work. People love to work for the company. Good facilities. Timely management. Healthcare Industry. Good competitor for other companies.
good,"UHG is a great company to work with, you will face any challenges which would help you to hone your technical skills."
good,Supervisors send email of job we will complete per day. Some days the leaders were not clear on which jobs we were to do. They had multiple new hire training's which took away the time to assist the current staff which caused errors in work. I liked co-workers.
good,Hardest part of the job is being stuck on phone all day answering non stop calls.  Love talking to the people though from all across the US.
good,United Health Group had a great group of people to work with. Management has significantly changed and there's a lot of micro-managing. The work culture has changed making it no longer a pleasant place to work. Morale was considerably low with a huge turn-over!
good,UHG is a good platforms to make career. work life is balanced. working atmosphere is good. however career growth is slow because of tricky policy.
good,"UHC is a great company for work/life balance.  They are adaptable to all situations, and work with you to provide that.  The employees are eager to help you succeed at your job any way that they can,  I learned a lot in my year about the company and their products.  They also assign you a mentor for the first year, which was a great experience and a big help."
good,Enjoyed working with my team mates and enjoyed the knowledge that was obtained
good,"It was a good job but they do alot of outsourcing!"
good,Lots of work - keeps you very busy.  Working above 40 hours a week on a consistent basis.  The best part of the job is the people you work with - they are all very interested in putting together a good insurance product.
good,"I enjoyed working for Arbonne but there was no room to grow, I like jobs that give you the ability to advance and not just make promises to keep employees. I loved my co-workers and the environment but I like to progress in life so I walked away."
good,Nice to have approachable managers. My day began early at 6:30am because all of my accounts were located on the east coast. This worked well in the since that I am a morning person.
good,Remote workforce is a great advantage. Able to handle many diverse and competing demands
good,"I would take back to back calls from customer service agents, that for the most part had system issues. They couldn't access certain systems, that could give them the information they needed to pass along to the customers. This is a fast pace work environment which I enjoy."
good,Great experience working at catamaran. Was able to learn a lot about how prescription our processed and the importance of PBM companies for PTs and Pharmacies. Hardest part of the job was doing what were called high dollar overrides for pharmacies.
good,it is a great job as long as you are meeting goals and if you are not  then you have a problem.
good,"job had great potential; great support team, home-based; learned how to develop contract language; saw both good and poor examples of leadership, some in management lacked people skills, double-standards run rampant; upper management tends to rely far too much on their underqualified team leads, who regularly look out only for themselves and are poorly chosen (a hard worker does not a good team lead make); job atmosphere changed from relaxed to toxic in short span of time; far too much time spent on team building (usually done after management receives poor reviews from employees); good employees tend to leave for better opportunities, leaving mediocre work force behind; management rarely on the level concerning promotions as they are based on who will be good minions vs. those who are good managers; not open to change or ideas; everything must fit established mold or else you are viewed as a liability; my manager was great and management in general was very nice, but they had to follow the company's guidelines; laid off on 6/24/2014; position not filled (hiring freeze)"
good,"Our workday didn't change much after our small health plan was bought out, if anything workload is less because UHC is more vertical and there's less responsibility creep.  It's well organized but unresponsive to problems.  Managers are cordial and professional,  other employees are pleasant and easy to work with,  especially in the department.   The hardest part of this company is finding out information to solve problems - you tend to get a steady stream of ""Not my job.""   You're heavily dependant on the managers to fight inertia which is hit and miss.  If you make good connections there are opportunities.  Maybe it's just being in a bought out branch, but most people complain about the lack of raises, and overtime is non existent."
good,"Our patients are our top priority. Making sure we're able to supply each of them with what's needed is a must at all times. A typical day at work consists of preparing totes for nursing home facilities to be transferred at night by drivers. We all work together to make sure each medication has been viewed by 3+ people (including pharmacist on duty) for accuracy. Working with Pruitt the past four years, I've learned how upper management does go above & beyond minimum requirements to make sure our impression is indeed a lasting one. My coworkers are a team and definitely willing to pull together to do what's asked of as well as expected. The most enjoyable part of the job is the commute, the flexibility as well as the attitude of upper management. However, the hardest part is the inability to learn of new drugs on the market."
good,"Flexible but unstable. Seems okay to work there."
good,"Sou uma profissional que trabalho com ética, respeito ao próximo, trabalho em equipe."
good,"I worked for United Healthcare for 2 years doing a temporary project for Hedis.  I had extensive Excel, customer service, and reviewing patient charts.  It was a great experience."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Day to day routine is handling complex and simple billing issues .Learned a variety of procedures and processes that greatly enhance my prospects towards future careers. favorite part of the job is solving an issue a customer has been having for a long period of time, sometimes months. Most difficult/unenjoyable part of the job is having to clear up misinformation other departments have given that results in a financial or health-related hardship to the beneficiary. Upper mgmt is terrible but immediate supervisors are great. Co-Workers are excellent but they are dropping like flies due to recent mgmt change"
good,Your geographic location can hinder your advancement if your not at a major location or willing to relocate.  There are also a lot of positions that can have an advancement ceiling due to the nature of the job and department.
good,"Goal oriented job atmosphere under new management."
good,"UHC overall is a great company to work for. The employees are great, the benefits are ok, and they allow WAH"
good,"Great Place to Work with High End Facilities and good perks. started my Career with United and learnt each and everything professionally here only, United is company that has a great stability factor for all the employees, not one of those companies who fire employees more often...."
good,"depending on the day and time of years calls at time are hard to handle but and time goes by pretty fast, great people and managmen is awesome as well. They are always willing to help"
good,"I learned the other side of claims processing because I had only seen it from the customer service side previously. Typically, our day was spent processing medical claims from an internal queue using Medicare guidelines through an external website and internal processes through our intranet. Management was very helpful and co-workers worked well together, however, the product came from Ireland so when business did not pick up as expected, our department was laid off and that part of the business was left in Ireland. that was the hardest part of the job because the job itself and the people and environment were all very positive. I mostly enjoyed the fact that our team had a very positive outlook which boosted morale."
good,"A typical day at work is sitting in a cube, and taking about 60 to 90 calls a day. Currently, the company is downsizing, so more work is being passed on to the current employees of the company.  As of now more tasks are being assigned to everyone.  The best thing about the job is the amount of PTO that is given is amazing.  There are no solid policies within the company, everything is on at ""management's discretion."""
good,Acting Liaison for Houston area Medical Director and all Managed Care Departments.
good,"UNited health care is a fun place to work. It is on the cutting edge of technology and able to move with change. THe only downside to UHC is the benefits, the employees insurance package is the worst being that you work for an insurance company, but the upside is your vacation time is great you accrue between 5-8 hrs every pay period. so you can take days off when you need them instead of waiting for a year like most jobs"
good,Good employer to work in telecommuter positions. Leading Health and Wellness company.
good,"Very good company, provides nice work life balance for employees. Very supportive to the surrounding community. We as employees  volunteer our time and services to support local community efforts in giving back locally and nationally   Great group of people and management style is very supportive."
good,This is an ever changing world and overall this company handles the change well.
good,"nice people , very busy all the time high call volume,clean  area"
good,"I like the job until they move and made it a call center environment. Some of the co-workers were very nice people and made you feel welcome, however when the move took place our department that move were made to feel like out siders"
good,"A typical day at work would be to enter all exceptions into the system.  Who called in sick, late. Vacation Administration for all Representatives in Arizona and Texas call center."
good,"UHC is an awesome place to work however, there are particulars that will have you at the Unemployment Office faster than you can blink an eye . Although this employer practices great work/life balance, it's all about who your manager is and how well you kiss up that will take you far in this company."
good,"Arrived at work around 7:30am, checked into security, logged into system established game plan for the day, got to work. I learned a lot about insurance, sales and customer service. Management was fairly down to Earth and engaging. Most if not all of my co-workers were very nice and talkative. The most difficult thing about the job was the co-workers that didn't want to be there and sometimes the headphones that we used to speak to clients would not work, which  would then make those clients upset. Helping clients with their problems and the good co-workers."
good,good working environment. I learn most of the things in reporting related.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Assist healthcare providers with claims, primary care physician changes and member eligibility. Also assist in any other areas that they may require assistance in. It's an ever changing enviroment so one must make sure that they are always ontop of the changes. The most challenging part of the job are slow computer systems but there are many work arounds to solve that issue. The most enjoyable part of the job is that no 2 days are like, everyday is a new day."
good,A company who prints and produces mail in a timely manner. You work with  a partner.
good,Catamaran is a fast growing company. Enjoy the ability to work remotely.
good,UHC gave me the opportunity to work on new processing programs and HealthCare plans. I was part of a good Team with a wonderful Supervisor. The plan we worked on was challenging and often the red tape made process improvements difficult. 
good,Assist medicare and retiremement members with their benefits/eligibility inquiries and claim issues.
good,The company offers wonderful benefits and pay but state they are a family based company but their policies are not family based
good,Good place to work at with several employee friendly activities taking place day in and day out.
good,"United Healthcare is all about three things: growth, maintaining a public image, and doing what's required at least expense to the company.  The pay is below market, the hours long and there's a lot of talk of going to do the right thing.  Sadly that rarely happens."
good,A day at work was good but very fast paste. The co-workers were ok. I just tried to stay to myself because it is a call center. The managment is what they really need to work on within the company. Alot of things go on but its a ok company overall to work for.
good,"United Health Group, in particular Optum Insight has all the makings of a great company to work for in terms of benefits and lifestyle. Compensation could be better. As a business they focused too much on profits, and too little on being really great at delivering first in class solutions to customers. Their ability to execute, at least from my vantage point was only mediocre. It hurt their customer relationship, and ultimately their profitability."
good,management is not that much good
good,"• Develops facility-based fee schedules, policies and strategies to ensure that contracted rates and reimbursement policies are applied accurately for company affiliates."
good,United Health Group has truely enlightened the work culture of an IT MNC.The best in an employee is brought out in the company and is used to the fullest for the betterment of the individual and the firm at the same time.It was a great kick start to my career in IT.Surely looking forward for similar or better environments which can help enhance my skill set even further.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering phone calls and helping a caller, rather they are nice or rude was acceptable but than I dealt with management on the side with nic picks like you stayed on the call to long helping the caller, are you have to watch your time limits we set for you, even if you are helping another co-worker (newbie). I learned alot about this job such as how a member health benefits work.(well from mental health/behavioral heath side). The most enjoyable part of the job is the parties, rather going away, holiday, or birthday. It was nice all our departments in the area gather together."
good,"Typical day start at 8:30 on the phone making follow up calls to the providers. I've learn a few things about the healthcare field, co-workers are easy to communicate with. Wouldn't say the job is hard at all just challenging, most enjoyable part is we are not micro managed."
good,I have worked for the company for a long time and at first I advanced very fast from Quilty to Contracts to Large Group Billing Accountant to Small Group Accountant and then as Mamsi came to an end I moved into the United Healthcare part. I became a Provider Service Rep and have been frozen since. I have since seen younger people come into the company making more than me and also advancing after only being there for only a year so that is why I'm trying to fine a company to work for with more advancement and security.
good,Good place for ladies and those looking for flexibility at work
good,since it is a back office job and continuous night shifts found it difficult to cope up
good,A typical day involved field work and monthly staff meetings.
good,A typical day at work is very busy. From the time you log on in the morning until you leave in the evening you have something to do. I felt I did not learn as much as I could have because no one has the time to train. There are always assignments to be done with short deadlines. The co-workers were great there. I enjoyed working with my fellow team mates and employees outside of my team. I think the hardest part of the job was trying to balance the job responsibilities and personal responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,A typical work day at UnitedHealthcare was making sure my team of 5 employees where on time and had the tools needed for a prductive work day. I have learned about many services and programs health insurance offeres. All management at the office where very supportive with work issues as well as advancement. My co-workers where alway punctual and respectfull of others opinions. The hardest part of my job was having to write someone up for not following rules and regulations. The most enjoyable part of my job was doing community outreach.
good,"Foi meu 1º emprego todo dia tinha uma novidade, aprendi muito de recepção e na área medica, nao tinha contato com diretores, mais a gerência pessoas derterminadas,a equipe muito boa, dificil com era meu 1º emprego ficava um pouco nervosa mais com o tempo foi passando e agradável era saber que estava gostando do que tinha escolhido para fazer."
good,Great place to start. A company with an open proactive mind.
good,I have gained skills from this job that will help me in my current job. I enjoy working from home. We come in once a month for team buliding which is great. I would like them to promote from within. Working from home with new management has become stressful.
good,"Busy, fast passed. Learned to use time efficiently. Management tough but fair. The hardest part of the job is a heavy work load. Most enjoyable part of the job is co-workers."
good,"Working with company management teams, SME's, graphic artists and various departments to create print ready member and marketing materials for the senior members for SecureHorizons, AARP, Evercare and Erikson"
good,-most people work here for more than 5 years
good,"Each day offers new challenges. No day is typical, there are limited comfort zone activities."
good,"Good company to be employed with there is definitely room for promotions and an increase in pay, but the late hours are not feasible for me at the moment, as I have small children. The thing that really sets the company apart from other billing agencies is that are very emphathetic to the patients needs and they ensure core values are used on a daily basis which keeps the patients happy therefore keeping the physicians of service happy as well."
good,"Finance and accounting teams worked very hard and long hours. Really smart people in general. Great industry, making excellent efforts to innovate and drive change. Two things I didn't like was that there was a lot of internal waste, especially in IT: meaning, they had issues with an inverted pyramid (lots of expensive leaders, not enough early - career doers), and lot of internal teams charging each other without an incentive to stay market competitive. The other big issue is that it was extremely difficult for anyone internally to get promoted beyond Director - most of the senior leaders were external hires."
good,"I was there 19 plus years and was laid off.  No lateral transfers to other available jobs , so i lost my vacation benefits etc.  So  that was hard.  I liked my job though."
good,The job is fine. The pay is fine. The micromanaging and hidden policies bring this place down. But hey it pays right? The culture really is what they lean on but they don't tell the dozens of way you could be terminated for simple misunderstandings and infractions.
good,Mediocre benefits and substandard treatment of middle management. Pay is average and work culture is entirely dependent on department and management. Recommended as entry level for first time young professional.
good,HCC coders run out of work. If you aren't in the top ten coders you will be furloughed. Switched me to another project and wanted to give up because it was not what I signed up for.
good,"I truly believe in the overall goal of WellMed PSO, as it is to ensure and assist Medicare patients to live their healthiest life possible; however there are limited growth opportunities along with low compensation and zero incentives."
good,As part of the merger with United Health Group the Polyclinic deferred spending and maintenance to get ready for the merger. Once the merger was finalized United Health Group did not want to spend additional money to catch up on deferred items.
good,"This company is very profitable but has continuous layoffs throughout the year.  The layoffs are very random and unexpected.  Also, the reduction in FTEs causes added stress on employess who remain with the company/department."
good,Company started doing layoffs and not new management not as good as old management. My leadership team was amazing and was there for you as a employee and a person. I am no sure how they choose who to let go but in my eyes I do not agree with some of the personnel they laid off.
good,UHG is a company employee compassionate focus and family driven organizations. A very open door policy between employees and employer . Great benefits and incentives. .
good,The healthcare sector was very fast paced and intense.  Company senior management made questionable decisions around structure and staffing. The company did compensate well and provided plenty of work flexibility.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The has a good culture. Their goals are solid and geared toward excellence in productivity. I enjoyed being able to work remotely. I enjoy working here.
good,I worked with United Healthcare for 11 plus years. Great opportunity to achieve many accomplishments. I had the privilege to work from home. Good Learning Source available.
good,"I would have stayed at this company until retirement had they not decided to downsize employee jobs. The benefits were not great for employees. I really enjoyed having the flexibility of working from home, I learned a great deal that helped to enhance my clinical skills, and I really enjoyed the people that I worked with."
good,Most employees are nice. My manager is great. She communicates daily tasks effectively & listens to any suggestions for improvement. To advance with the company it's sometimes about who you know so you have to network but that still is no guarantee. I was qualified for several positions and had recommendation by my boss and her boss but still did not successfully move into another role. You can work from home after 2 months if you are meeting metric requirements.
good,"Its ok.  Like anything in life, look for the opportunities and if there are none, move on.  Optum has opportunitites for growth and advancement if you can get it."
good,"A work in progress….affords all employees the opportunity to advance,  lots of energy and enthusiasm. Amazing guiding principles and core values but they are loosely applied."
good,must be comfortable with working independently and a self starter with confidence in managing complex medical needs in long term care setting.  risk adjusted coding
good,"I have had the change to direct my own career progression and management my day to day activities. It is a fast paced environment, and I am surrounding by intelligent, driven, supporting peers however there is a significant shortage in budget to support the required process changes."
good,"Be able to work productively and effectively"
good,Understand that you are joining an enormous company with a lot of levels of interest from separate and exclusive parts to your specific work group.  This top down culture can be challenging but obviously a great company.
good,"I have been working at UnitedHealth Group full-time for more than 2 years"
good,"Good overall company to work with Will like to continue great benefits , awesome pto and insurance for sure. United health is an awesome company it’s a big company to be honest"
good,Metric driven company.  Must make so many call contacts per hour.  Calling members and competing with robo callers and spam calls.   Members will not answer but the metrics must be met.
good,"Overall, good company to work for.  I am seeking change and other employment opportunities.  Salary is fair and competitive, however, benefits could be better."
good,"Pros: Work from home, fantastic team, support from managers, fair benefits"
good,"I worked here as a contractor for a year, and during those 12 months I only became work friends with two people, an admin and a co-worker from India, and both great people! However, it's one of the most unfriendly places I've ever worked. Not hostile, just contractors aren't looked upon as someone worth having a friendship with I believe because they cycle through so often. When your contract is renewed you better hope management does it in time because if not, all your access is cut, no email, no network access, no building access, and it can take up to TWO WEEKS to get you back up and running! This happened to several of us there at the time."
good,Hardest part of the job is speaking with customers who are unhappy with insurance as a whole or customers who think insurance is always the problem.  Changing the way to get on a shift of your choice is the reason for me leaving.
good,"Fast paced, lots of changes in policy. No work life balance. Great manager. Manager was very nice and understanding. Difficult to move to another position."
good,"The pharmacy segment is the most underrated, undercompensated, and undervalued department yet it brings in the largest revenue for the entire company."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"United Health Group is a clean and productive work environment, that I would recommend to anyone looking for employment in the healthcare field with a customer service background!"
good,"The management at optum in Jax is fantastic. They are a GREAT group of people who really care about their employees. For real, not just say that they do like most companies. They're usually willing to work with you if you have issues and they are happy to help you help yourself. Work life balance is ok. They offer a ton of VTO (voulentary time off - unpaid unless you have personal time accrued)"
good,UHG is an awesome place to work and enhance your career to the next level of the hierarchy. The best thing about the UHG is good training and lots of career option to make a person make versatile.
good,"uhh is a great company as far as pay is concerned, but very stressful work environment and management is not the best. I would only recommend if you can handle stress well on a everyday basis."
good,I had issues with the role of the house calls program. Is affected my health because of going into homes of all types where I had allergic reactions and it affected my vocal cords. I ended up picking up bronchitis respiratory malady frequently and have lung scarring. They couldn't find me another position in the area. Was too bad.
good,I worked in claims and appeals and I liked that I barely had to talk to anybody. I also had a chance to work from home after a year. Pay was okay but raises and benefits were terrible.
good,It's an okay place to work. Nice people were really nice. Nice company to meet new people. Worked from last year to this year on contract. Wished I could've stayed longer
good,"Workplace culture was very laid back. Less demanding than other developer roles, but also presented less opportunities for growth and development. Health benefits were particularly poor compared to other companies in the area."
good,You will work hard and get low pay but the people there are nice and a great group to work with. They are friendly and have a ton of different events that happen
good,"Pros"
good,"I enjoyed my job and had no intention of leaving but my department was restructured. The elimination was out of the blue and with no warning. Best of all/worst of all, now they are thinking that they let too many people go and are struggling to keep up with inventory."
good,"I don't have anything much to say about this company. Although, our account no longer exists, I could say that the account was enjoyable. Recommended to everyone."
good,"I’ve worked at UHC for 2 years now. I love my job and some coworkers. As with all workplaces there are some managers that make you want to walk out."
good,"UnitedHealth Group has a great philosophy and message to send to its customers and employees, ""Helping people live healthier lives."" They promote wellness for members and employees alike, and I saw this all the time in town halls. They are also a very profit-driven company, and that's great if you're on the business side of the company. In IT, it's not so great."
good,"Great coworkers, Worked from home as a Certified Community Health Worker.  Enjoyed working with the clients and providing them with valuable resources.  "
good,"words words words, they tell you it's different, they tell you to embrace your learning style, then you get to pray you have a job everyday for their training period, distracted power hungry trainers/ojts."
good,UHC has a very fast paced work environment. Computer knowledge over the basic level is required. You must be able to operate several applications on multiple monitors quickly and accurately. The workplace is silent and you must be self-motivated as you do not have a supervisor over your shoulder watching you work.
good,"Good company to work for, alot of growth potential. Great work/home life balance. Great team work, friendly management.  Health benefits are terrible."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I didn't get to talk to customers at all. I didn't like that part. I am more of a customer one on one type person. Training was not good at the time I worked there. I do hope it has improved by now.  There wasn't even real contact with other employees.  You are asking for honesty here and I didn't really enjoy the job at all.  I just worked on a computer for 8 hours a day and then went home.  This just wasn't the right job for me. It was a safe clean place to work at however.
good,"while as a performing individual you will be recognized and compensated through annual RFP bonuses, the opportunities and the support to grow is absent"
good,"The team was good to work for."
good,"Overall, the job opportunities and employee benefits were pretty good. One thing I really liked was the HSA and how the company matched your contributions. That has saved me money on medical bills even after leaving the company. The job culture has the potential to be great, but one major deterrent was a lot of the management-employee interaction. Oftentimes, management was poor and didn't know how to lead in a team-based environment. This IS NOT ALL departments!! Just a choice few. The phones was the most awful part, especially during open enrollment period. During that time calls were in queue well into the evening-lots of OT there. When open enrollment was done, then the phones were completely dead. They have strict rules for listening to headphones and such, some managers dont like you to have any reading material or coloring books or ANYTHING. so if you don't like to be bored out of your mind daily, this isn't for you. They don't pay well for all of the things you're required to do in your role, but there is always potential for bonuses and things on your check if you REALLY go for it!"
good,I quit within a month couldnt handle it.  I felt so alone. Training was so boring and i just honestly hated it. But i dont know you might like it. Pay is awesome
good,disappointed just not organized. I would think that a company that has the resources that they have would have this problem. Also very easy to fall int between the cracks in the training process.
good,Very fun company culture. Ability to work from home and wear whatever you want within reason. Lack of work. Hard to be recognized and lack of leadership.
good,Depending on the department you work in it can be very unclear how you can advance in your career. You have the ability to chart your own path sometimes and determine what you want to do but at the same time it's easy to get boxed in to a certain position without any way to move upward or expand your skill set.
good,"""Leaders"" preach agile for the teams but very few managers and executives understand or practice servant leadership. The company has deep pockets. Provides a decent salary and average benefits"
good,Nice Place to work. very clean facility. i was with the company for 9 years until they downsized. i gained a lot while working for the company. the hardest part of the job was month end closing.
good,"Heavy calendar management and problem solving.  I learned to have a listening ear and to be patient. Management can have high expectations and meeting them can at times be challenging."
good,"If you are just getting started, this is a great place to work.  The pay is average for customer service and the products overall are easy to learn.  It is a good place to learn professional behavior and dress.  There are opportunities to promote to lead, help desk, and supervisor."
good,"Gave them a 3 overall.   I work in software development for Optum Technology.  I've had a good experience overall. I just have issues with how the TDP program is organized and ran.  Other issues are typically in software development (shortcuts with software development practices, deadlines), so those are expected sometimes.  "
good,I found it difficult to navigate all the many layers of UHC. It wants to continuous grow but doesn't focus much attention on fixing broken processes and tools. Tough place to work and keep your head above water.
good,Challenging but rewarding work environment. The toughest part of the job was learning how to establish a healthy work-life balance. The most enjoyable parts were the work-related events and initiatives the company took part in to support healthy living in the community.
good,I love the job because they incorporate family home balance. The benefits was not sufficient for my family and high premium. The work place culture was sensitive to everyone demographics. The hardest part of the job was complete the work provided in 8 hours. Overtime was not allowed for in circumstances unless it was a major project.
good,"I appreciated the professional experience and personal growth I gained during my employement with Evercare in 2002-2004, and with HouseCalls Program in 2012 -2016.  I felt like I was making a valuable contribution to the quality of care of my patients.  I felt proud to work for UHC.  I tried my best to represent my employer with Integrity, Professionalism, and High Quality Assessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment planning skills."
good,"A normal work day for me is too long into my system , start processing claims for the state of US and sometimes NJ. Help assisting other teams to get overtime. I work in average 12 hours a day."
good,"Management varied "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,If you like to be by yourself in a cubicle and just work it is a good job.  The quality standards they are set a little high but it is expected for the claims to get paid correctly.
good,"The department that I work in is highly micromanaged.  My supervisor is disconnected from employees. "
good,This is a work from home nursing position with a set schedule and production matrix that has to be met daily. It’s requires diligence and patience to perform in this position
good,"A lot of work/not for everybody. Way too much work for the pay and awful benefits for employees. Everything has a macro in order to do your work. The system always has issues so it makes it hard to be ""productive"" in a strictly productive environment. I appreciate the experience and relationships gained but overall disappointed in the company"
good,ok place to work depending on the department and supervisor you work with.  They add more and more work to your load with no pay increases.  They give plenty of paid time off but you can not use it unless you schedule over a year in advance.
good,Long drive unless you live in Franklin TN. Always leave early and be there 10 min early if your even two minutes late it’s counted against you. Some managers are great while others have a power trip
good,The job was good and was not stressful but there is no job security and will be laid off every year after open enrollment season ends. Good place to get experience for the next job.
good,"Meeting production goals are the main job responsibilities. They track your work production monthly and send out everyone's stats to the group. You must be able to work independently, you're a statistic side conversations are prohibited, which is difficult to grasp being a people person."
good,"Organizational structure is highly bureaucratic and project teams could be more productive with clear direction and better leadership and investment in tools and training for employees.  Telecommuting is convenient but teamwork and collaboration are better when there are frequent face to face interaction.  Salaries and annual increases are lower than expected, job security is stable for full time but training and gaining new skills for advancement seem to depend on internal networks instead of objective performance ratings, contributions, or accomplishments.  The culture varies depending on which project you are on and team composition, some managers are not as supportive and team members are more focused on career advancement at the expense of others on the team.  Leadership should develop a culture of professionalism, mutual respect and collaboration."
good,"UHG was a god place to work. Although I didn't stay long the second time around, if I'd had all the credentials I needed at the time to stay and work I would definitely have stayed. The pay was great and the sign on bonus wan an incentive to that."
good,"Phones, checking small business's for health Insurance.  Being in contact with people from all over the country.  Management was super fair and took care of here employees."
good,A normal work day would begin at or around 7:30am - 4pm (although most days were completed by 6 or 7 pm).  Most work days were completed remotely. Training employees and providers was very satisfying.
good,"I answered incoming calls from providers', all day long concerning their medical benefits/insurance coverage, on their patients' etc. I completed intake cases, claims bills, quoted medical coverages,etc. I also connected doctors' with other departments, such as pharmacy, vision, etc, to confirm insurance coverage."
good,"I enjoyed working at UHG. Pay is great . Work from home opportunities made it well worth it.  However, there is no chance for advancement and the atmosphere in office is toxic."
good,everyone is very wishy washiy and they don't give any two scence aout your family and ust tryng and make things better to better micromanage. they will try and seem like they are on your side and then they will burn you and make you seem not smart
good,Cheap. Company overworks the people it has but doesn't want to pay any more money. Wants one person to do 10 peoples' jobs. Did provide the opportunity to work from home eventually. Only left to become stay at home mom. Had the best manager I've ever had in my entire life though
good,"Really like what I do but I'm relocating out of state otherwise I wouldn't leave. "
good,"The health care  benefits are surprisingly expensive for an insurance company. However, my manager and my team were great and I have always been happy with the pay. There are no cool perks like a stocked kitchen or things like that. The lunch room had 2 TV's that had to remain on CNN only. However, there is a work at home option for some positions."
good,"Receiving phone calls"
good,"Company is too ""metrics"" orientated  not people orientated. For a top corporation there is too much emphasis placed on statistics this is bad considering it's a people orientated business."
good,"Best job I ever had.  Paid well, though the health insurance was no better.  Management was questionable though and ended up discharging me over a FB post.  I was in a workforce position and my manager was a pharmacist that knew nothing about WFM."
good,Good benefits not good work environment.  Too many time limits and stress.  And that's all I have to say about it.  It just wasn't the job for me at that time.
good,Alot of information to learn. It gets easier after about 2 weeks on the floor but it is not flexible at all with home life or doctor appointments. Okay compensation.
good,"In Mail Service Pharmacy a typical day at work is smooth pace. We need to know all states law, and laws are changed frequently. My team was really good including my supervisor. We all are very cooperative. Workplace culture was really good within our team. I do not have any idea about management."
good,Typical work day is fast paced and a variety of changes. There's always a fire to put out. Member's could use more continuity with workers. Cases can be handed off with being completed with persons prior requested needs.
good,This was a temporary positions. I had found a more suitable role closer to my home. The training was not as detailed as I would have liked but others staff members were always willing to help.
good,"Deal with Adjustors, attorneys, Doctor's offices, patients in critical conditions and customer service in general..  Learned how system work between insurance companies and worker's compensation issues. About company culture, was a nice environment bases on respect.  Management was professional and accessible. The best part of my job was communication, satisfaction considering that I was helpful members were pleased with my work."
good,It was a fun job. But it was fast paced and stressful place to work for. Your call's are listen to and recorded for quality control. If you got less than a 86% you recieved a demerit. So with that being said the position was always stressful.
good,"great work environment, did not like that it was a third party company and under went new company umbrella. Once new umbrella came about management and company procedures changed drastically."
good,"A typical day at medsynergies was really laid back, its up to you to pace yourself and organized your work where you can reach your productivity. The hardest part was keeping up with all the changes."
good,Immediate managers show compassion and concern in making work life balanced for the employees when you communicate. 
good,"Aside from the work/life balance, the company's environment is average at best. You are expected to go the extra mile and work hard, but they don't do the same. You're equipped with the minimum and required to produce the maximum. I don't mind hard work. I come from a blue collar family, but when the company doesn't do the same, it's a problem."
good,Though it is fast paced there are times when you get to enjoy a hula party or a county fair party (with a homegrown veggie contest!) in between the 80-100 calls you can take within one day. Your time is very structured down to the minutes you spend in the bathroom. You will have offline time which really helps the heaviness that some calls can bring you in the day.
good,The environment is either sink or swim. You meet your sales goals or you get let go. It is always pressured to meet numbers and the base pay is really low.
good,"I like working here i recommend it to anyone but I give caution to Military Reservist and guard, everytime i get back from orders my boss is upset because ive been gone. My boss has told me i should look for other work because this job requires i always be present. Legally i can't be fired for being on orders but My supervisor has made it very hard and stressful. I just got back from order from the Ventura,CA fires and boss pulled be aside and told me that people like me who have to be called upon should consider work at McDonld's or Walmart. I live in fear that they will try and find a way to get me fired. but the company overall is great"
good,"I've been here nearly half a year and customers never get tired of yelling at you especially when it comes to the systems. Computers constantly slow down and freeze, the programs and applications we use constantly crash, customers constantly rave about how bad the IVR and website is, most management don't understand why we're logged as system outage and attempting to reboot the computer."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It was a very collaborative environment and I learned a great deal of Clinical Pharmacy Operations, growing healthcare demands, Medicare and Medicaid dollars and spending, Portal development, enhancements and trying to provide as many functionalities as possible to help the business area to bring in the revenue for UHG."
good,"If your only goal in your career is to be no more than a robot on an assembly line, then this is the place to be! I had a manager for nearly 12 straight years, and he never ONCE came to visit in person. Nice guy, but that's about all I can say about that."
good,"its a high stress job. my manager was great though! it can be rewarding while sad, sometimes we are the only voices they hear for days, no talk time is nice for the members."
good,"UnitedHealth Group is good company to work and maintains good work/life balance. It provides good learning opportunity."
good,Working with uhg will give you chance to learn a lot of new things at the same time continuous night shifts will bother you. The best thing that working with uhg is the leverage you get at work which can decrease the pressure of work.
good,"UnitedHealth group seems like a dream come true when you get in however they have a terrible policy that you have to make your manager aware that you looking to make a move within the company. Most managers than do everything they can take make sure you don't get out of the department. So you end up being stuck in a department over 2 years because of them c-blocking you."
good,Its a mindless job but not bad onceyou get the hang of it. There are stats you have to reach but not too bad. The managers I had hovered a little but no real complaints there.
good,This is confidential and do not want to disclose the information or about the program at UHC. Management is good and culture is somewhat okay. The company is okay.
good,"A typical day at work was training, getting on phones answering provider questions. I learned a grat deal about health insurance policies and proceedures. Management was very busy and fast paces. The culture at UnitedHealth Group is a team enviroment which involves  teammates helping and supporting each other. The hardest part of the job is trainers and management were very busy therefore were unable to answer new employee questions."
good,"High call volume and very stressful. You are audited all the time and have to maintain their standards. Not a lot of room for advancement. The managerial staff was very clickish, it's not what you know but who you know."
good,"Optum Rx is a Pharmacy Benefit Management for United Health Group. "
good,"Contract worker and due to re-org and financial constraints, contract was not renewed.  Good management and team that I work with.  Great technologies to implement."
good,It is a great place to work. You will be challenged and learn something new almost every day. Management is very supportive and open to new ideas. I take pride in knowing that my daily work is making a difference in someone's quality of life.
good,I choose not to reply to this since the contract for this job is ending 12/31/17. It is a good job with good pay.I am fortunate to work from home for the past 2.5 years.
good,"Although the workload was extremely stressful, working with such professional, good people was a good experience for me professionally and I was able to learn a lot from them. Only left the company due to leadership."
good,The job can get very exhausting and stressful. It's non stop calls. Management is okay. The real help comes from your co workers. It's not hard to advance within the company you just have to work hard.
good,"I was a contract worker but in parting, I still didn't have the necessary access to do my job effectively and efficiently. My job was to work aged accounts by getting that account to zero balance by performing the necessary steps needed, but was hard to do without the proper tools."
good,"There were various start times from 7am to 8pm"
good,"quick paced, detailed training, youre able to receive help from mutliple employees,coaching to ensure success in career chioces.Culture environment is as any typical call center. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the supervisors. The most enjoyable part is helping members and having a purpose."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,It is difficult to navigate the system due to the large size of the company. Opportunities to move to multiple areas within the same company. Work from home opportunities!
good,United Health Group is a good employer in helping an individual achieve guaranteed satisfaction with his job and growth opportunities. The work culture is cool and the onshore and the offshore team are co-operative and helpful.
good,I was part of a team of prior authorization and I only took phone calls with were mostly escalated. This was my 4th time working for United Health Group / Optum Rx. It is a  very diversified work place. The hardest part of the job was being talked to like you were gum on the bottom of someone's shoe by the caller. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay.
good,Some of the expectations are unrealistic and not focused on patient care. The pay is competitive. The job is pretty flexible. My direct manager makes me feel appreciated.
good,"Typical work day, processing as many claims as possible, correctly, and efficiently. The environment was very friendly, allowing self- management, breaks and lunch was at my discretion. The most enjoyable part of the job was processing the claims with the SOP's. The hardest part of the job was processing claims with the daily changing SOP's and getting an error."
good,At my workplace I learnt a lot about how to work efficiently. It includes massive time in trainings. Apart from work we balance our daily schedule with fun on the floor. We keep focusing on how to make our work process better and streamlined.
good,United Health Group had a lot of turn over as they tend to say they do not but look to let go of great employees by trying to create discord with employees. This did not happened to me but working in the Human Resource there were many episodes that were being reported due to management. They like to hire then fire.
good,"The people are great, had a chance to form lasting relationships. Downside..the job that they hire you for keeps changing. The company continues to combine more job roles to your title without additional pay"
good,"Heavy Work pressure generating the Insurance documents, Claim reports. Good Social Activities, Good Health Facility like GYM, Indoor Gaming. Good Cab facility."
good,"Overall, the company is a fun place to work. They offer a lot of incentives within your insurance, which promotes you to live a healthy life style. There was recently a Leadership change and I can really tell the culture of my environment went from being hostile to more efficient. Its all about the person you have in place and the new women in leadership is a true diamond. Very nice and approachable. What I don't like about the company is the lack of communication through out the teams. There have been some cases were all someone had to do was ask the question and they refused because of their high horse Nursing degree."
good,"This is pretty much a telephonic job. You take calls, answer customer questions, direct calls to case manager, social worker or dietian. Also, you take calls from nurse practioners  and type a report of the patient health. For the most part....I didn't like the job of being yelled at by customers or being disrespected by anybody. And the worst part is that you cannot hang up on any rude or disrespectful customer, so you have to take it all in. The company is great, but the position sucks. You practically have to be glued to your desk all day."
good,"It is a good company, I would have stayed had the economy not taken a hit. The things I did not like is you could not move up from your current position. The benefits, 401K and stock options where great."
good,"It's not a good company to work, if you have great ambitions and are eager to learn. "
good,Place to work with great culture. Change is not easy @. it takes time to implement any change. Stagnate of abilities after a while. New learning seems difficult
good,"A good place to work and retire here itself."
good,Working at United Healthcare was very helpful in developing my skills as a leader.  The cultural values were great and they encouraged us to live by these cultures.
good,The hardest part of my job is being in a leadership role. with all of the changes that is going on with our company things are change a lot. We are not really able to speak on the changes to the team due to management has advice that they will send out the information when needed.
good,Learned about Customer relationships and revenue cycle management.  Lead a great group of people.  Great people to work with and incredible work life balance.
good,"A typical day starts off with a meeting with your team over Webex to discuss the new updates and go over team errors or issues. Then it would be work on claims for the rest of the day, with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break to break up the work day. Expectations for the amount of claims per hour was 44. That was quite difficult if there were any difficult claims that took longer than a minute or two, which was a pretty frequent occurrence. If you made any error that was caught, forget it, you were promptly on warning.  The computer systems were not great and further slowed people down due to issues with macros. The management was iffy, some were great and some were a little too micro-managing. Coworkers were the same as in most offices, some nice, but mostly cliques and gossip. The most difficult part of the job was maintaining that 44 claims an hour quota every day, while also making sure you made no mistakes. The most enjoyable part was having days where you received mostly good, easy claims and had a pretty smooth day without any system issues. The bi-weekly accruing PTO time was also quite a nice thing. Overall, a pretty stressful environment even with support from your team, and a company with a high turnover rate that I'm no longer surprised about."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,This company would be better if they had better leadership. And more growth opportunities. Many people who are not qualified get positions based on their social clique.
good,"Very good Pay, okay benefits and good employees to work with. Management is okay, could be a little bit better. Always have good pot lucks. Hardest part of the job is retain all the info that is needed to help the members but once you get it down pack its a easy flow."
good,Family feel.  Great team support. Mutual respect is visible. Fun workplace with nice gym to exercise.  Managers are very flexible when it comes to pto request.
good,Servicing those who have the insurance is what makes the job worth it. Being able to help someone who knows nothing and you end up giving them the knowledge they want is so rewarding
good,"Worked as a senior program manager over various projects. While this was the most challenging job I have ever had, managing  7-8 real projects simultaneously, I truly liked my team, boss as well as his senior director. In my opinion, my department had very sharp, hard working, and respectable  people working within my team. I left because my contract ended, and their offer was too low. I would love to work at UHG again in the future."
good,Provide daily staffing for all 13 area hospitals.  Managed projects and programs within the Medical Management Department
good,Typical day is answering incoming calls from providers and insureds regarding insurance benefits and claims processing. I have learned the understanding of claims are processed and explained to provider and insureds. Co-workers are good and a lot of understanding of the job when it comes to asking for help.
good,Honestly this is a good job to have. It pays decent and has decent benefits. The job itself is so frustrating how ever. I've never had a job that has made me want to quit daily.
good,"Empresa grande que atua num mercado muito competitivo, visa crescimento e aprender com outras empresas grandes do setor."
good,"This is a place where you really have to put your thinking cap on to succeed. There is a lot of room for growth, in the various departments. They really push the work from home options, and you get to work with people from various walks of life."
good,"a typical day at work is going over all members records to make sure all is correct. making calls to complete task that are not completed. the hardest part of my job is being the only one in the office doing this work, my help is over the phone. I enjoy the freedom of my time and no one is breathing over my back"
good,"Took calls, fun environment, teamwork. We had team meetings where we learned shortcuts to reduce our average handle time."
good,"UnitedHealth Care is a great place to work for individuals with children who need a flexible schedule.  You must be able to multi-task, be adaptable to change, have a willingness to learn new things and be self motivating.   You will definitely be trained for your position."
good,Very goal oriented and structured company; encourages community participation and volunteering outside of the workplace.
good,"It was a great company to work for i would change a few things about the company such as training , Scheduling and A few system errors , Other than that it was a great learning experience and i loved helping the members ."
good,This was a good place to work until I moved to a different department. The stress and politicking within this company is overbearing and they micro-manage people in unhealthy ways right down to restroom usage.
good,"•	Handling of appeals raised by the individual/group policyholders"
good,They make you work 2 hours of OT each day. I really enjoyed the management while working there.    In closing I would work for them again but I need to change companies to get a higher salary.
good,"It was very good to work at UHG,I liked everything there each and everything was fine but, there were only night shifts and no rotational shifts."
good,I love the organization as a whole and believe that they work hard to encompass their employees needs. It is a great place to advance your career as they offer many different opportunities and with the fast growth of the company as well.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,In the time I had working for UnitedHealth Group I found it a place with high expectations and a supportive team environment.  Being a health insurance company the health benefits package was extensive and included benefits other companies are generally unable to offer due to costs.
good,"Good work place and learning environment"
good,UHC is a company with little advancement for their employees and no compensation for loyal employees. No clear work instructions for employees no on hand training staff.
good,"We take about 30 calls a day during the ""slow season."" They sent us an e-mail 3 months after starting stating that April of next year we'll be switched over to flex schedules where we could possibly be off for 8-16 weeks with no pay during the slow season. I think that it's entirely too much work for the pay. I love the actual work and helping the elderly but I think they would get a lot more results if they paid more."
good,Days go fast processing medical claims & assisting Providers & members with benefits & claims information.Telecommute opportunities are great but the compensation & recognition is very low.
good,"I have learned an incredible amount in this company and have grown exponentially. Every drop of knowledge I gained in this company,I had to obtain on my own. You have to be self driven and self motivated in order to truly find the hidden jewel in the experience of working in management in this company. Had it not been for my past management experience I'm not sure how far I would have gotten with this company. The glass ceiling is there and boy is it obvious, but others are still tricked into thinking that there is plenty of opportunity. My management experience in this company was exceptionally rewarding. I must say though that once you become a threat to someone's job because of your talent and gifts, you will quickly be eliminated. United is a great compay, but I am tired of dodging bullets and trying to make friends in order to keep my job."
good,A usual day at work included taking inbound telephone calls assisting members with insurance and healthcare questions and concerns.
good,"I have been working with a great team from last couple of years and learned some many things which really boost up my technical and professional skills. I should say, this is one of my best place and team where am currently working with."
good,Typical work day 10-11 hours with computer entry work at home after hours. Management was pleasant and expectations clearly conveyed. Interactions with co-workers were to convey status updates on patients as needed. Most difficult part of job was going into strangers homes which sometimes proved dangerous. Most rewarding aspect was actually making a difference in patient's live: sometimes improvement in quality and even rescuing them from abuse.
good,This is a fairly easy job with excellent training. Management is very involved in helping to make sure you have the tools needed for the job.
good,"Inbound call center, answering calls positioning health care plans through a thorough needs assessment, I've learned a lot about health insurance for group retirees and sales points, relaxed environment co-workers have same goal in mind that is to make money, constant phone calls, most enjoyable part of the job making a difference in a retirees life by helping them enroll in a health plan that's most beneficial to them."
good,"okay employer, salary is from below average to average. management needs more training and/or experience."
good,"A typical day is managing you own accounts to alleviate debt, I learned collections the management were very effective and the co-workers worked in a team environment, the hardest part of the job was getting the consumers to pay they debt. The most enjoyable part of the job is that  you had no supervision and you worked alone."
good,I really enjoyed working for UHC. I had job security there. I feel that there were not a lot of opportunities for growth or advancements for me. Understanding that I didn't have the college degree but when I went to college I felt that I still would not go anywhere in the company. Its a very hard company to get into. I have heard that it has changed and they are working with employees to succeed in their careers.
good,Very supportive environment.  Not a lot off room for advancement.
good,"I've learned a great deal at UHG."
good,"Process Corrections on Medical & Hospital Claims that have been previous processed incorrectly."
good,"My day would consist of looking up claims for clients.Sending them for review or checking why they weren't paid. Contacting the insurance co.Verifying patient benefits,computer, office equip."
good,"I worked with UHC for over 7 years and held various job titles. The job is very mentally demanding and the company does its best to try to relieve that with employee engagement activities, however this can be improved upon. The training is extensive and is constantly being improved upon. The relationships made there are lifelong. They offer very competitive pay with full benefits and flexible hours. If you can handle the emotional and mental toll this job can sometimes have, it is a great place to work."
good,"Working at OptumRx can be very rewarding. You are dealing with customers and their pharmaceutical benefits on a regular bases. Management tries to have some employee appreciation type of activities once a month to boost moral. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"While this can be a very high stress job, working with individuals that you can relate to is extremely valuable. I have learned so much about healthcare and continue to learn everyday. This job can be very challenging at times, but knowing that I am able to make a difference in peoples lives by listening and being understanding of each and every situation makes this a very rewarding place to work."
good,processing claims and providing explanation of benefits.
good,"I grew and learned alot from united haelthcare. I learned more of insurance marketing and claims, evolved as a expert in customer service"
good,"Typical day is very busy, work is rated in daily quantity.  Management is very hands on.  Learned the inner working of insurance claims review."
good,"A large multi-national corporation.  Within my group, normally good days with diverse work for supporting the clients as well as development.  Very budget driven with changing demands from upper management not always backed up with changes to financial requirements."
good,If your looking for quick advancement United Healthcare is the place. Working in claims processing can be tedious and boring so advancement in the department is popular. Although there are many advantages of Uited Healthcare they pride themselves on work life balance. And in my opinion it is not true. At one point for about 10 weeks there was a required 12 hours of required over time. Since I have been employed there I have been required to work no less than 8 mandatory hours of overtime a week.
good,"UHC is a well known company and a large one.  Being a large corporation, they want as much productivity out of their workers as possible.  That is as it should be, but in doing that, they have placed the customers second to stats.  Any good CSR will tell you that a ""one-call resolution"" is what customers want, not how fast the rep can get the customer off the phone.  Reps will transfer customers over to other departments just to help their stats.  Customers have told me they have been transferred 8-11 times just trying to see what date they are paid up to.  The IVR system is confusing for reps much less the customer..."
good,"This location is just too far for my daily commute. The work environment and communication in the company is excellent, and the team mates are great!"
good,Assist Customers( Members) with Insurance Benefits.  A typical day at work is to come in and sit take your calls and get ready to be yelled at by Members that certain thing are not covered by Medicare or the Insurance. what I have learned is that you have to have a lots of patience to handle our elderly customers. For the most part Management is ok. some are very Rude and put there employees down instead of assisting in making it better for them to learn and apply what mistake they have made. My co workers are great very understandable and easy to get along they understand the pressure we all go through. The hardest part o the job is making sure you take care of your members to make sure your supervisor is happy with you if not you get put down and its and ok place to work at but very challenging with Members that want to information right away if not you get yelled at and put down by them as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is the paycheck as if it was not for that your day would be not so great just knowing that you get paid to provided for your family.
good,Very less work and no learning at work place but one can enjoy at work.
good,"Review Medical Claims, Hospital and Physician. Explain to Customer service why the claims processed the way they did."
good,"The actual job is not difficult at all, and to some extent is a bit boring - basically conducting a comprehensive H&P (to the extent possible within a person's home).  There is a huge amount of documentation required and limited space for narrative writing.  There is also a great deal of redundancy, and it seems like they would be better served to follow the general physician's H&P format, adding extra information to the sections where needed.  "
good,"Face paced, lots of projects. Good work life balance depending on the area and management."
good,"My day includes,Project management and team building with peers and  staff."
good,"I have been working as a whole for this company for 6hrs...mostly under the banner of Optum Rx. I learned alot about being professional in the office environment from watching those at OptumRx work. My workdays varied as did my positions as I moved up the ladder from simple answering phones and completing orders to working for coporate and handling executive complaints. In Summer 2012 I switched branches due to a promotion working now for UHC handling expedited appeals, a fast paced environment not for the faint hearted as we don't stop til the works done. Though I could continue working here, it is my desire to get a part time job so that I may go back to school and earn a degree in History so I can become a teacher which is my dream."
good,"A typical day at work entails attending several meetings, working 1:1 with various employees to resolve their training needs, as well as facilitating group learning. Additionally, there are several reporting mechanisms to attend to. UHC is very metric-focused. My ""team"" co-workers are located throughout the country, and most interaction is done via WebEx and phone. "
good,Most enjoyable part of my day was my co workers. Management wasn't consistent.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A typical day has me working leads sent by a supervisor. I call people who are interested in more information about Medicare/Medicaid health care options. Once I research viable options, I arrange an appointment and go to meet them face to face. Being an independent agent is like free-lancing, I set my own hours, I go directly to the customer, I get to travel!"
good,"UHC is a Good Company to work for, but push that they are focused on ""Helping People Live Healthier Lives"" but when it comes to their customer service call requirements and handle time allowed and results expected ... care for the customer's aren't as important as how many calls you can take."
good,"I worked at UHG from 2009 to 2012. I liked it OK, but felt the only way to move up was to kiss some rear end. I am not so good at that. I felt handle time was more important to them than customer satisfaction. I was starting to get sick a lot in 2011, and the last straw was right before Thanksgiving, when my brother was diagnosed with lung cancer and not given long to live. I took time off to travel to see him, and they started finding everything they could to get rid of me. All came to a head in March 2012, when the fired me for making ""personal"" phone calls when I had to call home for my medication. Then I applied again just a month ago and had an interview. Got an email today. Didn't get the job. No reason why."
good,Good place to work but hard to move around.  Ive applied to several positions within company that I know I am qualified for and all I receive is rejection letters. They want to keep you still at one place
good,"Two years employement and the companys vision and direction is consistently changing, each quarter."
good,"When you are performing well yopu are treated well, when you are not, you are treated poorly. Flexibility for people with children is almost non-existent"
good,"Good Place to Work and Learn Work. Nice environment .In my observation, the BEST about UnitedHealth Group is well organized Learning and Development department which encourages and makes improvement to employees' professional and personal attributes as well! It truly justifies our mission- Our United Culture"
good,"This company isn't bad, people are great, but there's a lot of politics involved."
good,Its a good place to work. i learnt mainframes and java(html/css classeS) here. good trrainings.
good,"Trabalhei na AMil e Clinihauer 16 anos, foi uma escola, tenho sempre muito para agradecer."
good,The company I was with previously was bought by UnitedHealthcare. It seems UHC has multiple people doing the same job so there is a lot email chain and a lot redundant activity.
good,Sold Medicaid products over the phone. Answered customer inquiries. Learned that I could throw up in the trash can since I was unable to leave the cubical.
good,"Pros-Work life balance is good, Onsite and general team is good, Salary excellent"
good,"Responsibilities included taking prescription and over the counter orders over the phone, marketing discount cards to specific customers, tracking orders, and answering billing questions. The customers I dealt with were AARP members. I would answer between 80 to 100 calls per day. I used several different computer systems to help answer questions customers may have about their orders or bill."
good,Era um Trabalho autonomo com pacientes de alta e baixa complexidade.
good,United Heath group has a lot of opportunity to grow if you like being a number. However they do employ a large number and does great things for their community!
good,inbound call center in the optum health bank side assisting clients with their flexable spending accounts
good,"All in all, UHG is a decent company to work with if you are not too focussed on climbing up the ladder. One can spend the entire career here working in the same capacity."
good,basically go to work sit in a cubical and take calls about members insurance policies. co-workers help make the day go by quicker and the best part of the job is the paycheck.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"One would think an healthcare insurance will offer an excellent healthcare package...think again. The pay is competitive, but the health benefits are antiquated."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Committed to their clients and savings/lowering healthcare costs.
good,High volume of provider calls (inbound) calls to resolve claims also high volume of faxed calls to resolve issues not handled by provider calling.
good,Definitely don't recommend working in a call center here. It was like being part of an assembly line. We were treated much more like numbers than people.
good,Was great to interact with patients on a daily basis to help manage their health status and help them manage current disease states. Thanks for the opportunity to grow my clinical knowledge.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but not the job itself. I learned how to manage many tasks at once. My manager was amazing, but the culture was very strict."
good,"As an employee of a UHG, I have learned so much related to the subject and other things related to the management side."
good,"My experience  at the company was overall a good one. The team work was great overall supervisor where helpful. One of few negatives of company was that I didnt provide or reimbursed separate work phone to its employee, forcing the you to either use your personal phone for business or purchasing additional work phone."
good,I worked from home which was a nice benefit and schedule was nice too. I was processing claims that were originally paid/denied incorrectly and following the rules and regulations
good,Management let me go because a customer lied about me in a survey saying that I swore at them. Which never happened. However the job itself isn’t bad at all and I was really starting to like it.
good,"If you can handle taking calls all day, it's a good job but it can get old after a while. It's not easy for most people to sit down all day, not to mention you're inevitably going to get yelled at during some point because it's customer service but it's secure. You just need to keep up with insurance lingo and rules which can be challenging."
good,"Learning something new everyday , talking t different types of people , possibly saving a life each day . sending out thank you cards to members to make them feel happy ."
good,"UHG is a big company with a lot of opportunity. They are committed to excellence but be a bit of a sweat shop. Middle management is good but is tough to critique upper management. I was ""laid off"" after 21 years of service. I had seen  several people lose there job because of similar situation over the years ... let along a mass layoff during a recent ""Agile"" restructuring. I guess what I am trying to say is that they are a big company and one can get lost in the shuffle ... which happens alot."
good,"Great management but due to constrictions re state funds for quest members and the case load being too high (40-60 per nurse service coordinator)to give adequate attention, because there are too many hoops to jump through to justify the services.  and the company  pays RNS and SWs hourly and basically refused to pay overtime. "
good,"Constant turn over in employees, management positions are filled with employees that are not knowledgeable enough to be in management positions."
good,"Overall good place to work if your not a contract employee. I’m addition, they had a great customer service week for their CSR as it showed how they cared for their employees."
good,"I've worked for Optum under UnitedHealth Group for less than a year. They are big on coar values besides when it comes to making mistakes, getting sick and/or anything besides consistent work on your behalf. They're great managers and some you question how they made it. Overall if you go to work to work you'll be happy. You can't socialize, work is redundant."
good,This is a good company... Hard to advance but you can always count on your paycheck ever 2 weeks. The benefit package is horrible even though  they are a health insurance company
good,"If you like working alone and staring at a computer this job is for you. Good benefits, good pay and my supervisor was very nice and easy to talk to, but I was so bored by this job. Also we ran out of claims ona daily basis, so there was alot of sitting and doing nothing unless you wanted to waste pto. The pto was very generous 144 as soon as training ended. There is an amount of claims you have to do per day, but once you are fully trained it is fairly easy to get. There was also quarterly bonuses for no mistakes on your claims. They also stopped the work at home option in my department, but I believe in others it was still available after a year. Not a bad place to work, but way too boring for me."
good,"Working with united is very dependent on which department you get hired onto. Make no mistake, you are working in a for profit health insurance company. My department's bread and butter became short term insurance, which is notorious for being less than stellar (put nicely) health insurance. You're compensated well enough for an entry level position, the hours are consistent and the benefits are plentiful."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It was mostly ok.  Helping the patients with insurance issues and prior authorization questions was stressful because, as a nurse, many times we didn't have the answers but we had to muddle through and then try and help with the nursing part that many people didn't call for."
good,"United HealthGroup was a faced paced environment, always with a new problem in your hands to solve. The hours were long, and the management was strict with their policies."
good,"Everyday was productive and challenging.  With the ever changing climate of health-care, we was forever learning something new.  Even though we worked from home the team members were there for support via the Instant message app. The hardest part of the job was not having face to face contact with co-workers in an office environment."
good,I didn’t stay long because I was still in high school. My hours was flexible...for the age I was it was and okay pay...the manager was really nice from what I remember
good,"Learned a lot about Medicaid and how it works who is eligible ."
good,"Telephonic tasks were stressful...had to complete certain amount of calls daily.  I think it was unnecesarily stressful!  There not much more to say about this company.  The atmosphere was employee friendly, but extrememely stressful!"
good,"Taking on too much with not enough staff. Nice cafe in the basement. Also, very small, but free gym in the basement. People always eating at their desks so it constantly smelled like food while  you are trying to work."
good,"It was a good company, the staff was great and I had to face a lot of difficulties at work some days but the team  was amazing to be part of. Its an insurance company"
good,UHG is a great place to work with lots of advancement opportunity.  The hardest thing about my department is keeping up with the amount of workflow due to staff to workload ratio.
good,Management that's not onsite is a problem. I don't understand how an employee can be managed by a manager that's never visible. A manager who's never met the person they manage.
good,Its a good job for people who like to sit at a desk all day. Management is very friendly and understanding. Could have better training and pay. Tough to meet monthly targets.
good,"Very fast pace ....didn't have time to talk to the customers, not enough training to do the job right. Managers tried to make it fun to work there.They had a lot of lunches for free."
good,Fast paced positive work environment with good management. However it is a dead end job if you do not have a degree. You  are capitated at certain pay grade & will not get anywhere or move up in your department only move to lateral positions in different departments.
good,This place was good until you are not in the in crowd not a lot of fairness with employess they pick and choose what they want to do with certain people
good,"The only issue is micromanagement! If you have a big case to work on they only give you so long to work on it. If it's more than 30 minutes someone is in your face wondering what's the problem, not how they can help."
good,No help staff is available in house and management is not knowledgable and processes as it relates to job performance and employee issues related to workers compensation and rights and responsibilities of UHC to its employees.
good,UHG is a place that will not only show care for their customers well being but will also look for many ways be cost efficient while doing so. UHG is a place that is very business oriented and take pride in there work.
good,"Call center work, steady call flow daily. Co-workers were nice and events within your team were always something to look forward to. Potlucks.....were always the best."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"People are promoted based on who they know, who they kiss up to, not based on work performance. Your schedule is selected by people who have never met you, not by your manager. You are lead to believe you get a say, but you don't. It changes every 6 months and god forbid you miss a ""break"" time because you're on the phone doing your job."
good,Start with the cash management. Checking in patients for pre-screening and exam. Assist patient with selecting eyewear and lenses. Inventory management. Scheduling patients by collecting demographics and Insurance verification. Opening and closing of the office. I love the company because pay and benefits were balanced. The toughest part of the job was finding out the company funds were not reported correctly.
good,The hardest part of the job was when the quality for service and sales metrics changed and when it was starting to get harder to get 96% quality score for the month.
good,"Professionally experienced customer service representative who consistently meets and exceeds"
good,"Only have been working at OptumRx for 7 months. You to often here the opportunities for career advancement however after observation, I have determined that advancement is certainly possible, however at least here in Jacksonville it appears that the advancement spoken of only gets you so far in the company. Poor Benefits considering you are working for an Insurance company. Poor merit increases considering the substantial increase in profit margin and revenue"
good,This job I have is a very busy work that keep you so busy toward to the end of the day. We are teamwork to help each other out when in need if someone is gone for the day or the workload need to be done we get it done.
good,this company does allow you to advance in other careers. Good place to work for.  Has descent benefits. A lot of people that I started with have advanced to bigger and better careers with uhc.
good,"Slow paced, everyone blames everyone else for problems, Poor management. They feed you  company culture that is obviously not lived by all employees, most enjoyable part of the job, leaving after my shift"
good,"Good benefits, relaxed work environment. Great people to work with. Flexible schedule with telecommuting options for select positions. Centrally located."
good,"Interesting place to work. I don't have time to document my 8 years of employment, but I will say that there are a lot of great people there."
good,great company to work for you just have to put in the work. Have to be able too adapt to working in a fast pace environment. Must have the ability to multitask.
good,I really enjoyed it. it was a lot of fun. i still work there. oh so great all the time. people would have no problem working there. pretty normal call center
good,"Work was good, staff was good. Lots of politics that ruled care. Focus more on targets than on staff and members they supported. Most enjoyable was direct reports and their dedication to their team and the members."
good,"Optum pays their coders well and ""offers"" (mandatory) overtime. There are no paid holidays or other benefits and at the end of your time there when the MCR deadline is met, your job is over for approximately 2 1/2 months. Yes, you can collect unemployment compensation, but it is really a small percentage of your wages."
good,UHC/briovaRX is a fast paced and exciting work environment. UHCis a home infusion center that address all home care medications for UCH members. We serve most of Central Florida.
good,"Job involved working with multiple software programs concurrently, taking incoming calls from large employer accounts, assisting both providers and subscribers with their insurance benefits and claims.  I learned about insurance benefits, how claims are processed, medical coding, level of care guidelines, medical necessity guidelines, etc....Management varied from awesome to horrible, hardest part was meeting all the metrics and demands of the company while still providing good customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.  Typical day at work would be logging on and on the phone at your start time, taking call after call, getting two 15 min breaks and one 30 minute lunch.  Workplace culture is casual but professional.  The hardest part was not having enough training and much of the training is on-the-job training."
good,"Flexible company, work from home is available. "
good,Excellent PTO and benefit hours. Not for those who do not like change. Fast paced. Information needed to perform job task effectively can be difficult to find
good,A typical day at work would consist of different tasks dealing with medical correspondence. I have learned about a lot of medical related information I didn't know about before. Management wasn't very helpful when asking questions. The hardest part of the job was having to process and remember how to do all the different tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that the team I was working with all cared about their job.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,A lot of work load. Management was ok. Only there a year worked  hard and it was good most days. I was not there long because I got a new job out of state.
good,"I think that my experience of this one department in the company is NOT indicative of the company as a whole. As a matter of fact, I would say it was almost the exact opposite. The department I was in was very high stress, political and at times inappropriately so. Shortly after my leaving, that management team was dismissed, so I would imagine the issue was discovered and remedied."
good,"I paid or denied claim according to the guidelines of their insurance. Answered question to the beneficiary on why the claim was denied. I worked on problem claims, talked to doctors about the claim."
good,Clear vision is not established. Good benefits. Major changes transitioning from MedSynergies to Optum 360. The direction of business focus is not understood by all levels.
good,"My time with UnitedHealthcare was productive, fun with great acheivements. Meeting and assisting agents with whatever assistance they needed me from to make their jobs easier was the fun part of my job."
good,"this position is fast paced and stressful. Management styles vary from person to person, no set formula for management. The culture is a very cliquish atmosphere."
good,Typical day involves coming in and logging into phone and getting all systems up to be ready to take calls for the day. very good team comradre. Everyone is truly there to help one another.
good,The work environment is great. A very excepting and diverse place of work to say the least.  Work schedules when you are new are not ideal and you are just a number to management. Unique life situations are not taken into consideration until you have tenure with the company.
good,"As a Solution Architect, I worked with the Chief Security Architect, delivery teams and Business Development teams to develop solutions and support complex business development initiatives."
good,Enjoyed working with my member's in the long term care program.  It was nice not to have a supervisor micromanaging my every move.  This job showed me that I am dedicated and able to work independently.
good,When I worked at United Healthcare I felt that My job was secure and my managers and supervisors did an excellent job of promoting and helping others achieve their goals.
good,"While it was a very fun place to work where i learned a lot about the industry, there seemed to be inconsistencies between levels of management and underlying bad relations"
good,"Good Company to work with.Job Security is assured and good management.Great work culture,Employee engagement events are preferable.flexible work Hours."
good,"Offered telemarketing/work-from-home, plus and minus.  Eventually did not know co-workers, without peer support or socialization. Certainly a plus in avoiding traffic & loss of travel time."
good,Great company worldwide opportunity to grow. Very high-volume fast paced job. Able to set goals and hit those goals understanding your job title
good,Fun eventful work days. They gave free food for lunch of your from any stand in the stadium. great team work. i learned a lot i didn't know about basebal.l
good,"When you work for a company you should be able to lookup to your manager for guidance. If your manager is a person who wants you to shake your head for everything He/She says then then it is not a place to work."
good,"The organization is extraordinary with regards to work/life adjust. With my experience I would say they are the best. They are extremely required in the group whether it is the organizations possess individuals or volunteering in and around the group and I am exceptionally pleased to have been a part of that. The remuneration is awesome, you need to go in knowing your value and doing research, as some other organization however."
good,"Learned how to process claims, submit appeals and resolve grievances; challenging part was not knowing what would happen today; great coworkers and management"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,United health group is a world in itself & one should ask what it doesn't have to offer to a professional you yearn to excel in the field of IT.
good,They are a strong company and would go back to work for them.  They had a positive work force and didn't mind giving you the extra time needed to focus on an assignment.
good,"Nice,easy going culture , No real work pressure"
good,"Overall, The training opportunities given at excellent. They really give the employees the tools required to succeed."
good,"Amil fiquei por pouco tempo, mas este tempo pude observar uma boa empresa para trabalhar e com bons beneficios."
good,"They are committed to introducing innovative approaches, products and services that can improve personal health and promote healthier populations in local communities. Their core capabilities in clinical care resources, information and technology uniquely enable them to meet the evolving needs of a changing health care environment as millions more Americans enter a structured system of health benefits and we help build a stronger, higher quality health system that is sustainable for the long term."
good,"It was a good company to work with, the nature of the job was stressful but was doable. They were able to set attainable goals for the company though the salary was not that sufficient as opposed to the job, it was still a good experience to work with them."
good,"At Unitedhealthgroup, I learned leadership and the value of being a team player. Very good training and managerial support. I would work there again if given the opportunity."
good,its an ok job just for in between times. the coworkers are fun. the supervisors are also fun. the pay is ok and there is a lot of room for advancemnt
good,"I enjoyed working at UHC. It was a bit rough, but it was processing medical claims and they can be difficult at times... Over all, I enjoyed working there and if I could I'd probably still be working there."
good,I really loved this job when I love the challenge to meet production and that I am in my own doing my work with out anyone over my head pressuring me. I hated that they lay me off twice I wish they would have kept me but in another department.
good,"Being a leading cashier I really enjoyed working with customers.  I had so much fun meeting new people, remembering their names, and what they like to eat, and also serving them with respect and excellent customer service as well as hospitality.  I'm a people person and I enjoy making people smile, and laugh.  I give everyone compliments, and they love me.  I remember to ask them about their family, friends, pets, and love ones.  They are treated special.  That's the way I would like to be treated, so that's how I treat others.  I was born in a christian home with christian values.  I love a challenge.  If someone looks mean, I end up making them smile or laugh.  That's the type of person I am.  I'm real, honest, trustworthy, and I will get the job done with a smile."
good,Very long hours when forced to do mandatory overtime. Management is great and definitely takes time to work with you. New employees go through 7 weeks of training but still doesn't feel like you are fully trained when you go on the floor.
good,"festival dramas cultural programs..and "
good,worked 40 hours a week for an ob/gyn office. took intake and got to meet and connect with a lot of people. I have learned a lot about women's health. there is a lot of documentation and calls to be made. working under the supervision a physician. working with a great group of people who each have their own specialty in the off. The hardest part of my job is to call a patient with bad news. The most enjoyable part of my job is to make the call of great news.
good,Still going through training learning how to give great customer service.Learned different applications to navigate and search for members information which is at times difficult the most enjoyable part of my job is that i will get to interact with members on the phone which is what i miss the patient interaction.
good,This employer is really bad to work for. They tell you they can work around your schedule if you are enrolled in college courses. When that time came around they could not do it.
good,"Its a very contradicting and annoying job after a while but the atmosphere of the place is great. They are still building ground rules and switch up things a lot, and no one is on one accord as far as management and QA. They treat their permanent employees well but the temps don't get as much respect. They try to keep you interested with incentives and its not all bad. I felt like a child having to do ""well"" to earn a dress down day though. Overall I wouldn't do it again but it was a great learning experience"
good,"Typical day at work. Start of with reviewing e-mails to address any client issues or concerns, attending meetings, and working on continous projects. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"professional enviornent, the work place was a quiet cal center where you where able to get your job done. co workers were always there to help you when you needed and the management was pretty helpful. what i lied most about my job was how i got ot learn more about data entry and helping others"
good,"This was the first process with which I started my career in Genpact."
good,"Processing Cobra insurance,checks,waivers,terminations,reinstatements  and processing of the Cobra action forms in a time sensitive data entry process."
good,"Leading healthcare insurance company that did not provide excellent healthcare insurance themselves.  Ability to make ""okay"" money as a licensed agent, but have made better money elsewhere!"
good,"My first hour in the office, I usually checked my high priority tasks. I attended our regular meeting at 10 am. Our development team was very balanced and we all really enjoyed working together. We had very strong management that help us to finish every project before deadline. Sometimes we needed to work extra hour to finish our tasks and faced some difficult problems and we worked together to solve the problem. I always got help from my co-worker."
good,"It is good company to work with, it provides better job security, provide growth opportunities."
good,"I love what I was doing in helping customers understand their health investment and how to maximize that investment. My main co-workers are all awesome people, and I can honestly say there was no major drama concerns. However, the system is set up alot like other call centers: capitations of days off (including if it's an emergency situation - no discretion), change in schedule for HA's every 3 months, and you have to take your days off at the beginning of the year for the whole year. Also, I found that there were a lot of loopholes to getting occurrences: if workforce forgets to schedule you mandatory overtime and you don't say anything, if you are a closer and your schedule says off the phone at 8 and you don't stay on until 8:05 it's grounds for termination for stealing.... all of which no one ever explains to you. And that's the main source of wanting to leave the company. Any time you have a question you'd usually start with your peers, and then go to your supervisor. Every time I had to ask someone above my peers, it was ""oh go look over here; or check with so and so"" ; and even checking with whoever ""so and so"" was, I never could get direct answers. This included if I had an error and asked how I could go about fixing it, my supervisor always said he'd send me a link to the call and I could review it and ask him questions then. And then he never sent it. Also, if you want to go higher up in the company it's all about who's favoritism you fall into. I work right next to an amazing person who wants to be in sales. She's been awarded quite often on innovation and development"
good,"-A Typical day in the life of a Wellness Coach includes starting my day focusing on how to approach member concerns for improving their lives by setting wellness specific goals for improving life concerns and circumstances that may hault progression and a life and mindset of progressive wellness. "
good,It has the potential to be one of the best places to work depending on the department you work in. It is very stable and the compensation is ok.
good,"Onde consegui aprender a me desenvolver e acreditar em meu potencial, a Gerência me meu uma oportunidade de crescer onde passei de um digitadora para Assistente, porém a parte mais dificil era as condições que me encontrava, mas gostei muito de trabalhar pessoal muito agradável."
good,"Wonderful company to work for.  Benefits start immediately upon hire.  Work at home opportunities.  Very understanding management.    "
good,"First time in this environment with challenges to learn a new industry."
good,Just dont expect more money or promotions in any quick fashion. Healthcare is getting rocky and company is really trimming costs for budgets
good,"working with the UHG team who are 1,200 miles away in MN causes issues.They are invested and working towards improvement though."
good,"very busy and interesting. lots of work loved working for this company. How to do appeals, how to work with provider advacate.. "
good,"UnitedHealthcare is a cutting edge company with excellent employee benefits.  I manage the disease management (health) management department.  I also managed the "
good,"Fast paced, matrix organization, I enjoy working with a very experienced knowledgeable group of individuals.  The most difficult part of the job is the fact the it is a very matrix organization and often times causes delays in decision making."
good,"Good place to work, large amount of exposure to enterprise wide project and program management.  "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I learned a lot within my period of united health group employment.
good,Its a great learning to work in UHG.Management and co-workers are helpful.Hardest part is one and only night shifts.
good,Excellent company but hard to survive if you're independent
good,"Great training programs. Very segmented company due to growing too fast. The company is hiring a lot, but job security is an issue due to certain location responsibilities being moved to other parts of the country/world in order to consolidate resources"
good,At the liberty of the product sold from one year to the next. UHC has reduced the number of products and counties it is offered in making it very difficult to hit company numbers. Advertisement in our market has also been cut. If you are hitting your goal plan for a goal increase.
good,Call center atmosphere
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to sell Medicare Part D to the elderly. I felt like I was convincing the elderly into buying a prescription drug plan that they really wasn't sure they didn't know they wanted or not. I didn't feel right doing it and I wouldn't want someone selling to my grandmother like that.
good,Love the company (Optum) but no upward mobility or support from my direct.  This could vary for you depending on the area you land however they are in a transitional moment (as is all of healthcare) and the next 2 years will define them.
good,"As in any office, there are politics, but they seem to play out here in a very bad way. "
good,There are many lobbies in the organization and it is very difficult to collaborate among them. Management is also not open to new ideas and is only interested in making money by doing the routine task
good,"Responsible for managing daily operational activities associated with credentialing or re-credentialing of providers.

Other responsibilities include the development of standard operation procedures, process workflows and department policies and procedures. Responsible for supervising 15 employees 4 remote providing candid and constructive feedback; developing employees to their full potential."
good,"WorkLife balance is good"
good,"Hard to advance, very good work life balance, can work from home for most positions, competitive salary and benefits okay but high health insurance cost"
good,"United healthcare has a very fast paced and competitive environment. It is a sales floor, but the managers are very nice and do what they can to help you succeed."
good,"employee work well together, meetings, coaching, training in different positions, learned new task each week, customer service, good environment, atmosphere is excellent"
good,Great people to work with who all share a mission in improving healthcare and thinking analytically. Lots of opportunities to learn more and network. You can basically do anything in UHG.
good,challenging working with some many different manage style supervisors and managers along with co workers with different professional backgrounds and personality
good,"The worst insurance coverage..  Very expensive.  They are only united to get rich off of consumers' backs. How is this making the health care system work better for everyone?!?!?!?!"
good,Competitive atmosphere to complete tasks on time. Involved meetings  arrangements to make sure all agents were up to date. Management team lacked compassion and better communication.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Being a customer service rep, you must have tough skin to deal with a lot of things going on, and adapt to several changes without proper training. The benefits are great but the insurance should be better for employees. The deductibles are extremely too high unless you take a Kelsy Seybold plan- which only allows you to see specific providers(which is not good for me due to medical conditions), but the vision and dental are very beneficial. In regards to advancement there is room for growth but it takes a while and is quite a process. I have applied for over 30 jobs within the company and have not been considered for any position... its who you know. Being a customer service advocate has its rewards but it is a very stressful job and we are always told to adjust to the drastic changes without proper guidance or training and its hard to deal especially when you have an irate member on your line on a state that you were never trained nor prepared for. Currently, there was a misprint stating UHC will be open 7 days a week; instead of retracting this statement employees such as myself are being drafted into working weekends. So instead of me or my peers working Mon-Fri as hired, we are basically getting a regular scheduled work day off and forced to work the weekend on a shift that is not close to the shift we work."
good,When I was there I actually enjoyed my job at the time. There was always room for advancement.  The down side was it was not much security at the work place.
good,"Company is very customer driven.  If interviewing it would be beneficial to place customer service at the forefront.  I was a telecommuters, so I did not have the ability to witness the office environment first hand."
good,Optum has good work life balance with OK Benefits. Not enough opportunities to advance within. Seems to hire management from outside the company. Not enough culture and group events.
good,"I would say the money is ok not good enough for the eres and being that optum is such a big company. I really think the problem is that most people have been working for quest for over 30 years and they are not willing to change. An upgrade is needed to the system, the working procedures and the attitude of those who dont  want to try better ways to get money in the company.  it feels like all you need to do all day is hit those keys and nothing else, it gets boring as you keep looking at the same accounts and nothing is resolved."
good,"Love the work-life/ home-life balance this job gave me."
good,The culture at UHG is amazing. UGH really values a work/home balance and always supports employees putting their family first. I have worked for UnitedHealth Group for over 5 years and appreciate the leadership displayed within my job environment.
good,"okay place to work. They do a lot for their employees especially during natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, etc. large corporation. opportunity to work from home, I did for about 3 years and loved it. Sometimes wish I could go back just for that purpose."
good,"This was one of the best places to work. I loved my team, the supervisors and managers were very friendly, and easy to get along with. The pay was ok I guess, but the working environment was very good, made up for it."
good,"This job is great for those that are relocating and need somewhere to start. Training is great and ongoing. Very big on attendance! Keeping to yourself is the best policy that I can give and always be upfront with your supervisor. easiest money you can make. if you suffer from depression, anxiety etc this is not the job for you!"
good,"Training is like twelve weeks long, and I’m currently still in training. I have a college education and just under a year of prior call center experience but I get paid 70 some odd cents less than other trainees with no degree, although they have over a year of call center experience. There is a lot of self paced learning modules that can be confusing to navigate because they try to make it a fun game which only results in missing the information you’re supposed to gain. There are so many systems you must navigate to find simple information to give callers, yet the trainer will tell you, “but you won’t use this system very often”.  Not sure at this point what I will actually use or if it will be as complicated as it seems thus far. Apparently there is a slow season, spring through late summer, where they will offer voluntary leave for the day, and if necessary, they will start sending people home. Upon interviewing, you will be asked whether you want to sign up to be dropped to 35hrs, no less, during the slow period, or be laid off for 8-16 weeks with no pay or opportunity to pick up overtime. Supposedly this can’t be changed after signing the paper, before you even know if you got the job. Once out of training and on the floor, you will be expected to write a hand written letter A DAY to a member you spoke with. You will also make outbound calls and do the most for the members. I don’t think the pay is enough for everything they want you to learn and do in production. We have job shadowing opportunities which has only made the job seem more confusing and the upper tier support"
good,"I enjoyed working at United Health Care except for a supervisor that didn't like my sales ability.  My last month at United Health Care I reached 150% to my goal. I loved the co workers from all the different departments and my own.  I learned it's not about being good enough, but being liked by your supervisor.  My overall experience was mediocre due to lack of understanding with management."
good,"UnitedHealthcare allows you to work at home which is extremely beneficial, but the health insurance should be much better considering that they are a National Health insurance company. The deductibles on their plans average around $1,200 and then after the deductible is met there is still a co-insurance payment. UHC pays 80% and the employee pays 20%. The deductibles have caused my family to go quickly into debt."
good,I was not given good training.  Took to long to get ID badges.  Flexible with time off and making time up.  It would have been nice for some type of formal training.
good,Good company work and life has very good balance you can have opportunities to work on different technologies good at more experience number is cultural events agree organized here where you can enjoy.
good,Corporate was not solid with making changes. Too many changes and expectations from all employees. Excellent work production was highly sceptical which took time away from production.
good,"great place to work like the hours and the shifts are not bad,  pay is okay, management is ok there is always room for growth. it is overall a good company to work for."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"... great place to work to move up great benefits and awesome pay,some employees are not really team players and a lot of drama their all in all an ok Place"
good,I like this company however I believe it needs to focus not only on the customers but its workers and currently it does not do that. I feel as though a health insurance company should offer their workers a heck of alot better health benefits then they do now.
good,"8 to 10 hr shift in a cubicle, working on individual management teams of 15-20 people at times. I learned different computer data entry programs dealing with healthcare programs. Work place environment was very diverse, young an old age ranges, many different backgrounds, which I really enjoyed. Hardest part of job in my opinion is there is not enough training for all of the different requirements of job."
good,It's a huge company with lots of career options. Training programs were well designed. Managers are very supportive of individual success. Challenging.
good,"I had a phone interview , but I reject the job because they pay the lowest salary in the healthcare market. What they offered me is what I was making 10 years ago, great company great benefits but low salary.  They should pay more for the type of jobs They offer specially for a worldwide company."
good,"Very flexible, but a lot of overtime and move around. Benefits were great and company treated employees well. I was able to learn a lot of different areas of health insurance,"
good,"UHC has excellent core values and structure. The company is all about advancement within the company. I enjoy the fact that it is part of our job requirement to ""make a connection"" with each member."
good,"Very good company to maintain work life balance.Not too much oppurtunity to grow,but it can be subjectiive from my point of view ,maybe some other projects have growth oppurtunity."
good,It's a very easy going place to work at. Everyone is a team player and you are always given opportunities to move up the ladder.
good,"A typical day at work is a high call volume of medicare retirees who calling for health benefits, plan explanation, billing clarification or claim adjustments. What I learned at United Healthcare is communication is key in all that you do. Communicating with management allowed me to excel as an Advocate and grow as a person. The workplace culture is very casual at United Healthcare. The hardest part of the job are the broad amount of skills you are required to take responsibility, but in the long-run, it is what gives you job security. The most enjoyable part of the job the employee involvement; United Healthcare strives for their employees to model what we preach. There for continuously engage employees in various  healthy activities throughout the year that will help them reach their goals."
good,"•	Taking in bound calls from various members and providers.  Accessing many databases/Intranets to answer questions accurately and in a timely manner regarding insurance polices claims and procedures. While carrying exceptional stats such as, call times and quality scores."
good,"Good company to work for if you are not motivated by moving up the company ladder. Only 80% of employees are eligible for annual bonus each year. Leader chooses who  receives, and it is not based on  any structured formula."
good,"Wonderful training department, plenty of jobs! A struggle to find truly interesting advancement opportunities. My specific department has little support and a 'rough' atmosphere."
good,They pay very well but the job is hard work. If you are used to a call center environment then this will be a great job for you but if not I would suggest to look elsewhere.
good,"Stable career with room for growth. Call center environment can be quite hectic, but the compensation made up for the stressful days. This is a great place for those looking for a career path in the insurance industry."
good,"Productive and challenging work environment "
good,"Its a place with good work life balance and focus on overall growth of employee."
good,"Many reasons.  They got rid of me because I took time off to be cured of cancer. I did several things, the front desk, the mail room, data entry, ordering supplies, delivering supplies, setting up work stations for new employees"
good,"High paced, busy office, most of the day was spent on telephones with high call volumes.  Mandatory overtime during open enrollment."
good,"My typical day at work, is taking calls from active and non-active members. I assisted them with there benefits questions, claims issues, and demographics"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Empresa ótima, mais sem suporte da gerencia. Atrai muitos conhecimentos"
good,"Co-workers were always willing to help.  Team work and cooperation was great.  Management were very supportive.  I was able to move and grow with the company.  Hands on training were available.  They focused on solving problems, working together and did not play the blame game."
good,"A typical day revolves around an office setting. I am dealing with authorizations, emails, contacting providers, explaining benefits to our member services department, and facilitating medical claim audits."
good,"This is a very different type of nursing.  There is no hands on nursing and although you triage or educate members, all calls are recorded and reviewed so that business goals and metrics  are achieved.  The co-workers and supervisors are friendly, helpful and professional.  The starting salary is excellent and medical benefits are just so so.  Working from home also has its pros and cons."
good,"Working for UHC was a rewarding experience, but did not live up to the ideals and values the company sold me on during my interview. The ideals are strong, and the team I worked with directly and immediate superviosors were all great! However ""upper management"" was in a time of transition and as such there was a lack of accountability, often no one would claim responsibility for things that directly impacted me which was out of the control of my immediate supervisors. That was the hardest thing to deal with. There was also the issue of ""omega tracking"" which essentially means every second of your time must be accounted for through a time tracking system. For every project you work on there's an allotted amount of time you should stay under (not always realistic time goals) and it's absurdly micromanaged."
good,"My position has been eliminated two times in one year, last year in March and this year in August.  Leads are very hard to obtain from the nursing facilities due to Medicare rules."
good,Great company to work for you get to set your own work hours and a great company to move up in
good,"I had wonderful Supervisors Multiple job titles Provider Customer Service Rep, Data Entry, Claims Specialist"
good,"Bom local de trabalho, aprendidi a lidar com publico."
good,What i learned here in UHG is- - -
good,"My manager was great , but Things could have been more oraganized with how they communicate new policies to employees."
good,"It is a good company to work for.The benefits could be better. If given a chance, I would work for the company again. The company is flexible with working from home."
good,Great pay and benefits but the culture was lacking and it didn't feel person centered. Lots of focus on profit and less on customers and employees. Too corporate for my taste.
good,"UHC was an excellent place to work but left a lot to be desired in the area of advancement opportunities. In the end I was laid off due to a decision of the company to leave the area I was servicing and could not land an opportunity within the company in order to stay employed. With such a huge company and the many many jobs that were available, they made no effort to keep one of their own."
good,We went through a reconstruction in our department and specifically asked our management did we have to worry about our jobs and they told us NO!  2 months later we’ve all been laid off.
good,"I was amazed to see others feel like me. I was passed up for a promotion by someone under me because he brown nosed. I don't have time,I work too hard. This is all so unfair.On the plus side I love my job as a claims subject matter expert. Raises are called Merit increases but actually just a cost of living increase."
good,I can only testify to working a temporary position more than once at United HealthCare Group 2011 and 2014. The job lasted from August of those years to December of each year. If you were not going to continue to be a Sales Person; there were no available positions beyond said Sales.
good,"UHG/Optum stresses its corporate culture.  That culture  statement is very good and is taken seriously by senior leadership. On the downside, they offer only minimum health benefits to employees"
good,"Prefer not to leave a comment, not much one can say, if you are a problem solver and enjoy the environment, and live chats great just be open to learning new regulations which the experience only is enough."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Have to be ok with sitting at a desk for long days. Overtime is required at the busy season. Great company to work for. They always were doing fun things for the office."
good,If you are being hired as a  contract worker. Do not  count on getting hired. You won't even be considered unless it's at least your second time being contracted.
good,Great place to work.  Had a pleasant work experience as a Senior Systems Analyst for the Business Intelligence department.  Was given the opportunity to grow and develop in my role and was able to take on more responsibilities.  Excellent work balance environment.
good,"Typical day for me was to look at my daily report as to how many cases I would need to review that day.  Then I would review them and communicate with the Client Service Analyst of findings and errors to fix.  We have weekly meeting on how we can improve our process of reviewing plans before it can be released to the customers.  Workplace environment was peaceful and our equipment's are all up to date.  I enjoyed working with the India Team who also reviews some of the plans for quality.  The only downfall I have encountered is when after training the India Team, my position was eliminated."
good,"Enjoyed my time there. Bonus and raise every year, overtime, and great benefits. However, it’s hard to advance within the company because people stay with the company for a long time."
good,A typical day was long and worked about 10 hours per day. Management is bad  there when corporate decides to place you into another area with you not being able to have a say.  The company is great as a whole but some managers are poorly educated and narrow minded when it comes to how things should be learned.
good,"I answered the phone calls, from the providers calling in, to check on claims' statuses, cpt codes, intake cases, etc. I quoted medical insurance, and also got to work a job, where i can further advance, my career."
good,Overall it is a very family friendly environment.  Jeans dress code.  The ability to work from home if needed.  Managers are very understanding of the needs of their staff.
good,Good training. Work hours are regular office hours. Set up unrealistic work expectations but for those who like to chase new goals great place to work
good,The company stresses culture and it manifests itself in the day to day work. Work life balance is a big focus and allows for an extremely flexible work environment. One negative is the inability of leadership to effectively communicate and drive towards a common goal.
good,"It a job, i worked in a fantastic area that i loved and wouldnt have ever left but we got word that our job was being outsourced and they placed us in jobs that they thought we would like. well i ended up hating my job and it caused so much stress. we got word that the job we were currently in was going back to working in the US and they told us we would have to re apply for that position we had before being outsourced. i was furious!! The management is terrible unless you get someone that is good and thats a dime a piece. Pay is really great and benefits are terrible"
good,"My experience has been rewarding, fulfilling, captivating. It has allow me to go beyond my call of duty to reach member's expectations. Compassion, relationship, integrity and innovation has been motivating to me."
good,"A empresa tem missão e valores muito fortes e passa isso para os funcionários. Trabalho na Optum Solution, empresa do grupo."
good,i have learned plenty with uhc. I feel more experienced and now i am ready to move on to my next journey. I enjoyed my co-workers the most and that's who i will miss more.
good,"Very good company to start career."
good,"Co-workers are very helpful and demonstrates compassion on all levels on a typical work day."
good,"Every moment of your work day is timed, you are under constant pressure for everything you do which only adds to the stress of the job (ESPECIALLY if you take phone calls). The pay is excellent if you have the backbone to take back to back calls of people yelling at you for issues they are having. I felt as if I was only a number to this company, and work and life balance became a little difficult. The benefits and amount of vacations days that they give you are great. At times you do have to fight for the day off you need."
good,"Answered incoming calls about medical benefits."
good,a typical day at work would reflect a monitor and a headset in use that represents productivity. Company offers new learning even though there is scarcity of available time to take them. The management is working in becoming the company framework that is yet to mature. Colleagues are friendly and warm that provides comfort at work. I would say that the hardest part of my job is pacifying upset customers with unresolved issues. Fun at work includes food and party as well as additional incentives on performance.
good,"a very productive place with high volume calls daily. must be able to "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A empresa Amil possui uma cultura boa, porém onde há pessoas também existe divergências."
good,Medical Case Management for the Military community under contract with TRICARE. Personally fulfilling working with Military Men and Women and their families as well as contacts at Military Treatment Centers.
good,Empresa lhe dá suporte para que você adquira maturidade profissional.
good,I enjoy working at United  Health Care for getting a chance to gain a professional experience. Learn more in working in a career oriented setting. Enhance my knowledge as a young professional with big dreams and ideas that I can bring to the table.
good,A typical day at Uinited is sitting at a desk for eight hors a day producing referrals.
good,"My typical day at work involves sitting at a computer reviewing bills(claims) sent in by doctors and hospitals. Looking over information, confirming all info is submitted correctly and clearing up any edits the system needs for the claim to be resolved. All of this needs to be done and remembering that there is a daily goal that needs to be met. There is not contact with customers."
good,Health insurance sales over the phone. Incoming calls. Call Center. Offered Medicare Advantage plans. Very short term.  Enjoyed working with United Health Care trainers.
good,"The company is very nice place to work at, I learned to communicate effectively with the team and leadership, and also learned not to take anything for granted, that job may not always last until retirement."
good,Company current realigning due to business needs. A lot of great coworkers.
good,working with others providers patient and insurance companys
good,There great learning opportunities and room to grow. Everyday is different. You have to learn how to be productive with your time. Managers are very nice people. There is so much you can know here so part of the job is learning what you need to know.
good,"good place to work if you can keep up. the people are friendly and they encourage there people to help out in the community in a lot of good ways, over all a good place to work"
good,"fun, the work life balance was the top of the line most benefiting very flexible schedule vending machines, customer appreciation treatments the hardest part working for UHC is when we have to work claims that were not trained on, and when asked for help we have no assistance so we have to send the claims elsewhere and not received credit for, work culture is a call center however claims processor do not talk on phone we have a CSRMBR team that talk on phones but professional, clean and upkeep is always provided"
good,"Billing , Coding and "
good,UHC values their customers more than their employees. They have one of the worst health benefit for and sick leave of all time.  They provide too much sick leave and accommodation to half of their employees. They need to work on their sick leave accommodation.  Half of their employees received some time for accommodation.
good,"My employment at United Health Care, Inc was one of the  most rewarding jobs I have ever had.  There were plenty of resources to get the job done.  Team players were very key in this role."
good,"United Heath Care's call center is a fast paced, high stress environment, but offers excellent per hour pay and benefits. If one can handle the stress, the job is excellent."
good,"I've been at UHC since 2015 and its a nice start for a career. I initially started working in the Employer and Individual department which I absolutely hated because management sucked. They weren't very flexible or understanding at all and wanted our numbers to be perfect despite having flawed protocol guidelines and very poor training. They would actually change the type of calls we took so frequently that a lot of people were upset because we were doing twice with amount of work for not as much pay (the other people who did some of the calls we would switch off and on based on need were paid more). "
good,"A typical work day was very fast paced environment . During my typical workday, I am responsible to keep in touch with clients update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The hardest thing to do is not to be able to readily help people with. I wish we were able to receive faxes directly and scan the info into into the system and have at lest a 48-72 hour turnaround. Not a week or weeks.
good,"Good steady job, enjoyable work culture, good benefits.  I worked from home for 5 years. During my 9 total years my job ended twice but both transitions were comfortable because of the support from the company."
good,"Its a good place to work. Everyone there make a u feel at home. Just the hour a were not for me. This company was a mail room service for medicine. We stocked  medicine, filled medicine, counted medicine"
good,"Typical day at work Conducted daily detailed Enrollment and Eligibility audits, reviewed results and provided"
good,"Employees are very professional. Not very hard to fit in to the organizational culture as long as you do your work, meet your numbers then you will be just fine. There are plenty of opportunities and growth within the company so the sky is the limit!"
good,The company is great and I love the option to work from home. But the money is low advancement is difficult even even your a top performer. Need more money they make to much to only pay pennies
good,"It has good envvironment. Good people. Really promotes Job Work/Life Balance. Growing? Definitely not that fast, if you're a performer in the company they will not let go of you coz your a performer but it will not make you grow tho."
good,The job itself is not a big deal once you earn enough postive reviews you can work at home. That make life easy but more strict and you are tiughtly monitored so mins your p's and q's
good,productive. busy. nice environment. benefits good. friendly faces. good hours. flexible pto. own cubicle. always work to do. team busses and meetings.
good,"Nice break area, big screen TV's, free parking, complementary coffee and tear centers and flexible work shifts."
good,"Uma empresa conceituada no mercado de trabalho,e que valoriza o funcionario"
good,"Very good experience  "
good,The environment was great. The training was very difficult and it was a temp job. They didn't hire anybody from the temp agency. I don't companies that doesn't want to work with people.
good,A great place to wok family oriented. Knowledge of the system and how the company operates. Respectable environment. Co workers are loving and like family. The Supervisors are respectable and understanding.
good,The best part of my job is without a doubt the people that I work with. Everyone is always ready to help and encourage one another. That has definitely helped me become a more confident person.
good,"A typical day of work included Offshore coordination, Crisis management, Defect management, Review status of development of new projects under my team, Review of new projects in pipe line, Cost estimation and budgeting of new projects, and brain storming new process , performance monitoring and tuning the system for better performance and making it cost effective."
good,UGC is a great place to work the pay is ok I think it should be a little more but you can live off of it. You have team where you can also ask for help and people are willing to help you it’s not like you are in  competition with anyone I do feel like  Quality  Need to grade calls better
good,"Answer Calls and solve problems deal directly with customers either by telephone, electronically or face to face "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,My experience with United was very excellent  I learn more about the company and my insurance was very good I would go back and work the company again it was just the distance  other reason why I would had stay with them
good,"The company has a good work culture, everyone starting from the team members and seniors are friendly and helpful best manager best team good place to work."
good,I have enjoyed a lot with my work and we are a good at team work. UHG was contract based company .we completed the work as a contract came to end.
good,"Working for UHC during Open Enrollment was fine, nothing bad to say about the healthcare company. This was short term, not much more to say, as I travel to their client sites to represent UHC."
good,I find the best part of my job are the people that I work with. WFM is a very stressful job and my team agrees that we are not being compensated enough for our hard work. We just started to have a bonus structure implemented but as employees who have lives and stresses outside of work that is no guarantee that we will make the criteria each month. I know many other MC's that get way higher pay for the levels of stress they face on a day to day.I understand that working for a third party company is the major cause of these situations as well.
good,"The financial compensation is sub par, I feel like the way that the management handles decisions In the claims department very disrespectful to their employees."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, honesta, organizada..."
good,"If you started with United Health Group than I am sure you are ok. But if you were integrated into UHG through Alere, then I pity you, Unfortunately, the Alere facilities are ran off of Management who ALWAYS think that you are never good enough to even have the position that they hired you for. Each opportunity they get, they will make sure that remind you of your insignificance. If you are just starting out in the Call Center Environment so you can see how grimy politics can be in a place that pays you little to none."
good,I enjoy traveling to different and new places every week.  I enjoy meeting new and old clients and providing them with a great experience.
good,"I thought it would be a company in which I could advance through the ranks, but it did not work out that way. I worked for this company for 2 years. After the first year, I noticed things started to change, from management to subordinates. I have seen both fired, they have a high turnover...they will downsize 200 people and then turn around and hire another crop to replace those individuals. The benefits were comprehensive, but the pay was average or slightly below. I enjoyed the position itself, but the environment was unprofessional and they did not trust their employees. Only the smokers received the advancement opportunities. And bonuses were given out at the discretion of the supervisor and they could disperse them as they saw fit. So one person could have received the entire bonus and others received nothing. They did not possess good business practices at all."
good,"Your manager lives and dies with your metrics.  You will be watched, recorded and analyzed to the fullest extent.  I was there as a contractor and could not wait until contract was completed.  Many of the larger companies are like this.  Look for smaller companies to work for.  Less that 2-300 folks usually do not burden the employees with this metrics mess."
good,There was just lack of communication and organization in the company. also being a call center there was always issues upon the floor. The calls are always beck to back. and they training has nothing to do with the actual types of calls.
good,If your not into politics and butt kissing this isn't the job for you.. either your part of the incrowd or your forgotten about. Your given one schedule then asked to work over or sent home early...
good,Working environment was very multi-cultured. I've learned about Medicare products and coverage. It's very fast paced and an enjoyable company to work for.
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar."
good,Management was not all licensed agents and had never been telesales agents. They were not realistic about goals. The environment and co workers were great though.
good,"Aprendizado como atender diversos tipos de clientes, sejam eles internos ou externos."
good,I've gained my experience and knowledge about csr and the health field at this job. I took what I've learned from this employer to the next. It was a blessing to be apart of this company
good,"Busy environment. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Fixed hours, meetings all day.   Lots of tedious emails that are misunderstood by others.    I work in a department that is unpopular, which makes it stressful."
good,I worked there for almost a year. While the pay was great. The supervisors were NOT! My supervisor lacked empathy and looked for every reason to get you fired. I really enjoyed my time and the co-workers were fine but my supervisor made everyone's life tumultuous. When contacting HR they did not offer much of a resolution or confidentiality I was not secure for my job but I did love working there and I enjoyed the benefits and the 401K.
good,"The best perk working for UHC is the opportunity to telecommunte, but watch your back, they will out source work to Indian, so you will train them and the next thing you  know they will lay you off and replace you with workers from India the ones you just trained for cheaper workers."
good,"My job was wonderful before a very insecure and unenlightened woman came in and made everything terrible. Not only did she bring her Christian faith into the workplace (who does that in a Fortune 5 Company these days?), she took away all the perks of working here.  Our calls are recorded, our screens are spied on, and our work is scrutinized to the point of ridiculousness. We are threatened with CAP's (corrective action plans) when we cannot perform up to their 98% quality standards. These CAP's will torpedo your entire future at UHG. Not for the faint of heart or single parents."
good,"While working at Optum, they treated us like numbers and were quick to fire people. They focused on the benefits of the company not the people even though I was the #1 sales agent"
good,united health care is a good job its not the job its the management  the job require to many steps the company cares more about suggestive selling than spending time with the customers the job is set up all wrong the management gets judge by the csr so they put pressure on the csr to make them look good if your not making them look good your not a good csr and you get wrote up leading to termination.
good,"I was one of several temporary Sourcers at United Healthcare in the Talent Acquisition area.  For some reason, all of the sourcers were temporary or Contractors.  It was a very good, capable team that was very productive.  The problem was that there was unlikely that this job could become full time, or permanent.  It was as if this healthcare company could not, or would not provide us with healthcare benefits!"
good,"high expectancy  of certain things out of your control and  management is awful, yeling and screaming at employees."
good,managers at uhc have huge egos which leads them to crazy harrassing powertrips and awful work environment great pay for a very stressful job dont apply if you dont like being treated poorly by members and employers
good,This company treated everyone fairly and they showed everyone they cared by doing little pot lucks and leaving gifts at desks to show appreciation. This is a great company to get your foot in the healthcare door.
good,Ok place to work. good pay and tons over overtime. Ready to move on
good,"A rotina de trabalho é muito agitada, são muitas ligações, mas tem um ambiente muito bom para se trabalhar."
good,"cash posting to pt accounts"
good,"Management is a pain (to say it nicely) but the pay made it worth it, some managers wont do ANYHTING for you while others will do what they can...they promote thier friends not who deserve so that kinda sucks but all in all i would go back( mainly bc of the pay lol)"
good,I did data entry for 8 hours a day. I issued policy numbers for 2 states.
good,Working for united health care was an ok job. The pay could have been better along with management when j was there. The people and atmosphere were ok.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Lot of fun at wcork but no work life balance. lot of extra curricular activities"
good,United Health Group is a decent large company unfortunately they do not offer the same compensation package that their peers offer.  Bonus are subjective and based on favoritism.
good,"Bom salário, ótimos benefícios. Gestores com falta de comprometimento"
good,Hardest part are the providers you get & the lack of help when needed. Be prepared for attitudes. Got to have confidence. Everyone is nice but due to everyone being busy you most likely wont get the immediate help you need. Pretty easy job if you get the proper training (Depends on the trainer you get). Call centers are just a pain in general so if you have experience then you know what i mean. They are really firm on the rules. Half a point if late. Full point if no show. You get a total of 7-8 points. Bonus's are nice IF you meet your metrics but this call center is always changing rules so be prepared for change.
good,Great people to work with on a daily basis and it is close to home.   Typical day 30 to 50 incoming calls to provide benefits  to members and to review claims with  providers.
good,"united claims is a great place to work, opportunities to move up, the pay for the most part is decent however can be extremely stressful, but can at times be very rewarding...now management... has never done the job so their micromanaging is unnecessary, they like to play favorites and see people fight against each other for positions or projects/jobs."
good,Nice to have others to help when it was needed.  There was education opportunities.  Had 4 different supervisors and got along with all except for the last one.
good,"unrealistic goals and they do not care about their employees, what used to be a small group is a number and employees are not cared about what happens to them."
good,nothing to say over than they moved 80% of tech jobs offshore to save company money 30% onshore. that's all i have got. They did people wrong who were faithful to the company due to age.
good,"This company offers many opportunities but lacks work/life balance. The company has a strong belief in work/life balance but getting to the lower levels of the company, it can be difficult to take time off, hours can be very long for long periods of time. There is a lot of stress with certain divisions of this company. The company has a good culture philosophy but they don't always walk what they talk."
good,"I enjoyed working at optum, There were Nice people, flexible schedule , courses for improvement offered on your own time, ability to move up if you put the work in"
good,"Worked there for 4 years, promises were made but never happened, disappointed in upper management commitment to existing employees. Big company that did not show any concern what they did. Profit over people. Also, for being a healthcare provider, the costs were too high, and did not over enough plans even if you wanted to pay more out of you own pocket"
good,Highly competitive. Learned a lot about health industry.  Mgmt. was not up to speed. Work culture was ok Mgmt. not on board. Loved being able to help.
good,very busy environment  80-100 calls per day
good,"For a call center it pays decently. However, the micro managing is ridiculous. Your two 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch goes by way too fast and God forbid you have to use the bathroom any other time. The supervisors are constantly on your back about your ""stats"" because it affects their raises and they micro manage everything you do to make them look better. Training is long and ok but does not cover half of what you get on the floor. There is no work life balance because you never feel like you leave the place from one day to the next and good luck trying to get a day off to be at one of your children's events. There is something better out there, just gotta keep looking."
good,"Management was indecisive about making changes and restructuring, not giving importance to older employees. There was an acquisition that triggered big layoffs and employees from the new company got raises and promotions over the older employees"
good,overall a great company really no room for advancement as been here 5 years on the phones and not many positions to get off the phone. I have enjoyed my time here but relocating back home to be with family.
good,Company is a growth company ranked in the fortune 400 companies in the United States. Company has good atmosphere to work and relationship building. Management is very good at working with employees through various issues.
good,"It is a very enjoyable job for those who are fit for it. Being able to communicate effectively with the person on the other side of the phone is the key to having a fantastic call.  As long as you have a positive attitude and listen to the person's needs this job will go very smoothly. On the other hand, if you are someone on the more timid side and are afraid of giving even the slightest push to get the consumer to buy the product, then this job is not right for you."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Empresa com area de atuaçao muito especifica, trabalho um pouco engessado e sem dinamismo. Trabalho delicado pois trata-se da saude dos seus clientes. Deve haver muita compaixao e profissionalismo."
good,Poderia melhora agregando benefícios trabalho como auxiliar de enfermagem prestando serviço de acordo com minha competência
good,This is a great company with numerous opportunities available. A typical work day is very energetic and fast past. With this company you get a chance to see innovation at it's best.
good,"Typical dr office type work. Scheduling patients, collecting co-pays and verification of medical benifits. Co-workers were enjoyable. Doctors were demanding"
good,"If you can handle stress, this is for you! The people keep coming and the managers are trying everything to get you to sell.  if you don't have enough sells within a given time, they focus their attention on you."
good,"Management in the facility sucks. Since the first day of training managers were down my back for no reason. HR has no idea whats  acceptable and not, supervisors can be cool at times , but only look out for themselves at the end. The pay and benefits are great. Best advice is to stay to yourself."
good,"I worked in interventional radiology. I loved my team and physicians, we were efficient, productive and fast at what we did."
good,"•	Review calls for Quality Assurance in order to be compliant with CMS (Centers of Medicare Services) "
good,"There is not really much to review, overtime can be a hassle during the end/beginning of the year if you have a strict/set schedule for your personal life. Things can change quite often."
good,Great culture but can be hard to advance. Not enough transparency. Looking toward rapid growth but interrnally company needs to continuously disrupt to evolve for growth.
good,"not a competitive pay scale and new hires start out making more than those that have been with the company, have more experience, and job demands, poor management, and no room for growth."
good,"Would love working here better if I had better pay,  more fairness,  no favoritism,  better benefits,  and better managers to work with in the production floor"
good,"The company does not reward for accuracy, it is hyper focused on production metrics which is secondary to doing a good job and being accurate. "
good,"Math and memorization skills are key to this competitive field. I quickly excelled, producing numbers far beyond my requirements but ultimately chose to move on when an opportunity to pursue a dream presented itself."
good,The position was nice but at this time I lived in San Fernando Valley and my drive was horrible everyday back and fourth. They really don't train yiu enough here at this facility but it was ok. I believe I could have stayed if I was much closer.
good,Working for any insurance company can provide you with ample opportunities to progress through the departments. The hiring process is performed by a third party so there is less chance at favoritism. Self directed and working independently are expected at the management level. Sr Leadership as with any other big business is always politically motivated and rarely takes the front line staff into consideration.Work hard and keep learning everyday whether its from a subordinate or a Director and you will end up with the satisfaction that you carved out a career you can be proud of.
good,"Good company to work for. "
good,Each day you take incoming calls to provide help to Seniors looking for medical coverage that will help with Medicare benefits. There is a training program that you go through. The hardest part of the job is being counted as a statistic instead of a person.
good,"Stable Job, with clearly defined duties.  As employees we learned how to access Sharepoint to print out Job Aides and Product Information.  Business culture, little interaction beyond our Product Team members"
good,"it was an okay job, it was a temporary job so no  benefits, you could earn paid time off after a year with the company, but nobody made it a year. Managers sucked, alot of drama in the building easy job easy systems to use, regular call center job."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Calling members doing assessments North East MI, RI, WI , NY MD.  All phone contact no face to face which is why I am looking for a job. Want face to face contact again."
good,Great time working for company able to complete task and worked with a great team.  Management could be unpredictable and unapproachable at times made for unstable and uncomfortable work environment.
good,It is a business and they are definitely on the Corporate America schedule. Overtime is mandatory. They do have a wonderful training crew.  your position is consistent with company needs I was promised to be put into a claims position after my first 6mths and then they would not let me go so that I was able to transfer to another dept as they needed me in customer service (which I did not apply for) and kept me there .
good,"the environment was loud and unprofessional. However, the job was very fast paced and stressful. Most work from home, i was not allowed to work from home for some unknown reason. management  could use improvements on communication with employees."
good,"Good company for full timers."
good,"Starting pay is great, hard to move up to different positions. You can do great every day but if you get docked one point, you can get written up for it and potentially get fired because you aren't getting 100% in all ratings. One of those jobs where you can do everything and more for the member and get a 95%, you get in trouble."
good,My review would be based on 15 years ago.  This would not be a relevant review.  What I do recall is that the managers were not people that worked with their teams.  There was favoritism going on.
good,"As a Registered Case Manager, 85% of your time is spent on the phone speaking with consumers. You are also required to obtain multi-state licensure during your employment with the company. It is a fast paced, ever changing environment."
good,Good salary & benefits.  Hectic work environment.  Never any down time.  Not a good Job/Life balance unless you were higher up in the food chain.  Good place to start your career.
good,Benefit are not good. Work vibes are warm.Work load is stead.I consider the management as fair. If your looking for a career in health care this is a good way to get your foot in the door. You'll get a great understanding of healthcare from the insurance end. I consider it awesome stepping stone if you are had door closed due to lack of experience in the medical field.
good,"Fair and flexible, good place to work. Many of the roles are telecommute, it is really nice to work from home. I found I was highly productive in this environemnt. Management is very flexible, great place to work."
good,I remember every year getting the day after thanksgiving off paid for a holiday. No one does that anymore. UH is very into giving back to your community.
good,Typically I would gather lockbox information and process it. Help out to my peers when needed. And focus on areas where I could be more productive to the company.
good,"Traveling case manager, making at least 2 home visits per day, to check in on patients, ensure that they have proper services and are safe and healthy."
good,"The area we worked in, Alere, was purchased by United Health Group so it had its own issues.  The equipment was old, the metrics were impossible to attain and some of the management was not understanding as to how the metric numbers never added up"
good,It was not a bad company to work for. Their was no paid rate advances. They only paid $10 dollar a hour. The amount of money per hour could be a lot better.
good,"It was a good place to work for, everyone worked together, if you needed help everyone was willing to give a helping hand, you never had to worry about not getting the job done."
good,This was a medical environment job with a lot of confidentiality. I enjoyed taking the patients information and signing them into their appointments. I also took co-pays and entered their insurance information in the computer.
good,Fun and productive. Every friday my department always do fun stuff to get us excited and people are friendly and nice. Leadership are always willing to hear what the employee wants to addressed.
good,"A typical day at work is enjoying picking up patients for transport. What I have learned is to be patient and very understanding to the patients concerns. Management are okay when mistakes aren't made. Work place culture is good, work balance is NOT good...Hardly a steady early pick up schedule assighned to the driver. The hardest part of the job would be receiving constant incorrect and false information on patients where abouts, communication with personnel is mediocre at best. Constantly getting incorrect addreses from Logistic Care and passing that mistake to pick up drivers."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I don't have time to write a review at the moment. Original Boss was awesome. Then bounced around to supervisor to supervisor.  That was not great. Overtime was great if you had the time.  UHG remote supervisors not considerate of WestCoast employees time difference.
good,"Great hours, management needs to be better. Don't like to be tied down to the chair and micromanaged. The management needs more experience and knowledge on how to talk to employees. Class was put in the position and not had enough training. Coaches were not as supportive as they should have been"
good,"Typical work day was production based, learned a lot about HCC Coding. Management was a little rude. Co-workers were cordial. Hardest part of the job was traveling to work in the snow. The most enjoyable part of the job was working at home."
good,"I enjoy my coworkers we work as a team to accomplish our goals "
good,"A typical day at work would be to arrive early, help client with movement from bed to choosing clothes for the day. I help clean bed, bathrooms and kitchen. I do laundry, vaccuming and dusting when client request. I learned to always ask questions when moving a clients items from or around their home."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"I believe UHG as a whole is a good organization. I learned so much about the health insurance industry and countless administrative-related duties. "
good,"This was my internship for school. "
good,"I start at 7:00 and finish at 3:00 and work from home 3 days a week."
good,"Um bom lugar para trabalhar, o que atrapalha é a gerência que não sabe coordenar."
good,"For the most part UHC is a wonderful place to work.  Good pay, good benefits (PTO, flex time, etc).  The problem that exists there is that as an acquired entity, you will be picked apart and the acquired company's staff will be eliminated.  They also send positions off-shore due to cost, but the productivity is low and stateside personnel end up re-doing the work.  United Healthcare also talks about promoting ""telecommuting"" positions, but fail at that aspect in many areas (Finance, Sales/Account Management, IT), yet these seems to be the areas that have the most open positions.  They also talk a good game about keeping the staff that they have rather than training someone new off the street - again, they fail at this as well.  I actually trained a person for 6 months in a role similar to mine and because he was local to headquarters, his position was safe, but mine was eliminated.  This speaks volumes about how experience is not held in high esteem, but overloading a lesser paid employee is ok."
good,"For the period of time working for UnitedHealth Group I found as time went on that the job was extended from the original Enterprise Business Architect to Project Management, Solutions and Technical Architecture as well as Development and Testing."
good,"United Health Group as a whole, is a great company. However, due to its large size, it has been tough to advance. I started my employment in the Producer Help Desk, which was a great experience. We had good leadership and it was a rewarding job. I then moved to Hi Health Innovations and have been here for nearly 3 years. Providing our members with affordable, high quality hearing aids and services is great. The management is tough to deal with at times as we are still a very new company within UHG. So the ability to advance and shine is much harder then it is in many other areas of UHG."
good,"A questão da empresa não tenho nada ruim a declarar, mas não possuía carteira assinada e isso muitas vezes me prejudicava. Como é uma empresa de vendas esse ramo é muito incerto e assim tinha alguns malefícios. Nos meses em que não conseguia um número maior de clientes."
good,"I loved going to work, I loved what I did and who I worked with."
good,Constant phone calls. worked with some very nice people
good,Nice place to work
good,Flexible work schedule that is family friendly. Good for a new parent or parent who prefers to be easily accessible to meet their family's needs. Would recommend to a work from home parent.
good,Its okay don't apply if you don't learn fast. Training is intense but good company overall. good benefits but pay doesn't equal to the amount of work given
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Stable company but not much focus on employee develop over a 13 year career.  Little to no training received during my time here.  Only pushed to deliver next project or product
good,"United is the biggest Healthcare company in the United States.  If you are expecting to work on a 290,000 + employee corporate industry, this is the place to be. "
good,Training at UHG was unfortunately not the best.  Was there for first two weeks and there was no work.  We learned the programs once we started to work. Contract ended sooner than expected. No feedback from managers.
good,"Though I learned what needed to be understood about RX processing, I have 0 interest in medication. I appreciate working from Home when I did serve however, I changed industries due to my stance on medication."
good,The company does not value its employees. A person can be laid off who is performing very well and receive no assistance with transferring to another role. I’ve see awarded employees go without a blink of the eye. Some groups are better than others. Optum is much better than UnitedHealthcare. The culture is more caring.
good,I did not work their long as there were many policy changes while there including the dress code going from casual to business casual. This was not something I could afford immediately as many others and we were held accountable for it with less than a 72 hour notice.
good,"Working for UHG was insightful. It gave me experience in the corporate arena. I am not a huge fan of big business, but my overall experience was good. I think the manager’s hands are tied and they ultimately have to do what “the man/woman” wants and the opinions of the employees are not taken seriously."
good,"Day starts Easy"
good,"UHG Provides a lot of training to further your career, such as classroom trainings and online trainings as well. The company pays for it as long as your manager approves"
good,"Often very click like atmosphere.  You have to play politics.  No sick time which is ridiculous for a health insurance company.  Surprisingly the medical benefits and prescription benefits are not as good as many people we serve.  However, vision benefits are great."
good,"I have an advanced level of proficiency in Microsoft Office Applications and experience working with Commercial and Medicare service teams."
good,"Empresa da oportunidade de você aprender"
good,"My typical day is just being on the phones all day, which I don't mind, the things I have learned about my job is the diversity of people that I enter act with on a daily basis. The management are very knowledgeable, but the trainers lack a lot of knowledge I was not very prepared when I went the production floor. The culture around the work place is OK everyone has the own little groups dome make you feel welcomed others not so much. I think the hardest part of the job is not having enough time finishing note before the next call comes in. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help my members."
good,"poor middle management, no opportunities for advancement, lots of work, everyone not held to same work standards, middle management unprofessional and unappreciative of employees hard work"
good,The environment and people are fun to be with. There may be tasks that are difficult to handle but with the right thinking and positive approach it will be easily to overcome.
good,"A typical day is very busy, many conference calls and reports due."
good,Great work environment. Open communications from management to employees working remotely. Great camraderie and support from your colleagues. Companies values and mission reflected well in their communications.
good,"i would handle members, doctors, hospitals and pharmacies with medical benefits. I explained benefits, and resolved claim issues that the caller would have."
good,"Fun and great diversified work environment to work in. Fast paced, although it is very hard to move to upper lead/management roles within this company. Clean work office and very great food cafes in each building. Amazing coworkers to work together with."
good,Management wasn't to good great place to work  didn't like the cancelations of shifts and the pay well. Would love to work for then again in a different department
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,A typical Day at Work was maintaining the Middle Tennessee Database Grid of members to insure United Health Group stays compliant with the TennCare Guidelines under the Choices Program.
good,"Manage day to day activities of service account managers in a healthcare setting.  This would include all HR functions, managing escalations and work volume."
good,"would not want to work here as a full time job, its very draining and very robotic, Management was not bad just my supervisor was. she was very rude and a bully"
good,"While UHG states they're trying to innovate for the sake of the customer, they routinely contract their In-network providers are rates far below other insurance companies, create far more paperwork for their customers, and limit their employees work/life balance incredibly."
good,Health benefits are terrible. Senior leadership doesn’t care about the employees who are actually doing their job so that they can have theirs. It’s a cut throat kind of business.
good,The position that I am working right now is extremely stressful. There is not a lot of support from management. I really enjoy my team members. In a normal work day I would review appeals or grievance submitted by the members. I would also prepare for hearings for these cases.
good,Pretty good training but not a lot chance for advancement. The culture of the company is fast paced. This job is not for everyone. They should really pay more because the wage doesn't match the cost of living.
good,Not a bad company if you are just starting out or at the end of your career. Not a great place for individuals that are in the middle of their professional life.  Most management has been in place longer than is conducive to growth.
good,Manager did not allow any work from home options. Advancements in department was always a struggle. Work life balance in the department was non-existent for most.
good,"Nice environment, however, in some positions the salary was lower than expected.  I you are looking to advance you would need to relocate to the headquarters of Minnetoka, MN."
good,"Good place to work, I loved working from home. There are many departments to work in, anything you can imagine doing can be done at this company. Tuition reimbursement could be more."
good,"I used to work for Pacificare, so when I saw the job for UHG, I was under the impression it would be the same since since Pacificare was not UHG. The benefits were not the same at all! We were on a PPO with a deductible. We worked on the same floor as sales and sales had an HMO with a $5.00 copay. I was pregnant and it cost me the individual out of pocket maximum to have my baby. I was told sales had an HMO because they were the ones who brought in the $ to the company. Overall, I really liked my job, what I did, the staff I worked with. The location was BEAUTIFUL. The position I had was based on a 2 year grant that was given by the state of California. UHG wasn't sure what was going to happen at the end of the grant since it was so new. I accept the job knowing I may not have a future in with the company. Therefore, it was job, not a career. In fact, once the grant money was gone the program ended and the staff had to find new positions."
good,Did enjoy the work schedule it was fixed same hours and days off really enjoyed that felt like I could plan something outside of work because I knew my schedule it stayed the same and the pay was descent but was though a temporary agency.
good,"Great Company to work for, and can make good money on commissions.  Medicare Sales Reps have high turnaround and you are always worried if you will be let go."
good,"A empresa tenta seguir seus 5 pilares de valores, porém nem sempre cumpre com o prometido, na questão de pagamento a empresa é mais do que correta e sempre pagou na data estipulada. A parte mais difícil é tentar conciliar o que a empresa deseja em relação a metas com os pilares, pois nem sempre é possível conciliá-los. A parte mais agradável além do ambiente confortável é a satisfação de ajudar quem necessita, claro quem nem sempre isso é possível."
good,"The pay and stock options are the best part of this job.  Work life balance...forget about it.  Meetings are scheduled at 7:30 in the morning and at least several times per month there are emergency meetings that occur at nearly midnight.  The work load is ever increasing with fewer and fewer resources to accomplish.  Staff is stressed, spread too thin, and turnover is increasing."
good,"Working at UHG the last 6 years, I've realized that it is really difficult to move upwards without knowing or having the right people to propel you, in your corner. It's very competitive but also very clicky in many departments."
good,"You can pick your 8 hour time block, they offer flex time, PTO, and sick leave. Management doesn't really know what they are doing but the SME's do. If you meet metrics for a minimum of a year they let you work from home. The hardest part of the job is the isolation, when you are a claims processor, you aren't allowed to talk to your co-workers unless it is an emergency or you are on break. There is no talking to the customers or anyone else so you have to be comfortable with little or no contact to the outside world. I like the company culture, but it would be nice if the New Mexico office supported their employees in volunteer activities."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Managers are not required to have at least an Associates Degree in Nursing.  They are allowed to be managers with Diplomas in Nursing.  While a few managers may have a BSN.  Therefore, often they are not properly trained to manage in rapidly changing, fortune 6 company environment."
good,"UHG is a results driven company with high expectations of its employees.  No one skates by in this company - you either work hard and perform, or you don't last."
good,Career advancement has been great. Homework life balance could be better.  Working for a managed-care company priorities  are always changing. You have to be very flexible throughout your workday.
good,Everything is at the manager descresion which leaves things open for personal feelings by management and can sometimes make bad decisions based on how that person feels about an individual
good,"I was a temporary worker during the busy season, so I was not involved with the company culture. The company was nice to the temp workers. We had a good office with a nice view. A big supermarket with a deli was next door, so we all ate well."
good,Lots of overtime. Some micromangement depending on the department you work for. There is room for advancement if you are motivated. Most positions require you to work weekends.
good,"Largely depends on the department and leader you work with. Some areas are great. Others, not quite as much. Currently, the organization is not supportive of visa and residence sponsorships, so keep that in mind."
good,"I was responsible for the day to day operations of several hundred UHG IT applications.  My teams were first responders when issues occurred around those applications.  As you can imagine, there were always a few issues going on each day.  It was my responsibility to work with my teams for resolution and recovery for our business customers.  24x7x365."
good,I liked the under management but the upper management was not very nice.  I became a licensed insurance agent and worked with individuals who are eligible for medicare on signing them up for medicare advantage planes.
good,I love working here and I'm going to miss the people very much. I wouldn't be leaving if they weren't shutting down. I loved having the EEC. That was so much fun! I work at my own pace and switch from task to task so as not to get bored. Management is willing to help with whatever you need. I am always learning new things. Everyone is willing to help you with problems. My favorite part of the day is when I can help someone else with a problem. When I get here I work on EOBs needed from previous days until I get my current claims. Another worker prints those for me. I also work on counting mail or if I have some return mail or address change mail. Something I don't like is that they won't give me access to OWM. I need this to find some of my EOBs. It doesn't make sense that I don't have this when I definitely need it. This is the hardest part of my job- trying to understand why they won't let me have access.
good,Progression in the M&R department was based on how popular you were with the managers. Not based on  your overall work performance. Definitely a you have to know the right person to get the opportunity to advance.
good,Flexible working hours at work. Friendly bosses. Very keen into details. Must be able to delivery the number of applicants in a day. The culture is average
good,"work place culture was very diverse"
good,"I worked 4 departments all the time i worked there, but last one another company bought them out, and management was terrible no one knew what was going on. I enjoyed working with company itself and i really enjoyed working with my last three supervisors, until it was bought by someone else."
good,The job was good.  I learned a lot.  I moved to Dallas to help my family.  I started working in medical billing and enjoyed it ever since.  I had no problems.
good,thankful for United Healthcare but wish they gave value to their employees who are dedicated. The worst is the high deductible health insurance policy for their employees....
good,There were particular employees that were treated differently then others. others abused the policies and got away with it. others we watched like hawks and written up at the drop of a hat.
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho ,ampliou meus conhecimentos em relação a área administrativa e atendimento a pessoa jurídica.Obtive ótimas amizades.Aparte ruim da empresa foi o salário que não era compatível com o mercado,ou seja,estava bem abaixo do mercado ."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Sharing information and establishing a connection. The goal of my position in the company is to help members maintain a healthy lifestyle. Many of the individuals I come into contact with may first start off venting and upset about benefits, providers not being in network, prescription drugs not being covered, but after we talk and discuss solutions our encounter becomes enlightening and friendly. We often find ourselves talking about things that had nothing to do with the call at hand. I love the Compassionate Connection that I receive and I am allowed to give to our members."
good,It is a great culture depending on the department and manager you work with day to day. There are times that you get to meet others in the office but not often again depending on the department you work in.
good,Medsynergies has recently been acquired by Optum Health. My experience prior- great provider of all back office services for large provider organizations.
good,"I held many different job titles in my 15+ years at UHC.  There was a very political atmosphere, and advancement opportunities were scarce."
good,You are in sales so each day is an opportunity to reach your goals and make a sale. Loved the flexibility of working from home a few days during the week.  Also enjoyed my co workers who were in the same role to share ideas and encourage each other.
good,"The company seemed to be great, but as always new people can mess that up. UHC acquired Helios and let them become my management, they practices are horrible and disrespectful."
good,"This is a great company to work for, but management has it's favorites and favoritism is the focus rather than actually based on performance."
good,"I enjoyed the coworkers that I worked with. It had a real family feel to it, but we needed to support each other. The reason why, was our supervisors weren't the brightest people. The supervisors weren't good at problem solving, and wasn't acute to build a strong work environment."
good,ok job. stressful. good pay. sneaky co workers and management. they will smile in your face and throw u under the bus behind ur back
good,"A empresa ajudou a ter mais conhecimento de novos programas, ter habilidade em lidar com situações inusitadas,a ser mais humana, onde tinha um perfeito relacionamento com meu companheiros de trabalho. A parte mais complicada era quando por falta de pagamento um paciente nao podia ter atendimento e nao queria compreender que o serviço não seria prestado por conta de sua inadimplência. O mais agradável de tudo foi os bons conhecimentos e contatos que levarei para toda a minha jornada de vida."
good,"Quite a challenging place to work, a lot to learn and loads to achieve in the BPO world however definitely a trend setter when it come to employee satisfaction."
good,"United Health Group is an umbrella company under United Health Care, a well known insurance company.  It has great benefits and offers a wide variety of positions."
good,"Busy work day however, offer the work and home life balance"
good,"Uma empresa com excelente funcionários, pessoas dispostas a te ensinar e aprender com você. Carrego comigo uma bagagem espetacular, da amizade á excelência do trabalho. A melhor parte era a rotina, super agitada, muitos problemas e soluções rápidas. A parte ruim foi ter que ver pessoas sendo promovidas por gerentes, sem seguirem o ranking de avaliação do RH. O que fez muitos funcionários de excelência se desmotivarem."
good,"A typical day at work from the claims processing prospective . "
good,Good place to work with and the hardest part is you will not have parking facility. You cann't epxect onsite opportunities.
good,"UHC is a great place to work in the city of Duluth Minnestoa. There are many opportunities to a wide array of jobs within the call centerl, so there is something for everyone!"
good,"United Healthcare has forgotten about their US employees. All work is being shipped overseas in return taking work from the US and resulting in lay offs, people quitting."
good,Good company to grow our self. The company is proving health care process for US people. Everybody supports and encourage to learn new things.
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, porém não atendeu minhas necessidades pessoais."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Empresa engajada no aprendizado e crescimento dos colaboradores,    incentivo a prática de esportes e cultura."
good,UHG offers employees the opportunity to learn and grow within the company and help their  members live healthier lives.
good,"Inbound calls from medical facicilies to gather information of members benefits. What I learned about this job is every member had different type of coverage, none was the same. Management always willing to help. Co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was no overtime availability. The most enjoyable was when got compliments from medical facilities."
good,"i learned about how to behave in corporate industry."
good,Most innovative payer to work for.  Highly competitive.  Telecommuting is common which is nice.  Learned all about Health care reform.  Management varies.  Co-workers were nice.  Hard if you don't want to move to Minnesota.  Fun part is learning a ton.
good,They have great benefits and was great for my family as far as medical and dental.
good,"I effectively managed attendance, call volume, payroll, and quality control of team. I remained for monitoring, organizing, and coaching a team of 25 members. I Developed incentive programs to support a positive working environment and inspired exceptional performance."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.   The work was data analysis which I really enjoy.    However, our hours were in excess of 70 per week and not time was allowed for family.    I was constantly called for urgent jobs which I completed in the allotted time.   The team I worked with was great but management was not as supportive as I thought they should be.  Personnel turnover was high.   I have worked in a telecommuter position for over 6 years and would like to work customer service for Bright House.   I'm retired from the US Navy and also have Social Security.     I'm looking for a job in customer service that will provide me additional income.   I hope you can give a chance."
good,"The Oldsmar office is a joke. The management for the PCRS and PPR are both only there for their job. There is no support that they say ther is. There is a manager there that she thinks she is the icing on everything and believes that she is the reason the coampnay is successful. "
good,"todos benefícios trabalhista porem não oferece promoção,"
good,"Very stable, VERY high call volume- you learn a lot of information, being quick on your feet and being calm and collected is the best personality that will fit. Providers can be very difficult to deal with. Typical call center environment."
good,"The Sales Department is productive, fast paced, willing to teach you to better your skills. Team building events where you get to know other individuals from other departments. I enjoyed working with co-workers very supportive of one another always willing to assist if help is needed. The hardest is to make sure you meet your dead lines in case of a last minute request, but the dead lines where always met."
good,"united healthcare is a good company to work for, if you have a family they offer good benefits"
good,dealing with customers that calling that are upset with how payment was made or rejected claim. Learning curve on how to get them information quickly and correct. No room for error.
good,Making phone calls to members who already have our services offering guidance through our nurse HealthLine.
good,"It is a good company, but they are reducing their California workforce, and moving to other states to reduce costs. My manager had no college, and should not have been promoted. She was mean to her downlines, but could really suck up to superiors."
good,"I enjoy the staff at UHG and enjoy working with members and providers. The management is somewhat lacking, but the culture overall is sufficient. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with s wonderful group of people and learning new things on a daily basis."
good,Good company to do work. Pay low salary. Cab & bus facility transportation is good.less process for departments. Competition is more in employees.partilaity is there in Managers.less holidays.overtime facility is there.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Great place to work. Very good working environment where one can manage work line balance."
good,"Pretty good place to work,  but lots of frequent changes to the job, increases stress, makes it harder to help customers. Pay is ok. Supervisors are friendly and helpful."
good,"Working at OptumRx started out Great! A few free lunches, long new hire training to really grasp knowledge, and easy going culture. Then you hit the call floor and it is all business numbers. After a certain point there is also no more room for growth."
good,Rewarding job as far as helping members with insurance questions.  You are self reliant. You are responsible for almost all you do. Little help from management.
good,"Heavy inbound of calls, assist members with eligibilty and mail order medications. Reviewed accounts and took payments over the phone. Transfer calls as needed."
good,Company offers very good infrastructure to work being able to buy and provision the best equipment due to its sheer size. Work balance is very poor despite what management says.
good,I was glad to have the opportunity to there by ready to leave.  They have a very business like culture but promote work/life balance.  Compensation is below industry standard
good,UnitedHealthcare is a high pressure environment where you must be 100% on and performing 24/7.  The employees are great to work with and their telecommute program is excellent.
good,"However, I think in my area they should focus more on life balance. They need to look at Work at home options for all. The work load is very demanding and life balance is necessary in order to keep up. What they don't understand is that, in a professional work environment, trust is important and micro management brings down morale and productivity."
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are good. Difficult to move up or to change careers from within. Definitely an environment where you can learn new skills while on the job.
good,"The job is stressful due to need to meet time deadlines for every job. "
good,Overall UHC is a well-balanced company. The Job is stressful and you are required to do alot if you are taking calls. The Work load is manageable but you are asked to do alot for a decent amount of money.
good,It is an okay place to work and currently for IT they are only going to be based out of MN.  They had to pull all jobs back to MN and close the CT and RI office
good,"Clicks/groups of favorites."
good,"The environment as an whole is a place that, culture is trying to be brought in but still needs work. Management as long as you are bringing in numbers are great but the second that they fall you will be looked at as a problem with little guidance. Holidays are a great time to work within the company because they go all out."
good,It's pretty complicated at the first few weeks. But it's not that hard to catch up and learn the require skills that we need. I can say that you'll gain a lot of experience to this company that you can use in the future
good,The company is a good company to work for but some of the managers they have should not be there. I think manager should have more skills before given the positions
good,PTO was awesome. Supervisors were nice. Getting time off when you wanted was usually manageable. The pay is low which slightly offset by overtime. Mane were afraid of getting laid off all the time.
good,"Great place for self-motivated individuals. Great benefits and chances for bonuses. i have referred individuals to UHC because they were looking for  stability, and the chance to grow within a company. They were seeking a career, and i felt UHC would be able to provide those things , and they have."
good,"This is a excellent company to learn how to be more professional. However the examples that will be shown to you from some management, vps, and employees are not examples of what you should do but more so what not to do.  Everything is not bad but you must have a positive outlook in order to complete your day-to-day assignments."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The work mentor-ship at UHG was extremely helpful. We were trained on certain skills such as SAS, SQL etc. before we were allocated to a project which was very beneficial and made the transition a little bit smoother. The business problems are quite interesting and helped me gain in-depth understanding into the healthcare business"
good,This business developed me as an individual in the Administration Assistant field. I really enjoyed my position as a Admin Assistant. This position developed my skills at multi-tasking.
good,Great place if you are looking for a home and work life balance. They have flexible schedules and work with their employees. The pay is awesome. Great incentive options.
good,Don't think you will come to work and get by with not working. It is a good company to work for. I hated the hours. I like they have a grill in the building as well as a clinic.
good,always looking for ways to reduce cost. The ability to work from home was a great benefit. Management was willing to try new approach to solving issues.
good,Fast passes work environment moving to the agile methodology. When it comes to compensation they believe in pay for performance.  There health benefits could be a lot better.
good,"A typical day is you come in and are greeted by your peers, and log in to the systems and begin to take calls and work the files as needed and make outbound calls as needed and call backs."
good,"Uma empresa boa, porém sem muitos benefícios ou plano de carreira."
good,"Work day was filled with planned and unplanned activities.  Allowed for learning opportunities, sometimes trial by fire."
good,"The job is in a high growth mode and has a lot of positives and negatives. Leadership is terrible, but the opportunity for sales and business growth is high in spite of."
good,I Love working at my job. However the management is hard to understand why the do certain things . There is not room for advancement at this point. Work I a day on the phones members are amazing.
good,I really have no comment about my employment with this organization. This job like every other job will always have its ups and downs. Management could have been a bit better but for the most part it was a job.
good,It was a good company to work for overall. The hours and flexibility was great and being able to work remotely was a big plus for me.  They also had a gym on site.
good,the culture was fun but numbers driven. benefits were great and employees were great but management had there favorites and some managers were not really helpful.
good,"Fast Paced environment that drives you to time manage yourself."
good,It's a good job but Management isn't always upfront with you. HR is heavily involved but you are not notified if you are under any type of investigation so you are not able to defend or explain your actions
good,"I was surrounded by people who cared about their job."
good,Overall my experience working at United Health Care was a good one. They had a great 3 week classroom training program and then 1 week of on the job training. I really feel like the company wants to set you up to succeed at your job. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the massive work load that you are given. Management was also not the greatest. Many of the managers showed favoritism and even though they said they were open to listening to complaints they really were not. The most enjoyable part of my job was that the company had an employee fun committee that I was a part of. We would plan monthly activities so we could bring all the employees together.
good,Difficult to write an objective review of UnitedHealthcare as I haven't worked there in almost 8 years.  I learned a lot while working there and would welcome an opportunity to work there again in the future.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"depending on the ""stage"" I was working on I would start out making calls and talking with provider offices. if working on a different stage I would QA PQ's and if everything is correct I will proceed to complete the PQ and submit them for the next stage to process. There is a metric system for each stage that the company wants us to meet. which I do feel is reasonable ."
good,The team acquired for support was a dedicated and supportive group that focused on the customer.  Supportive supervision was provided to ensure meeting team and individual goals.
good,"I last worked there in 2013 - 2014 it was a good company, there are opportunities if you apply yourself.  Management was a class act.  Grateful for the experience.  No cons to speak of."
good,"The supervisor I had before I left really didn't care about her workers. If the had a problem and emailed her, it would take her days to get back to us. She rarely held meetings."
good,It feels good to help out millions of clients to help them live better lives. It can be difficult to handle the work environment sometimes since it feels like there isn't enough leadership to help drive the workforce. It's hard to move up in the department even after I've been with the company for years. The leadership want to help you get better but then you make a mistake and then you're knocked down to step one.
good,"I was a great experience working and learning there. But I am not a telesales type of person, this was not for me. Yes I did learn a lot about health insurance and how it works, which was a good thing to know"
good,The job can be very stressful because you have to meet certain requirements that are not attainable and if you do not meet them for three consecutive months you go on a CAP (Corrective Action Plan) this adds more stress to the job.
good,"Nice provided sit stand desks.You set up your own computer when you first arrive which is fine. Come in, do your work, not a lot of interactions with other employees other than need-to-meet for code reviews or clarification. Eventually, seems there's more work than can get done and work/life balance doesn't feel balanced. Seems to have employee turnaround rate of 1-2 years."
good,My manager was rude and didn't have knowledge of the day to day job. She was short with her team and inflexible. I witnessed on several occasions when she would talk about other employees in front of her team and she made the statement that she was going to get rid of my co worker because of personal differences. There was no recourse with HR or the unit manager.
good,No comment. I enjoyed my supervisor.  Good company but some of there expectations are just off. They should really look at what department should be doing what.
good,"heavy in the management with some unqualified managers.  A lot of X Generation employees who spend most of their time on You Tube.  Overall good company worked there for two years due to close proximity.  Downside quality control was in Manilla and may have not been accustom to American culture,"
good,"I loved my job itself although not a lot of advancement opportunities at the time. I was not there long enough or tried for any real advancements, but from my co-workers, that was the main complaint."
good,"Fast paced company, a good company to work for but is consistently changing on a daily basics. I think that they should offer their employees better healthcare plans and costs considering we do work for a healthcare company. Also employees should get paid way more than we do for all of the work and metrics that we have to meet on a daily basics. Overall it is a good company, just some things I personally think should be different."
good,My overall experience with UHG was that they didn't get in no hurry to call me back when I would need a question answered..Plus there is still owe me...
good,"Work there was fun, but I didn't have a car and it was a 3 hour commute via bus to and from work.  Was very hard to get home when the last bus was at 6:20 pm and I didn't get off until 8pm."
good,Very good place to work. I enjoy my co-workers.  The atmosphere is fairly relaxed.  Good job for being exposed to a variety of patient populations. Valuable experienc
good,"Strong M&A focus to provide holistic solutions for consumer, businesses, government in areas of analytics, network design, benefits, ancillary non-health services, etc."
good,"Fairly standard office environment.  Very structured in terms of breaks, lunch, allotted time for each type of work done by each employee. Average of 10 hours of mandatory overtime required each week for employees."
good,Dead end job for contract work SOme have been there as contractors for three years. Not given a raise.  Little chance of advancement. not much more to say
good,"Working at UHG requires highly motivated and driven individuals.  It is fast paced and challenging, but the rewards are worth it.  Culture expectations are well defined and promoted."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I was caught in one of the many reorganizations and drew what has to be the worst manager and I refused to work for her. Was not given any opportunity to change positions, so I left the company. Life is too short to be treated in that manner."
good,"Hospital conceituado, atende a classe alta e tem mais de mil funcionários."
good,Company always talking about work life balance and how next year they are going to get back to a reasonable work life balance just as soon as the new project is completed. Guess what there is going to be another project next year.....
good,I survived 10 years and I still feel as if I should have been further along in my career.   I held myself back for many years then I stopped playing with stupid games with wrong people.  Speaking up to upper management was frowned on.
good,"Inbound call center for Insurance benefits,claims. It was a good job management is bad. I think if you have a person who has good stats you shouldn't be terminated so the supervisor can prove a point to get a new position when they don't even know the job they are supervising."
good,"Honestly the work in itself and the ambiance was good.  Training could be a bit better as there are several things involved with doing the job I did, but most of the training had to do with customer service and not the software programs being used.  I do, however, feel that considering they are in the health area they should provide their employees with the best health benefits possible and definitely with lower out of pocket expenses to their employees."
good,"Duties include generating leads through conducting sells meeting and attending community events. Responsible for following up with leads, establishing a trust with the prospect, and enrolling them in the best insurance plan for their individual needs. Maintaining contact with existing book of business and assisting members with enrollment needs was essential in succeeding in position."
good,This company really focused on making sure that you could provide excellent customer service. The length of training was perfect and you get a lot of guidance.
good,"A typical day consisted of fielding 180-210 inbound calls from members of the health plan. I learned about health insurance, as it pertains to members and providers."
good,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar , os funcionários mais antigos não se importa com os bons funcionários ,que importa pra eles que não tem atraso e falta ,para ganhar premiação ."
good,"A typical work day - make visits to Nursing Facilities; make calls to HCBS (Home Community Based Service) Members to assess their current status and update their charts; calls to Providers and PCP's for update on Members health; Update Members charts; Close cases when Members die and submit paperwork to the State for processing.  "
good,It's really about location it's very far but there are WAH opportunities.                  You have to meet goals to qualify / also have to work one weekend day.
good,"Worked here for 11 years and for most of that time I enjoyed it.  The people there work very hard and it can be stressful and fast paced at times.  The culture isn't bad, but the commut is what made me leave."
good,Ambiente agradável entre a empresa e colaboradores.
good,N/A it is okay job. Sometimes it get overwhelming with management. But higher management seem to care more about life outside of work. Great company but management sucks.
good,Working for a subsidiary of United Health Group made if feel that you were outside of the mainstream of the company. The complexity of the company and the exponential growth made it difficult to sometimes see how our business segment fit in. In my business segment about 1 in 5 employees work remotely doubling the difficulty to feel apart of the culture of the company.
good,"A typical day at work was mostly sitting and answering inbound calls from UHC members in a call center setting."
good,a typical day at work consisted of fielding calls from employees to advise of benefits they signed up for with their employer. I learned how to handle a variety of customers from very satisfied to very irate without taking it personally. management was okay but sometimes not very helpful in that they may not have known a lot about a persons individual benefits. united health group was a place that had a wide variety of personalities and backgrounds for its employees. the hardest part of the job was when my hands were tied on what benefits were allowable because most of the time it created an upset customer. what I enjoyed the most was being able to help someone understand their benefits and how they applied to the programs.
good,"I love the job, the skills I've learned and how I can manage my time. I can work with no or minimal supervision, I can make my own schedule and manage my time according to my day by day."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I have been working here from last 5 months it's a good company  . For girls they provide good for cab service . I learnt time sens and coaprative staff are there who can teach well to beginners
good,"Es un restaurante de elite en cuanto a alimentos y servicio , el personal no de el todo profesional. Son demasiado elitistas exgeradamente tal vez."
good,"A typical day at United Healthgroup was a fast paced, high call volumed call center environment. Always very busy. I learned how to speak with members about their health. The hardest part of the job were the many questions we had to ask the members. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers."
good,"Lack of organization from day one, not a lot of support from leads, coaches, other departments lack of ethic and a lot of errors that lead to a lot of angry members calling."
good,"Learned the corporate culture, working with much experience people,"
good,Nice ppl but it doesnt seem to be any real room for andvancement. It is also very busy every day. You are gonna speak to many providers every day
good,extremely micromanaged they don't pay nearly enough for the amount of work that is required or the information they want you to know and because its a government contract they have numerous regulations
good,"Typical work day- 7-3:30.  Alone for the majority of the day.  We were placed in teams/groups for each process we worked.  My team had two separate groups and we met with our individual groups each day for huddle.  I learned very quickly that the process you learned while getting trained in may not be the process you are required to work when you get to the floor.  Nothing is permanent so do not get comfortable.  Management was good for the most part.  They did not have very good communication between upper management, floor managers, and SME's (subject matter experts), so we often got multiple answers for one question.  The hardest part of the job was honestly sitting, all day.  Sitting still was something very new for me.  The most enjoyable part was knowing that you were helping members."
good,"good work place, the management team is great and very supportive, the best part of my job is that I'm actually helping others and that's always a good feeling and I would say the hardest part would be when someone calls in completely irate but it normally ends well once they allow me to speak and assist member with what he/she called in about, there are changes in call centers but I can definitely handle change and the challenges make it all the more interesting and rewarding."
good,"This again, was work through an outsourcing company called APAC.  We did not work directly for United Healthcare.  The training was 7 weeks before taking live calls, which in my experience is exemplary.  The supervisors, training and mentoring was world class.  The call center environment was business casual, but very excellent and overall good place to work.  The downside, like all the other positions mentioned is the longevity of the agent regarding temporary or seasonal employ.  This company, in everything they said or did made the agents feel that we would have employment beyond AEP if we were top performer's.  When AEP was over, that was our last day.  United Healthcare did not continue there contract with APAC and the call center eventually closed.  This was my first experience in a call center so I was stupified that they did not keep high producing agents for continuous work.  I did not realize that this is the standard regarding Medicare sales.  I think both APAC and United Healtcare should have been more upfront about that eventuality. No benefits."
good,"you must be in a clique to survive at this company, the pay is great. very stressfull,the supervisors are not informative but the company want you to ask them for help, if they give the wrong answer you get in trouble."
good,Great company to work for. Great co-workers.  Enjoy going to work everyday.  Benefits are expensive.   Overall I recommend the organization to others.  People in the organization care about the work they do.
good,I like the job that I am doing however the company that holds the contract with UHG is very disorganized.
good,"Trabalhei por 16 anos na empresa, e todos os dias foram intensos, pois tratava via telefone com pessoas que já estavam nervosas por não receberem seus pagamentos que estavam em atraso. O volume de trabalho sempre foi enorme por ser uma grande empresa. Meu departamento, Contas Médicas era enorme, mas meu trabalho especificamente ( faturamento não localizado ), a tratativa era apenas comigo. A direção é rígida, os colegas de trabalho são companheiros e amigos. Apesar da falta de oportunidades que nos é dada, gostei de trabalhar na Amil, porque sempre de alguma forma recebia um ""muito obrigada"" de alguém, e isto era gratificante."
good,"I have worked here for a few years now and when it all started i must say that it was an amazing place to be. But now we are in a stage where everyone wants to leave, losing supervisors as well as managers to other companies.  if they could fix everything that has fallen i would come back but as of now i will not think twice of applying again"
good,"Typical day consists of answering continuous calls regarding Medicaid and Medicare applications, process applications as well as checking for eligibility for specific Medicaid plan through the Medicaid state system. Learning experience of what plans of insurance are to offer and the understanding of open enrollment, learning about insurance and its importance as well as how to handle a fast paced and stressful position. Hardest part of the position is having to tell patients that they are past the enrollment date and would be without insurance of that they did not qualify for the plan. Enjoyed being able to assist others and knowing that the patient will benefit from your assistance."
good,"Reviewed cases for accuracy and completeness, understanding principles of HIPAA; So maintained government mandated confidentiality, while verifying member eligibility."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Working at United Healthcare was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about the many different kinds of claims that can be submitted by medical providers. I also learned a lot about the different kinds of medical procedures that can be performed by doctors. Management was always generous when it came to work/life balances. The hardest part of this job was interacting with irate customers. A typical day at work would consist of logging into the computer and telephone systems and also getting a cup of coffe to start off the day. My co-workers were all very nice and we had good discussions about sports and all kinds of foods.
good,UHC's Member Services program is impressive however once you hit the floor you are expected to retain the knowledge you learned. It's not a easy ride but the supervisor team at that time was great with working with staff over schedules.
good,learned a lot about insurance and got my start in the medical industry.. decent place to work... telecommute
good,I learned how a mail order pharmacy works and learning new things everyday
good,"Good place to work, a since of stability.  With such a large company some aspects make it dificult to accomplish your work in a streamlined fashion"
good,"Comprised of diverse team-players and matrix of team.  Enjoyed working at UHG but had five different managers change in short period time.  Never consistent resources, new person on-boards and off-boards constantly."
good,".preparation the work allocation based on daily, weekly and monthly basis "
good,"Empresa é boa, não tenho do que reclamar, porém é uma vaga temporária que não há possibilidade para efetivação."
good,My typical day includes coaching billing service representatives in helping beneficiaries as they call in.  I have learned all about the Tricare program.  My co-workers and I interact daily to ensure we are maximizing the enrollment and billing process to limit the number of errors to the beneficiary.  The hardest part of my job is working with management to understand the processes and how some departments are causing billing issues with beneficiaries.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team members to help the learn the billing processes.
good,"Analiso notas fiscais de órteses prótese materiais especiais OPME,atendimento aos fornecedores e resolver problemas de notas fiscais pendentes."
good,um lugar que contribui para o meu crescimento profissional
good,I am able to be a part of strong company that is continously growing and implementing complex tasks in order to optimize efficiency.
good,"Compensation and benefits package were very fair if not above par. Management left something to be desired (went through 3 managers in the time I was there). Everyone is quick to point out something minor you've done wrong but are unwilling to correct procedure to ensure the same problem doesn't happen to someone else. They are quick to take your ideas and present them as their own once the stuff hits the fan. Co-workers in general are very nice but beware of the management with their own twisted agenda."
good,"Medsynergies, Inc is striving to stream line the medical billing process to insure quality health care for doctors and patients."
good,"Great place to work, can be stressful at times. Opportunity for advancement and tuition reimbursement. The more education you have the further you will go with this company"
good,"dias de trabalhos comuns sem nenhuma surpresa, sempre os mesmos trabalhos sem dinamismo."
good,"Uma boa empresa, meu coordenador era ótimo, sai por motivo de corte na empresa."
good,The job is only temporary when the company moved to a new site and needed a person to guide the clients from the old office.
good,Nice people and great experience. work environment was great and the owners were very nice to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"As point of contact for overall day-to-day issues and servicing, I manage the client accounts by making sure the clients benefits are setup with thier true intent. Research and resolve problems, add memeber/group information and prior authorization in the system to allow them to obtain their prescriptions."
good,There is a one year waiting period before applying for new positions. There is almost no way to get tuition reimbursement as the course must benefit you in your current position. If I wanted to just work in customer service for the rest of my life I wouldn't need to attend college. Benefits are great if you don't get sick often (health insurance plans aren't the best) but leaves of absence are pain free and all benefits begin the first day of the month after you're hired.
good,UHC was moving out of the area which prompted me to accept another position.
good,Nesta empresa aprendi mais sobre minha área de formação e com essas informações poderei propagar o conhecimento pelo mundo financeiro mercadológico.
good,"Great benefits, opportunity for advancement.This is a fortune 500 company with great benefits and an awesome management team."
good,"providing service and resolving customer/client and provider issues was great satisfaction, learned indepth aspects of health insurance, coverage, benefits, local management was very frustrating, corporate seemed unable to identify with their employees, met some great people and still have contact with some"
good,"When I started working for this company it was Harrington Health and we were contracted out through Fiserv and I loved working there, but we lost our contract and United Healthcare picked us up. United Healthcare started layoffs and it just went down hill from there. We had to start working longer hours to try and help other cities get caught up on claims and other projects. So as far as benefits, it is a great company but they not much for caring about thier employees or being stable, at least not the office I worked for."
good,Most of the positions are now remote. Education is important for advancement. Family friendly working environment. Mainstream technology available.  All resources are based online.
good,I really have nothing to say about it the job was cool they just really didn't take the time and work with you once you got on the call center floor. They expected you to get it down automatically after a few days.
good,"Ask questions before taking positions, annual salary’s, bonus structure, vacation, pto, job training, job advancement, flexibility in weather related  occurrences . Etc."
good,Great people to work with. Plenty of learning opportunities. good workplace culture and great environment. The company likes to give back to the community through volunteer events.
good,"Change happens quickly at UHC. We are laser focused on making healthcare affordable. While this vision is clear, it’s not always clear how teams fit into fulfilling that vision. UHC has a lot of work to do to improve change management and building trust with employees. Despite this, it’s a great place to learn/grow and work with talented, smart people all over the world."
good,Great place to work if you can handle the instability.  They’re very supportive of the virtual environment and push work/life balance although they don’t always stick to it  too many layoffs
good,"I have learned a lot in this company."
good,The work place is really nice one can plan working for long time but has to be self motivated. So being techi and dynamic is what going to help anyone to grow here
good,UHC was a good company to work for when LTSS was in Iowa. The pay was generous and the managment team was very helpful and nice. My office was home based which was nice. Hours were scheduled M-F 8am to 5pm but the company was very flexible within reason.
good,"I have had an overall good experience in my short time with the company. UHG is always growing, and is a giant in the market. The key is building relationships, and finding the right path to continued growth."
good,"It's a good company overall. And there is a lot of opportunities. However, like most companies they have their own difficulties. But the support staff is great, and management usually supportive. However, sometimes I feel Leadership is a little out of touch with the day to day struggles.  Pay is good but work life balance is challenging."
good,"Cutting edge training material, I felt prepared for my job as a sales agent. They like to keep the sales floor energetic. Would love to work directly for them"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A typical day at United is very rewarding.  If you're fortunate, you are able to work remote most, if not all of the time. The people are great as well."
good,"Pros: Telecommute positions"
good,A typical work day consisted of taking outbound calls from providers initially and subsequently taking calls from members.  I then transitioned to a sales position within the company.
good,A good place to work if you want to grow your career and you are passionate about healthcare and improving the system.  Some opportunities allow you to telecommute which is big plus.
good,I enjoyed working here. It was time for myself to venture out for more jobs. I did very well I processed  high dollar claims. It was very interesting to do so the odds and ins of all the different varieties of processing.
good,"Good company.  Fortune top 6, strong financials, strong leadership, great team members, managers, work/life balance, lots of PTO and holidays, telecommuting."
good,The culture seems to be strong especially in comparison to other large companies in the space. Still relatively new but overall like the company.  Do not have other feedback at this time.
good,"fast paced work environment, management team are very supportive. The job can be very stressful at times. Opportunity for growth with the right work ethics."
good,"The supervisor was very empathetic toward the agents."
good,Worked for UHG for over 31 years. The skills I have were obtained through my work experience. Internal opportunities to post for new jobs is abundant. Pay over the years could have been better.
good,You get your 2 breaks and one lunch. Take calls for 8 hrs. Help callers get into the plan of their own needs. Make sure you provide great service and hassle free experience.
good,"Very disappointed about being laid off, really loved this role! The case loads varied but overall were very reasonable. Managers were supportive and down to earth."
good,"Good company to work for and gives you a rewarding experience. Somewhat hard to get your foot in the door but once you're in, opportunities are limitless."
good,"I have seen other reviews that speak about the work silos that exist at UHG.  They were right- you cannot apply one  person's experience across the whole company. I liked the company and their message.  Senior leadership was very impressive.  The individual team experience was not as good. There wasn't a lot of variety in day to day work and little opportunity to collaborate with other teams/employees.  It was fine- not exciting, not thrilling but you knew what you would be doing when you got up in the morning. Moving between departments was harder than I had hoped, so I ended up leaving.  I would be willing to go back, just in a different area."
good,"Good opportunity internally which will helpful in various ways. "
good,"It's great pay. Fast pace. Most supervisors are amazing but some have the napoleon complex. Meaning, they think they're are better then you and make you feel inferior when you're asking for help."
good,I didn't work here. It was great to go through the interview process but the salary range was not working out for me. I need something with different hours and a better salary range.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I loved my time there. Very professional company and atmosphere and right next to my home, lol. The company is working to have home agents soon and I would love to apply them."
good,Wasn’t fond of serving members with insurance questions mixed in with medical matters.  “One stop shop” didn’t work for me. Time was continually monitored right down to the minute.  Structured like the military.
good,"United Health Group is a world-class enterprise that thoroughly prepares you to go into the field and excel at your appointed position.  As a Medicare rep., I was very successful at achieving my goals."
good,behavior health coverage. the culture is very diverse and fun and a great place to work. the management team is great and always have opportunities to grow
good,Optum provides a flexible schedule for its employees and also some benefits. Good work is appreciated by leadership and is a constant motivation to do better.
good,I enjoyed the benefits and the environment of this company. It would be a great pleasure to be apart of the company again. I am hoping to find employment in Nevada and relocate. It would be with great pleasure if United Health was the employer to reach oht and accept me prior to my relocating.
good,I enjoyed telecommuting work. I had freedom of being creative. I wish I had more advanced training such as 6 sigma lean process. I did not like the job security and layoffs.
good,UHG was a great place to work for 15 years until unfortunately being laid off.  I was promoted within the company 4 times and loved how they promoted from within.
good,"Depending on the position, you may be micro-managed. "
good,"United healthcare was a good company aside from the internal management. Times where I was due a raise, they found every reason not to give it to me.."
good,"I was there for 4 years."
good,"Very family friendly, Flexible, Not much guidance, Pressure: expectation is to do work of, at least, two employees, Compensation below market, Fair benefits."
good,"Will have two way cab that's it.. Targets to reach,, quality maintenance is important.. "
good,Business at UnitedHealth Group is in constant motion - planning for and changing to meet the business needs for the shareholders and the people served.
good,"its a very growing company with great benefits flexible hours i have enjoyed my time here, although some changes could be made to employees  including bathrooms breaks"
good,Good to be part of this company. Modernization lacking. Should encourage the existing employees and give ample opportunities to grow. Management should be monitored regularly
good,It was a very fast pace environment. Daily duties known and well trained. We had optional overtime on weekends and was notified if we had mandatory. People was nice there.
good,You would think that a company specializing in health care would provide excellent health care. I sell better policies to customers then what my health care is. That just doesn't seem right to me. Other then that UHC is an excellent company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Training is intense, a lot of information to obtain in a short period of time.  There is a lot of tests to get you prepared to be on the phones.  Training should be a little longer."
good,"I was a part of an awesome team. The work was challenging and very rewarding. "
good,"I witnessed multiple times new high paying depts. Open up for in house advancement, to only see the dept get fired as a whole within months."
good,"Great place to work, very professional great technology and amazing benefits for employees.  They are very fair with compensations and days off,sick days."
good,Involved in day to day production activities. Developed internal and external Interfaces to send the data at regular intervals to Data warehouse systems. Extensively used Power Center to design multiple mappings with embedded business logic. Involved in the discussion of user and business requirements with the business team.
good,"scripted phone calls sales focus"
good,The only thing consistent is change.  You must be able to adapt to change quickly refocus or regroup and get back in the game. The company is great for growth opportunities.
good,"Great place to assist elderly, intellectually challenged individuals get their healthcare needs addressed. Room for advancement and on the job training"
good,"very nice place to work, excellent management. good co.-workers very respectful with the employees, my job was easy without a lot of stress"
good,United health was an awesome place to work. Flexible schedules and you can work according to your schedule. Satisfying and productive work. Great pay and benefits
good,It is a very nice company don't get me wrong nice people beautiful offices . It had many aspects of the job that I liked at some point I was assigned to a new manager and that where it went down hill unfortunately. Since my first supervisor was so great so much patient and I have learned so much from her really too bad that it happens that way.
good,I really liked the job at first but had a horrible supervisor that really didn’t like me. But hey I was there to do my job and I did it well and exceed what she thought I could do. This job is stressful because you’re dealing with members that are sickly. I really enjoyed majority of my members that called in. You’ll meet some really nice upper management as well as make life long friendships.
good,"Um ótimo ambiente, bons valores e remuneração adequada, a grande expansão talvez esteja deixando um pouco o cuidado com a boa cultura."
good,Heavily focuses on quality and performance. Little job security due to the nature of a contract position - based on business need. Most full-time employees work remotely from home.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company. The work is fast paced but as long as you keep up with the training that is offered before you go to the floor , you should be fine. They are very customer oriented and will give you  everything you need so that you can do your job correctly and efficiently. Only thing I did not like was they will call you during your scheduled shift to make sure you follow all of the phone procedure as well as the computer procedure for looking things up and grade your performance to make sure you were doing your job to  the best of your ability."
good,It is in a call center environment everything goes based off of quality scores. They train you in additional skills but don't add any pay incentives. The hardest part is the constant changes. Overall if you like being on the phone all day this is a great job for you.
good,"There appears to be a great deal of effort being made to establish an Agile and DevOps culture.  However, they are management top heavy and the multiple layers of managers have their own agendas.  The result is mixed messages, continual fire drills (as it were) and a considerable amount of managing up the line to expectations rather than championing principles and productivity."
good,You have to work through a agency before you get hired on. Took 7 months to get hired. Wish got paid more. Kind of difficult to get incentive payout because metrics you have to meet are in attainable.
good,case rate was very much emphasized but i appreciated the challenge to improve and rev up my volume.  our bosses were great and provided lunch every friday which was awesome!
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,Many job postings but hard to advance. The culture is nice. You get a lot of exposure to healthcare. Great starter job if entering the industry. Wish they helped you advance
good,I was able to work for 15 years with this company. Advancement opportunites and good benefits.  More comparable salary compensation with market rates.
good,"Homecare Dimensions is a nice place to work, but there doesn't seem to be much chance for advancement. The company tries very hard to make the environment fun."
good,"I did not work for UHG, I worked for a call center by the name of Optum which was a nice place to work and things constantly changed as they normally do in a call center environment."

good,"nice people nice atmosphere, very busy atmosphere excellent training  good advancement opportunities, learned a lot of good business skills help me attain my certifacation"
good,This job was very interesting and educational.  We had team meetings and I enjoy working as a member of a team.  My manager was very upbeat and helpful.  I gained a lot of experience from this job and it was my first fulltime coding job online.
good,"Excellent company met many good people all over the country that I worked with and collaborated with for two years. I really loved the culture and was a culture ambassador, I think the company has a great future if it can only raise salaries and provide better benefits."
good,It is a great company but just was not for me. They offer great benefits and have a good management.  Just constantly being on the phones without being able to walk away to us the restroom.
good,Great company for hands on with a lot of security tools; management was having issues keeping up with staff turnovers and workload. Would not go back to work in this location.
good,"Nice people.  They have cutbacks every 6 months, and lots of meetings.  You get some opportunity to learn new things.   They are VERY security conscious.  They are always putting in new roadblocks to stop you from doing your work.  They are great on the work from home thing, but they have been moving away from that lately."
good,"Fast paced work environment, must be flexible and willing to learn.  Must be a team player and have great communication skills.  Lots of work from home opportunities."
good,This business developed me as an individual in the customer service field. I really enjoyed my position as a senior trainer. This position developed my skills at multi-tasking.
good,Is overall a great place to work but the pressure of keeping up your stats and Attendance policy is pretty strict. They do pay you while you are in training  for 3 months and offer decent health benefits and competitive pay rates
good,Great company culture but can an american Healthcare company really be allowed to work for the good of the NHS.  If they can avoid the political implications of allowing fantastic expertise in from a company like United Healthcare than the NHS could benefit but ...
good,"Fast pace call center. Overtime is mandatory in January enrollment. Multiple shifts you can choose from, over 5 clients at OKC location.  You can work from home with this company!"

good,"It is a good company. It is growing and I am thankful for the things that I have learned. A typical day at work for me included talking to patients, reviewing claims, sending corrected claims if necessary, taking credit card payments and entering notes on each account. On the Specialty side I learned a new system Script Med and I learned that no matter which side you work whether it is for Infusion or Specialty patients are important and that you have to be flexible."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Overall it is a great company. working culture is great as it offers work life balance. Leadership team is very supportive and works on developing individuals
good,They closed the office in Centennial but did provide a new job opportunity for work at home. This was a great position but a very hard to grasp. I was written up for production and eventually  termed for this reason.
good,"I am satisfied with UHS but my department FRN can use some work especially in the management department. There is a lot of favoritism and no room for advancement. I enjoy working under UHS they are really great to their employees.  I am looking to relocate to Johnson City, TN and I would love to continue to work for UHS."
good,"I've learned a lot and am glad I've had this opportunity. I would change some things, like management style but I believe it's just my territory that suffers from this."
good,"I loved working for UHC, I was terminated after being micromanaged and not given a single warning or coaching, I was just let go, even after being ranked #1 out of my work area for a long time. Very strict on their guidelines. Management is scattered. Overall, 3/5."
good,Good experience but many changed lead to layoffs for about everyone I knew. Felt like being under a microscope at times. I liked the experience very much depending on the manager. Feast of famine.
good,"decent place to work"
good,"Productive and interesting place to work. Fast paced environment, always changing. Working with a variety of clients. Fact based decision process. Work life and personal balance."
good,"I would have still been there if my manager did not micromanage for no reason, she was rude and horrible to work with. When I reached out to management regarding her behavior nothing was done."
good,"It was a decent place to work.  Air conditioned, heated, office setting.  Worked 4 days a week, 10 hour days.  I got lucky and had a nice schedule that allowed me to be off Thursday Friday and Saturdays.  That was really nice."
good,Call center life was very stressful and inflexible. Claims processing was fantastic until recent frequent shakeups and decline in available work. Flexible schedules and decent benefits.
good,This was a nice place to work. There wasn't many times that we had days off because of lack of production. There was a good work culture here. The management depending on what department you were in was nice.
good,"Meetings"
good,"It's a decent job. Pay is fair, scheduling is fair, decent benefits. Very stressful call center. Medical insurance is complicated so the training is extensive. the support network is great."
good,Work there was okay it wasn't exciting. Most you was dealing with elderly people which was bad.. some of them was very kind others was most. But overall it was fine
good,Nice company to work for other than wages.  Company’s expectations vs compensation for productivity is unfair. They do not give fair raises or bonuses.
good,"Can be stressful. Always changing."
good,"Fine. It was unfulfilling work, but it paid well. That is all I have to say. I didnt work there long enough to fill out all these requirements. Jeez Louise..."

I attended daily team ting to review new policies and procedures.  The work environment was competitive but friendly.  the hardest part of my job was to be the Command approvals back on time. The most enjoyable part of my job was the potlucks."
good,I worked for Optum which is linked with UHG. The pay was decent and I enjoyed my job. I wasn’t stuck on the phone 24/7 (only half of the day.) The other half of the day I was uploading patient charts. I worked from home which was an awesome perk!
good,"I worked there as a Contractor for a short time.  The company had very interesting events in IT, like an Inventors Day, which I thought was very exciting.  There seemed to be lots of opportunities for innovative people to shine."
good,"If you enjoy people yelling at you constantly through the other side of a phone call, then this is the job for you. If you have the patience to deal with that than you are a better person than I."
good,When you are looking to move up from the “call” side of the job it is very difficult to advance. I do love that they allow you to work from home. The goals they set are attainable
good,"Worked  for many, many years at this office in central Massachusetts until they closed in 2006. Friendly, experienced staff in a face-paced environment."
good,Excellent place to work at with competitive salary.  Great opportunities for growth.  big company located in almost all the state allows you to relocate easily.
good,A good company to work for with good benefits and friendly environment.    Enough training is not provided so you have to learn everything on your own.
good,"The people were very good to work with on a daily basis. Very helpful, always willing to answer questions and assist when needed."
good,Actually the work is very good for me. The work environment is good and people are professionals and approachable. The only thing that is keeping me from working there is the transportation from home to work.
good,"During a typical work day, we are expected to complete coding tasks remotely as we self direct our way through charts. The supervisor keeps us busy with plenty of charts she loads for us. The hardest part about the coding job is definitely the weekly tests. As a single mother, I enjoy being able to work from home. This allows me to be able to complete any overtime with little to no stress."
good,Overall a great place to work. Could do better with benefit pricing. Would like to see improvement of pay offers.Also more information on how to move up in the company.
good,"I have been employed with UHC / Optum for 12 + years it has been a great company work for. "

good,"Often times upper management were reluctant to help junior grade employees to move up in positions. There is little mentorship that occurs though out the company. Other than that, it was a good company to work for."
good,"I have worked as a Resolving Analyst, I have more than 2.5 years of experience. Competitive world with supportive team. Challenging environment to grow yourself. Allover I had a great experience in building a strong women being who can face all the challenges happily"
good,I have one of the few best bosses at UHG. But polices are always changing. One thing is if you work within 100 miles of the office you have to go in. An there is no work from home unless a wather event occurs.
good,Like most companies there is Good and Bad but you are in control on how far you you go.If you wait for direction on your career you will be waiting. Initiative is appreciated and respected.
good,"They have their own friends and family in already do not expect to be chosen by performance b/c that is going to be worse, they (management) will do anything to get rid of you by hurting your results, in a call center environment that is too easy for them, they can mess your data entry program while you are working, etc."
good,"Constant sitting, and monitoring of your call hours, extra hours were all for open enrollment time period.... it was a good job to start out but again always on the phone taking calls."
good,I learned a lot clinically and had interactions with many departments within the facilities. A lot of training is provided by the company. I was consistently given 65+ patients to care for.
good,"They have WFH , good benefits, good training. Pay was horrible for specialty agents. Even with 15 yrs experience you still couldn't get more than .50/hr sad..Companies should realize without cs agents talking all the angry calls,resolving all the mistakes, they wouldn't have anything so show gratitude and pay people what they deserve. These money greedy Corp and executives are sickening!"
good,"United Health is a very fast paced company. "
good,good place to work.  you make your own schedule and you determine how much you can make.  united healthcare is a good  company to work for and can provide you with long term money from residuals.
good,"The scheduling was unfair and not consistent. There wasn’t an fair promotion program . Enjoyed helping and speaking with the senior citizens , making sure they are placed in a plan that will cover all their needs."
good,Not much training and work life balance is different by dept.  Team environment could be better.  Many people working remotely so you spend much of the time on calls with verbal information being shared.
good,"The company benefits are amazing. Workflow you allowed to be innovative and build work relationships with providers and staff. Office politics are not professional. Management within the department do not communicate with each other, nor with their staff."
good,Consistent and productive workplace. Everyone there is friendly and courteous. Atmosphere was not fun but they did participate in a lot of non-work related events or activities.
good,There are many changes going on in the upper levels of the business and many changes have not been for the best. I hope they can go back to their values and concentrate on improving employee morale through the entire company.
good,"Company is great to work for. Just no upside for our role and within our team. Would love to continue to work for the company, but unfortunately not able to."
good,"I appreciate the opportunity to work for a company that allows work from home. I find that working from home is more productive than being in an office."
good,Generally a good place to work but there is not a lot of opportunity to advance or gain a substantial pay increase. There is opportunity for advancement but there are too many people applying and recruiters do not really understand the function and role  of the positions they are hiring for.
good,"Great atmosphere, liked the people, it took a long time to get a raise. Having access to your PTO is complicated. Too many layoffs, no job security for this employer."
good,"Once you get through the Hiring process, this is a very nice place to work. PTO, Benefits and decent management. Only drawback is that there is not a great chance of advancement once you become proficient in your current role."

good,"I worked at home in my pajamas and some days it seemed I rolled out of bed and worked until late at night and went right back to bed to get up a few hours later and do it again. I worked a lot and developed 3 ulcers due to the stress of having to constantly be pressed to work more, If not enough people volunteered then mandatory overtime was issued. Overtime time frames were supposed to last from late December to February but often lasted into September or October or would go year round. I ended up taking FMLA and still did 40 hours per week."

good,"This was my firs temporary job.  I was more a clerical assistant."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"The short period I worked there, I met some great people. It was a part time position so maybe that had something to do with it. Overall, no complaints. Work/Life balance always there."

good,"Good environment, training available, lots of travel as independent captive agent, management offers support, and opportunity is up to how hard you want to work."

good,"While it was fast-paced and dealing with high-stress issues, the people, predominantly women, were the greatest to work with. When I first started they were helpful which continued as I kept working with new issues. They made coming to work something to look forward to and I am still in touch with them to this day."

good,I joined United health care as a team member. My job was to make and take calls of our clients and agents...arranging the previous insurance health check up and home visit for HNI clients.
good,"Although the company professes an open door policy, it is debatable that it exists for all employees. If you follow the documented protocols and keep documentation on all things requested of you, you can do well and advance within the company. There is room for advancement, the company is top heavy with management.  Good opportunity with limited local growth. Change is the culture. Local leaders very good but are limited by the hierarchy. Communication silos create fire drills."
good,"great people .. busy environment............."
good,"A lot of changes have happened in the workplace culture, communication is a must and everything is communicated to the employees. As a whole the culture is great but it seems that sometimes that is not trickled down into some departments.  With that said, I love my department and the work-life balance that my manager instills, I just think that should be company wide."

good,"I would like to start with the work environment, we feel free to work here and its my first company so I got many things to learn here. working in admin is not a easy job you need to be in your tips work with all your senses open. now coming to the management its great and understanding. now coming to the difficult part is you need to know every corner of the site including its problem with the location and cause. I am learning a lot here and now its time to take a step ahead and perform my skills in a larger sector."
good,"Good opportunities to advance if you are willing to relocate and/or telecommute across USA."
good,"A typical day consists of processing, reviewing and reworking Medicaid claims. I learn something new everyday. Management is ever changing but overall I have had a good experience. UnitedHealthcare strives to stand by their culture. The hardest part of the job is not making a mistake that would be costly to the member, provider or the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I am helping our members."
good,"Backwards systems and backwards hiring process. Last role was a promotion to clinical admin coordinator, I should've stayed in claims. No clear direction, no handbook, no set rules or guidelines, yet are penalized for not adhering to unwritten rules."

The only negative I endured at this job was the ""shift bid"". There was a big possibility the shift you receive which is established by draw, will be outside your availability for  two month and then change to your availability for the next two months."
good,"Before moving out of the area, and back home.... I worked with the sales team in a support position. The sales staff, my team, and the dedicated associates that worked with us was awesome. Made it very easy to do my job."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering calls and helping providers with insurance information they needed assistance with. I learned a lot about the inter workings of insurance and how to distinguish between correct claims and claims with errors. I learned how to research thoroughly and dig deep to come to the correct conclusion in a timely fashion. There was really nothing too overly difficult in this position, but if I had to choose the hardest part of the job it would probably be when you'd have to explain to a client why a claim would be denied due to an error on our end. I would take the correct time to correct this of course. Sometimes the client really just wanted to rant, and through this job I discovered how to carefully handle these situations by giving the caller their time to express their grievances while also doing everything in my power to help and also pacify the caller all in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction I personally got by helping out those who had a hard work load all day and were expected to get things done and resolved by their medical leaders. They would sometimes call in completely distraught and being able to figure out their situation and give them understanding, friendly service would sometimes turn their whole day completely around and they'd be very grateful."

On an average typical day, I help multiple healthcare providers with insurance verifications, obtain prior authorizations, learn information about their claims, help resolve issues that they are having regarding claims and patients. I have learned a lot about medical coding and billing and learned a lot about the healthcare field. For the most part everyone I work with, management and co workers are very pleasant to work with.

good,UHG was a wonderful company to work for.  Optum management took time to understand the needs of their employees.  They were fair and decent.  UnitedHealthcare Military and Veterans leadership needs more refinement to merge with the culture of the overall organization.  The military and veterans side of the business is only focused on making money and doesn't support their staff of the people the military community they serve.  I am a military spouse and I did not receive any support during our transcontinental transition.  What was so offensive is that their leadership team is former military.  They lack of compassion and knowledge is something to be investigated at the Federal level.
good,"resolving and trouble shooting incorrectly processed claims. on a typical day I corresponded with providers, customers and management to resolve problems and update account information wile explaining member benefits and answering questions about coverage.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Depending on your department, your job security is not always guaranteed as they do “Fit for the Future” quite often, which leads to layoffs.  There are some departments thatdo not go through these  events"
good,UnitedHealth Group is a good place to work.  Very flexible work schedule.  Good benefits and vacation.  Many opportunities to move around in the company.
good,You do shift bids with people who have been there longer. In the end you get stuck on a schedule that does not work for you. Overall it is not fair when it comes to shift bids for new employees
good,Great stepping stone. Managers are nice. They value your work. Advancement is minimal. Turnover rate is high. Inbound calls are high. Phone calls are scripted.
good,"Focus was not in the correct area. They focused more on administrative than client experience. Flexibility was good,a lot of changes/updates to keep track."
good,Empresa sensacional a gerência e ótima e um bom ambiente de trabalho.
good,"I was proud to say I worked there. Plenty of opportunities to grow in the company.   Have to work there a year before promotion, usually. Employees are friendly."
good,"Job not completely different than what was told to me in the interview.  The associates were all about themselves.  Did not like this company from the first day.   Work schedule was not reasonable, management was not for the workers."
good,"i was very happy to go to  work everyday, my manager was building new  brand generic Algorithm report. i was told by by boss that he has not teach , and am the first to join the team. the hardest part of the job was the i was not thought  or teach me the job because they did not know how."
good,The organization is huge. That unavoidably brings a degree of bureaucracy and impersonalness. Also there is a lot of offshore IT. That brings communications and working hour challenges.
good,My managers and supervisors were available to answer our questions. The welcome/boarding process was smooth and supportive. The management team was knowledgeable.
good,"Nice place to work, liked working other team members. Management was supportive with team's ability to manage time effectively and execute and deliver to sub portfolio stakeholder expectations."
good,Management and leadership is not the best and do have the employee's best interest in mind. Huge turn around for employees that are constantly being let go with no explanation due to them being temp employees.
good,"A very fast paced environment.  Most education is online which is somewhat frustrating. The culture is all inclusive and diverse. Volunteering in the community is promoted. They donate a lot to the community, including food and clothing.  Member benefits are very good."
good,"It is a great atmosphere to work in and overall a great company to work with if you have the right manager. The dress code is casual, jeans are allowed but without holes, rips and excessive fading."
good,"Recent leadership changes led to job eliminations for a lot of employees.  Everyone worked together, senior leaders listened to the employees.   Recent decisions to make change were not well thought out"
good,Very mentally draining it is nearly impossible to work and continue your education. Great first job to make good money and feel apart of something. Mangers and team is great.
good,"Making healthcare more affordable and available to everyone. Difficult to get promoted from within depending on your manager, department and grade level"
good,All work and no play. But you have the job security if you are good at your job. Work from home opportunity is great there. Supervisors keep changing for the teams.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Was beneficial to my career and a good company overall to be employed by.  Flexible work hours, opportunity to work remote, or in an office setting by choice."
good,"Great place to work, however, management is unfair and biased.  Difficult to advance unless you know someone.  This is a great company to work for when starting new as a NP."
good,UnitedHealth Group is a strong organization that is doing very well in the healthcare space.  They have a very high quality of IT professionals working within the organization.
good,It is an okay place to work if you don't mind low pay and micro management. Overall it is a great place to work and the culture is good. There is always a lot to do and the people are great.
good,"Great company with great talent.  Need more of a mentorship program for employees Management needs to provide equal time, opportunity and resources on each direct report"
good,"Good place to start a career."
good,"I started working for UHG 4 years ago and since first day I committed myself to learn this complexed intresting industry. United Health Care is a positivitie, fast paced strong company that is trying to change the lives of its members in a very positive way. I’m grateful to work at UHC, but I want to progress and move up. It doesn’t seem that my company gives me opportunities to do so."
good,I had the opportunity to learn and grow within UHG and was promoted from within on 3 separate occasions. There were opportunities within other areas of the business that you were supported to learn about and apply for.
good,United Healthcare is good company to work far and many of the employees have been with them for 20 + years.  The company values work life balance.  You have the opportunity to enhance your skills and grow in your position.
good,"This was a great job, Management Alana is amazing, but the computer system I had kept having glitches. I liked that we were not micro-manged and the leads were very nice. We had a very big cafeteria and received a lot of overtime."
good,Lots of troubleshooting  lots of learning  good freedom to do what needs to be done  nice people  a bit of politics  lots of work to change old ways of doing things but overall movement to become more up to date
good,Great opportunity to work from home for the beginning.  I was asked to drive to Greensboro which was two hours each way to work and I was an hourly employee with a 10-year-old at home and a single mom. It was very stressful. I spent a lot of time in the car.
good,"•	Handle medical benefit consent checklist & payment arrangements"
good,"I honestly started out LOVING the company. It was so different and seemed so cultured, clean, and innovative. Overtime, I've just simply come to grow apart from the company. We need more and more help and it just adds to the stress level of the job when you're constantly having to clean up someone else's mess and being yelled. OF course, that's with any customer service job, but the stress added by management doesn't help. I would still recommend and I'm still looking to hang in there because overall it's one of the better jobs that I've had."
good,I am a telecommuter working from home.  My day consists of problem-solving issues that are presented to me. I have multiple meetings scheduled a day with different level of management.
good,Overall I did enjoy my experience here however with any call center the schedule doesnt always work for you. Not very fast pace din my department but it was always fun. I would recommend.
good,Very aggressive growth plans.  Collaborative spirit across multiple technology teams.  Can ve highly stressful and demanding depending on position and time of year.
good,This was a great opportunity to for a career change that allowed me to get  a variety of different skills that helped me to advance my career that would best utilize my skill set.
good,"UHC was a great company to work for.  Like all call centers it has its ups and downs but I was glad to be apart of a great team and a great sales environment.  A lot of being on the phone, working leads and campaigns and trying to close the sale."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,it is a fast pace job. You have to be compassionate with the members and  very good listener to their needs. I have joyed my role with the company. and I have enjoyed working with my Team Lead who will keep up with the latest updates.
good,If you can get a decent manager you’re through half the battle. Most positions are work from home which is priceless these days but the ay was actually cool as well. Management leaves a bad taste in your mouth but the work is not bad.
good,"The company itself is ok, except for the insecure supervisors! Who micro managed, make up lies about why you can't get a raise, and for giving occurence for being out sick."
good,"very stressful and not much time to move around, tied to your desk even with memos stating sitting at your desk all day is harmful to your health..  there were no health club benefits to counteract sitting all day.  Managers were caring but the company at the Eau Claire site were not.  Met a lot of good people working here and liked that I could work from home and did not have to travel in winter to work."
good,"Very friendly and easy to work for, work at home after training and approval on a Government contract, all equipment required issued for working at home"
good,You gain a wealth of knowledge in the position. Performance is a must as pay increases and job promotions are based on meeting and exceeding metric goals.
good,This company is ok to work for. I wish they would give people more opportunities based on their performance and not their affiliation. Also I wish they would pay a little more.
good,Always has career resources and job openings in other department. They're are a lot of opportunities and community engagement. They offer an excellent 401k. I love working from home.
good,"Decisions made to save money not to earn money. Let good people go and brought in less expensive less experienced personnel. If department doing well, cut headcount so employees feel overworked and beat up"
good,"Nice, clean, and a very productive place to work for and good experience in healthcare environment, but no security on keeping jobs for long period of time because we're mostly contractors from different agencies. I would have love to work with UHC again if there's another chance :)"
good,"Growth is limited as its captive organization. Onshore opportunities are available but, based on management's decision."
good,"It’s a great place for work. The benefits aren’t the greatest but management is top notch, at least those who work in Pharmacy’s SIU. They promote innovation, teamwork, and self-care. They care about their team members."
good,"Too many changes.  Doing same work as social workers for less pay. Too many people dissatified with changes moving to other positions, but positions that are left t aren't filled quick enough. So more work for those who are left."
good,"I would say the experiences that I felt and was subjected to had I truly not been lied to about a company who cares for their employees and such a tight knit culture, I would never agreed to work there. Their Leadership at Optumrx was a complete joke for the most part. Individuals was promoted into leadership roles such as supervisors that I feel should not have been there, a 5 year could run a place better. Their policy and made up rules were absurd. Every supervisor which I never understood working under the same company, all of them, did something different, therefore, leaving the agent most times puzzled and confused. Some of the policies were unfair and not consistently enforced equally upon every employee, I witness first hand employees getting away with murder, probably because their mother was a manager while others were watched and critique to death, literally had every aspect of their work nit picked. To add insult to injury, how can a supervisor on one hand give you a good annual evaluation with a pay increase and then recommend and promote you with a second pay increase and then all of sudden let you go indicating you violated a company rule that never was discussed with you, no prior write ups, corrective actions, PIPS, warnings nothing. Double standard was also a huge problem with this company."
good,UHG offers good comparable pay but unfortunately it offers bad insurance benefits even though we work for UHC and for the most part management needs improvement.
good,I worked there for 5 years the moment I went to claims it was like I was placed there to sabotage myself I asked to be put back in customer service where I did much better and the refused..
good,United Health offers a lot of benefits to employees and the work is dependable/consistent. There isn't room for growth where I was and the management needed more managerial training. Overall good.
good,Decline to respond to this question at this time.  I do not feel as though my response would be helpful or informative at this particular point in time.
good,it is the main place to work and this is the matter that I would like to make the time for the job and i dont like th hob and the end of the time forward cool.
good,"great place to work, especially if you get the opportunity to work from home. management is not the best but it is always what you make of it. if you are on top of your work then you will be fine."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It's a fine job! I enjoyed working there for the time I was thee. I was provided a better opportunity and decided to take it. That's why I left, otherwise I would have stayed."
good,Great place to work.  They pay really well but change happens rapidly.  The company has great partnership discounts and the benefits are great as well.
good,"Empresa que se preocupava com funcionários, vários benefícios, adora trabalhar lá."
good,"Ness atual empresa, pude desenvolver melhor minha habilidade de comunicação, e interação entre as equipes."
good,They don't really give you much opportunity on job positions. They are constantly pushing for production and quality. Also not allowed to ask questions of other team members. Concentrate on production and quality not very team oriented.
good,"This company is huge, yet your role will be highly silo'd. They have the capability to be great, but best practices sharing is minimal. Also YOU WILL spend the majority of your time on conference calls talking about things vs actually doing them, which is frustrating. "
good,I don't have anything to review. Company was good. I simply did not offer me the medical benefit i needed. I does not support the weigh loss health support i needed.
good,"Great place to work, attendance policy sucks. Pros are"
good,"Good company, lost of changes for policies , work from home. Schedules are flexible, meetings often to make you aware of ploicy nd company changes . I loved both of my supervisors."
good,A good organisation to start as a fresher and better place to work  environment and other good facilities like free transport for both pickup and drop.
good,Even though we had stressful weekdays and sometimes weekends as well at work we were given extra amount of rewards for the weekend work. The management was work oriented I have learned to handle a typical stressful day at work .
good,"Company is fast paced, if you don't keep up you will get buried and work and work-life balance is gone. They offer training to help improve their workforce."
good,"For a call center, the environment is comparatively relaxed."
good,"The call center is high volume. Managers are inclined to help associates achieve quarterly goals. Merit based performance incentives. Lots of opportunity for growth,"
good,"Perfect company to work from home, increase my work skills and work both as a team and independently. Great pay and benefits. Wonderful opportunity to network with providers and members."
good,Good and collaborative work environment. Allowed me to work from home. Decent pay but not enough for the San Diego area. I would recommend the company overall.
good,Love what I do just wasn’t permanent . Pay wasn’t enough for the amount of work done but pretty good compared to work for other companies. Would recommend uhc great company if permanent position.
good,"While working at United HealthGroup, I have been able to work with many great people and for an everchanging administration. "
good,"Training and Mentoring employees to meet Customer Expectation."
good,"I really enjoyed the job, but too much drama and management tended to ignore or play favoritism. I stayed out of the drama and minded my  business but they would bring it to the floor"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"This job is very physical, and you must be able to stand for long periods of time and also lift light weight boxes. There was possibly opportunities for movement."
good,Após ser vendida para a United Health passou a ser somente mais uma empresa a tratar os funcionários como números e metas.
good,"I worked there for exactly 1 year with a contract. I started a 7am and ended my day at 5 with a 1 hour lunch and 2 coffee breaks. We worked in cubicles and management would come see each person on their team every morning to check in and see how they are doing. The hardest part of the job is getting through the initial training and the most enjoyable part is the rest once you have ""graduated"" through training."
good,UnitedHealthcare has done a great deal of work specific to Culture.  This ensures that individuals are accountable for performance yet keeps the Customer always in the forefront.  Building relationships across departments is also important so everyone is working towards the same goal.
good,United was transforming to an Agile model and was not going very well. Then new leadership came in and decided we had about 30% to many people in my department and laid 30% off including me.
good,The company provides security to be able to have a stable job. I only wish the pay was more for the work you do. The vacation time is more than what most companies provide.
good,"It starts off great until about an hour in when a lot of horseplay and loud talking starts and you cant hear your calls well,but you adjust focus and get to helping customers which is the best part of the job which is providing them with valuable info about their plan. The worst part is informing the the customer you not be able to help them with problem due to finances.So you try and talk to supervisor. to see if there is anything we can do to assist the customer and they you do worry about it just to get to the next call and they dont try and truly help the customer its only a numbers game and their team having the best AHT etc............"
good,Outside of management the atmosphere was very welcoming and staff was helpful when you may have questions or not sure of information pertaining to the information provided to the providers
good,"United Healthcare is an excellent place to work, with a great work environment. I was happy to see smiling faces every morning with a great work edict. I worked in two departments in my almost 8 years with United Health Care. Enrollment and the Credentialing department. In both i learned a lot about the medical field and its terminology."
good,sit at a desk and take phone calls. nothing else needs to be added but im required to write this stuff to help indeed tell people about this place. have a nice day.
good,Great company to work for and definitely challenges you on a day to day basis.  Great people work in a matrixed environment in order to deliver on strategic initiatives
good,Answering incoming calls from providers & members in reference to behavioral health benefits and or claims. Working from home is convenient when the weather is bad
good,The most enjoyable part of working with UnitedHealth Group was knowing you are making a difference in peoples lives by assisting with their access to Healthcare within the U.S.
good,Licensed insurance agent selling medicare products. Happy with the fast paced environment. Salary is competitive.  Would rather work for the actual company
good,"Keep up with your productivity and all will be well! There are several resources available to employees, contract or full time that are meant to help you succeed."
good,"lots of inconsistency "
good,A typical day with UHG entails conversing with patients or healthcare professionals in regards to there medications. All while keeping in mind you have others listening to you and grading your performance. Which is known as the Quality Score. The training environment was a very fun environment.
good,"Golden Rule insurance was privately owned by the Rooney's.  It was a great company at that time.  I only worked under United Healthcare for a short time.  I feel United Healthcare was a fair company and the wages are competitive.  United Healthcare is such a big company compared to Golden Rule.  I missed the company being privately owned and the perks that came along with that such as Christmas Parties, Christmas dances and knowing the owners."
good,"The training was not very good, but I enjoy that we have all weekends  and holidays off. There is no physical support from managers on the floor because they work from home."
good,overall productive fast paced work environment. short breaks.....the pay wasn't all that great based off of the demographic area. management was satisfactory.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Work at home options.  pro's and con's.  Need quite to complete job.  Can get lonely.  Supportive culture, managers.  Enjoy the flexibility of working from home."
good,"The culture is good but the salary is low and the working hours high. Only night shifts but okay with shifts.managemqnt is good, but there is no carrier growth."
good,"•	Answer a high volume of calls from patients or their representative, regarding patient balances, payment plans, credit card payments, patient pricing, rebilling insurance companies and general customer concerns"
good,Steady work with great co workers. Some days are long hours to meet deadlines. Decent benefits with lots of vacation time. Compensation on the lower end of the scale.
good,The training for provider services could be much more robust and inclusive of more typical daily issues w/providers.  One call resolution is very difficult with the level of training provided currently.
good,"Good company to work for. Many areas of opportunity. Vast career options. Work life balance, flexible hours to a point. Salaries are fair. Too many different systems. Too much work done off shore"
good,We had the opportunity to work from home after the employee showed a good productivity rate. The company had the opportunity to work from different locations.
good,"I really enjoyed when i was in the academy under my contractor position once you get hired they demand more out of you, on the phone non stop too and they literally dont give you enough aux usage time. They pay is really only good during oep because they give you OT. Their micromanaging techniques are not working for the company as a whole because they dont tell everyone the same thing its always confusion and miscommunication. As far as bonues they dont really give as much back as they should. We work very hard every day. They hire the contractors at a higher rate then they do thier employees. I would say my coworkers and the managers are nice its very diverse"
good,"I worked under a company that was contracted by united healthcare. So, my experience is based off of that situation.The third party was teleperformance and they did not pay us what united healthcare actually paid. This was back in 2014."
good,"Large scope of business options and ability to advance in your career.  Decent benefits, but the compensation could be better for mid level employees.  Lots of highly skilled and intelligent people who work here."
good,"Great company, can be a little stressful. Opportunity to advance. The hardest part of the job was the competition between the various managers. Very heavy call volume and little flexibility in schedules."
good,Leader in its efforts to positively impact healthcare.  They have made great strides in their efforts to transform the healthcare system while remaining focused on the needs of the individual that they serve.
good,You dealt with people who had Questions about their coverage. that could pertain to Out of pocket Doctors or within range ( In pocket)  You had so much time to answer a call and give the customer the information that he or she needed
good,"It was a decent place to work. The culture on the floor can be toxic, though if one can abstain from making friends and remaining business minded, they can be successful."
good,"The quoting process is extremely quick pace and the processes constantly change.  Sometimes, the various departments do not communicate effectively.  However, the overall process is efficient."
good,Great work life balance in some areas. Health Benefits are horrible. Operational people area really great. Product people are always about the numbers which is probably everywhere. There are pockets of great areas in the company but also an equal amount of bad.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"UHC is a good company to work for but advancement and promotional opportunities are limited and bonuses are hard to come by ... generally everyone is very motivated, intelligent and passionate about supporting the corporate mission to improve the healthcare system for all here in the US and abroad."
good,"I feel that the company is slightly inefficient -- too many meetings, lots of re-orgs, not a great sense of purpose in day to day activities. However, the company is huge so that could be very different in a different area. "
good,Great place to learn and acquire needed knowledge to expand your skill set. Healthcare's ever changing environment promote an atmosphere of uncertainty but a company like UHG allows employee to be wrong and provide the tools to explore and correct.
good,All necessary equipment delivered for remote assignment.  IT Support was excellent.  Training videos were provided as well as PDF's of workflow processes.
good,Existem hospitais piores. Mas no geral é bom.  No setor que trabalhei não havia muita oportunidade de promoção optaram por trazer pessoas de fora e desvalorizaram os funcionários que já estavam na empresa.
good,"UHC is a great place to work, if you have a good manager. There is a lot of ""picks"" in this company, and if you're not it, they will try to get you fired. But, if you do what you're supposed to do, it won't happen."
good,"Working for this company was enjoyable. Management & coworkers were very friendly. Overall atmosphere was pleasant"
good,"UHG has a culture mandate around Integrity, Performance, Relationship, Compassion, and Innovation.  Depending on what department one is located, some items are emphasized, while some are not.  I have first-hand experience that client satisfaction is paramount to 99% of employees."
good,"...given the fact that they enjoy outsourcing a lot of the work, the lack of job security is most certainly overshadowing all other perks offered. What's the point of benefits if they're taken away and shipped to India? As long as you're in a safe role (is any really safe?) it's a great place to work. Otherwise, applicant beware. If you hear anything about outsourcing, offshore, or names like 'Cognizant,' run for your life."
good,"I liked working for Optum360. I loved the job and the people on my team. The building was awesome with a great cafeteria, gym and store. Worked from home one day a week."
good,You got help that you requested on time. Sometimes it was difficult to communicate with Managers but issues got resolved nonetheless. I would recommend this place.
good,"My manager makes the world of difference. I personally have an awesome manager but I have witnessed some questionable practices during my time with this organization. Working in a production environment is very stressful trying to maintain a certain CPH (charts per hour)level each day is draining. Each day may vary based on the work load placed in your que, or your individual circumstance(your mood, Internet speed, other factors beyond your control) however, the powers that be still demand the production be the same with no exceptions or excuses. That can create an undue stress if you're not careful. The production requirements are continuously raised on a regular bases...it's all about numbers...push, push, push, more, more, more...is the name of the game. I sometimes question the quality of the work because of the high demand for more, more, more."
good,"i worked there years ago, my last position was processing electronic claims at home.  working home missed other employees, and it made me lazy (sometimes stayed in pj's)"
good,"Description: "
good,A typical day at Productive and fun. You get opportunity to work but lots of internal politics as well. Secured place to work. The management responds to queries. Nice place to work in.
good,"I have worked here for 11 years,  and it has been a great place to learn and grow my career.  I am looking for new opportunities,  to expand my knowledge and leadership skills."
good,"While this company has offered me many ways to advance, flexible schedule, telecommute accommodations, and fantastic management - the work/life balance is ultimately what is causing me to seek outside employment. I have a generous PTO policy but I am unable to take an entire day off due to work responsibilities. With a family this is ultimately unacceptable."
good,"Salary wise, it's a great place to work. RNs are paid really well. Benefits are great except for healthcare. Cost is fairly high, you would think working for an insurance company you would get great health benefits. PTO is great, plus you get an annual bonus and a raise when you meet your metrics.But workload can be crazy. We are perpetually understaffed and the nursing staff are often working caseloads for 2 people or more on average. Turnover can be bad. It's not a job for everyone, so keeping staff is a challenge."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Aulas  para reeducação alimentar e  preparo de  pacientes para Gastroplastia. Atendimento  clínico individual para portadores de  doenças  crônicas. Direção  de fácil acesso porém com metas desafiadoras sempre  estimulando e  preparando os funcionários. Bom relacionamento entre a  equipe multidisciplinar.
good,Working for UBH was fun and demanding at the same time. The only thing I would complain about is the unrealistic expectations of upper management. Sometimes it was not always possible to wrap up a call in the amount of time they expected. It was not always possible to meet the requirements based on many factors regarding the computer system as well as the customer on the line. I think quality of care is more important than quantity.
good,I really like the job culture and the people.  I learned a lot about healthcare credentialing and how unitedhealthcare does it. Coaching and training is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Great training, They offer advancement opportunities based on training that they provide both online and face to face, They prepare you sufficiently prior to starting date,"
good,"Thankful for great opportunities for more than 20 years. For the first 15 years, life was great, had some terrific leaders to work with. As an IT resource, working as a telecommuter is a significant disadvantage in recent years. I am not interested in moving to Minnesota at this point in my life and career."
good,"Working at United Healthcare was enjoyable for the most part; I thrive in a fast pace, sometimes stressful environment .  I always tried to ""one up"" myself everyday.  Daily activities would  include answering inbound phone calls regarding patients insurance eligibility, review claims, explanation of benefits and billing questions."
good,I really liked working for the company until I got my last supervisor. in the last position I held I had 9 supervisors in the last 4 years. The company lets us to do reviews on management and the last supervisor I had got several bad reviews and had to take mandatory management classes.
good,Defect free deliverable is the highlight of my requirements. Know how to build coalitions and you might get what you need. Good when you build relationships and you may be able to drive your agenda with the support of managers.
good,"no room for advancement or growth within company. Opportunities aren't given and job security isn't dependable. Being that the company is a ""at will"" company allows them to lay off at any given time, which isn't fair to me."
good,"I have been employed with United Healthcare since 2004. I was able to work from home since October 2005. Flexible to not have to go into office. "
good,"Responsive management, good benefits - but was laid off due to downsizing so my opinion of company is not unbiased.  Enjoyed working there for a brief time."
good,This is an organization that relies heavily upon telecommuters and field workers.  It has developed excellent tools to make these types of employees successful.
good,"I loved my job as Clinical Administrative Coordinator at Optum, until they switched the job description abruptly. I enjoyed the company culture, but there was little to no room for advancement in my role, and moving on in the company was at my then supervisor's discretion. I hated that. UHG has awesome benefits and I'd recommend being an established individual with a trade, or a couple degrees to get the full advantage of working with this company."
good,"Overall, my time at UHG was very good.  I learned a great deal and gave a great deal.  I enjoyed my positions and had some very good managers/directors.  I did feel as that there was not a good work/life balance.  Many weeks I worked 60+ hours including weekends and holidays."
good,Overall a great experience but could not find opportunities for advancement as years of service accumulated. Working from home was a new experience is professional career and limited the ability network due to major offices limiting travel opportunities and bigger projects.
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar com uma boa cultura em bom ambiente de trabalho. Experiência e aprendizagem em quatro anos em gestão de Processos , com destaque para mapeamento, redesenho e follow-up de processos, propondo e implementando melhorias contínuas; assessoria aos departamentos na elaboração de seus indicadores e estruturação da gestão à vista; gestão de documentos elaborando POP’s da área; gestão de indicadores na análise de resultados e produtividade da equipe e criação de mapas de manutenção preventiva e checklist."
good,"Good place to learn office culture.If you start your career at UHC you can have many opportunities for advancement."
good,It was a nice environment but there was to much favoritism with getting ahead. I loved what I did making a difference in people lives when everything goes well and the patient is pleased.
good,"I enjoyed UHC I just needed more money. My current employer pays more but the environment and systems are not as up to date as UHC. If they went up on"
good,This position was extremely fulfilling in that it allow me develop my interpersonal skills.  It was rewarding in that it allow me to educate individuals regarding their healthcare options
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"There are few local management issues in most of the teams."
good,Working on production. They were good about just letting you do your work. People was friendly and easy to work with. Work place was enjoyable. The most enjoyable was being able to work on your own.
good,I usually take 50-60 phone calls a day from providers and members.  It can be very stressful and overwhelming at times.  Management is good and usually fair. I have a good group of team members I work with that are always willing to help each other.  It just seems almost impossible to advance within the company.
good,"UHG was a great place to work however, the positions like Claims Adjuster have such strict guidelines for daily quotas it isn't the sort of position you can keep for years at a time and nearly everyone is switch to a different department as soon as they are able (usually a year or less!). The managers are in constant flux as well and you'll have one for 3 months then another for 6 and its always a constant circus but if you can stick it out then its a great job to have with lots of benefits."
good,"started out doing professional services claim reviews, moved to precertification/UR/CM.  Management was not supportive of staff; when looking in to the high staff turnover the director asked the senior staff why they stuck around."
good,"Working at a fast-pace to meet your metrics daily."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, humanizada, receptiva. Trabalho a 2 anos, gosto muito da empresa. Porém a remuneração para a enfermagem é muito baixa."
good,An extremely large organization to work and learn and grow. Limited when it comes to personal and professional growth from what I can understand. Way to big of company to make an impact
good,"Overall, I'd rate my experience at UNH as positive.  Good people working hard to support the business.  Recent changes have moved the culture to be more collaborative but the management system is historically command and control and there is a definite youth movement."
good,The training and work environment was good.  Co-workers were great.  The stress was being in the call center and dealing with people trying to understand their insurance benefits.
good,A typically day is answering outbound calls that never stop coming. The mbrs were rude. I worked in M&R  department so all of my members were 65 and over. This job gives you many different hats but do not want to pay
good,"provides a small gym, putting green and video game room. inbound call center. high call volume. casual days are Fridays. the rest of the week is business casual ."
good,"This company is great to work for.. once you work up from the bottom level.  Entry level positions are extremely demanding, and micro-managed to an unhealthy level.  If you can stick it out, have talent, and are driven, this could be a great company to work for."
good,"If you are entrepreneurial & innovative, you will love working for United Healthcare. They are on top of their game & leading the industry."
good,"Nice People. Good Team Coordination all the way. The management is co- operative, Things can be bit slow some times going through the long chain of process."
good,"The pay can be competitive, and the work isn't overly difficult depending on the department. There is room to jump to different departments. The benefits are lacking considering you work for the insurance company."
good,"UnitedHealth Group is an excellent company. I have been insured by this company for years. "
good,A empresa amil é uma empresa dinâmica aonde pensa no funcionário pensando a sua saúde e no crescimento de trabalho.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"it was a call center, which at the time they did not call it a call center/ now the do.  you are non stop on the phone with no time to process claims."
good,Call Center work with some optional and some Mandatory OT.  Pays better than most call centers.  They like to keep employees and hire most from referrals.
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere at the Teletech building.
good,"UnitedHealth Group, now known as Optum Global Solutions is a stable and well-known company known internaonally. It is one of the leading Clinical and Business Process Outsourcing in the world."
good,They were very supportive to the agent and always make sure they kept supplied with the tools we needed. I always enjoyed going to work.The growth and development really enhanced my ability to perform.
good,A good performer can do very well here. One must reconcile the profit-driven motives of a large insurer with humanity. Profit motive overtake the senior level executive resulting in ridiculous compensation while lower level employees make much less. All of this is done on the backs of providers and patients who suffer from this.
good,mixed med/surg pediatric floor. OBGYN surgical patient typical for flood. Low acuity pediatric population. 1 NA for 10-12 patients. 1:5 nurse:patient ratio.
good,"Restricted on call time"
good,Fun atmosphere but some departments suffered by poor management and direction which caused the company to lose a major client resulting in multiple job displacements
good,"I liked working for this employer, If this employer takes employees health concerns more into consideration this job would be more successful. This is just one thing I believe that can improve. Overall the managers try to work with employees the best they can despite what corporate wants."
good,Broad learning experience; new systems onboarding and an opportunity to develop new skillsets.  Company is large as provides opportunity to further develop your carreer.
good,This is a good place to work. Stable working environment. I have learned many skills throughout my years. They have flexible hours and willing to work with you.
good,"UHG is a good company for new graduates entering into the work force as a professional for the first time.  There are good benefit package offered."
good,"acquiring multiple sub companies under UHG, UHG was ill-equipped to handle and adapt these companies and their member/client base into UHG's own brand, bringing in interruptions and delays for current and new member/client base."
good,"Great place to start working. Lots of opportunities, but must be willing to move up positions every year to make any sort of money. This company is great for someone who likes chamge because they are constantly updating everything to make it better for members."
good,"We were bought out by CHI and laid off, but the job was great and I enjoyed the people I worked with. Was able to move up in the company, and looked forward to growing with the company."
good,It is a very stressful job and not really much growth for advance. The raise is annually but very workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is learning everything about the policy because training is only a guideline to what you need to know on the floor.
good,We would take calls for members who belong to specific health care plans. They would call in and we would assist them with the Pharmacy aspect of the insurance.
good,The company overall cares for their employees during the Hurricane they donated supplies and sent a lot of help to those in need.  Management does not take much interest in career advancement which means as far as advancing in the company you're on your own.
good,"My job as a HouseCall nurse practitioner involved working alone for the most part.  "
good,"Building in Hartford is clean and well kept, each floor has a break room with refrigerator and TV,  Not much time to take a real lunch break tho."
good,"Optum is a branch of United Health Care, and they closed down the program I was hired for.  Great to work remotely from home, but there was zero job security and they decided to close the program. I enjoyed working for Optum, and truly enjoyed my manager. There was work/life balance when I did work for Optum."
good,Local moderno e com excelentes materiais de trabalho.
good,UHG/Optum is currently going through budget cuts and downsizing affecting its IT workforce. Several development projects are being shelved or shutdown. This makes employment there somewhat of a risk.
good,"Realizava analises contratuais entre Hospitais do Grupo e Operadoras de Plano de Saúde."
good,I learned a lot about my abilities and what I really want to do with my life. This company has amazing programs and incentives but to benefit you have to be in it to win it. Stay to your self and when it's your time to shine take it humbly.
good,Customer service representative. Resolve complex insurance questions when receiving incoming and out going  calls. The daily task was to make sure the customer was happy after getting assistance with any insurance issues.
good,Job isnt hard or challenging. The schedules are really the only bad part of the job. You have to work at least one weekend day every weekend. The chances of you having two in a row are slim.
good,UnitedHealth care as a company provides an opportunity for the employees to grow along with the organization. It offers many learning programs which can opt simultaneously while working. It provides equal opportunities for every employees.
good,"On a typical work day, it is always hectic at the beginning. Trying to get everyone between shift change triage and to be put in a room.  If it wasn't for my night crew teammates, it wold be hard. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with change"
good,"Great company to work for, I would recommend this company to anyone looking to work for a fortune 500 company. There are opportunities for you to move up and they are big on education for their staff"
good,I worked for the company for about 5 years. The overall experience was decent. They got cool perks for the FTEs in terms of the ESPP or 401 or the amazing PTOs and I loved the flexibility that my team offered though its been changing company wide now due to the Agile thing but very bad team politics in many teams that you got to look out for!! Beware if you cant cope up in such an environment.
good,"It's Good and development company . I faced challenges while learning the job sources. however, I overcome the challenges and learned the work very quickly and hit the production.Supportaive management . Learned how to work under pressure."
good,"The administration of healthcare is kind of a mess right now. United Healthcare offers so many different plan types, that they're finding it very hard to administer them all correctly. Customer Service reps are constantly giving out incorrect information because of this. My job description has increased theee fold since I started there last year. Like all companies, they're trying to do so much more with fewer people."
good,Empresa renomada no seu setor de mercado . Oferecendo ótima experiência aos funcionários.
good,its an totally health care industry so i want to build my career in finance side so i am looking to job change so that it may lead to grow my carrer path.
good,"Good, place to work.  Telecommuting positions are available in many cases.  A lot of flexibility in hours you can work.  They train you well & you will be confident before you start working on your own."
good,"Good company,a lot of the management are very you and could use some training on people skills. The lunch is only 30  minutes, so you don't have enough time to stand in line and eat your food, because everyone goes at the same time."
good,"A great place  to start you career. Wonderful benefits, great place to advance. Many offices around the world. The company is growing fast. New offices have opened up in the pass couple of years."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"UHG is a very good place to learn as a fresher because of the diverse nature of projects, technologies and teams. You get to work with customers directly and if you demonstrate your performance you'll get roles and responsibilities reflecting that. "
good,"I Spoke with people all across the US. Listened to story's, Also helped people with there health care. It was such a great experience it was just a temporary position."
good,The pay is competitive and the work-life balance is manageable. The workplace culture is inclusive. I learned a lot about managed care.
good,"I am an extremely hard-working, dedicated, punctual, and organized person who applies the whole of my abilities to every task set before me. I am well versed in the medical field and take complicated issues as a challenge, rather than a burden. I am a team player who is willing and able to play an integral role as an operations manager, ensuring the funneling of productivity and efficiency. I am positive and upbeat and work well under pressure."
good,"Empresa agitada, em constantes mudanças, todavia me identifico pois gosto do novo. Aprendi muito em todo esse tempo e continuo aprendendo diariamente. Boa equipe e fiz grandes amigos na empresa como um todo. Falta definição de muitos processo o que torna o trabalho um pouco difícil, contudo permite desenvolvimento, resiliência e outros"
good,The work is good but the benefit packages are awful.  We work for an insurance company and cant get good benefit.    This job is good if you want to go to college for they will work with your schedule.
good,"Great company to work for. The benefits, management, and room for growth within the organization are it's only downfalls."
good,This is a very good place to start if you are new to the Insurance Industry.  It is seasonal for Open Enrollment for Medicare.  Middle Management is very unorganized and really doesn't manage and develop the people that are under them.
good,I worked with a great group of people we had to combine departments and with the changes that happen everyone handled the change very professionally. I really enjoyed the team i worked with.
good,"This rating only applies to Optum. Great learning experience. However, I found this particular branch not equitable in terms of career growth. Only certain groups advance."
good,"Would love to work for them again but of course under new management. Loved what I did. Loved all my previous supervisors, team lead and managers."
good,Enjoyed talking with patients and helping them improve their health. Had quotas that we needed to meet. Able to take CEU classes through the company. Had very good benefits.
good,Foi uma experiencia com grande ganho para o meu crescimento e desenvolvimento com administrativo e eventos
good,"I learned how to be more detailed oriented.  I also learned how to react to different situations, to be patient and understanding. "
good,"I think UHG does very well with encouraging employees to advancement.  The group I work with is fantastic. "
good,"It is wonderful to be able to work from home and prove that you are a great asset to the organization even when you are not being micromanaged.  It is nice to know that good, hard work gets great rewards such as being able to be at home."
good,Over all was a nice place to work. Just miss working with the customers. As most work is just on the computer and not customer services.
good,"• Verify Benefits • Obtaining authorizations • Follow ups • Taking payments • Transferring calls to correct departments • Using multiple application • Explaining billing processes • Obtaining medical documents • Walking customer through the online sites • Verify claims, receipts, and EOB's"
good,"Its a good place to work, Will have good work life balance culture. Co-workers are very supportive. Management doesnt take much action to retain employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"Company provide good work life balance. Good people and good scope of learning."
good,The company could do a better job of ensuring their employees pay is commensurate with the market rate. Employees benefits could be a lot better. What I love most about my job is that I have a lot of flexibility and can work from home as I see fit. The organization as a whole really promotes working remote.
good,"I researched information for the company so I can bring their customers' information up to date. I like my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was that I did not want to stop working when my shift was over. "
good,"I'm working 9 hours a day at night from 9pm to 6am. What I have learn the most is to get away from negative vibes and negative people and just stay positive to keep motivated and happy at work. This would also keep you to what you are working for. The management is good because aside from motivating you to go to work they would also find a way how to make people working and be happy at work initiating program that would result to camaraderie and unity."
good,"Heavy call volume, required to adhere to handle time requirements,"
good,"Great opportunity for entry level customer service and learning teamwork and healthcare rules and regulations. Management was warm and encouraging for the most part, but there was little or no opportunity to become full time or advance for contract employees."
good,"The culture is pretty good. Currently, I do not have a permanent status & they have been interviewing outside people in the department I am in verses communication openings to the 13 people of us as we were told when we began in 3/2016."
good,The atmosphere was great. I meet a lot of nice people who i plan on staying in touch with.Really enjoyed the work i was doing.Just lack on communication.
good,"The management and team I worked with were excellent, however it becomes difficult to appreciate a job when the company has to layoff  10+ pharmacist within 2 months in a 6 month contract position."
good,My experience has been very interesting. But ever learning. There is a lot that leaves you questioning the company. I enjoy the phones and assisting the callers get issues resolved.
good,"This is a great place to work. "
good,"trabalha lá foi uma experiência boa, se  eu tive uma oportunidade pra volta eu voltaria."
good,Job duties are clear and concise and do change much.  Collaboration between departments including cross function training was not experienced by me.  Educational opportunities were great but didn't seem to impact your chances for advancement.  It seemed as though employees were generally concerned with job security and were generally uninformed (almost clueless) by senior management..
good,"trabalho tranquilo,não apreeeedi nada novo , só tive oportunidade de expor os meus cnhecimentos e minhas eexperiencias foi otimo"
good,"Attractive work Environment and good facilities provided by the Company. Supervisors and Managers are very Supportive and they wanted us to grow faster."
good,"My company was a wonderful place to work. Very easy going, very personable. My manager is very understanding and listened to any issues the team may have encountered. There was sometimes favoritism between supervisors and reps, that caused some tension but not too often. Most times everyone was fair."
good,"Second time working for UHG. First time was great. Lots of benefits, education, references and support. Pay was good too."
good,"4 week orientation with home office installed & paid for by UHG."
good,"Good place to work . "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Nice working environment and well compensated benefits and allowances. The best part though is that my workmates are easy to get along with and you could definitely learn a lot from them.
good,"Job was wonderful until the merging with Optum. Then it was all about money, profit and how many calls a day that should be completed. When I originally started, it was all about the customer, the vendors and the medical community bringing them all together to provide the best healthcare possible. Now, all for profit, downsizing staff, expecting more with less."
good,"I have learned a lot working with United Healthcare Military & Veterans.  I learned about teamwork and how important I was to the mission of the company and how it effected many military veterans and their health.  I also learned how to effectively communicate with others in order to establish a great working environment so that our work would be accurate and submitted in a timely matter.  A typical day consisted of consistent data entry and attention to detail, as well as helping corresponding departments to meet company deadlines ensuring entry completion before the end of the day.  The hardest part of the job would be the excessive 20-40 hour last minute mandatory overtime to complete data entries.  As a mother, it was very difficult to setup daycare for my child while working overtime, especially on the weekends.  This made it difficult for me to have a steady work and life balance. I will say the most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork in our office.  When one person was out or needed help, everyone would come in and help out to compensate."
good,"It pays very well, but the hours given were not so hot but not too bad.. more so mid shift. I love that we have weekends off. The calls are not that busy but we do have busy days at times. Management knows nothing about the calls, but our supervisor knows alot. Management is very nice and all about their business. The hardest part is daily changes on how to handle the calls, or what job is to be called out on. The most enjoyable part is you are NOT micro managed, even though they can see your every move on the computers, but as long as you follow the schedule as closely as possible you will be fine. My coworkers are the best, everyone gets along very well. So its a good company to work for, but I hate the insurance plans we have..those are not so good. You would think since we work for them we would have better options."
good,I enjoyed working with UHC. The management staff was very personable. The pay was fair as well as the opportunityfor advancement.
good,"Facilitating 5 week new hire classes to ensure proper coverage of inbound calls filling medications.  "
good,"I liked everything about the training, the management and the work atmosphere and salesteam.  the peers were exceptional.  the pay was not as competitive as other medicare companies because it was outsourced to a company called APAC.  the bonus' and commissions were less than we were promised upon hire.  This was a temporary seasonal position. the contract ended and the call center closed.  I do appreciate UHC though, because they showed me my forte was call centers and helping seniors choose the best medicare options for their income and health needs. a very good experience overall."
good,A typical day at work is mostly only the phone. Answering about 30-60 incoming calls per day on average. Management is a bit complicated since they hired 100+ staffs at once.
good,"My typical day in the office is handling inquiries, educating consumers as well as my fellow colleagues. I enjoy every aspect of trouble shooting and resolving till a favorable solution is met. The major struggle of a days work is not coming to a resolution but knowing there is a commitment to strive for a solution. What I've learned by my management and experience was to progress and grow learning all aspects of the company as possible."
good,Lots of experience gaining company. Salary may be bigger issue in it . Night shift pressure is also there for opreation team. even
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar. Salário acima de algumas empresa, no que tange o cargo de op de tlmk e bons benefícios."
good,"This is good company to work with.provide healty plateform to work."

good,"- Setting up your work station, including all systems & tools to help you do your work efficiently, answering inbound calls to assist customer's in processing their orders, or answering questions."
good,overall the management at my site is what made my job incredible.
good,I was able to work from home with this job so that made the home to life balance easy. Mt direct Co-Workers were easy to work with on a daily bases. We learned from each other.
good,"Boa empresa para começar a vida profissional. Há momentos em que temos prazos, e outros em que temos a liberdade para terminar o trabalho. Indico para quem estiver a procura do primeiro emprego."
good,The people here are very friendly. Management could be more lilenient on accommodating lunch hours. Co-workers demostrate teamwork. The pay could be better.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,I am was super excited to work on the New part D department when it launched.  They are good at promoting from within.
good,Interesting working with my patient. Lots of different mood swing from the patient but enjoyed every moment with her.
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  Unfortunately, not many opportunities for advancement in the payment integrity division of the company and it is very difficult to transfer to another line of business.  I have enjoyed the learning experience they have provided me and my co-workers have all been great.  It operates as a team environment even though we are located all over the US.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to travel to different states.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the budget goals set by senior management."
good,"work from home under micromanagement , had frequent non job related meetings on line."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,We work hard and we take care of all employees very much. Employee Oriented company.
good,"Leader of the health insurance pack, the company invested well and has always been on the leading edge.  Management was a bit isolated, though."
good,Good work in environment and pay. Good place to learn Medicare Part D and how to enroll participants before eligibility time for one of the biggest providers. Great management team who showed you how to sale the product to the customer.
good,"UHC is a great place to work with an amazing overall culture within the company. I've learned so much while being there. The team I work with is wonderful, there is a great sense of belonging and dedication among the people I work with. Change in some departments has caused turmoil, but hasn't hindered overall morale. I really enjoy the nature of the work with which UHC is involved."
good,work as a complex case manager at home for a insurance company.
good,"consegui conquistar varias amizades"
good,"Typically I heard disgruntled employees complain about each other, their managers and many complaints about the new Director. It was an uncomfortable place to work full of suspicion and innuendo about others. Sitting where I was my desk counter seemed to be a place where people would stop to talk about one another and It made it difficult for me to work without being interrupted. Any suggestion on my part to take the conversation elsewhere was to invite me to either join in or be ridiculed."
good,A great company to work for with one exceptions some managers or not good.
good,"Work day would being with morning meeting. Then a review of any pending claims. Make call to clients to schedule an appt. Go to appt. fill out report, review.

good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I process and audit high level transplant medical claims. I use contacts, job aids (some I have assisted in writing), teammates and innate skills to get through the processes daily. My team has changed drastically over the past 2 years and I loved working with them and we became a very close family unit. The hardest part of the job is trying to get new management to understand exactly what we have done the past 9 years. The most enjoyable part is knowing that with my dedication, attention to detail, efficient and concentrated work, I make a difference in the lives of people and their families during probably one of the most difficult and emotionally/physically challenging times in their lives. I love working with the nurses, together we try to figure out the quickest and correct way to make the claim/provider/payer/patient satisfied with our results."
good,We are required to do TennCare appeals within a timeframe of usually 14 days for a turn around time with serious consequences of liquidated damages.

good,I was happy to work with UHG. Now I want to do work from home. I was learned there about health insurance claim processing
good,"A day for me at UHC consist of getting the cases and preparing to adjust and/or correct each case for the provider or the client. Management has put certain time limits on the cases, when some cases are more complex than others and require more time. The most enjoyable time is getting the job done correctly for the provider or the client."
good,Very good place to work. i enjoy what i do on a daily bases. Job sometimes gets boring
good,"The typical work day at UnitedHealthcare involved contacting doctor offices, calling patients, and processing prescription orders. I used to work 10 hours four times per week. Even though those shifts were long, the workload was constant so the days went by fast. The hardest part of the job was to maintain a fast, accurate work pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was easy."
good,"I work with some of the best co-workers in the company throughout my many positions here.  For being a health insurance company, their benefits are not the greatest which is why I choose not to enroll in them through the company.  I get better insurance through my husband's union insurance.  As for the compensation, for the job I am in right now - it does not pay for the horrible issues we have to deal with and the lack of information we are given to assist in resolving those issues.  You get the feeling like you cannot leave you desk.  Many of my old co-workers have commented that they never see people in this job around much and it is because everything has a timeframe to it - and you feel like you cannot take a break.  Just sick of healthcare in general - too many changes with no direction on how to convey those changes to the workers effectively."
good,"The Optum division of UHG is a high quality place to work, with generally interesting work, intelligent staff, overall good processes, and really great people to work with.  There is a high ethic on serving the customer over any personal interest.  There is a general team spirit that makes it an enjoyable and relatively lower stress place to work from the standpoint of  having to worry about people's ego getting the way.  Despite it's weaknesses, this was the best company and overall working experience I have had in my career."
good,I enjoyed working with most of the people that I came in contact with at UnitedHealth Group.  They were hard working individuals
good,I loved to speak with new people and learn more about the medical field.
good,"Typical day at work was answering phones and helping clients. My co-workers where great and everyone was pretty knownledgeable and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a satisfield customer, turning frowns upside down."
good,"United HealthGroup is a friendly environment to work in. A typical day at work varies day to day, but each day has it's own challenges. I enjoy learning new things each day  with my job experience and I also enjoy educating members."
good,"For five years, I worked in the utilization management department. It was rewarding to continue using my clinical skills for keeping quality of care for members of the healthcare plan. It also was a great change from the direct care career I had previously held. I was able to enjoy a more traditional workday atmosphere. "
good,"It's really very good experience with UHG,As i had learned a lot of things in corporate culture and improved my analyzing skills,very good and supporting team members i have as off now,at the same time my manager is very communicative,effective and very good concern person and approachable too,we mostly enjoy the day of as the management conduct the program of Rewards and Recognition for the all employees performance."
good,Typical day woudl be to enter mass loads of data in over 26 systems correctly.
good,we learn each day new things. good to work with both organisation.
good,"Arrive to work, set up work station, touch base with team leads, check emails. This job allowed you to listen to music while you work! always a plus. Unfortunately there was more down time than one would like. Our ""ques"" would empty several times a day. Although I was able to study during down time I would have preferred to work."
good,"On a typical day I would arrive to work 15 minutes early to allow personal time and enough time to set up workstation. Workstation set up would include turning on computer and opening necessary windows, checking email, reviewing any new policies or procedures, touching base with team lead to clarify any questions on policies or procedures."
good,More challenges than opportunity due to the current health care environment
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,SXC is now Catamaran which creates a stronger and more efficient company for the PBM industry.
good,"I enjoy my position as the Sr Provider Relations Advocate."
good,"I work as a mainframe developer.  Responsible for daily production support as well as new system developement.  My most recent project is ""system interface testing"" working with offshore developers.  The hardest part of the job is communication with the offshore developers. I use email, IM, phone,  plus shared document to make sure the communication is effective.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when the program finally works as designed.  It is very rewarding to see the result of our hard work."
good,"Monday, Wednesday and Thursday I start my day by running portal reports, When finish with the reports, I resolve payment issues, and answer questions for our Offshore team. I work for an awesome Supervisor and my co worker's are the definition of team players. The hardest part of my job is, working with the Offshore team. The most enjoyable is that I enjoy what I do and the people I work with."
good,"Management kept in close contact with employees.  Worked very hard, for very little."
good,"I enjoyed the "" Behind The Scene"" medical occupation. I also enjoyed meeting and or talking to different people, on a daily basis. Medical personnel was a bit to get use to. My co-workers were very caring and involved. The most rewarding part of my job was; knowing other people depended on me to do my job with high expectation and accurately have the data they needed, to do there job."
good,Has strong cultures and values. I was there for 10 years doing cust service in an in bound call center.
good,"Good experience as a Senior Accountant"
good,"I have worked for 3 differant divisions of UHC, and had good and bad experiances. The benefits are okay, not what you would expect from a healthcare plan...but better than a lot of other companies especially with premium costs."
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, principalmente para quem é da região de alphaville ou próximo."
good,"Medsynergies is a work environment that is always changing, from new management to new policies to new clients, change is the only constant. "
good,"This a great company to work for in the insurance industry."
good,"UHC is a good place to work, but upper management gets away with murder. Their leadership is based on favoritism and is not consistent. As any company with satellite offices Admin has no clue to what violations are occurring as long as the numbers look good. They have many people who lack the education and leadership skills micro managing and giving criticism to those trying to fix the errors and do the work. They are constantly rewriting their P&P and modify it to support their current ideas. Health benefits to employees are just as bad as their plans that they sell to consumers and employers. Retirement benefits are good though."
good,"Good place to work if on a permanent position and long term basis"
good,The hardest part of the job was saying no to customers when their medical care was not covered.
good,"Obtaining clinical reviews from facilities telephonic and assisting with discharge planning ."
good,Um Bom Ambiente para Trabalhar com uma boa equipe
good,"99% of experience was good! Besides work, there was a lot of other opportunities to be involved with sports, charities etc. Only drawback was advancement opportunities. They seemed limited and not based on performance when promotions became available."
good,marketing new program
good,I worked for a company that was aquired/purchased by United Healthcare. As an aquisition there was a destint difference in working for a company based on your town to one based in another state. The warm and fuzzy is replace with a conference call. And you are devalued from a core employee to an aquisition.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Arriving at 8:00am and greeting my team and off to work. I learn new things everyday since the workforce and Healthcare is constantly changing. I'm busy scheduling meetings, travel, helping MD's and nurses with making their job run more smoothly."
good,With a large company one receives exposure to several areas and topics. This leads to an exciting but demanding place to work. Expectations are high but there is satisfaction in meeting those expectations and connecting with others along the way.
good,"assisted provider with claim inquiries, referral calls and benefits"
good,Work in customer service handling
good,Great company. Direct management works hard for their employees.
good,Enjoyed working for this company and hope to go back to get my 11 years of employment back.
good,great benefits and compensation. willing to work with school and military schedule. little room for advancement. hardest part about my job is staying motivated. most enjoyable part of my job is closing a sale.
good,"Salário competitivo com o mercado de trabalho, bons benefícios, ambiente agradável."
good,"You are mostly working independently .  Some employees work from home.  Management is available to help with issues,  most co-workers offer help things.  Work is timed for the most part , at least in the department in which I worked, so finding quicker ways of doing things or knowing exactly where to go for help helps a lot."
good,"UHC is always looking for ways to streamline and be more efficient.  They do allow WFH, have nice workspaces with many amenities and give yearly reviews and bonuses."
good,I feel it's a great opportunity for me to work with such a big organisation as a fresher and also to grab good exposure from experienced management while facing new challenges.
good,"Set up office at home and all training is on-line so everything is done from your home. The job requires field visits to clients. You have to be disciplined to be able to work completely from home. The company gives you absolutely everything you need for your home office. If you would like working from home, this would be a good job for you."
good,I have worked for United health care for 8 years now. I have grown with in the company and witness many changes to the company. I have been blessed to work her It is time for me to make the same changes and seek better opportunities.
good,Experience was good in working at United Health Group . Work culture was also good and innovative . so it's was good team involvement and was friendly environment .
good,"Overall I would recommend working at UHC. "
good,"Our division unfortunately closed due to mismanagement at the local level. Corporate did not take reports of mismanagement seriously until it was too late.  The work as a whole was extremely rewarding and innovating. We partnered w an ACO and insurance companies, PCPs, while providing  the best care for highly complex patients. Compensation was very good."
good,"Assisting consumers with refill f medicines,seeing anaking sure they qualify for other benefits, seeing if they qualify for extend refills while going on vocations"
good,I have 6.5 years experience. Working as team member always supported my team when ever they require. I gave my 100%. Looking for new job where I can increase my knowledge as well as my package.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Seasonal work with great training and innovation but very fast paced. This is a great introduction to health insurance but has limitations with work flexibility.
good,"Enjoyed my time at OptumRx very much. Will go back if the right opportunity presents itself. Colleagues met along the way are like family, which made the workday fun!"
good,"People are all professional when it comes to work. The management prioritizes people and have them engaged to work and at the same time with the social life of their employees. The workplace is cool, accessible and possesses a positive ambience. Hardest part of a member service representative is being affected of the customers' hardships when it comes to receiving their health benefits and insurance. Most enjoyable part of the job is whenever we resolve a concern that is sometimes a life and death situation."
good,"UHG was my first experience as a full time telecommuter.  While I was a little apprehensive about the lack of interpersonal connections, I found that technology provided and the personnel really combined and provided a forum for collaboration and productivity."
good,I enjoyed my time with this company and worked with an amazing small team of six. I learned specialized programs for mass mailings and managing the intranet site.  UHC has a strong culture.
good,Overall the company is great just some areas of improvement since as work life balance the company can be unorganized as far as management and supervisors
good,"Medicare and retirement is very busy. A typical day would be staring up your computer, logging in to all of the systems. Starting up VCC which is the dialer system. log into ready and the calls start to come through. Any questions or concerns that they member may have we have to answer them. If they have concerns about a claim, need to know their exclamation of benefits, have questions about medication or they need to change their primary care physician. As a customer service agent I take care of the member and give them all the information that they need."
good,"Poderia ter/ser promovido promoções e vagas para colaboradores internos, a fim de captar melhor grandes talentos."
good,"Smart and dedicated leaders.  Great atmosphere and there are events that take place for the employees.  Healthy cafe and snacks with an onsite bank, Caribou Coffee and workout area."
good,I worked 24 hours per week and got full benefits which was great. We never prescribed medication which was a real down side. Part of my role as a nurse practitioner is to diagnose and treat illlnesses which we were not allowed to do. We were information gatherers mainly.
good,"Good Place to work...."
good,Great place to work the teams are very helpful. Management style varies between departments but overall the people are willing to help you when needed.
good,"我目前的职位是接听客户的电话， 为他们解答医疗保险上的问题。 从我的工作中可以学到沟通技巧， 了解不同客户的各种需求， 也看到了人性的多面化。 通过跟同事的相处也更好的学会了团队精神， 懂得团队的重要性。 我的直属经理人非常好， 她懂得体谅员工， 也会站在员工的立场上思考以及安排工作。 她是我继续在这里工作的原因之一。 "
good,"Must be able to work little to no supervision.  In a typical day you'll check to see if  every one is in, if not check your voicemail/ email for call ins.  Note call in on the attendance spread sheet.   Start the group chat.   Check your emails and respond to them in a timely manner.  See your meetings if you have and meeting for today.   Review the client list and review the works progress list, if you have a client that is not doing to well find out from the employee assigned to them why.  Pull the reports for management and prepare your presentation to them.   Employees doing well send the a kudos, employees not do so well, find out why, see what "
good,There is a lot of focus on reducing costs and there is clearly pressure for political talk about Medicare for All.  There is a lot of focus on culture through the culture training programs.  Busy time of the year is in prep for 1/1 readiness.
good,"It was a temporary job but had full support of staff and managers. I liked that the hours were flexible, as long as you put in the hours required. it was data entry."
good,"I probably have 7 meetings/day, and get about 200 emails/day. It doesn't leave a lot of time to review all emails or provide quality work. For a company with an emphasis on quality, your time does not allow it. I find myself spread extremely thin. Compensation is average, but they have an excellent Employee Stock Purchase program that has had great returns. The company is huge and has opportunities galore, but it is difficult to get over that hump where compensation increases dramatically. I like the people, but upper management really needs to examine how we are structured and make decisions that allow us to be more productive and produce quality results."
good,We had a small team with a good culture but it was hard to be creative in a big corporate environment. Compensation was good but benefits where average.
good,"However, departments can become segmented and detached from other parts of the organization. Lack of communication and direct workflow structure between sites/departments can cause process breakdown. Lots of room for improvement within this organization."
good,Very large and somewhat disorganized company.  Dominant in their space.  Difficulty for the company in remaining focused given the breadth of their portfolio.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Good opportunity to grow your skill sets. This is a very fast pace high volume working environment. They provide a quick training with hands on help from the team. They do provide a work/life balance by having your work remote. They have high expectations and require a flawless Recruiter.
good,"I can say that I Love The culture and the diversity at UHC ."
good,A nice atmosphere and great people to work with. Flexible job schedule is a plus. Training is very helpful when learning their systems and new projects.
good,"Pay was great! Management could be better, they tend to promote people into roles their not qualified or trained for. They did provide a lot of resources and will work with employees going through a hard time! Work environment is relaxed and friendly!"
good,"Good company"
good,Working at United Health is a great place to be for a work/life balance. There are a lot of opportunities for remote work. The company has so much interesting data to analyze and encourages personal growth.
good,Great place if you work hard and focus on your career. Great teams and good benefits to grow and work with teams. The facility is also great for working with clients and business partners.
good,They are a good company to work for.  They are flexible if you have appointments.  They give you holidays off and paid time off. They work with you. Team work place.
good,"UHG, claims is a moderate paced job, however the content that you need to do the job you must locate with in a certain parameter. No mater the  scenerio there was information that needed to be applied to each claim. Management at UHG, understood the nature of the job and were very helpful in keeping production up with accurate information."
good,It’s a decent well paying job. Kind of hard to beat the pay they offer without a degree in hand depending on what area you live in. Depending on what area and what part of the company you work in you may or may not be micromanaged. Medicare enrollment is micromanaged by a tracking system called Omega that tracks your every key stroke and every mouse movement. I’ve never worked for a company that tracks idle time and well if you work for them they will.
good,"The typical day at the work is employee cultural friend with out effecting the productivity of the work. I have learned how to fill prescription, and been excellent customers service. The management was easily approachable and friendly.  The base approach of how to hire an employee was not fair for all race. I wish they give priority to the education and experience of the future employee. The hardest part of the job is schedules. The most enjoyable part of the company is employee who are more friendly and very welcoming."
good,Looking back I can say that this was good experience and oppurtunity to work with Optum/UHG. Although there were times the workload could get heavy I still feel like management would make adjustments and assist you with the increase in work. I was compensated well and they also give you quarterly metric bonuses that are easy to obtain with no hassle. This a good job to develop independent skills and time management.
good,Good job until it wasn't.  Position eliminated …..That's all I have to say about it. I don't think I should be made to talk about a company I previously worked for.
good,"The focus is more on touching more cases to resolve them later than actually taking steps to resolve the cases. Their perspective is that if time is taken to attempt to ensure resolution now, then someone else is waiting to speak to someone and getting frustrated by the hold time and it's better to have the appearance of progress on a larger scale than it is to make progress. The problem with that, however, is that it becomes like a game of tag, back and forth, needing additional information, things being misrouted and misplaced in the system, etc. Many issues I came across had been ongoing for months, if not years, with multiple denials for substantial amounts due to such issues. In one case, where the individual had dealt with numerous supervisors and other representatives, I found the issue, but my position didn't allow me to fix it. I included the information I was supposed to and sent it to someone who should've been able to. The same person got me again about a month or two later at which point I found out it was denied due to not having the information I indicated the location and contents of. I spent extra time on the call to ensure resolution by being very detailed and sent it again. It ended up being resolved, but I was also written up because my call was too long. Later, I was told that the individual had written in and had contacted my employer and their employer about the service I provided, thanking me for my help, and that due to the individual's contact and their employer's contact and expressed appreciation that my write up would not count against me, but would"
good,"When i use to work in united health group, i was in to night shift 8.45pm to 6.15am which 9.5 hrs shift . When it comes to work pressure it was stressful for certain period of time . But came across with good amount of experince which is helping me to maintain my self confidence ."
good,"UnitedHealth Group is a great place to start your career. However, one should not expect many opportunities for advancement. Data Science is a very new discipline at UHG, and there is very little structure with respect to how one would advance their career as a Data Scientist. In fact, the role ""Data Scientist"" did not even exist until a year after I began. The Data Scientists at UHG are several underpaid, and many are leaving after just a few years."
good,"Great benefits and PTO increases with tenure. Opportunity for growth. There are a lot of work from home positions. Depending on department, work/life balance may be good or not."
good,"There were many kind faces, i worked hrs between 8am-4:30 pm. i learned new software like ibm and pims. Hardest part of the job was the ever changing line of procedure for any work task."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The company truly treats their labor force as numbers. It is very difficult to get a proper raise and there is no internal employee support. You can work hard here but never be recognized for it.
good,Stress free environment good work culture where you find good team bonding good career opportunities work and personal life balance good pay as well have enough work to do for you selfs.
good,"a good place to work and learn, fun place to meet good people you can advance with work; but the work is neverending too many hours going into meetings, on call 24/7, you get burn too fast."
good,Usually a typical day at work is working in a metic based environment .  Company offers employees to work at home  and flex schedules depending on departments.
good,"Very quick paced and competitive job.  Enjoyed the work type.  Reasonable benefits.  Enjoyed the Telecommuting environment.  For the most part, I had good managers."
good,"My location was in Irving, Tx.  It was a newer UHC purchase (right before I started), so they were bringing it up to UHC standards. While I enjoyed my time there, and it was a valuable experience, the bureaucracy was what drove me out."
good,Working for United HealthCare has been a great learning experience. They were patient in my learning process within the healthcare field. My co-workers made it easy to want to come to work. This location allowed me to get to and from work without any commute stress.
good,"United Health Group is a great place to work for maintaining your own life, benefits, and paid time off! They always try to work with you in any situation that may arise in your life."
good,a reasonable place to work hands on training for the position you get hired for. willing to teach you about new up coming systems on a daily bases. can be a challenge to work there
good,Good place to work. Nice work culture. You will be given chance to prove yourself. Only thing is in some projects you will see legacy people making show off work and get required stuff done.
good,"I enjoy working with UHG , and thanks for all your support of my collogue and managers. as the process is moving to Gurgaon . look for better opportunities"
good,"fast to critic, but slow in commendation. Supervisors were not supportive. When you need hands on assistance there was not anyone available or not enough personnel"
good,"I didnt have a problem with the work load because it kept me busy throughout the day. I always tend to go the extra mile for both patients and doctors because I know how it feels to be a consistent patient and not know where to start, I always put myself in their shoes instead of looking at it as another job. Receiving feed back from both patients and employees made me feel complete that they were satisfied with my services even though I tend to go over the allotted time we were able to spend with each person on the phone, I figured if the customers come first we have yo take as much time as possible to ensure they understand the information given."
good,"Over the years at United the culture went thru a lot of change. I learned that I could adjust and change with any situation that presented itself. I was fortunate to have worked with caring management. The hardest part of the job was the constant change but as I mentioned, I learned to adjust. The most enjoyable part was working from home."
good,At times there may not be enough work for everyone. However during my interim I had a good opportunity to work on project with good collaboration and teamwork.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Enviroment itself is amazing. However, issues and frustrations come from the outdated systems used and poor supervisor communication. IN building cafe and relaxation room is nice."
good,"Start your day on phones, answering questions from benefits, claims, authorizations.  Speaking to all types of people from all over the world.  Organizational skills and learning how to smile over the phone.  Management would entice team members to participate in monthly friendly competitive battles to strengthen the work environment.  Hardest part of the job was not being able to understand what some people were saying due to accent. The best part of my job was when a claim was paid and all was happy"
good,I enjoyed the company and my role but there was a high turnover on managers leaving staff to handle things without support. The company's vision however was great and with stability from management it may have ran smoother.
good,made some good friends made decent money and left on my own accord for better opportunity. hope everything  goes well with them thanks for the opportunity
good,not a lot of interaction with other employees. liked benefits. good culture. very helpful. easy access to supervisor. company worked to make employees feel important
good,This company is fast paced and they promote from within. Customer service is very important. Member experience is valued over the process. While calls are timed how the member is treated is more important. Calls are 100% recorded and played back for quality control. External quality control is used to monitor calls
good,"I learned the Optum Agile manifesto after being a business analyst for five years while also managing deployments for an automation process, interacting with various internal teams and external vendors."
good,Work life balance is best you will find. There is a level of pressure to hit production levels that consistently rise. Main issues here are pay and advancement.  In 5 years I have been consistent top producer and received 1 to 2 percent pay increases annually.
good,I worked at a call center and it is busy work. I worked both the provider (Doctor) line and the client (patient) line providing information and handled issues with their claims.
good,Não tinha grandes benefícios mas os salário era boa se trabalhasse muito pois era comissão
good,Work life balance cannot be maintained. They need you to sacrifice your personal life for project. Nothing comes before their deliverables not even ur health
good,There's a lot of work to be done but the culture is great and makes the job worth it. The hardest part of my job is knowing that working in different parts of the company creates inconsistency with compensation and benefits.
good,"Over all good work place, it was just too far for me to drive. .. If they had an office closer to me i would apply. The people there are very helpful and work as a team."
good,"UHG management is family friendly.  Allowing flexible schedules and work at home options.  Unfortunately, a number of positions are being re-allocated overseas."
good,Overall very innovative company. My team was  awesome. Lots of opportunity for education. Hardest part of the job was meeting the metric if you really care about your quality of work.
good,"A typical day is routine. Management works well with you. Since I've been here I have learned quality control, training new hires, and also how to work with multiple systems. The hardest part about the job is speaking with rude members and doing the same thing over again. Ironically, the best part of this job is talking to and helping people."
good,the company is great to work for it just depends on the department that you work in. I must the supervisors that they are hiring now  come from the outside and don't have any healthcare experience. I think they should stay in house for those positions
good,"Its great opportunity for me to work with UHG,I learned advanced new technology while working.There is a Good amount of time to learn every one.I learned ASP.NET Core and Angular 5."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,The Telecommute is great. Constant change. Metric based. Fast pace. Starting nursing pay down south is 70k. Opportunity for growth. 8 paid holidays. 4 weeks of vacation. Very High insurance deductibles. 4% 401k Match. Ability to buy shares at discount rate.
good,"I worked in several different capacities though out my 22 years in the healthcare industry, starting with TakeCare, FHP, PacifiCare and then UnitedHealth Group. In all positions, from Customer Service Assistant to Customer Service Supervisor to the many roles in the Account Management Dept, there was always opportunity to learn and advance within the dept or to another dept. Management is very supportive and always there to assist/help."
good,"Since starting here I have felt that I have been working at 1-2 pay grades above where I was getting paid.  My director and senior director have both recommended me for promotion multiple times but i have been denied.  I have seen others with less experience, education and time at this company get promoted over me."
good,The position I held was not a glorified admin or manager. The call center is fast paced and has a very high turnover rate. The 18 months I was there I had 3 supervisors and 2 Business managers. It was the third supervisor and second business manager that made the call center better in my opinion. The job materials were always out of date. The handle time was challenge.
good,"they management and people there are fantastic, but i needed health care as soon as possible. I did not know how long they were going to keep me before they hired me on as full time or if they ever would."
good,Great job with poor management.  Really enjoyed the job but hated the schedule.  The poor work hours is what drove me to look for another job actually.  I had no social life while I worked for United Health Care.
good,Needs better management - other than that the office is great.  I enjpyed my job but poor management does not keep great employees. Morale is everything.
good,"Having worked at UHC worked from home which was plus also they allowed flexibility. Able to learn new systems such as TSM,  Hard to establish a relationship with management since turn over was every year."
good,"Typicla work day is you logging into four different systems, making sure you log in on time. management looks at your login times to make sure its accurate. workplace culture was great. hardest part of the day was making sure you get your work done within the allotted time frame. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people i worked with in that setting"

good,"Good Company in terms of Infrastructure and policy but average in employee satisfaction."
good,Company provided adequate CEU opportunities.  Allowed to work from home.  Enjoyed the customers we served.  Difficult to schedule doctor appointments as you work the same hours as the offices are open
good,"The people managing us,"
good,"Great benefits and fairly good monetary compensation. Work/life balance can be tough here. Open enrollment means mandatory OT. Plenty of hours to be had. Competitive, metric performance based."
good,"It’s with mixed emotions that I write this review. Open enrollment is going on and I should be so busy with leads that I do not have the same amount of time on my hands as SEP.  However, leads this year are down at least 50% over last year and what leads you do get are mainly Medicare/Medicaid Dual SNP.  The agents are having to struggle to make ends meet and we have more chargebacks than regular MA or Med Supp Plans."
good,"Enjoyed working there, was able to work with Human Resources for "
good,"Direct clinical operations of community program, management of staff, responsible for clinical outcomes. Daily telephonic conferences and virtual meetings"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Not a bad place to work good money and work from home is awesome. Management is not that great but you don't have to deal  with them working from home.
good,"I learned customer service skills, enhanced my typing skills and team work. The hardest part was taking call after call and not knowing how long the call would take to resolve the issue."
good,"It would tend to be chaotic, with frequent mgmt, work-flow and departmental changes. My time was a time of inconsistency and frustration. When we were able to just do our jobs and collaborate with the other departments as needed, it was a great place to work and the outcomes could be amazing."
good,Oferece boas condições de trabalho e ótimo ambiente.
good,I learned several aspects of the medical insurance industry. The hardest part was the high standard of my last position.  I enjoyed the people I worked with in the office.  When I worked from home I appreciated not having to miss work due to inclement weather.
good,"Overall it is a wonderful place to work with great, helpful coworkers.The managers try to offer the help needed to help you succeed.  Sometimes it may get too fast paced and you may not be able to take a break."
good,it was great just wish it lasted longer and they let us know when it was ending instead of coming in working then letting people go with out notice. Other than that it was great they even gave a bonus for coming in on time not missing days and so forth it was good money for my family really.
good,"I spent 11 years there and was able to climb the latter. It was not without it's downsides. Ultimately, great place to work. I enjoyed most of my time there and will not soon forget it."
good,"This was a good experience for me in corporate America. As a healthcare professional I gained valuable experience in the business and financial side of healthcare. My long term goals are in the provider side of the business, but I would recommend working at UHG for any provider with an interest in managing health care delivery systems."
good,"Uma boa empresa na área de saúde porém,gostaria de uma nova experiência em uma área que seja o perfil do curso de Direito."
good,Overall good company. Not much flexibility. Open and diverse culture.  Not much freedom with telecommuting positions. There is room for advancement and they promote learning and bettering yourself.
good,Great place to work . Flexibility and manager are awesome. Feel medical benefits could be better. Fast paced and care driven work. You must be organized to excel at your job.
good,"Very high deductible. I need a second job to keep up with my medical bills."
good,"Not a bad environment to work in. Flexibility to work from home. There are a ton of volunteer opportunities and also to travel. Although sometimes work expectations can a bit over the top, but other than that possibly a good place to start."
good,"You need to be a skilled organizer to work here. If you're not relational, do not know how to manage your time, and lack interpersonal skills you will have a hard time meeting your goals. You can have work life balance if you have strong relationships and strong leaders. However, this organization has a lot of competing goals and you can work excessively because of it. this union burns out their member leaders too! We spend a lot of time reporting and updating the database on top of our work. There is a top down approach to organizing and it can feel not intutitive at all. But this organization is very mission driven and we win a lot, so if you're interest in building power and politics, this union has got it going on. But there is a little interest in promotion here. If you're good, the expectations become greater. They typecast you. If you're good, they dont want you to complain when you have legit challenges. The pay is very good but make sure to negotiate hard before you work here. Know the higher they negotiate, it is possible your wages will be frozen for two years because of it. So understand the scale and ask when will be your next anniversary increase when you get hired. We get colas but once you reach step 5, you get stuck there for two years. There is also not a lot of people of color in positions of higher leadership, lower level managers are people of color but above them, it is primarily white men."
good,"Introvert try another company, extrovert this is definitely the place for you. advance from a 22 to 23 in two yrs into a new position. Its all about your stats  and keeping a positive mental attitude. I truly can be what you make it"

good,"good place overall..fast pace, hardest part was sometimes answering members questions.."
good,"A great company to start your career and gain experience. "
good,"United is a good work place. It has its flaws like any company, but the benefits and flexibility are great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy members while the best is succeeding in helping someone in need. Management is good but due to it being such a large company, getting things done can be a slow process. Overall, they are a good employer with many different career paths available."
good,"Relaxed work environment with 25.00 Gift Cards, and other incentives for a Top Seller of their Health Insurance Plans much better at Concord Location."
good,Relaxing call center
good,"Typical day of work would be to take about 40 to 50 phone calls a day.  I would help with claims and help members resolved benefits and provider issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the members, I have members that specifically call in to talk to me.  Its rewarding,"
good,"This was a good place to work.   Advancement opportunities were limited.  Pay was fair, benefits were horrible, which is odd, this is a healthcare company."
good,Each person is their own climb to success. This company believes in telecommute as much as possible. Its enjoyable for majority of the call center employees.
good,Job was face paced customer service work. The job consisted of quoting benefits t patient and healthcare providers. Offline work consisted of handling customer compplaints
good,"A typical day at work is handling around 100+ monitored calls a day. Advocates must be positive, compassionate, informative and accurate. Responsible for helping colleagues in need of help by Y-jacking. I've learned that with compassion, patience and accuracy are key components."
good,Lots of good resources to help you perform your job well & a good support system if you need help or have any questions. Nice to work with a company that encourages teamwork.
good,"Too much emphasis on maintaining adherence to systematic guidelines rather than assisting customers. Everyone always seemed so unhappy, especially management, the mood was daunting. It seemed as if no one wanted to be there now, except me."
good,"United Health Care is a great place to work for learning new technologies and feeling like you are a major contributor. "
good,"UHG is not the most special place to work, but it is a solid company that pays fairly well, has decent benefits, and does not generally demand their employees work excessively."
good,"The Unit, Team and Supervisors I have been fortunate to work with are and have been beyond professional in their role. The care and compassion they have for the employees they manage is exceptional."
good,"excellent place to work with extensive training, outgoing management with optimistic reviews. fast growing and fast paced work environment. easy to meet goals"

good,"1. Productive and fun to work"
good,It was fun enough. Management was hit and miss. I really enjoyed that I was able to leave on days that were too slow. I especially enjoyed getting to work on special projects.
good,"-Satisfied with work/life balance."
good,Great company to work for. I myself learned a lot and probably would still be there if they didn’t close. Worked very well with the other employees and loved the team environment.
good,"I loved my job & working there. The program that 4 employees had been working on got dumped & it was either find a job quick or you were out of luck. I was one of the ones that was out of luck & lost my job! A bit discouraging to say the least..The hardest part of the job was some negative upper mgmt. The most enjoyable was working with the provider communities..I know my job, I have 16 years of experience. A typical day would be talking & laughing with customers out there. The workplace culture was good just did't always happen that way; people have to know when work is done for the day & still have a family life.  I've learned that there are so many things in life to be grateful for, for what we have, who we are, & what we feel we need out of life."
good,"assisting members via 30-40 inbound calls per day, your own cubicle, Hardest part of he job is learning the many systems, most enjoyable part of the job is many incentives pay."

good,"Typical day at work is normal. Learned documentation, CAPA, Agile and how deep healthcare industry is. Work culture is very supportive. Hardest part is uncertainty about project."
good,Loved my first year there.  It was my dream job.  Once I was moved to a different manager it all changed.  May 2017 till Oct 2017 was a stressful time that prompted me to be super flexible and built my resiliency.
good,Great environment and loved the fact that we had onsite gym and cafe. The hours were great as we made our own schedule and they allowed for us to handle family situations outside of work easily if the situation arise.
good,"Very stressful, highly demanding work environment with excellent pay and benefits. Depends on which side of the company you fall on, can be a great job."
good,The company is always trying to change things which makes it more difficult to succeed and excel in the goals an employee may hold. There is a strict scoring chart on the employees performance which a lot of the time may be effected by the caller due to an issue that may not be due to the rep.
good,First at home base employement and enjoyed it. Learned how to manage time on my own as it was very different from working in an office. Lots of atanomy. Hardest part of working from home: feels like your day never ends but one has to learn how to end the day.
good,"Worked from home taking phone calls for military "
good,"Nice place to work, they are on a list for being background friendly, but they are not friendly if you have made mistakes in the past. long training but intensive you will learn everything you need to know if you pay attention. not rocket science. be patient."
good,"Working with the team and resolve issues is the most enjoyable part."
good,"United Health Group is a very well known company with a vision and mission that is followed.  I would be happy to refer people into the company ."

good,dont have lots to say if you dont want to be in a job that runs on numbers and lots of overtime then this job is not for you. many different background of people and everyone was so helpful. managers were not so nice.
good,"It was an ok place they played favorites,very judgemenal. Managers had their favoritees.rules dhould be the same for everyone and they should be more considerate"
good,"United Health Care was a good place to work. The only thing that I felt needed improvement was management, pay and the ability to advance further within the company as a whole."
good,"lots of people calling out, manager would put people on side projects and would have one person taking calls. Manager was new so could be taken advantaged of"
good,"Attracted skilled clinicians due to salary and benefits. Offered tuition reimbursement, encouraged furthering education and learning to enhance knowledge and skills for the job performed."
good,UnitedHealthcare is a nice company to work for.  I really enjoy the environment they have wonderful management Team and the trainging is excellent. My Coworkers are very pleasant and are always willing to help.
good,"This would really be a good place to work if they were more concerned about their employees and took care of them financially. "
good,The Lunch hour was to short and not enough time to regroup your self. I did not like sitting all day for eight hours i think they need to give you the option to get up and move around some times. Your bones get stiff and you gain weight from not moving enough. and the breaks are to short.
good,For board during down time.  A little prejudice against white women when it comes to advancing.  Great benefits but no sick time.  Vacation is first come first serve.
good,United HealthGroup is a very large company that has many resources. If you take the time and effort to take advantage of these resources then your opportunities are limitless.
good,"Rigid culture, diverse, competitive pay, career advancement, minimal minority leadership, international, great training, communication needs improvement among departments."
good,UHG/UHC is a great job and great place to work in my area. They have offered me with exceptional benefits and a great work environment. I just don't feel they offer the advancement I am looking for.
good,"hardest apart of the job is listening to peoples problems and doing the most you can to help but knowing its not enough. Very strict work environment, but the pay is decent. Commissions were constantly changed by management"
good,"Friendly & diverse. And that's pretty much it. I don't have anything furthermore to say about the company. You are on the phones most of the talking with members about their benefits and also the discounts, on car rentals home auto life and also renters insurance."
good,They do not rehire. It’s pretty easy work. You are expected to participate and to stand out at all things. Be involved in community and team building which is great
good,I am enjoying my work and the opportunities offered by the company however the benefits could be improved. They have covered the basics but they could provide more options to there employees.
good,Nice place to work but over works and under pays there is so much focus on numbers that quality work is very hard to produce. They have terrible job training if you don't learn fast then you are out the door.

good,"A good environment to work , and good compensation and benefits. Workplace culture is okay . Management is good ."
good,"High volume call center. 60+ calls a day. Representatives were required to help members, sometimes with very difficult issues in a quick and efficient manner.This job could be quite stressful at times, as we were dealing with the members health, family, and money. Supervisors were adaptive to the representatives needs."
good,a typical day at work would be login in to the systems  and answering phones answering customers questions about their cards or assisting them with any problems.  the workplace culture is a calm yet serious environment. The hardest part of the job was making sure the issue reports were accurate and to not make any mistakes what so ever.
good,"Call Center with metrics systems, answer calls provide members info. on their benefits assist finding providers scheduling appts, authorization on services."
good,Good place to work. Great coworkers. Good work. Great benefits compared to the previous places I've worked. Great company. Good times. Room for growth.
good,"UHC is a professional company that works hard to provide a family work balance.  They offer a great telecommute package, with travel to the office locations when needed.  The employee education within the company is diverse and offered to all."
good,"Daily schedule mostly involved working cases independently. Each  cases required research of medication, patient's history, claim history, clinical decisions. We were required to perform/decision certain amount of cases per hour. Minimal phone contact with patients. Made calls or fax physician office to retrieve pertinent information to decision cases. Everyone worked independently and kept to themselves. Overall relax atmosphere."
good,"Very good culture for such a large organization.  Had a very high pressure, high travel position.  Was able to get sufficient support from the company at each stage."
good,"This company is a behemoth, but the resources for those at the bottom echelon to improve/advance are minimal, you have to put forth your own effort in networking and soliciting higher ups if you really desire to advance quickly in this organization. If you want to earn a decent salary and work in a challenging/rewarding position, come equipped with a masters degree."
good,I would like to still be working here but they had a lay off in 2009 and I was laid off.  The company is a good company to work for and I would like the opportunity to work there again.

good,The company is growing constantly and the work life balance is great. There are a few issues with pulling the trigger and actually putting plans into action
good,"A Health Care Insurance company"
good,"United HealthGroup is a great place to work if you are looking for a job. However, if you are looking for advancement opportunity you must come to the job with prior insurance and claims experience or your will find you self stuck in your role. I would definitely recommend UHC to anyone that desperately needs stable employment as UHC does pay well and provides a ton of benefits. However, for those looking for a career especially recent liberal arts graduates this may not be the place for you as prior insurance experience is a must to move up and get into different departments. Also jobs at UHC can be a bit mundane as the majority of the jobs involve call center type work."
good,"Productive and positive workplace. Was very disappointed when I found out that my job was going away when I was hired, but was not informed of that."
good,"overall great place to work."
good,Over all it was a kind of work which i like it and now its a time to move for a better opportunities in UAE. I believe in a work which can enhance my skills.
good,"I was there when they were transitioning from Golden Rule to United Health. I had no complaints. Management was fair, training was relevant, pay was okay, and benefits weren't too bad.

good,"Best Place in delhi if you want to work in healthcare, Good brand , Good benefits , Pay little less then standard, Career movement between projects or designation is slow , frequent team outing"
good,High turn over in management - each one with their idea of how the team should operate.  This can be especially difficult when the manager is new to the team's responsibility.  The company is consistently providing incentives to employees.  Several activities with the communities surrounding the different office locations.. Great benefits and although the job is stressful - I loved working for the company.
good,"The work there was great and most of the people were easy to get along with.  I like to automate my work or find ways to make it more efficient.  My biggest issue was one of the people I worked with would not allow this to happen even though I found better and easier ways to do the same work with the same result.  "
good,"On a daily basis, I analyze multiple customers eligibility files and provide feedback to the customer on any issues that may arise. In addition, I review and reply to customer emails and calls."
good,They helped me get my insurance license and gave me a job selling insurance. This position helped further my career by giving me more employment options.
good,I learned quite a bit about how policy affects the care individuals receive. Advocacy is critical to the care of the members across the country. Multi-tasking is key to getting work done in this environment.
good,"I was a consultant brought in to help with the design and development of the sales data wwarehouse. It was very fast paced group that I worked with wghich always kept me busy. "
good,"I worked for Optum Services, the financial services company at UHG.  My experience as Health Insurance Sales agent overall was positive also, the pay was good..  The team leads and managers encourage and support all the agents by offering direct performance  feedback and extensive training.  All work is based on metrics performance basis which is both good and bad depending on the volume of calls.  So, most times this was extremely busy.  "
good,"A typical day would begin with returning phone calls to clients or facility personnel, as well as teammates and manager. I would then respond to emails with priority. Documentation completed on a daily basis with emphasis placed on deadlines and priorities.  I coordinated services with clients, families and nursing facility staff to schedule mandatory appointments."

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Honestly made good money here but the constant phone calls extremely stressfull. Mainly because phone calls were often directed to people who did not have the skills or experience yet to solve the issues at hand. for example, a Customer Advocate who was only supposed to receive calls related to providing information about the customer plans would often end up with claims calls that could not be then redirected to the correct department. Not to mention the stress of getting good ratings on calls that often time you had no control in the end result played a high role in a standing position in the group."
good,"Received calls from prospects to purchase Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement and PDP plans. (prescription drug plans). Managed and supervised agents to be able to perform these tasks."
good,Had 7 good years at UHC and was disappointed i had to leave for personal reasons.  Hope to work there again one day and I would recommend others try to apply as well.
good,solid training and mentorship. Not much room for advancement. Telephonic nursing became very busy and had back to back calls with little no to relief in between to ensure charting was done correctly.

good,"My management team was very helpful. The metrics was a bit over the top in my opinion. I always scored top 3,but felt the stress of the metrics system throughout my day. They have you schedule your time off 6 months in advance, which to me is a bit too much."
good,"There are never enough hours in a day as there is always so much work. This can be stressful but is balanced by a large allotment of paid time off. "
good,"Faced paced, competitively driven department, attention to detail and ability to adapt to change was required. Fair organization even being corporate based."
good,the company is a very relaxed atmosphere where work is good intent nothing to stressful. great schedule. staff members are workable. family orientated

good,"This was a DOD contract so very strict policies and rules. "
good,Poor management practices. Company offers good pay and benefits. Use to be a nice place to work. We worked and yet had fun. Got to be a burden going to work.
good,Excellent culture and great management; advancement limited and roles are added without compensation. You could be asked to add to your goals to get a grade increase (yes really). Promotions/ advancements internally are not advertised for opportunities to interview.  The company has great goals for helping the member and that's what keeps me here with the leadership vision.
good,"Everything was outstanding in UHG, every month RnR. Managers are very supportive, fun loving work. Work Culture and place are very good, I haven't found any hard point of work."

good,"I worked for United Healthcare for over five years. I learned a lot about health insurance, medical claims, how to multi task efficiently . However, the job proved not to be very secure . Also, sometimes this was a difficult environment to work in . The hardest part of the job was unfair work distribution not everyone received a balance in incoming calls. And not everyone was given a opportunity to advance , or the option to work from home. This was suppose to be a equal opportunity employment agency and professional environment . There was a lot of profanity and sometimes irate behavior in the workplace . I received a raise while working at this job and two months later I was let go for no valid reason. This company had to pay me unemployment for almost two years ."

good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,While at United Healthcare I was given the opportunity to thrive. There was some things that I did not care for but that comes with any job. At any time I could call on my agent manager and he would respond to my requests or questions.
good,Working culture and leadership team is very Good and motivating  This is the organization where you can spent your life.......................................................................

good,"Independent working environment where almost all communication, scheduling, training is by computer. Flexible scheduling, bonuses, all equipment is provided."
good,"Wellmed can be an ok place to work at but is very bad on raises and giving praise for a job well done. You will have job security for sure but as to every work place, you will have your daily lazy people, favortisms from boss, and gossip."
good,"Very busy place fast pace environment, great work culture and environment. Interfaced with a number of employees around the world. United Healthcare Group is a very big company with a lot of resources to become successful."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It helps to have years of UHC experience in order to understand specifics. I suppose that is with any company though."
good,Fun work place with good office space. Management has problems with communicating with workers. Day goes face how pace contact center. Hardest part of job employee attendance
good,"Overall a solid company to work for. I like my managers and assistant manager that provide it support while I work there."
good,"United Heath Care  was a decent place to work but not a lot of room for advancement , raises and bonuses. but overall I gained more medical knowledge."
good,"This Place is really good for beginners "
good,"Enjoy the autonomy of remote work though, you may miss communicating with peers as you would at a regular 9 - 5. The company is expanding and if you meet expectations you will be along for the ride. Must be dependable and focused in order to be successful as a coder here. The pay does not meet expectations of such a large healthcare organization but there is plenty of OT offered and an annual bonus based on your performance/department goals."
good,The Work environment is nice but management sucks. They're not professional at all. They treat you like you're a little kid.
good,"I liked working here for many years, but it's evident that business is taking precedence over patient care.  That being said, everybody is scrambling to get ahead of ACA mandates and bundled payments."

good,I processed medical claims. It was a tedious job. Metrics had to be met on a monthly basis. It was a lot of work. I worked there for 5 years but I became ill and had to resign.
good,"There are numerous opportunities at UHC and they are doing something right as they just hit Fortune 6 - up from Fortune 14.   I worked for two divisions with UHC, and I happened to have a fantastic management in Medicare Solutions.  I felt valued for the hard work I put forth and the sense of urgency I brought to my positions.  Depending upon how much you decide to put into your position, the work/life balance can be good or challenging - each area of the company is different and there are at least five different areas offering many opportunities.  UHC does excellent things in the community, and in Healthcare overall.  They work hard to make long-term, positive impacts that will benefit the overall population they serve."
good,"My typical day at work , consists of handling repetitive calls in a timely manner , assisting United Health Care members with prescription refills ,questions, and concerns."
good,Good place to get your feet wet in the insurance industry. There is a lot to learn and the opportunity to move up is there if you are willing to put in the work and have the time to be considered.
good,"A typical day at work is great. Being a telecommuter I have the ability to have a balance of work and personal life. However, this company pays under the national average for a Senior Grievance Coordinator position. The management states that pay on or above average for the same position."
good,"I learned a great deal while working at this company, and gained skills and experience that have been extremely valuable."
good,"The hardest part of the job is to make sure that you have all of the paperwork needed to enroll providers and the knowledge to get medical claims paid when they do not meet the correct format.  "
good,"United health has a great culture for work life balance, and the people that you encounter are genuine and good to work with. However the benefits are some of the worst I've seen. The insurance is extremely expensive and the coverage is minimal. General management appears to want to be positive and support employees, however the direct management is more concerned with the bottom dollar and doesn't care if you have a work life balance or if you spend you life at work, as long as the job gets done."
good,The company provided continuous training and assistance learning I appreciated the amount of growth opportunity within the United Healthcare community. I would recommend this organization for those whom are seeking employment in the insurance field. The company was good at keeping team spirit  . I learned important things regarding the healthcare industry. The most difficult part of the job for me was keeping my productivity consistent. I was then able to apply for a telecommuting position.

good,"Everyday at work was peaceful , and on rountine as long as we did our job right there was nno problems. "
good,"ambiente familiar"
good,"There is room for advancement in the company but they make it clear that attendance is very important. Those that never miss a day will move up very quickly. The mangers are very helpful and will do what it takes to make sure that you succeed in the work place but its really up to the employee how far they will go in the company. The hardest part of the job was learning how to navigate the system, then remembering all the pass words, but once you get that information down; the work place get a little easier."
good,"United Health Group is a good company to work for.  They offer many telecommute positions making it easy to balance work/life priorities.  The technology is good.

good,Good place to work but doesn't pay enough. Good balance between family and work but this company can definitely pay a little more for the work done.
good,"I enjoyed working at United. It is a secure job with great benefits. 18 days of vacation your first year. Health Insurance was adequate and the organization is HUGE into culture. There are plenty of opportunities to advance but in certain positions, the pay is below par for the amount of work you do."
good,"Reviewing the appeals that need to be reviewed, set up, sent to doctor for review, work with claims on adjustments while taking calls from providers and members with questions.  Generate all appeals that are letter ready.  All letters are time sensitive, so this can be a challege at times, but keeps you busy and alert."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Catamaran and hoped I could continue. But, a new merger is coming soon.  Most of my friends and co-workers have already gone. I may be the last survivor. I am confident that the knowledge and experience I have gained at Catamaran will translate into another opportunity."
good,"Empresa tranquila para se trabalhar. Aprendi a valorizar a pessoa humana ainda mais, entendendo que a saúde e o bem estar está acima de qualquer outra coisa. Direção flexível e empática com relação a seus funcionários. Com relação aos colegas de trabalho, só tenho elogios a fazer, pois fiz grandes amigos no tempo em que trabalhei na Amil."

good,"Arrive at the workplace and immediately start taking customer calls. Management is there if there is an escalation or if we have additional questions, they are fairly new as well. I would like a position with more responsibility."
good,"Call center triage, very busy volume of inbound nurse calls. Delivery of education and disposition based on needs of the consumer."

good,Most days are quiet on the floor I was assigned to however on the days the office was full there was to much personal talking going on and rather loudly while others were attempting to speak on conference calls or being trained via a webex. Cubicle space setting; nice upper management around.
good,"A typical day is providing legal advice on privacy/compliance issues and investigating and evaluating privacy and compliance incidents to determine risks. The most enjoyable part of my job is negotiating contracts and interacting with co-workers.  I work specifically on the Dept. of Defense (DoD) contract that my company was awarded.  It has been a great learning experience to learn the DoD regulations, which are slightly different than other state and federal laws."
good,"This is the hardest job i ever had. Since we do have a lot of skills that we are catering on everyday. But those skills makes me a better representative since it would help me to improve my knowledge.

good,"Trabalho bastante exigente pois estamos trabalhando com a saúde de nossos clientes."
good,"I worked in a few different departments, overall it was a nice experience. However, when you work in a call center you get alot of micro management. I only left the company due to lack of internal advancement with the pay i wanted. A person coming into the company may make more than an internal employee promoted to a higher position. "
good,"The company is great for individuals who don’t mind working in a call center environment and who can adapt to constant change. There is little advancement on the customer service side of the company but many opportunities for individuals who have experience with claims, clinical administration, case management, and other healthcare departments."
good,"I enjoyed working here they have great benefits, management was very approachable, good location, excellent training, and opportunities for advancement. I just thing that the pace was a little slow for me as far as the culture of the organization. Lots of steps and process and red tape to move forward."
good,"It's a good company to work for, no complaints. There is a good culture of accountability that isn't seen in many companies. "
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, com bons benefícios."
good,"I learned a lot of office jobs, faxing, coping, fix the printers/copies. My typical work day pretty much involved sitting and inputting data in to a computer.

good,UnitedHealthcare focuses on keeping their employees engaged. An engaged employee is a successful employee. I enjoy the opportunity I have to work making myself a better person.
good,"I have been with UnitedHealthcare for 10 years and I truly enjoy it. There are many opportunities for growth within the organization. The salary is competitive when you first join, but it is a challenge advancing and receiving a competitive salary."

good,"Day I entered into organization I didn't knew anything as I am fresher- Later part I have learned many thing how to sustain with organization by giving goods result in all the parameter especially quality. Some part I have learned with my co-worker."
good,"The best thing about working at UnitedHealthcare is the people I work with; they are the best. The hardest part of the job is maybe having to tell a Senior that they can't get coverage until October, due to Medicare rules. The most enjoyable part is being able to help someone get their coverage."
good,"Typical day includes supporting six regional managers that travel 100% of the time, as well as the CEO and 17 of his staff located out of state. While the company is great, the benefits are sub par based on out of pocket cost considering it is the insurance provider. "

good,"Ok, it was fine. Not a lot of opportunities to move up that you would be made aware of. Managers were okay but very it is very much a clique environment."
good,"In a typical work day I talk to anywhere from 30-60 members. I go over claims, benefits, and in general health questions. I may need to reach out to hospitals, Labs, or Physicians to get corrected information regarding claims, or to get resolution on amounts being billed to the members. I am able to process any claims real time that need to be processed/reprocessed. My management has been great, they seem to always be there when you need them. They are quick in ensure that you have the information you need, and if they aren't aware of the answers, they will get you with someone that does. I would have to say one of the hardest parts of my job is dealing with members that are dying, or have a family member that is dying or just past away. I make sure I take my time with all my members, but with these cases I am extra sensitive for them, and try to go above and beyond to make sure they don't need to continue to callback with the same questions. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a member says how great you were, and that you have answered all of their questions. I love to help people, even in difficult times."

good,THis is the first place i worked for that actually values there employees health as they have a weel center for doctor appts and a gym which offers yoga and training classes weekly. while working for this company i learned that in order to stay the best you must learn to adapt to what your customers need.
good,"Overall working for United Health was beneficial to me because I learned to help the consumers decide which medical plan best fits them financially and medically. The most difficult part about working for this company was unorganized management. Other than that, I enjoyed satisfying each consumer & working as a team to accomplish many goals."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"Review of medical claims for Fraud Waste, and Abuse."
good,"Large company, good benefits.  Local site is very good and tries to balance work and life.  Too many outsources support areas for employees"
good,Great place to work if you don't mind answering constant calls. Easy to move up in the company if you're a dedicated worker.
good,I have learned so many things in troubleshooting.The hardest part of the job is one issue taken 3 days to resolve  due all servers down.
good,"Working with United, you learn how to multi-task very quickly and to work independantly.  Fast paced environment and you will never be bored."
good,"The work day consisted of answering incoming calls from members, doctors and staff from various hospitals throughout the United State.  I educated individuals on medical benefits, processed claims, reviewed appeals and prior authorizations. I also ordered ID cards and submitted requests for mail order pharmacy."
good,"Seeing people assisting the nurses with cares, co-workers are great, I think the hardest part of the job is driving everywhere in Las Vegas"
good,"Work from home is great, learned mostly routine paperwork, insurance specializations not required as you do not deal with this kind of stuff unless your a big dog.  Coworkers were blah, most didn't talk, got used to being ignored and people walking past you as you didn't even exist.  Lack of advancement opportunities as usual, would email the management but no interest or so much even a response."
good,"Being able to make a difference in someone's life, is the best feeling ever."

good,"Otimo ambiente de trabalho."
good,"A typical day consists of researching member issues and/or answering member benefit questions. Call center is new to me & therefore, have learned a whole new aspect of the business within the last year. Management & subordinate staff are easy to get along with. We rely on eachother to answer questions to things that we might be unsure of. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the more difficult situations like an upset member. However, this is not common. The day to day interaction with members & knowing that we have satisfied their needs is quite satisfying."
good,Busy call center with a large group of call center employees. Good training department. Overall good team morale.
good,"the work was difficult but not impossible. they set very high standards that are hard to meet but you wont get fired unless you have attendance issues for the most part. everyone says they are all about compassion for the customers but they are really about their pay and could not care any less about the people. Training was good when they actually taught something but out of an 8 hr day in training, 3-4 of those hrs were actually learning something. the rest was sitting waiting for something to happen.training did not feel complete. You could be trained on many different things but hardly a pay raise."
good,"United HealthCare is an industry leader in health insurance. As the company expands by acquisition, technological challenges are many. "
good,"A Typical work day would be to handle incoming calls and processing claims at the same time. I was just beginning, so I learned a lot about how healthcare benefits are administered. Management was supportive, and friendly. My co-workers were also friendly and supportive. The hardest part of the job was processing medical claims and answering phone calls at the same time. The most enjoyable part was knowing that you helped the person on the call at the exact moment."
good,"We start our day with our daily huddle to know our daily quota and updates on our client and systems. What I learn in this company is how to balance things up, esp family, life and work. About our management, they are eager to find ways how to become more productive at the same time not very stressful for their employees. My co-workers are nice and friendly, very approachable and they will really help you on your problem especially on coding."

good,I joined here as a fresher and the managers and the whole team was so helpful in understanding the business of UHG and the technologies which were completely new to me.
good,"I worked in two different units of this hospital. Management is the biggest issue, but I believe that is the primary issue at any agency. The best part of both jobs were the patients. Overall, UHS is a good place to work and if I hadn't moved out of state I would still be there and probably long-term."
good,"A typical day at UHC was answering inbound calls from medical providers as well as assisting employees coming out of class. "
good,Overall i loved the job and the people I worked with including management
good,Would help nurses or Health Coach's with members in finding premium providers in the area. Also would have inbound time so that members were call in with any questions. Also had a que for outbound calls which seems kind of pestering to members but was requested of GE. Would cater to GE members needs and beyond..

good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"Typical day at work is reviewing overturned Appeals and processing claims for payment.  Learned how to process claims, learned medicare benefits, research certain medicare policies, help others. etc."
good,"The healthcare industry is growing so fast, especially managed healthcare. I like the depth of knowledge I have gained from working here. There is so much change and therefore so much to learn. Very exciting to be involved right now."
good,"United Health Care is a good place to work if you are a self-starter. It provides you with a lot of freedom to work at your own pace. That can be good or bad. They give you the materials needed to complete your job and are there if you need assistance, but you are ultimately responsible for your own success of failure."
good,"Company captive, how ever enviroment same as bpo"
good,"O trabalho na Amil era muito bom até que a empresa mudou para muito longe."

good,"Continues shifts."
good,"any growth opportunities are located in another state."
good,"I work from a home office and each day I am responsible for reviewing health care claims paid by other adjusters and the automated system.  I review policy wording and ensure the proper benefits were applied.  I issue additional payment or request monies back depending on my findings.  I work with very little direct supervision as my direct supervisor is out of state.  "
good,UHC is a good work place... just managment needs better people
good,"learned to communicate with different kind of people,felt the enjoyment in working mnc"
good,"An atmosphere conducive to developing and strengthening skill sets. Provides good growth and development opportunities."
good,This was my first job in high school. We were only open a few hours every Monday through Thursday. The pay was decent for someone with entry level experience. As with any job there were great days and there were terrible days.
good,There is no formal intake process for the assignment of projects to the Black Belts.  This leaves the door wide open for the champion and/or sponsor of the project to request deliverables/goals that do not require the high-level skills of a Black Belt/Six Sigma Consultant.
good,a typical day at work
good,"The best thing about my job is that everyday is different you never know what you are going to face the day you come into work. What application is down or having issues today, you will find out quickly tho from the first couple of phone calls you get and your co-workers get you gather the information and let incident management know. The hardest part of the job is that you are on the phone constantly for 8 hours except for 2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

Mas, com o passar do tempo, percebi que havia uma demanda (não atendida) de conteúdo, tanto para público interno quanto externo. Daí surgiu a ideia de organizar a área que hoje chamamos de ""Comunicação"". Fui responsável pela implantação, desenvolvimento, edição e aprovação de newsletters, email mkt e jornais para clientes e colaboradores."
good,"I worked for UHC for 12 years, 10 of which was working from home. It's a stable company, however there are certain departments that seem very unorganized and lack of communication from management, while other departments run very smoothly."
good,I have been fortunate to work from home and I have learned how to push myself to accomplish more goals since I have been working at UBH. I enjoy helping our clients although I'm ready to move on into HR.
good,I was acontractor for a 3 month lob. I had limited exposure to the culture and people. Overall a good company to work for.
good,Worked independently with provider office staff to assist with issues or problems with billing or policies with quick resolution. Negotiated contract issues and expansion of network providers. Management was hard to contact with questions or issues because of being a telecommuter. The hardest part of the job was getting resolution of issues that needed to be addressed in house because it sometimes took much longer than anticipated. The enjoyable part was getting provider satisfaction for resolving issues.

Sempre trabalhei na area de relacionamento com o cliente e considero ser um trabalho dificil mas com imensa recompensas. Amo trabalhar com gente, cada um com sua cultura, raça, personalidade, e é exatamente isso que me agrada."
good,"Productive, fast pace environment. Learned different types of ICD-9 codes . to pay doctor bills. keyed in hospital bills. Worked with 5 co-workers willing to help each other when needed. At the end of the day made sure our quarters were made. Supervisors were their when needed and helpful with what every you need. The hard part of the job was when they merged with an outer state company, am happy I had the chance to work and learn from some of the best people in the management department to use in my career"
good,This company has great management. They are fair and offer a great competitive compensation package. It can be difficult to move up the ladder so make sure that you make lasting connections.
good,work from 6:00am with 30 minute lunch off at 3:00pm. Do enjoy the flex time.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"Semi decent benefits, good pay, high stress, but a good place"
good,The majority of my day is auditing broker compensations. I handle all external brokers and their payments from our department. I deal a lot with our Accounts paybale department for problem solving.
good,"I loved working at United Health Group but like any job it has it pros and cons and it seemed as tho the cons started outweighing the pros. It became more demanding on my family because of the stress level I was under. Overall, there were alot of people there that were willing to help you succeed and move forward."
good,"Productive and good work place. Got good exposure to management and leading activities. Learned many things about management, leading teams. Also got ample opportunities about technology advancements."
good,"UHG is a typical corporate environment. They are slowly incorporating a open environment in their offices. With such a large company, the management is going to depend on the line of business and department you are in."
good,I believe the company offers great opportunities and a friendly work environment; but could improve in communication and competitive wages for their employees.
good,"I signed on as a trainee knowing I would have to locate from my family for awhile, didn't know there would be furloughs come the beginning of the year"
good,I would stayed if we were not have a layoff. I had a great boss. They were bought out by optum and eliminated position which is typical for the cooperate world
good,I was only a temporary employee for seasonal work but everyone was very nice and helpful. The training was adequate and the trainers very knowledgeable. I met alot of great people while working there and the atmosphere and environment were very fun and a nice place to work.
good,"Great place to work, and there is room for growth!  I disliked the daily meetings - lost of production time. I actually have nothing more to say - apply and start your new career."
good,"Great corporate culture. Empower employees to perform well.  However, it puts a lot of pressure on managers.  They have 360 review process every 6 months.  A lot of turn over, too."
good,Minimal work/life balance. They expect you to work excessive hours and always focus on the bottom line which means constantly assessing and reassessing how to do more with less resources.
good,"I've been impressed that even thought UHG is a massive company, I don't feel like a number. Overall, I believe they have the best interests of their members at heart. Sure, they still need to make a profit, but the number of folks I come in contact with on a regular basis that genuinely care about our consumers is staggering. Don't get me wrong, working for such a large company has it's downsides... but my personal experience has been positive overall."
good,Fun place to work at!  At the beginning i had a very strict supervisor that would give you points for not going to work even if you are sick.  I was pretty upset about that at the beginning but then I got a new supervisor who was very understanding.
good,"Na empresa Amil foi onde realmente pude  mostrar  todas as minhas experiências, e tive muitos aprendizado."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Ability to work remotely is fantastic, yet it is difficult to find work life balance. "
good,Overall work place is good but management is not that good. I specially learned a lot experience and skill from UHG. There is nothing for me as the hardest part of the job.
good,"Uma empresa tranquila no seu dia normal de trabalho, com atividades complementares no dia a dia. Aprendi mais sobre Excel, e não houve parte mais difícil do trabalho pois a cada tarefa nova era explicado perfeitamente e ensinado com tal paciência. A parte mais agradável era lidar com os outros funcionários."
good,My supervisor wasn't friendly and had favorites. I liked working from home. I made a lot of cool friends. I liked that there was a gym. The cafeteria was very clean and the cooks do a good job.
good,The ability to learn new skills as you work and to have a great support system around you was the best thing about working with Optum. The culture was always positive and even though it is not the perfect place to work as none are it was definitely a place I would recommend to others and would work for again in the future.
good,This companys goal really is to help people live healthier lives. They will go above and beyond to right any wrongs and also make the experience better for the consumer.
good,ability to work remotely is offset by a salary that is not very competitive in the local market; hours are long even though you work from home. The positive about working from home is that you are available for family emergencies etc
good,"Wonderful atmosphere. the people are wonderful, the job itself was rewarding and fullfilling. The patients really are what makes the company successful."
good,"Good place to work, people are largely supportive, a lot of flexibility. Management is supportive and provide a lot of learning experience. Occasionally requires working additional hours."
good,I left this company voluntarily for a better opportunity and choose not to write a review at this time. I have nothing more to say about my work experience at United Health Group.
good,"Working at United Health care has taught me a lot on how to be pro- efficient company. From having daily meeting to go over goals ,objective for the week and how we can obtain these goals. it taught me also how to be more communicative with customers so we can give them that class A customer service"
good,"UHG provided me the opportunity to further my education and plan a family while advancing my career. I obtained tools that helped to be successful within and outside of the company. UHG offered many locations to work both remotely and on-site. While the culture was very diverse, the particular location I was employed was small and did not have much room for growth at that site. The good thing was the job availability at other sites were open to almost all employees, so relocation was always an option."
good,"Não indico aos novos colaboradores (não sei como é o trabalho na área de vendas de planos e de atendimento aos beneficiários) para a área administrativa; há entra e sai de colaboradores, devido ao ambiente estressante por parte do relacionamento com os credenciados e fechamento de novos contratos."
good,"they had a lot of activities to make the work place enjoyable, like fun runs, office themed parties and also access to discounted gym memberships. this really made a difference"
good,"Work usually begins with meetings updating numerous provider contract negotiations, reporting and next steps.  Prioritize the days work and add new assignments to the departments work log. Kick off 12 month data extract for new requests.  Price analytics to current provider reimbursement and setup proposed reimbursement.  Evaluate current reimbursement adjust units and or fee schedules where needed.  Price data to proposed.  Add pivot tables for snapshot recaps.  "
good,Jo doubt company is good i have spent their almost 4 yes unfortunately my process was ramp down.When process  is ramp down they are adjusted the person which was working with them
good,"There are only two kinds of people in the corporate world - the losers and the achievers. Losers accomplish nothing; achievers, everything. Losers are liabilities of the corporation; achievers are its assets. Achievers run companies. They invent, innovate, and change tomorrows. They stand out and rise up to the occasion."
good,i would like to tell about my current company experience: it’s very comfortable environment for freshers and experience people to work with united health care.
good,It is a good place to work. I telecommute which is nice. It gives you the opportunity to work in different areas of the country with out having to relocate.
good,"My team was dedicated, collaborative, fun and hard working.  It was a pleasure to go to work each day and also wonderful to be able to work from home at times."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"Overall calm environment. Easy going. Friendly staff. Okay benefits. Good 401k. Casual work attire. You have your hourly break, able to grow within the company."
good,"depending which department you end up, rule and schedule flexibility may vary. overall great company to work at and people are nice. benefits are really good!"
good,"Typical day is reviewing and assigning projects, tickets, reaching out to customers, contacting staff and addressing any challenges."
good,I answer calls from members about four hours a day.  The remaining time I process claims.  Work culture is pretty good.  Management is good and communicates good for the most part.
good,i Liked the team environment and LOVED being able to work from home. To have that flexibility is a godsend. To have that trust placed in you to get the job done makes me feel proud to work for the company.
good,Very nice work culture and work life balance all are eco friendly. About the company us largest healthcare payers. Lot more I’d coming and I like to be a part of uhg
good,Work was very enjoyable but the lack of communication in the program with the constant changes did not provide for a stable work environment. The program was new and needed a lot of stuff worked out.
good,"Work was very busy."
good,Productive workspace and great teams. I have had a number of different position at UHG and was able to transition from legacy technologies to distributed technologies. Able to expand my distributed technologies and was able to develop production support as well as program in Java with Tricare which lead to my current position with the Link/PEDS group with new technologies such as RH OpenShift and server-less processing.
good,Very nice place to work. Pay was very good.  Some work days could be very busy taking 70 to 80 calls a day.  Employees are very helpful to each other.
good,My team was amazing.  I liked the ability to work from home. I had strong relationships with my business partners. I enjoyed being able to travel to client sites.
good,"Specific skills required, but if you possess those, you will be challenged and have plenty of opportunity for advancement with the company.  Hours vary by position, but generally a flexible work environment and some great leadership within the organization."
good,"Excellent culture and great benefits, fast eviroment. "
good,"Company is well-positioned for the future, subject to external pressure from customers looking to reduce costs, rising healthcare costs and political implications. Culture is good, good benefits, career mobility is supported, remote work friendly."
good,Great work environment with the opportunity to work from home. Working from was a great chance to have a little flexibility in your work schedule and a great perk for living a great distance from the facility.
good,I am very upset and disappointed that we got laid off when we we’re working sooo hard and meeting our goals. Our members were taken care of by our department.
good,"Good work culture and work life balance."
good,"Fast paced inbound calls from agents and customers"
good,"UHG provides excellent benefits and do provide the opportunity for Employee feedback through the use of Vital Signs.  You will be compensated for a job well done. Some improvements can be made in regards to business decisions and spending as it relates to their Medicaid programs.  Overall management is favorable.  The one greatest challenge is job opportunity in trying to move up in the organization.  If you are not a licensed staff or an RN it is very difficult to obtain any other positions. I have a Masters degree and was one of the top Case Managers in our region in Florida, exceeding expectations on my yearly performance evaluations.  I have applied for over 20 jobs both while being employed with UHG and afterwards once our contract with the State of Florida was not renewed and have not yet been successful in getting past the recruiters.  It is my feeling that they are missing out on some very talented and competent staff by not allowing the opportunity to at least interview for positions that one is quite obviously qualified for."
good,"nice location and facility a typical day at work is to plug-in and grind. "
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I started off as a Customer Service representative which I believe is the best place to being. you get a good idea of insurance in all areas ( Commercial and Government) Once you have a base from customer service, there are a huge arrangement of departments you are able to explore."
good,I worked several years under several different managers of which each one had their own style of management.  I learned so much about CM/UM .  I worked from home and loved the autonomy the job offered.  I think my  job performance would speak for me.
good,The benefits are great and the company really cares about the balance between work and life.  Working for UnitedHealth Group allows you to know that you are directly helping people.
good,Meetings at UHG were very engaging and geared toward the employee.  Opportunities were provided to the employees that would increased productivity in nursing case management.
good,This was a positive experience that provided additional experience in a field that I am interested in.  This was a temporary position to assist the company in improving HEDIS Scores.
good,Its a challenging and hard job where we have help educate and assist people in getting enrolled or buy health insurance. Had to deal with many clients all day along and phone calls
good,"Good company not much room for advancement"
good,"Lack of adequate training for new employees, no structured orientation provided. Too many tasks for one associate to handle. Clinical staff was overworked and management was not always visible."
good,"Good company, the standard of a solid business with good benefits, competitive pay, and reasonable opportunities for transfers. Only criticism is fairly weak management system."
good,"Depending on the team, work/life balance can get stressed at times. Opportunities to speak with senior leaders. Very motivated and intelligent people that provide great opportunities for mentorships. Overall, it was a great experience."
good,"A very large company with many moving parts and changing goals.  The people and work is great.  Company culture is fairly new but very strong.  A positive environment for personal and professional growth, including training and stretch assignments."
good,"Supervision assisted staff with questions, and participation  Very work friendly environment. Advancement for promotions unequally balanced."
good,"Heavy case load, understaffed, and very fasted paced with strict regulations to meet. Overall a good company to work for. Always changing management members."
good,"...sans the mass lay-off it's a great place to work."
good,This job was intregrated with a small business. At first it was a great place to work however as positions became less demanding for the group that was intregrated  more stress was evident. Production was  very demanding and became very bad because of management
good,Somewhat difficult to get cases unless youve been there for awhile.  But assignments were fairly easy but lots of travel.  If you are a detailed person you are probably not going to be able to bill for all of your time you spent on the case.  Billable hours are preset and you are expected to get the case seen and completed within that time frame.
good,I worked with a great team of marketers at Optum and enjoyed the collaborative nature of my team. However upper management did not seem to know what they wanted and there was a lot of change of direction and turnover.
good,"Company was good, my location had a few management issues but most people I worked with were great and really cared. Did have a lot of mandatory OT in my department."
good,Great place to work if you're looking for an opportunity to grow and advance. Not having a degree will not stop you from moving up. Leadership is very interactive with the employees.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Every day I would be able to login to my computer with my passwords to clock myself in. I thought that was amazing because you can even put yourself on break while timing yourself to come back on time. The most enjoyable part is speaking with the elderly who have so much life experience. It is truly my favorite thing to do. I learned how to communicate better. Management was fair.
good,"Must be able to work fast paced job with stats of 120% or better, be a people person. Must Have patience. Benefits could be better.   Management is ok."
good,"Empresa muito boa"
good,Learn how to have better communication skills on the phone. I learn how to navigate through different computer systems to help refill patients medications orders. I learn how to multitask I work into new computer system to the old system. Learn how to do on-line order. Did special projects for the supervisor
good,"Good people"
good,No feedback at all don’t want to answer questions or feedback due it was a few years back and not sure I remember the process of the interview process. Thanks
good,Had great time. Great place to explore career opportunities and learn things. Had guilt feeling as I had started career as fresher though possessing 5 years of experience.
good,Overall a good company to work for. If you have troubles adapting to change this may not be the company for you because Healthcare is forever changing.
good,"A solid place for a career, but longevity is limited by advancement opportunities. Company tended to go outside for candidates rather than internal promotion in mid to senior technical positions."
good,"UHG is a great company with a ton of opportunity for advancement and career development if you put the work in. A lot of people I work with have been with UHG for 10+ years. Work life balance is good, but if you want to stand out you defiantly you need to work hard as its a huge company."
good,"The benefits that you receive are good, such as a 401k, and various discounts available such as with your phone plans. There is also a lot of paid time off available after you accrue some time with the company."
good,"I enjoyed working at United Healthcare overall.  I loved working from home and the compensation was definitely the best in the market for similar positions.  However, it was very management heavy- often felt like you couldn’t use your own judgement to do your job to the fullest.  The bottom line felt more important than actually meeting the needs of the members a lot of the time.  It was very difficult to navigate the process of being promoted from within."
good,"Loved my manager, she cared about her team. Had a lot of overtime to offer, to me it was really slow paced and there was no room to grow even if you are doing great at your job"
good,"Worked as Call center rep for Optum Card Services - a lot of confused/angry customers, debit cards were issued for flex savings accounts.  Had to explain how the benefit worked to a lot of angry people at their Appt.'s."
good,"Good work life balance. You can get good hikes if you work hard."
good,Uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar
good,"I like working for UHG. They have a solid culture and embrace professional growth. At times, it can be frustrating seeing advancement from a pay standpoint."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I do not wan to comment. I work there and it was pros and cons just like any other job. I was not there too long due to a lay off. The pay was pretty good.
good,"Empresa tranquila, bons técnicos e enfermeiros. Vale a pena"
good,If my work schedule was better I'd never leave. There is extensive training and they pay for licensing. Lots of room to grow and stable hours. Gym on site! Cafe on site with payroll deduction option.
good,Great place to work. Team work environment clean work place. Management was always present. Flexibility with time off. Dress code enforced to business / casual
good,"overall good place to work, but NO job security. They need to review and update their salary ranges. The benefit packages for their employees were not good at all."
good,UHG has been a fun place to work. Lots of changes are going on at the moment.  I have been able to work from home for many years.  I have been working with a fun team of people.
good,".good pay and ability to work from home, no day is the same and the aspects of the department are always changing. Looking forward to advancing within the company."
good,"As a Care manger (work from home) you have the benefits of working in your p.j's but the paperwork & visiting clients on most days  comes with alot of paperwork & documentation (5hours to 6 hours) of paperwork can be for 1 client not including that you still have to complete paperwork for your other  clients in a 48 hour turnaround time frame. Management give raises or promotions to (friends) not based on work performance. Also when you're out on vacation you have to get someone to cover  for you & complete the paperwork. (If the person covering for you doesn't have time to do the paperwork on your client then that means that you'll get behind in paperwork). Because the person that's covering your clients for you has their own caseload to complete. So at times people are afraid to take vacation because you'll get behind in paperwork."
good,"I enjoyed working for United Health Group! "
good,"I enjoyed working with UHC, able to meet a wide range of people in different ethnic groups; learned so much about Medicaid and Medicare . Unfortunately the funding was lost"
good,"the company itself is great however the management doesn't seem to know what is going on and dictate each other. the job is very repetitive as well. overall, i would recommend it."
good,"Could do more for morale"
good,Great friendly work environment . Awesome place to work. Advancement is obtainable.  Beautiful landscape  in office building.  Pay rate should increase to compete with other companies.
good,I don't like micromanaged sedentary call center jobs.  The offer the option to work from home which is a good thing and perfect for women with kids at home.  Not a good fit for me though.  I don't like to sound robotic and that's part of the culture
good,Different departments are structured a little similarly and overall use standard operating procedures for all tasks. depending on the department you work in some management is very picky and micro manage often while others tend to let you just do your job. Some job duties can be fast paced while other areas are very slow paced work.
good,"uma empresa de grande porte, umas das maiores operadoras de saúde do pais."
good,"The work environment is pretty tranquill with the option of working from home offered bi-annually (once elected you begin to work at home primarily as long as you meet expectations.) Generally friendly staff. "
good,I am proud to say I have worked for UHG going on 3 years. But i have seen some changes that may not have been the most positive to the employees by management.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Great organization high level discipline, world class collaboration.  However, critical thinking many times frowned upon in the sales division.  Great tools available, good culture for career development."
good,My last manager was not a good fit for our team and did not help us improve the way a manager should. Many of the managers responsibilities fell to myself and my other teammates. This did not help the group.
good,"Worst Management, Most of the managers will create Unnecessary work pressure, Late night calls."
good,"I worked as a claims adjuster for years, eventually working from home. The benefits are good and the pay is great. The only stressor is there is no room for error and you are expected to do so many claims an hour."
good,Good place to work with career advancement possibilities. Employees work very well together which creates a great structure and environment to work in everyday.
good,This was a great company to work for if you can embrace change.  Policies and procedures change so rapidly that by the time you learn one process it is changed.
good,"Its been a while since I've worked for UHG, and while they have definite down falls, such as PTO hours are not 'yours', anything not used for vacation or sick does not get cashed out, I had the best work life balance while working there.  I liked the 4 10 hour shifts/ week and working around the clock at a hospital made it very easy to switch shifts to cover vacations and such making PTO accrual very easy for when you did need it.  UHG offered a system where you can give a shout-out to an employee, a kudo, (I forgot what they were called) , and this would give that employee points, and there was a store of sorts where you could redeem said points. ( I saved up and was able to redeem a Kate Spade shoulder bag!). This way of highlighting employees and then rewarding them was definitely a positive. Another downside was staff meetings were a set time and day of week, making it difficult for people who work night shifts or not on those days and needing to find childcare coverage for a 1hour meeting. They ultimately were a bottom line is profits type of company, but they did some things to help balance that. The management team I had was not very professional, but that speaks to those people and not necessarily to UHG as an employer."
good,"The  job was challenging that promoted performance, productivity and achieve goals. The supervision was supportive and encourage collaboration in the team."
good,"A typical day at work was multitasking with different levels of employee's at a fast pace to manage workflow for a team of 25+. This included obtaining and reporting to upper leadership with my market's inventory. Assign work, assist colleagues with questions regarding a process or in locating an answer for their direct question.  As part of Leadership, I worked directly with two teams and those team leads as well as the regional manager of our market to keep them informed of any questions or concerns or feedback regarding team members. Everyone is non-stop all day so, there was no down time which, would be one of the hardest things of the day as it did not leave time to work on our training or upskills learning courses. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationship that is built between you and the Client. It is extremely rewarding to know that you are the reason this member was able to pick up their medication on a Friday late in the afternoon. The relationships you build with your teams and within the regions are irreplaceable as well as informational. Every employee has a different book of business with different sorts of needs. This is so helpful to have colleagues to collaborate with to ensure we are resolving the members needs at that moment as well as ensure that we can successfully catch any future questions and/or concerns with probing questions."
good,"I enjoyed this position and the environment there in, though the salary was low as compared to the workload. I would recommend this to someone very detail oriented and a hard worker"
good,"Typically, The day start with daily scrum calls to discuss about Development efforts, having pretty good discussion on functional requirements about the product owner stories. Before any Development work done on any story it is important to discuss about the good understanding the stories better to make the development effort easy on a platform. Along, the pipeline it is needed to attend other meeting in order to attend other stakeholders meeting via Business analyst and product owners to discuss new stories to provide inputs if a need arise while discussing on each story."
good,This fortune 5 company is driven by their culture. Others are always willing to help. Lots of ways to learn new skills and network with other people. Open space environment
good,UHG offers great benefits with a great work life balance. It offers the ability to have a long standing career. A good place to grow with plenty to offer.
good,Very fast paced. Very repetitive work. Management is very rehearsed with verbiage and little room for human error. Workplace culture is very member-centered. The hardest part of the job is no variety. The most enjoyable part of the job is speaking to the elderly.
good,I don't know much about United Health Care as I worked for  NMHC which was acquired by SXC corporation which later merged with Catamaran. The catamaran was acquired by UHC
good,The pay isn't bad for the type of work. Lots of room for advancement. The option to work from home is amazing ! The management is so-so. The try to manage people and cant even do the job themselves.
good,We have constant overtime and limited staff for the volume of calls we handle. The company is working on hiring more people however you will get burned out quickly. You will make a difference in people’s lives and if that’s important to you then I would recommend this company.
good,Management was supportive and allowed me to take care of the client.  Salary was competitive but overall benefits could have been a little better.  I was given flexibility in my day to day activities.
good,I was able to telecommute. It provided me extra time to do other things such as studying or running errands. It also helped not to deal with traffic every morning.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"My actual work was pretty boring and mindless. So much so that I was able to watch Netflix as I worked and still be one of the most effective and efficient workers on the team. This also was influenced that I just sat down and did my work without taking many breaks since I did not bond with the other employees. The first summer I worked there, there was another employee my age and that was fun because we became friends. The following summer, there was a significant age gap between me and most of the other employees and no one really attempted to get to know me. The work can be kind of isolating. Relationships are formed at breaks. That being said, that was what I wanted at the time and it allowed me to just go home and the end of the day without any baggage or thoughts about work -- meaning I had a decent work-life balance."
good,"worked as part of a team doing remote support,  had several people I was able to count on for help as well give help to others myself."
good,"United Health Care is a good place for employment, I would definitely recommend for anyone. I have learned so much as an administrative assistant and I cant wait to explore new career opportunities."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers get the much needed referrals for healthcare.  They had a workout area to help employees stay fit.  They had a good wellness program and helped employees maintain work/life balance.
good,Awesome work environment. It takes commitment and dedication to succeed in this environment. Being pleasant and have an adaptive attitude is a must. Dedicated management to help you through tough times.
good,Great place to work great team atmosphere! Wages are low! The company is located in an area that many of their employees can not afford. Increase wages and the job would be great!!
good,Good pay but poor benefits for an insurance co. Good to great training presentations and resources. Autonomy to do your job. Issues and difficulty with collaborating with other divisions to complete projects or goals.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and I loved helping people. I was able to help and change the lives of pregnant women. Providing them and helping schedule prenatal appointments. Providing additional support with programs in their state or community.
good,"Answer incoming calls. Received and processed faxed prior authorizations from providers for medications not currently covered by a member’s prescription plan. Assisting members in ordering their medications, assisting with accounting/billing issues. Verifying receipt of prescriptions via mail, fax or escript. Assisting co-workers with questions. Promoted to Prior Authorization department in December 2012."
good,"I loved working there but the drive became to much, but now I would go back if given the opportunity because I live by the Beltway. Best training ever."
good,"Great people to work with and the work is easy. got to learn how to work on the Mitel, Avaya and Cisco voice systems. As well as unity and many other peripherals. the management i was moved to was not the best as he had no clue on how to do my job. the hardest part of the job was working for someone that does not know what their employees do."
good,Experience depends on the position. Can be fulfilling and challenging. Previous work with UHC was telecommute and local travel.  Current position is 8:00-5:00 in hospital.
good,You will basically do the same thing everyday. The hiring process was quick. Training was super long and the company takes care of their employees during natural disasters.
good,I worked with the patient solely.  I did not work in any UHC offices or with any manager(s) directly.  I worked for and with the patient although all protocols were via UHC.  But I was treated very well by UHC when I did have to interact with them.  And they were always prompt in answering any questions or if any assistance was required of them.
good,Call center was high volume.  Worked to resolve patient insurance issues with confidence and success.  Best part of day was knowing that I helped someone.
good,United Healthcare is a great place to work.  The supervisors in the Greensboro location are awesome and care about their people.  They want to see you successful even if it is outside of the company.  Only things that could use improvement are communication amongst management and consistency across the teams.  There is too much shifting around.  One day your paying one policy and under one supervisor and the next day it changes.
good,"Enjoy working and UNITEDHEALTHCARE. Culture training is nice and I absolutely love the people I work with. "
good,A typical day in the broker service center involved a constant steam of calls from brokers about their current book of business and for help with prospective clients. We would then do research while on the phone with the broker providing the answers for the issues called about. Our management acted as SME for issues when we didn't have the answer.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"I worked with United Health Group from 2014-2016 as a licensed Health Ins Agent. Initially I loved the experience. Management was great, training was great and just the overall work environment was great.  Changes started happening within the company such as my site transitioned from Connextions to Optum. Certain departments such as Medicare sales left the site. Building leases ran out.  A big group of us sales agent were given the opportunity to relocate to a new site which we did. Then came the poor management.  It became more of a seat-filling job rather than actually being able to do what we were hired to do, which was to inform and educate members on their policies and ensure they have access to care. That was not always the case because of kps. Over the company and benefits were ideal.  The overall culture changed over time."
good,I have been with United health group for about 4 1/2 yrs.  I believe that it is a great place to work and they do have a lot to offer.  The greatest con is it is extremely difficult to advance in your career.  I spoken with my supervisor and her supervisor and also I have applied for over 100 positions within the last past year and gotten nothing. I recently received my bachelor's degree and this is very disheartening.  It feels like I have given a few years to a company that doesn't want me to advance and because I have spoken up about it seems like no one cares.
good,Love working at Optum. It's fast paced and provide flexibility to work in Agile environment. I learned a lot and having a great time. Optum Circle building is modern and I love the atmosphere.
good,"My typical days of work included answering incoming calls from member, providers, and other agencies which included but not limited to: questions about claims and how they were processed, verify coverage. "
good,"Strong team oriented, environment is very friendly. Teams leads very supportive, focused on improving out communities. I had a minimal experience in the health insurance field, but working UHC I have learned so much."
good,"An excellent company for self-motivated people, particularly in telecommunting positions. Workplace culture is open and supportive. However micromanagement has taken hold of upper management, so bear that in mind when applying."
good,"I loved the ability to be able to work as a telecommuter and have a bit of autonomy.  You have to be able to be a self starter and have to the ability to work without supervision in a telecommuter position. "
good,"The previous employer was excellent.  Never wanted the company to leave or to lose the contract.  I worked for the current employer for only a short time.  Therefore, I am not able to give a review."
good,"Overall a great company, however the pay should be more. And the recruitment process is very unorganized. often times it takes a couple months to hear back from a recruiter on a position you applied for."
good,I personally need more in a job.  But UHC is ok to get started. Its nice to be able to tellecommute but gets lonely at times.  You deff have to make time for outside activities.
good,"As with any large company, it depends on your department. The one I was in changed so many times it was unnerving. There was no continuity and your position never felt safe.  However, earlier in my work experience, it was a great place to work."
good,I love the people. I really enjoy being able to help our members. We are able to answer all their questions without transferring to other departments.
good,"The days are always fast paced, very busy, it can be competitive. Being very busy is a good thing for me, the day goes by quicker. I love dealing with the provider/client communities. My peers & senior leadership are for the most part really great!!"
good,"Fast paced work, inbound/outbound call center with data entry and opportunity for OT. Enjoyed working with co workers, good work/life balance, worked M-F 8-5."
good,"Typically promotes from within."
good,"Working for UnitedHealth Group was stressful, but management attempted to make it as stress free as possible.  Learned a lot about the Healthcare industry.  The company attempted to have plenty of extracurricular activities, while at work to make the work environment my enjoyable.  Fellow co-workers were all wonderful to work with and was a great culture to be a part of daily."
good,This company is really well rounded.  Great structure and salary is somewhat competitive.  They have the ability to offer the tools an employee needs in order to be successful at their job.
good,We do a lot everyday but do not get paid enough. no a bad company but they expect you to be close to perfect while maintaining a lot of job roles. ik wwork from home whitch is a plus but i am looking for somethting with a salary and higher pay.
good,"UHG is a great company with a culture focused on living a healthy lifestyle. They supported a work-life balance with good benefits. At UHG, you have the ability to create your own career path through a diversity of roles within, as well as the opportunity to contribute to positive changes through employee engagement."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I post payments to patients accounts and had to balance at the end of each day. I sent claims and statements and credentialed physicians with the insurance companies.
good,"If you think of problems as treasures and as opportunities to make a meaningful impact, UHG is the right place for you. There are seemingly infinite solutions floating out there in the ether that just need to be identified, developed, and put in place. Never have I worked somewhere where so many people are open to change and new ideas. However, you have to be willing to do the hard work and carve out the time to make the magic happen. It really takes effort. And you have to have the ability to create definition in a highly ambiguous environment."
good,Great entry level job so that you can learn all the about the healthcare industry.  I worked in the Medicare and retirement department and it could be challenging working with seniors because of somewhere experience major health issues and were alone.
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to work with the public - in my case helping Medicaid members with health issues. The challenge was in keeping up with current changes with the individual states we contracted with. Oftentimes the changes came prior to the company having sufficient staff in place to meet the demands. I very much enjoyed my co-workers and supervisors. The atmosphere was one of support and teamwork. I never felt alone in dealing with any challenges that I faced on the job.
good,Compensates adequately for work done. Excellent benefits.  Provides employees with resources to make them easily employable in the event of a lay off.
good,"The staff was very helpful when I needed help. They had an open work space. "
good,The one thing that makes UHG a nice place to work is the flexable work schedule.  Coworkers are very supportive. Employes are given the ability to research and encourage best practices with provider groups.
good,I enjoyed working for them.  There were educational opportunists throughout the year.  Flexible with Dr. appts and such.  It was nice to talk to other co-workers if you were having problems.
good,"UHG is a good solid company to work for, with the ever changing medical world, there is continuous change and the focus is on getting to the bottom line."
good,UHC- offers many work at home positions that allow you to balance work and family life evenly. This helps wonders for the single parent. Their training program is extensive.
good,Strong will survive and move up the corporate ladder. Certain roles expect you to be on call or on the clock for 24x7. Promotion cycle and process is not consistent.
good,"Productive job and doable work, as long as management leadership knows how to run a health care facility."
good,"I dont have a review to leave. United is an okay place to work. Pretty much just like any other call center, just with a major company. You take calls all day."
good,Great work life balance. Live their values and their culture. Best part of my job is the ability to help others achieve their goals. Very flexible and my team is fun to work with
good,"review a typical work day is a ton of calls and you can not resolve half of them. you always have to send it to another person for it to be completed ,"
good,"Training is thorough but you learn more when you actually get on the work floor. Ask questions when you need to! Use every opportunity to understand the process & policies. If you have a manger you can familiarize with LATCH ON! "
good,It is a very solid place to work. If you show up everyday and work hard you will have job security.They don't have a lot of organized training but they are working on it.
good,United Healthcare has been a great company to work for. I have Telecommuted since my first day and am currently in a perfect role for my personality. I love the collaboration with my colleagues to problem solve various roadblocks to ensure we meet corporate standards.
good,Can run into work life balance issues....but often training available...a lot of change with management and turnover. work place culture is good. Can get frustrating in motivation without real authority.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"There is an opportunity for growth within UHC, however It can be stressful at times. There is a lot of support in regards to work , life balance. However there are major opportunities for improvement, within specific areas. All and all a great company!"
good,This was my favorite place to work. I loved it there but they just inter promote from other departments which is rather annoying when your boss doesnt even know the job.
good,"United Healthcare is a good company to work for mainly for the good benefits such as good PTO and ESPP and flexible work time such as ability to telecommute. For the most part, it is a good company to work for, however the main disadvantages is that it is harder to move up and get better compensation, and poor upper management that is slow to communicate in getting things fixed efficiently."
good,"I spent over 10 years at a division of United and enjoyed it.  When the time came to make family changes and move, finding a remote job turned out to be harder than imagined considering the corporate vision and support for work/life balance."
good,Optum is an overall good place to work.  I would recommend working for optum.  My co-workers are all wonderful and always ready to lend a helping hand.
good,I worked in a high stress environment. The people were really nice and I enjoyed the team. There was a high expectation of high quality output and production.
good,There has been too much reorganization with too little overall planning.  Current employees are left to their own devices to find a job in the new organization.
good,"As long as you are on time and ready to work this can be a fun place to work, they have cafeteria and a mini clinic there for your convenience. Some positions are inbound others are not."
good,"Gave me a bigger edge on finding new jobs. The work is very is easy and that's my most enjoyable part. The environment is nice, as well as my officemates."
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  I have seen great managers and some that were not so much.  There is room for advancement, if you are motivated to grow with the company"
good,"Was a decent place to work, the other workers were mostly friendly, good office environment. Strict with rules, manager was helpful and friendly. The work load they expected us to complete was a bit high in my opinion. Some calls were routed improperly, which was frustrating on such tight time constraints."
good,"it's a good place to work."
good,"Team oriented.  Collaborative,  good training.  Busy.  Morning meetings were held every day and strategy for the day's work was discussed.  Managers were available for  any questions or issues."
good,"Foi de grande aprendizado trabalhar no hospital, pude desenvolver minhas habilidades aprendidas no curso técnico e isso me levou a ver uma outra realidade, com ótimos profissionais e ótimos tutores."
good,Most days are not filed with any extra activities except work. Management was always accommodating to requested days off. Coworkers and management all work together in order to provide optimal customer service.
good,The opportunity to learn alot about insurance as a whole. I also had the opportunity to learn diffrent roles. If you want to grow with a company UHG is a good place to do so.
good,"Loved the innovative culture and work.  However, had many transitions that interrupted work and flow often.  I had many supervisors to adjust to and many strategic plans in a short period of time."
good,Typical dat at work nothing was really learned. basic common knowledge the minimum required. most enjoyable part of working there was not having to fill out surveys.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,United Healthcare was very flexible as you could work from home or in the office. This made it easier for employees with a family. Management was easy going.
good,Employed in the Work at home division  for 8.5 years reliable and consistent job advancements.  Utilized my pharmacy and medical knowledge . Assisted in lead department helping peer’s with question related to our job responsibilities
good,"I was able to develop the leadership skills that I needed to advance in my career within United HealthCare from United HealthCare. "
good,United Healthcare does well with allowing staff to balance their work and home life. They also do great with offering paid time off and the ability to bonus quarterly.
good,I enjoyed working in the company and i learned how to handle clients/policy holders attend their needs. The company is part of the fortune 500 companies in the world.
good,"The corporate vision and project direction was clear. The company is using current technologies and Agile practices. The down side is the lack of flexibility for remote work, even though most days I commuted to work, and then spent the majority of the day on phone and video calls with colleagues in other locations all over the US and abroad. Rarely a face-to-face meeting, yet still had to sit or stand at a desk every day.  The Boston location is very cool - near Fenway Park, but housing is very expensive in the area, so long commutes are the norm, and compensation rates are not well aligned to cost of living."
good,not a bad place to work very busy and lots of incoming phone calls specially during open enrollment . not a bad place to work just not enough money form e
good,Optum is a great company to work for. The only problem I had was immature co-workers that made the company look bad. My only advice for the company is that they should hire individuals that are 21 years or older.
good,"My only con is the compensation doesn’t match the job. Otherwise I enjoyed working there. Great cafeteria you’ll never go hungry and I enjoy that they always have some sort of employee event, potluck and gatherings."
good,"Working as a tele commuter and being a mature clinician go hand in hand exceptions are lack of seeing other teammates face to face."
good,"Good company to work for, networking helps in job security.  Communication between business could improve to ensure optimal collaborations and economic efficiencies."
good,Atmosphere was great and the culture was very supportive of its employees. Stress-free environment and the work load was appropriate. Job security was always an issue. Upper management remained silent about the future of the company. Eventually they addressed to the company as a whole to reassure everyone that all was well. We all knew they were covering up the truth. Eventually everyone was laid-off.
good,Working with UHG allows me to have and maintain a great home work life balance. Telecommuting allows me to contribute professionally and do my part to support our customers.
good,"Group Tele-sales representative; there is a lot to learn but the training  program is great. It is a pay for performance position. The attendance policy is pretty strick, so make sure that your vactions are planned. Overall a great expirence and the compensation is good if you want to put in the hours."
good,"Love working there.  No room for growth and new manager makes the job hard most days.  She is a sweet person, but she acts more like certain employees"
good,Okay place to work. On holidays and with voluntarily overtime they provide free food and many fun games to keep the day rolling.may fun perks like employee discounts
good,"A typical day at work: manageable, good balance."
good,"United Healthcare provided good insurance benefits, along with retirement benefits. Management was fair to employees and vested in the employees job performance."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I liked working from home and would like to do so again.  I will consider work at home positions in the future.  It was a great experience.  I liked the people that I worked with and continue to stay in touch.
good,"Atendimento ao cliente de alta complexidade, aprendi a liderar, ambiente coeso, difícil rendição, agradável era a equipe."
good,"I enjoyed the diversity and multiple tasks."
good,"Job is a call center like job, great people. The job is a typical call center day--currently working under the ancillary services segment. The people are great."
good,Job Descriptions are no so accurate.  Find out what each items on description entails.  I found out i had to sacrifice a whole lot of my personal life time to make the job work.
good,"Company culture is fair, in most of the projects it would be employee friendly and work from home option would give us peace during peak work time. Provides better transportation, as-usual like in many companies here and there you can see internal politics."
good,"Good pay for call center work, however job can be stressful and demanding.  Work is constantly tracked and monitored along with time on and off phone."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed being on a team and collaborating on procedural changes and process updates.  However, you mostly work alone taking in-bound calls back to back.  I loved this at first.  Talking to strangers who are your friend by the end of the call!  But after a while, it became boring, if you will.  The same call, call after call.  No room for advancement, no room for pay increases that mattered."
good,Working from home was great until I had to move due to a divorce.  My apartment at the time did not have a place for my office.  Other than that is what a great place to work.
good,"Excellent work team, supportive management.  My Insight Global representative went above and beyond to assist in a successful completion of this contract."
good,At United UHC your typical work could be very good or it could be very stressful with and the different rule and regulation that medicare have set.  On a good day if the systems are working properly things can be very peaceful.  You would learn something knew almost everyday because of changes with medicare .   Manangement could be a little pushy on thing depending on how many calls are in the que waiting.  The culture there was very diverse and balance.  The hardest part of the job was giving the information correctly to the client because sometime the info you had learn prior might have been update or changed.  The most enjoyable part of the the was the volunteer work we did at Feeding America.
good,Very fast paced.  Culture is very competitive.  People were great to work with.  Work life balance is a challenge.  Most management positions required at least 60 hour work week.
good,"Good place to work, tough place to advance. Fun, and everything was good, but it's very departmentalized. By this, I mean you may get put into one division where there may be nowhere to advance to, and going outside that department is always more difficult."
good,fast paced and professionally productive day. Team building skills developed internally and the staff morale was great.  Training and on the job skills were taught at a adequate time span.
good,"Worked for UHS out of Binghamton. The comments still apply. Innovative and advancing place to work. High paced with overtime available if you want it. Competitive vacation time which sometimes seniority helps with. Hospital rules and unit rules some time differ, so must ask out front, but are usually workable. Many mandatory classes and skill reviews on your own time."
good,"My experience at United Healthcare was what you would expect working at such a large employer.  Coworkers were great but at the end of the day your made to feel like a number in the 80,000+ employees."
good,"Its very comfortable to work over there. As a Sr Cloud DevOps engineer I was Leading two teams . The atmosphere was good to work but there will be lot of pressure because of on coming deadlines ."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I had an an extensive career with United Healthcare. The unfortunate reality is the ever changing structure and reorganization that caused my departure.
good,I like the environment because you were given a task/your job requirements and then you were left to do your job unless there was a needed coaching session in which they would have a meeting with you to go over you work performance and give guidance
good,Taking inbound calls to service customers for HSA's and notional accounts. Standard call flow and call center expectations. My supervsior treated me with the utmost respect and caring. While I enjoyed coworkers I felt it was time to move on.
good,"Great company to learn and grow with. Compensation and healthcare benefits could be better, but overall it's a fairly decent company. Fresh fruit, popcorn and juice every other Friday is awesome!"
good,"I had fun working there. I like the fact that I could work independently.  People were okay. Some would gossip a little much, but if you stay to yourself. No problems there."
good,"I enjoyed working at UHC as there were no phone time constraints , or average handle time , or Hold time on the phones , yet the job managed to get done . And it was reflected on the compliments and feed back we would get from the members"
good,"I enjoyed working with the company. Very fun place to work."
good,"UHC keeps you busy and challenges you to grow.  Nice people, okay work conditions.  Very tight with raises,  You will learn a lot.   My last manager taught me a lot about clin ops."
good,"Typical day consisted of conducting audits on the auditors, analyzing audit data and training new hires on various audit processes.   "
good,Overall United Health was a great company with great benefits. Over the years the healthcare market has changed and things have not been as stable. The environment have been a very stressful place to be in. The management staff have always been great and very open.
good,"Excellent place to work . All team members are very co-operative. there in Optum no body bother   you as long as you are doing your work responsibly, that why i like the Optum"
good,"I still work at the company and have been for over 14 years or more. Our company was purchased by United Healthcare a few years ago and the unfortunately the culture changed. It went from a smaller family style, to a larger more corporate, silo business structure. While that is ok in some aspects, it does tend to affect the morale of the staff as a whole and the majority of the folks that were with our company have now been let go. There are literally only a handful of us left. While I appreciate the opportunities afforded to me, I feel that the pay I had prior to United's purchase was better, but I am thankful for the job that I have and things I have been able to learn. I do enjoy the work at home job I have had for the last two years and the things I have taught myself to do in this new role. My new manager has been awesome and if I were to ever leave the company, it really would be strictly for the salary issue, as I don't have any issues with management as a whole. If there are issues, we can raise them with our boss, and she will attend to them and push that up the chain as needed to get things addressed appropriately."
good,This was a contract job so we did not get paid time off or benefits. Hourly wages are good but training is lacking. 
good,"I disliked working for UnitedHealthcare, but loved working for Optum, which is part of UnitedHealth Group. "
good,"I loved my job at Teleperformance, and I had a passion for helping our members of United Health Care.  I had a traumatic incident occur in my life so unfortunately my career path there ended abruptly.  If I could I would go back in a heart beat because I made a difference in peoples lives and that company gave me a purpose."
good,United Health Group is the most diversified health care company in United States and a leader worldwide in helping people live healthier lives and helping to make the health system work better for everyone. It is a great privilege for anyone to work in a reputed company like yours when I read about your company I found that my skills are matching your req

good,"Established and large player in Healthcare. A lot of talented individuals work here."
good,UHC is a fast paced organization creating innovative ways to expand the market place and provide the most current benefits for its members.  They work diligently to build value based relationships with their provider network and are the best in class when it comes to healthcare administration.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,This company gives you a lot be thankful about. Does not ask you to do overtime only when it is necessary and crucial. And gives training for you to progress in your career.
good,The teams are small and very overworked.  The transition is to move to Agile but there is a big split between IT and Business.  A lot of reorganization is going on every month and the stress levels are high.
good,"It was a mail order pharmacy so it was a fast paced job, daily goals as a group and personal. A lot of standing. But the job was easy as long as you stayed focused."
good,"handle day  to day calls"
good,"clerical unit multiple  taks, learned all taks within unit, busy, culture hinged on coworkers, hardest part was having to deal with slower unproductive coworkers"
good,"As a contractor, I liked the variety of projects and the ability to work full time from my home office.  The hours are sometimes difficult because I am in a different time zone."
good,Enjoyed working at UHC. Great benefits. The people are very nice and the culture is fair and inviting. The work was steady and challenging. I would certainly recommend this company to anyone looking for a great place to work that has great benefits.
good,"Great work/life balance, decent comp, worked from home, good management, decent benefits, good PTO, great experience while working at MSI, learned a lot."
good,I have worked at United Healthcare for almost 5 years and it has taught me much knowledge about the insurance industry.  I would recommend the company for career driven individuals.

good,Great company to work for. Excellent staff and I enjoyed all of the people there. Great salary and the benefits were great. Looking forward to psossible fgoingdgf
good,"I enjoyed working with UHC.  The work was "
good,"The experience at United Health care considered of experiences with customer service, call center, health insurance, dental insurance and rx orders. The other employees, supervisors, and managers were all helpful during the work experience. I loved the benefits offered at United. I would recommend United to other job seekers."
good,"its a 9-5 you will have good days and bad ones, there are always people that will help you if u need the help, closes at 6 pm Monday thru Friday no weekends"
good,If you like call centers then you would probably like working here. I had a amazing manager. Upper Management however is not my cup of tea. The health insurance benefits is not good! Its like whats the point of working for an health insurance company if your going to make me pay all this money out of pocket every time I go to the doctor.
good,Friendly people to work for. Trainers were very helpful and always invited questions. Co-workers were very friendly and made it inviting to enjoy work.
good,"OptumRx is a great company to work for and the work is pretty simple, but its very busy and fast paced. The pay is good, and you do get the option to work from home in some positions. My problem (and the problem most people there have) is management. The highest is the director. He's amazing and if you actually explain things to him, he will bat for you every time. But the problem is every manager under him. They are all about unrealistic expectations. There are quarterly bonuses in some positions, but even if you do well enough to get it, you still have to be looking over your shoulder and kissing butt for job security. The micromanaging there is overwhelming. But, if you're willing to kiss butt and keep to yourself, it's a great place to make a career."
good,It's a great work place for individuals that like to do telemarketing on a daily basis.  The best part of the job experience for me was the training class.
good,"Learn how to speed read, Process & Understand Medical Claims & Billing.  The Hardest part having to read a lot in order to receive one answer.  You become a number expected to work Quantity over Quality of work."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"This job offered paid training. Staff was prepared well to facilitate helping client find the right insurance to meet their needs. The atmosphere, though fast paced, was rewarding due to working as a team."
good,"Ambiente tranquilo de trabalho , política interna interessante."
good,"As a Work From Home Position, this position has a great flexibility. My supervisor and manager are wonderful. However, the company was recently taken over by UnitedHealth Group under the OptumServe Umbrella, so there will be changes. "
good,"Sempre em busca de diferenciação do mercado de saúde suplementar através de inovações e grande senso de preocupação com o cliente, seja o beneficiário ou credenciado médico/odonto."
good,"Typical programming shop.  Do more with less.  Change directions at a moments notice,  management not sure of overall compnay plan.  If your app is not important to profit, less involement from upper management"
good,"I used to work for Research and analytics wing of United Health group . I helped UHG team to build statistical models and made them robust in terms of stability and accuracy Using R."
good,Receive in depth training. Building is up to date and nice. Quiet environment. The hardest part is locating some information to provide the correct information.
good,Empresa com ambiente agradável de se trabalhar porém não possuía nenhuma plano de carreira.
good,The company was upfront about what was going on with the company. New what direction we were heading. Was not left in the dark when it came to changes. They ensured we had the tools and resources to manage the changes.
good,The company is very large and disconnected. Working from home is an option for those interested. Compensation is not adequate with the national standards.
good,"It is a good company who observes employee benefits. The facilities is advanced and work place is nice.Although most often than not, mandatory overtime is needed."
good,The company was a good company. They had a good work culture and great team motivational practices. They also gave their employees the option of working from home which was great
good,"I enjoy learning new things as I meet new people and there families. The hardest part of the job is getting attached to clients and they pass on, in the hospital for a length of time and or our schedules are not compatible."
good,"competitive work place, worked under xerox corporation. learned a lot of time management skills and working together to reach goals quickly. worked 8 hours. manager was okay"
good,"Healthy work atmosphere. Learned some new things in my field. Attended training sessions, taken inputs from the experts from the same. "
good,I enjoy working at UHC.  It provides opportunity to learn and to advance if and when you are ready.  I enjoy working with my providers and helping them find resolution to their issues.
good,My experience at United Health Care has been amazing. I believe that you can make any job position a great experience if you put in the hard work and dedication.

good,"I have enjoyed my time working at Medsynegies a great deal.  It is not by choice that I am leaving. I would not recommend them to anyone because as of 12/22/17 they will no longer be Medsynergies but will become Optum 360.  "
good,The problem I had was year over year they would restructure our commissions to where we were selling more and making less money. Other than that the people are very nice and helpful.
good,"work life balance, great salary and career choices.  Offer many internal learning opportunities and culture trainings.   Company is invested in its employees."
good,"The life cycle of the project, no job security....."
good,"Good work environment."
good,Empresa com grande potencial de crescimento profissional.
good,"This is a good company and fair when it comes to compensation, benefits, and advancement opportunities. Continuing education incentives are very difficult to obtain if you're not working in a clinical department"
good,"United Healthcare started off as a great place to work, and the perception was that my career was going to be long-lived, but job security was not stable.  The company provided excellent training."
good,"Great group of people to work for with great values.  The company truly cares about the clients, policyholders, and employees.  The difficult part about the day is that you have different shifts and depending on your shift you can get out late, owever the client is never treated like just a number and there are many options to help with out of pocket costs."
good,"Challenging company to work for but I was able to grow a lot professionaly and personally."
good,Working at UHC was ok.  Some Supervisors are there in name only and do not provide coaching/positive feedback.  I thought medical benefits were costly considering you worked for the company that provided benefits.
good,"This was my first job in Insurance and it was like learning a different language. It was tough at first, but then I got the hang of it with training. I enjoyed my time there as an account coordinator and I met a lot of nice people. I left because I was getting married and moving out of the city."
good,"Publicly traded company, answerable to stockholders and hence management takes hard decisions. Doesn't consider people who have put 10+years of experience in the company."
good,"Very heavy workload; however, the teamwork is amazing. The management is always looking to improve processes so that the external customers are satisfied."
good,"Good paying registry, alot of working hours they provide. Very professional, on time paydays, accomodating, always keep in touch with you, i like travelling"
good,"UHG is a good place to work, it's a fortune 500 company with great benefits. They also give you the option to work from home in most departments after 6 months."
good,"This company is tops in their field. However, the jobs are contingent upon government contracts. The work environment is very fast paced and extremely stressful due to trying to maintain job performance expectations."
good,"After Tricare government contract expired seeking continuing work in coding with medical certification."
good,Good training and follow-ups. Benefits cost high which detracts from what you bring home in salary. Co-workers and managers helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Com os problemas que existem em algumas áreas, a maior dificuldade é fazer a correção e melhoria do ambiente através da conscientização, pois muitos usuários estão mais preocupados com seus afazeres do que com a proteção dos dados"
good,It was a great place to work until my position was eliminated. I worked with a variety of people/teams on a number of varied and interesting projects.
good,"Central support function for Enterprise capital management.  Interactions with management, peers and support staff on a daily basis. Qtrly FP&A process to manage.   Counsel and advise on business case preparedness."

good,I enjoyed working for UHG.  It was a very stressful job but the compensation was good.  I would work there again if I had better training.  The company offered room for growth.
good,"Great company and an outstanding manager. Unfortunaltely I am leaving this company since quite a few of the project have been put on hold. Given another opty, I would go back to my old job"
good,UHG being a insurance industry has no sunset and therefore provides job security at the highest level and the pace at which it grows each year is tremendous. The only downside is the plethora of levels in the hierarchy which makes the career growth very slow when compared with the market standards.
good,"I enjoyed the environment, but I don't believe staff is trained properly. Hours are good and flexible shifts that get rotated, some mandated hours, but not too often."
good,Having worked on other areas of this industry before I appreciate getting to know how much and how many are involved in the day to day options of the carrier side. If your are a driven and self motivated individual you will do well.
good,"work cultural environment is nice"
good,"The project is challenging, the manager is kind, team members are hard working and with good technical skills. They just begin using Agile development life cycle, and always make new ideas and changed the teamwork mode to find out the best way to do."

good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,This job was enjoyable in that I got to help people all day long with any questions they had about their medical benefits. It only became stressful when we got new management and had to meet so many metrics. I felt that they only cared about numbers and not the members on a personal level.
good,"very people oriented, multi-culture and age group"
good,"Good place to work and settle your life."
good,"UHC provided me with a challenging work environment and the ability to grow and telecommute. "
good,"United Healthcare is a great company to work for, and very demanding. As a company I would recommend it for anyone that is looking for a career with United Healthcare."
good,"Productive working environment, great pay scale, opportunity to work from home, advancement opportunities. Learned to work with United Medical Contracts and usage of various contracting and medical product databases. work well with others.  Most difficult part was grasping the various contract language."
good,I loved working here. It was a cool environment and advancement was very easy. My lead was a cool chick and made it easy to come to her with life issues when I need time off or anything.
good,"Work life balance can be a struggle and upper management can be poorly organized or structured in certain segments. However, work can be very fulfilling and achievements are recogbized."
good,Great opportunities for advancement and compensation. There could be more compassion for life outside of work and attendance. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"It's a wonderful place to gain experience, the CEO and managers live the culture and putting our members and providers first. It is hard to advance here however, because we are a smaller location."
good,"Culture is great but more of leadership needs to exude and live these values.  There needs to be stronger support lent to leaders.  Great pay, room for advancement, opportunity to work at home."
good,"Management was awful.  They picked who advanced based on who was there favorite and buddies. Overall the company was excellent to work for, loved the 401k and benefits they offered."
good,The work experience was good the company was very productive at one time we took many insurance the company doctors was very helpful and kind and willing to educate and help keep us intelligent and well informed to give good service.
good,"hours change a lot last min OT ,calls can be up and down but when they become busy ot rolls out you may have to stay late or come early the next day and work on off day"
good,There are plenty of positions available with opportunities to work from home. Customer service/call center environment but there are other positions available where you're not on the phones all day.
good,I learned many IT applications and had a great group of people in my Distributed Group. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help people.
good,"I have learned a lot with Unitedhealth Group. Had fun in everyday work. Learned to be a good team player, Fun work place with fun team members. Always do good on every project."
good,"good place great management , great training and support they take time to make sure you understand your role and provide hands on experiences great culture"
good,Provides flexibility like working from Home but compensation is low. Have good Project Management tool to work with. Annual review is more stereo typed rather than innovative.
good,"Company gives chance to everyone to enhance their skills and maximize their capability in other areas so that they can compete in current changing environment."
good,I worked my way up through the company. I did find it heartbreaking when I was excluded from new training when the full department was learning. I felt they did not see me as having the ability and I did learn by myself. Eventually laid off.
good,"Optum is growing rapidly.  Customer service/product offerings are numerous and complex. Finding how your piece fits is daunting.  There are very intelligent leaders at the helm.  However, that trickle down to middle management leaves something to be desired.  I have had both respectable and intelligent managers, along with those who are very good at corporate speak and are not effective.  Depending on department the typical day looks different, i.e finance/accounting is cyclical on monthly/quarterly basis leading to longer days.  Most enjoyable part are being able to forge solid relationships with those not only in your immediate working group, but those you sit around and get to know.  This translates to when moving along in the organization and still being connected with people."
good,"Job is very relaxed, upper management doesn't really bother you much unless you are not meeting metrics. Flexible schedule is awesome. Really my only qualm is sometimes the metrics can be a bit demanding, and that the job itself is really quite boring. It is a cube farm, sit at the desk all day type of job, so if you are a person constantly needing to move I would consider that."
good,"I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Working here is very overwhelming,but if you canwork under pressure it may be a good fit. I take inbound calls and assist members in answering questions about their health insurance."
good,Very happy working here. Environment is great and co-workers are fantastic. Schedules are flexible. Benefits are top of the line:great dental and health insurance.
good,"This place gave me more room to grow. They kept their word on promises of bonuses and the crew was supportive of each other. Management could have been improved, they, at many times, were not useful and we had to fend for ourselves with helping the members. We all got along, had many laughs and in the end, it was a job that we succeeded in."
good,UHC was a great place to work. It was more of a family and not just a job. The management was great and they took care of their workers in every way possible. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that its a either you or me type job.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, and I loved what I did. however, management needs to learn to actually talk to their employees about anything, the good or bad."
good,Answered 150 to 160 appointment scheduling calls per day. Sent emails and faxes to the appropriate medical clinic. Called the appropriate medical clinic when a patient had an emergency.
good,they do not put there employees first when working there at the one in greensboro. they do have good benefits an great pay
good,"A typical work day would be an environment that is peaceful, healthy and fun, all while learning to perfect the craft of the job. "
good,"Serving a diverse population to bridge gaps in health and personal care needs."
good,"Fun people to work for. Could be stressful working with the agents as they can be very demanding and  short tempered. "
good,A great organization to work with but a slow response rate to industry advancement and availability of newer opportunities. A few people in leadership roles have a lot of opportunity to grow into their current role to be effective.
good,"Catamaran was a good place to work.  There was close communication between managers, supervisors, and their teams. The work was important, helping our customers understand their health benefits and helping them get the medications they needed in a timely manner."
good,"Started as a fresher, its a good place to work as a standby until you find a new job. Not a good place to look for a career in the long run since there is no progress."
good,My daily duties changed regularly'  but I really enjoyed the constant challenges. I found everyone there to be very enjoyable.
good,United healthcare  is a very nice company to work.  There very understanding when it comes to family  matters.  They do give great bonuses and lots of over time
good,The company offers flexible schedules and great benefits. The company standards are high when it comes to how the providers and members are treated. Management is great.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"Great place to work to build experience in healthcare. There is continuous change and growth, that can make it challenging but fun. Develop skills quickly such as time, priority and project management."
good,"Worked as a Hadoop developer in United Health Group for nearly 2 years as a fulltime employee in offshore Hyderabad, India location. It is indeed a wonderful experience and team is well managed."

good,"Relaxed environment"
good,"Very busy, always something to do. I moved positions fairly quickly. Lots of merges with other PBMS. Lots of drama in the call center environment"
good,UHC is a good place to work. You learn valuable information about the medical insurance industry. Also ways to apply the ethics & core values in your everyday role.
good,"I've enjoyed over 13 years with UHC but looking for a different path and location change. I've worked in customer service, I've been a customer advocate , sales support, training, claim's supervisor and appeal's supervisor. Every job had been a rewarding  experience and I've learned so many beneficial task and life experiences. Great company to work and grow."
good,Uhg is  a good place to work. now it is capitalised by Optum. We are working for Optum. I have been working since 6 years and I did not feel any pressure while working.
good,UHG is a very good company to work with . But the work pressure is too high and the team in too big . The best part is that UHG is very flexible in offering remote work which helped me a lot.
good,"Sign in on phones 8 hours a day, taking incoming calls from physician's, nurses, pharmacies corresponding on behalf of the prior authorizations request."
good,nothing really to say good company good culture more opportunity for advancement needed but love my current manager always something different
good,Catamaran was a fun and fast growing company with good pay and good benefits. There were plenty of opportunities for advancement. There were often free lunches and motivational events.
good,Great work experience. I learned about how the medical field operates. I also learned about customer service as far as how to be customer friendly and listen to the customer.
good,Ok place to work good hours and work/life balance. People who are in management positions aren't the smartest. Depending on job function there is little to no OT.
good,"Cohesive team, dedicated to impeccable care to patients and families.  Extraordinary interdisciplinary team members who exhibit respect and admiration internally as well as in the community."
good,United Health Group is a great company however if you disagree and dislike a job where they micro manage everything you do on your PC. United Health Group is not the job for you.
good,"Medsynergies is an ok company, they were still growing when I worked there and had a lot of run for improvement. If anything they could have offered more compensation for the work done."
good,Working at C3/UHC taught me about about compassion. Learned Great skills. Fun people to be around. The pay is just not worth the amount of work to be done.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I enjoy being able to help people so this is a job that allows me to do just that. I have learned so many new skills while being employed with them. I love a challenge and this job has been a challenge.
good,"Face to face customer service with members who come in with questions about there medical and dental insurance. Provide excellent customer service. Respond to complex customer calls. Resolve customer service inquires which include: billing and payment issues, customer material requests, physician assignments, authorization for treatment, explanation of benefits, works independently."
good,Professional environment with many workplace advancement opportunities. Many events to keep stress levels low. Nice campus with cafeteria and pond. Very happy professional environment.
good,I enjoy my job daily.  Monthly meetings to recognize employees and to keep employees informed of how the company is doing boost morale.
good,The company it self is huge. However depending on the person it can be hard to advance. Sometimes it feels like it depends on who you know. Benefits are bad but not the worst none of the plans have copays all are high deductibles. Stress plays a huge factor in making sure you are meeting stats.
good,"A typical day at UHC was really nothing more that clocking in, working and clocking out"
good,"A great place to work if you're looking to gain a lot of experience. However, compensation is not that competitive. The workload fluctuates; you can go from having no work to being completely flooded & not sure if you'll ever come up for air."
good,"Management expects the best of their team and are willing to push to get it.  The culture is hard work pays off. They pay for performance and if you are a hard worker, this will be a great fit!"
good,"Very consistent place for work. Difficult product information to understand at first, but soon after gaining understanding, very easy to navigate."
good,"answering calls for customers that challenges you to be more human with your clients. "
good,"Good place to work, positive environment, pay is good, benefits available not great policies. Room for growth and plenty of opportunities"
good,"As long as you did your work with quality and efficiency, there was no micro-managing.  There was lot of direction and support, I regret resigning."
good,6 month contract position with long but thorough training.  The work is challenging but many tools and resources are offered for reference.   Open enrollment is a very stressful time with many hours of overtime.   Department management is great about doing what they can to ease the stress of this busy time.

good,"A Amil de forma geral é uma boa empresa. Nela tive a oportunidade de estar conhecendo sobre liberação de benefícios e contratos de planos de saúde. Os dias na empresa são de contato direto com a gerência, pois como o setor trata de liberação, muitas decisões precisam ser tomadas junto a direção o que torna o ambiente mais unificado, não somente em relação a diretoria como também no relacionamento com os colegas de trabalho. Em alguns momentos temos dificuldade quando se trata de negar algum tipo de benefício ao paciente por motivos contratuais, mas como em todo lugar devemos zelar pela organização e bom andamento nos processos da empresa. A parte agradável é quando percebemos que de alguma forma podemos contribuir para a satisfação de nossos clientes/ pacientes."

After this you would round on your patients after speaking with the rounding physician. While rounding a determination would be made as to when the patient was being discharged and discharge planning would begin. At this same time the chart would be reviewed to determine if patient met criteria for Obs or Inpatient and Milliman was used to determine length of stay. You may have up to 5 facilities to round on depending on where the patients were from your clinic. One day per week you would attend a PCC mtg with the clinic(s) you were responsible for to discuss patients cases, their outcomes, and to determine if they needed to be picked up by disease management or needed a social work/case management follow-up visit at home. This meeting would usually occur around the lunch hour and lunch was provided. After rounding on patients you would need to contact their family members to discuss discharge planning needs. If the patient is being transferred to a SNF you would need to coordinate this as well or arrange for home health and social work. After this was completed you would enter in any clinical or discharge information as needed. If the patient was in a SNF you would need to issue a NOMNC to the patient or family (Wellmed is a MSO for Medicare) and document this in your charting.

However, you can expect that much of the learning process will be dependent upon your ability to access online resources to enable you to be successful at your job.  You need to be able to work within a highly matrixed organization."
good,"Working with a variety of clients within their homes allows for a different learning experience each day. The support provided by fellow employees was amazing. Given the teams are fairly small, it was almost a familial atmosphere where each person was willing to help the other, rather than act as their competitor."
good,"UHG values workplace culture, they strive to find a work/life balance. Management is always in touch with the employees through quarterly Town Hall Meetings and surveys."

good,Need to be resourceful in order to find answers to questions/concerns. You will be learning something new everyday. Very large company with opportunity to grow. Hardest part of the job is having the potential to do more but application process for internal candidates is not any easier. Contacting the HR representative does not provide any additional insight.
good,There was mutual respect among team members. Managers were overwhelmed usually. Pay was better than most software engineer jobs that allow remote work.
good,A typical work day includes incoming calls with questions about benefit coverage and my job is to find the clinical issues based on recommendations or trigger words.  My management team is very open and responsive to issues.  Workplace culture is big on customer satisfaction.  The hardest part is selling my skills to the caller because they are not expecting to speak with a nurse.  The most enjoyable part is helping those in need with the unexpected.
good,The company is worthy. They gave us a worthy salary base on our duty. But please give employees a break when calamities are strong like recently the taal volcanic eruption. It may harm your employee’s health
good,This is a great company that continues to innovate and is looking to improve.  The company needs to continue to work on aligning better it's interest with employees.

good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

good,Production is key as an HCC Coder.  5.7 charts an hour need to be coded and that is a lot.  Just a heads up.  Health insurance is extremely expensive.
good,"It's a cool job I enjoyed working there. I would've liked to stay longer but my job ended to soon. It was easy and I really enjoyed the short time I was there, should've lasted longer."
good,"Can't say enough great things about this company. They are customer focused, employee focused and truly live their stated values."
good,"UHC is a good place to work, there are places for improvement, but overall pretty good.  There is growth opportunity,  but you can't expect to be mediocre and still move up.  The two things bofhere me is the medical benefits package, it can be better...and the tuition reimbursement program...it is not productive as it applies to classes taken for your current position."
good,"This company had a friendly enviornment with the opportunity to excel and advance. Management was easy to get along with, organized, and detail oriented."
good,"I believe they're to strict on the wording for quality but understand it's because of cms guidelines, otherwise its a great place to work! I enjoyed my job and the opportunity to work in other areas as well as how they give great opportunity for bonuses. The training is excellent and I'd definitely recommend it to others."

good,"If you're able to withstand guidelines for advancement, United Health Group can be a great place to work long term. Gain as much knowledge as you can, and be very specific early on about your desire to advance. Otherwise, you could be overlooked when the time comes to be considered for promotions."
good,"The company was good. They pay well, but they have frequent layoffs. I was only with the company 5 months before my program ended and was laid off, but enjoyed my time there while it lasted."
good,I no longer work there due to health problems I had. Wish to work there again from home someday. Great group of people. Employees were like family and helping people have me great satisfaction. Great pay and room for advancement is a plus also.

good,"I was a software engineer intern at Optum. Put on a team of 4 other interns and extremely relaxed culture. I wasn't too passionate about the work, but lots of time to just have fun with ping pong tables. Lots of intern events."
good,The hours are good and they provide mentorship program to learn new skills. There is good worklife balance. The hardest part of the job is meeting the daily numbers they require.
good,"While I worked for UHC, I worked in 3 different roles. I worked from home the entire time I was employed. The culture was excellent. The attitude to improve and be innovative was incredible."
good,"Optum (UHG tech branch) is a good company that cant get out of its own way.  Healthcare in general is behind with regard to tech, and Optum was no exception.  I loved the people and the mission, but their insurance really really sucks - 12000 deductible and an HSA"
good,"Experience at United was a rewarding one where they gave you opportunities to become better skilled in areas to excel with your position. I was an IT Director where I was a mediator between the business community and the technology side. The hardest part of the position is trying to meet the need of the business in a timely manner, based on the size, cost and scope of the work. Primary goal was meeting the customers need in an effective and efficient manner."

good,Great place to work with excellent culture. A lot of value placed on employees and customers alike. All activities are done with those receiving care in mind. High expectations for employees in a very fast environment.
good,The company itself is amazing to work for and the benefits. On the other hand management and some leadership are not leaders and communication is just awful.  They talk down to you and treat you as if you are not doing a good job especially when you go above and beyond what you do.
good,"For the most part, everyone okay United HealthCare really puts an effort to support work life balance.  They have really good vacation time compared to other companies, and ensure that you use up most of that time."

good,Pleasant place to work and good management staff. Not a fan of the dress code being that we do not interact with members. Pay is competitive. I have learned a lot.
good,"Good company, just wasn't for me. Patient population was educating and challenging. I needed more hands on aspect of my working condition. Telephonic pros includes work-life balance, no  on-call and no mandatory overtime"
good,Daily activities included designing programming code to automated extraction of client records because the client would not give us the necessary access to obtain the records needed to save them millions.  I did learn amazing best practices from some coding geniuses but we were expected to obtain unrealistic reimbursement goals from hypothetical forecasts.  You work remote 3 out of 5 days a week and typically never had to work weekends.
good,"UHC is a really good Company to work, however. Need more organizations to create better opportunities to growth professionally. I'm a current employee and I have applied for internal transfer, for relocation to Orlando and I still waiting."
good,"I am a telecommuter, i spend most of my day assisting manager/supervisor with inventory control and pulling reports for both on and offshore employees."
good,There is never a dull moment at UnitedHealthcare. Very busy workdays filled with daily reporting deliverables to new business sales staff and existing business account management teams.
good,"United is a great place to learn new skills and learn about the dynamic, fast-paced and ever changing health care industry. United provides many, varied leaning and training opportunities."
good,The only bad thing I could say is that the hours were not flexible. They also work on CST and living on the west coast makes it a little tough. Working 6am to 3pm MST is a little rough.
good,A great company just very unorganized. I really enjoyed it just wasnt for the favoritism. I love the commercial side of the company. I would work on the government side if I did it again.
good,"Pro's:::"
good,"Nice facility, flexibility with work - life balance, collaborative atmosphere, decent pay and quarterly bonuses. You are recognized for your achievements and frequently rewarded for them."
good,Mandatory Overtime was my only issue.  You are on a fixed schedule but schedule can change every quarter.  Your production reflex your schedule.  It also can be difficult if a single parent with no help.
good,"UHC really emphasizes work/life balance. I work with amazing and smart people. "
good,"I have found it quite rewarding working with team members within our organization who reside all over the world. There is not really such a thing as a typical day, I like the variety and opportunities that come with that type of environment where new challenges are presenter regularly."

good,United HealthGroup is a great place to work and has a lot of benefits to offer however if you looking to grow with the company due to 3rd party recruitment advancement or transferring opportunities are very limited in the company.
good,A typical day at the workplace would be full of daily task and reports to review. The company is a good place personal and professional growth and development. There were often many structural changes that caused an employee to be flexible and adapt to changes. Some of the changes were related to management changes and systematic changes. With constant changes I learned not to get comfortable. The environment itself is a very casual and relaxed environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people live healthier lives.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was being a mentor to staff. Watching them grow. Training was a big part of my job. Also making sure all the documentation was up to date and easy for the staff to understand when doing their doing daily job entering cases.

good,"Working from home was a great experience. Management provided great support to their employees. Overall, united healthcare group is a great company to work for."

good,"Overall working for this organization , provided me with a great insight to the healthcare world, and provided me with a way to gain skills need to succeed in the healthcare and health insurance world."
good,The company provided cute incentives and different means of compensation for their employees; There were team building exercises to promote a unity and togetherness.
good,"Company pays quite well. The benefits arw second to none. The PTO is probably the best out there and you receive medical coverage from day 1, unlike other companies where you have to wait."
good,"good company.  Lots of opportunity.  must like working and interacting by computer, rarely face to face contact with collegues or members.  overall company culture is improving"
good,Love to work. Keeps it challenging and great team culture. Like the Kanban development methodology for Operations department. Gained lot of business knowledge of NEMIS system of UHG and became an SME in fact.
good,"Motivated employees with contest and gifts overall a fun place to work for. They trained employees well,managers were well to work with had a open door policy, answered calls for people with disabilities"
good,"It is a great place to work with great benefits but some management is awful. Hours are great and steady. Paid time off, 401k and medical and dental is offered as well."
good,The company seems to be a great fit for someone that needs flexibility.  The work life balance is good.  They allow several days to work from home.  Can be overwhelming because it is such a large organization.
good,"great place to start your career, the starting pay and the benefits are great. I noticed it is sort of difficult to be promoted from within, at least in my experience. I know others found external opportunities to get a salary raise as well."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"Everyday endless meetings, learned skills below my level. Management is decent and good culture. The hardest part of the job was to maintain their tedious documentation processes. The best partwas co-workers and walks in the nice park"
good,"The work is interesting, especially Workflow, Electronic Financial Record (eFR) and Computer Assisted Coding Applications. QA engineers are assigned stories that include testing tasks and work involves either planning for tests or executing tests. Many Managers I experienced were people who didn't have the technical acumen to fully understand the work required for testing and/or automation. The hardest part of the job was explaining the time needed for analysis so that we could do a good job designing test cases. The most enjoyable part of the job was applying my engineering skill to find bugs that others would not otherwise have found."
good,"You are able to flex your work schedule.  Being able to work from 6am-9:30a as a start time was helpful. If needed, you were able to split your day and still complete an 8 hour day."
good,"While UHC was an excellent employer, it is not for everyone. I struggled to maintain a balance between the mandatory overtime hours and my school work, despite asking for permission to go back to college part time."
good,"I don't feel that I was paid enough for all the stress and duties that were asked of me, but I have an opportunity to advance and really loved the people and my manager."
good,"I enjoyed my time at UHG. It was one of the places where I could come to work, do my job and go home without any drama. My supervisor was very flexible and easy-going. I would probably still be working there had I not got engaged and relocated to Southern California. The only thing that I didn't like was the mandatory overtime that made it quite difficult for me as a single mother at the time. I was working sometimes 50 and up to 70 hours or more a week. The money was okay but it was exhausting and I never got to enjoy the money that I made."
good,"I have worked at UHG for several years and it is one of the few places where everyone not only knows the core values and mission statement, but truly lives them."
good,"good opportunity to work, flexible, good job opportunity learning  ,"
good,Pay could have been better. Co-workers were very good. Supervisors were excellent. Training was first class. Lunch was available on site. Office in the Northwest side of Indy. Would have been better to be downtown.
good,"Stable work environment.  Room for growth. Minimum supervision. Good work life balance is achievable. However, there are some complicated job processes."
good,Work was routine and predictable. Company focuses on measurable performance to determine promotion and raise potential. Company cut back on many perks of employment prior to my departure.
good,"I was a contract employee, so any benefits I received were through my ""talent agency"". I enjoyed working for the company mainly because my direct supervisors had very positive and supportive attitudes. I enjoyed all of my co-workers as well, and the team as a whole was wonderful."
good,"i did not feel like a contract employee and i felt that my experience was valued.   we worked basically a set shift, but if need be there were flexible to allow for apts and live activities."
good,i worked as customer service and it was great.Unfortunately I was only there as a temp. I have applied and no luck yet. Look forward to reapplying in the future.
good,"Productive and enjoyable workplace, all the people there were great."
good,I learned a lot from my team and from opportunities provided to me by UHC to grow in my management skills. We had a great team of UM Nurses that were collaborative and hardworking to meet the needs of our Military and Veterans. I am sad that our contract had to end such a well tuned team of nurses.
good,"A typical day at work is a consistent flow with answering calls, dealing with member's, nurses, physicians, and providers. Providing services for our member's. Management is great. They are very knowledgeable and keep us educated and informed. It is a very easy going environment with a great staff. The Moral in the office makes this job enjoyable."
good,UHG identifies and support individual contributors with growth opportunities.  Multiple leader development programs to enhance leadership skills for upward mobility
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Good company to work for overall. lots of benefits however heath benefits are not what you might expect. ranking amongst the 2nd worst of all the employers on my resume. job is pretty unforgiving when it comes to attendance. company applies occurrence rules there is no separation between vacation, sick and personal time it is all PTO. expect to sit for 8 hours a day in front of a computer and or on the phone for 90% of the work day."
good,There is a lot to learn here and helping members live healthier lives is enjoyable. I also like the incentive program for employees! I would love to see more people advance.
good,"It was great place to learn, grow and expand yourself.Always better opportunities around.Flexible schedule and decent pay as well.Good for learners to leear"
good,The culture with UnitedHealth Group is great and the fun people to work with. UnitedHealth encourages you to learn more and always ask questions to better yourself. They are always there to help you grow.
good,"My experience working at Optum/UHG was very pleasant.  It was in line with my work goals.  The day to day work was satisfying and rewarding.  The work culture was ""laid back.""  Management was a big proponent of worklife balance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the work product I was producing.  The hard part of the job was timing.  I had to coordinate work within different time zones."
good,"I service the State 2 accounts which we have maintained as a client for over 8 years. I 	Research unpaid claims to resolve issues and adjusting the claims to pay. I Organize and conduct Enrollment meetings/benefit fairs, presentations to potential and excising   members which maintained existing customers for over 8 years.  Explain health benefits to group administrative and their employees. I Attend Health Fairs, conducting body fat analysts, blood pressures, derma-scan screenings to 200 and over employees. I Track and  provide  reporting for all activities resulting from  the State of Rhode Island Rewards for  Wellness program. I also 	Conduct presentations of plan benefit changes to our customers"
good,I loved working at UHG especially working from home. Lots of opportunities for advancement.The only downside was changing work schedules every quarter
good,I have enjoyed working in United Healthcare. They have a good culture and do what ever it takes to help their employees succeed. I appreciate their transparency.
good,"Challenging, however rewarding.  I enjoyed going to work everyday assisting the internal and external customers.  However, there was no room for growth in the department where I worked. Overall great company to work for."
good,They are a good place to start off working. You will be provided with training and lots of resources. You will met some good people that are not only work friends but you will enjoy outside time with them as well.
good,"The typical day in my last position was sitting all day doing data entry. I learned how to enter hospitalizations, diagnosis, medications to patients records."
good,"Ability to work independently with flexible schedule and remote opportunities  Team effort to achieve goals of company.  Respected for"

good,Management was little different but the workplace was awesome and I enjoyed going to office everyday barring the reviews where came across with unrealistic ask
good,I was able to have a long standing career in UHG.  The corporate climate started to change to a more agile environment with young development talent. The environment has changed to be an in house application development focus
good,"UHC is a good company to work for.  They consistently seek to improve, innovate, and streamline processes.  The company culture is reinforced and incorporated into all aspects daily.  A typical work day can vary based on your department and function.  Management can vary from relaxed and laid back to micro-managers, again, depending upon your department and function.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building, fostering, and maintaining relationships between teammates and trainees."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Nice work place...Flexible working hours.but not much onshore opportunities. Have parking issues at Hyderabad site. That much I can say..................
good,Nice Company but they deploy you on any project according to their requirement. There is no use of your skill set.  But you can stand for yourself that please align me according to my interest.
good,"O dia de trabalho é corrido, devido ao grande fluxo de ligações dos usuários, porém o ambiente é agradavél, as horas passam rápido."

good,"Great, fast paced work environment in the medical field. Management should provide better direction on projects, but fun and positive work atmosphere."
good,"Great company to work for they just need better pay for CSR's with all the work that's provide. "
good,"My coworkers and I are like family.  We are a very charitable group and actively volunteer in the community and hold multiple drives throughout the year.  On a functional level, we have monthly office meetings at the end of the day and that's a drag especially since some can be done via an email. Overall it's a great work environment."
good,You need to have a very strong work ethic here but it is a good company overall. I recommend it. The company is very structured and they like to promote from within. Training is not very good and most of the company is subject to QA which can be good and not so good.
good,"This employer offered a training program for health insurance claims processors upon employment. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at UHC.  The environment was competitive, but also friendly and interested in the welfare of its employees.  Very customer friendly.  The most enjoyable part of my job was that I got to work with our clients directly to evaluate their need and turn that into specifications for our developers and then participate in the testing and implementation of the changes to satisfy their needs."
good,"...if you don’t want a life kind of like not wanting to get caught up in this surprise survey.  So, I’m just going to keep typing until it lets me out of this box."
good,"everyone is very helpful, encouraging, understanding its just the attendance policy is like a win lose which make it harder to become a career unless you can go without any mishaps in life"
good,Very large organization with the pros and cons that come with it.  There are huge career benefits to be had with a positive and aggressive approach.  There is a lot of internal organization terrain to learn.
good,"Each company has its Good and Bad and so is for UHG, it is a good place to work like you have free transport, but few reasons will not make you feel to stay forever here like there are no dedicated Desks and have to share it with other people who work in alternative shift with you."
good,"nice place to gather work experience ; love the tele commute"

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I achieved experience in the health care industry across many job titles."
good,Great experience working with Medicare/Medicaid members; supervisor easily accessible; and seasoned staff extremely helpful. Team work with other contractors in PA/DE/OH via e-workroom a plus.
good,"A typical day is always different.The Management incorporates fun activities, that will promote productive team development, in a positive atmosphere."
good,"I liked the work but after many years, it got repetitive. I liked being able to help people set goals for lifestyle change. I learned a lot about how to communicate effectively and I learned about motivational interviewing. I excelled in this skill. I also got to work from home which was nice for awhile."
good,"I enjoyed working here in the claims department. I started as a processor then quickly moved up to an adjuster, adjuster inpatient, and then to a subject matter expert. A good portion of the time I worked in the office however we had the flexibility to work overtime and such from home. There was a definite work life balance with this position. The claims team consisted of approximately 25 people of which we became a family. It was laid back yet when there was a deadline to meet, we would totally crush it. Team work at its best."
good,Work culture is Good. Salary and felicities are at high standard. Company provides Cab services to the employees. Yearly appraisals and benefits are good.
good,"Currently working part-time for Optum, the clinical arm of United Health.  Challenges include having coverage territory shifted without notice or explanation.  The day is over when your work is completed, so some days are easier than others.  Opportunity for advancement and building your career is there.  Benefits are great and offered to part-timers as well.  Overall, the culture is amazing for such a large company; for example, I am currently doing some volunteer work and United Health will gift my charity of choice $500 after 30 hours of volunteer work."
good,"Pros - Great salary, benefits and culture. Job satisfaction, constantly changing priorities"
good,"Its like working for a government, or a small country with over 100,000 employees. If you are willing to work hard, network, and learn, you can develop your career into anything you want."
good,Productive workplace. Management not in tune with staff at times.  micro-manager. Co-workers pleasant. Good company to work for overall. Good benefits
good,"This can be a career company if you pursue the opportunities available. Be sure to discuss your career/development goals often with leadership, and frequently review opportunities available to check/meet pre-requisite requirements."
good,"Could be unprofessional sometimes, but I enjoyed working with my coworkers and enjoy a face pace environment .  I dealt specifically with customers that were 65 years or older and loved making there days by providing excellent customer service"
good,It is a great place to work.  The benefits are not that good.  They have a great ethic to work/home life.  Very active in the communities and keep the employees up to date on changes.
good,"Provide services to generate sales,visit providers,sales event in order to set up home appointment, RV locations and pharmacy location ,office locations to generate sales too."
good,UHG/Optum is an exciting place to work if you're on the right team.   It's a sink or swim environment.  But if you're lucky you'll find yourself on a team that is very supportive and cooperative.
good,"I worked at UHG for quite some time during the beginning and middle of my career, as both a consultant and an employee.  I have very positive things to say about the people I worked with on a day to day basis, as well as the work I was a part of."
good,"great company to work for, I was given the necessary tools to grow in my career. I appreciated all of the experience and opportunities provided by the company."
good,"very good company to work . Large organization , lot of learning , Good management , lot of work , No Parking, Friendly colleges, good hikes, good pay"
good,"Overall UHC is a great company to work for, flexibility, culture, and development is very dependent on the manager. Some encourage a higher degree of cultural adherence and others loosely follow it. I chalk this up to management style over a company culture issue. The company is on a cultural journey and they are heading in the right direction, the journey is not at its destination so bumps are expected. "
good,"United Health Centers provides excellent benefits including 401k, profit sharing, life insurance, medical insurance, dental insurance, paid time off.  Good Christmas party, annual softball tournament and barbeque."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"United Health Group is a solid company with good benefits and a caring culture for their employees and customers.  However, working as a contract employee you are not working directly for them.  You are selling their product but in a call center of various other companies."
good,Great company.. I enjoyed working here when I was employed at United. Management was wonderful and coworkers were great.. a very close group that was like family. I would have stayed if I did not screw it up myself. Hardest part of the job was the mandatory overtime.
good,The pharmacy business is extremely difficult to learn however; it was very interesting. There was a lot of mandatory overtime and it was difficult for employees with small children.
good,Excellent experience gained and knowledge acquired. Culture was wonderful and positive. Hardest part was learning different insurance rules per state.
good,I had many happy years at UGH and am sad to leave.  I started at the ground level and was encouraged to work my way up.    I successfully advanced my career over the years.
good,Awesome place to work at!  Only worked there for about 2 months.  But from I saw going on managers were very attentive to us.  There was always a manager around to direct us in the right way and help us with any concern we had.
good,"Great people to train, listen and assist with training.  First experience do screen share, learned a lot from different programs supported in the office.  Bariatric Surgery, Cancer Treatments and Young mothers."
good,I learned a lot from this position. I also got to learn some of the new skill which I would not learn without being there. I recommend this place to wok
good,"It was the number one health company of US. It was a great company to work with, but as there was a night shift due to which my health was affected very much. So I had to leave the job."
good,"Work Life balance is good.management is really good. and work culture is very good. Team is supportive and good technical work."
good,"Its a fun place to work, I have worked 6 years here. I am looking for a career growth and looking for a change. I have learned the maximum in this company."
good,"United health Group is a good company with excellent work environment and motivational colleagues.  Description:"
good,"Worked on a five year project that afforded me the opportunity to learn all about the phases of project management. Worked closely on building requirements and testing and met with stakeholders and super users. Became expert at process mapping, and workflows, and identifying process gaps ."
good,"Had good benefits and did advance from Records Mgmt. to Legal Contracts Coordinator."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships developed with everyone.  Our local management was dedicated and communicative.  The hardest part of the job was that higher management was frequently changing.
good,"Hours were long and lots of overtime. Stay 2 years, I'd find it difficult to be there longer. With Medicare contract, you get to tell grandma that she cannot get her specialty medicine even though she worked and paid social security all her life. Good luck forgetting that call."
good,I enjoyed the benefits of working with this client and the opportunities that became available to me through working with them. I like the company as a whole
good,Very busy and fast moving workplace; decisions need to be made fast and on many levels; multitasking and fast learning is a key for excelling and surviving.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,UHG  has amazing work culture and flexibility at work. It is the best place to work at. The work life balance and flexibility is the best in any company so far.  It has tremendous learning opportunities.
good,"Typical day included a couple of meetings, with creating and running several reports while answering several emails and phone calls.  I learned that the health care industry is always evolving and UHG is always looking for ways to make it easier for everyone. The team culture is crucial to creating good quality products to provide a positive customer experience.  The most challenging part of the job was the tight timelines and deadlines for the planning and execution of the Annual Enrollment Period."
good,Typical day stressful. business relationship between nurses and doctors. Management not very comfortable to work with. Job does not provide any resources to motivate employees.  The hardest part was dealing with the nurses and management to complete your job each day. My most enjoyable part was talking with co-workers to lift your moral.
good,"I worked in UnitedHealth Group's IRD group during a transformation period. I learned a lot trying to balance risk-taking innovation in a very risk-averse industry. Ultimately, executive leadership decided to pursue different objectives and the ensuing period of introspection led to some growing pains within the group."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at United Healthcare was the opportunity to visit Ireland 3 times.  I was selected as a member of the training team for the initial 30 team members in the Virtual Claims Processing Office,"
good,I really enjoyed the director and team members that I worked with.  The offshore team that I lead was amazing.  They were always willing to go over and above what was needed to make deadlines and they were very skilled ETL developers.
good,"UHC/ Optium Health bought out AIM Healthcare, and then laid off a large percentage of employees, I was one of them. AIM Healthcare did on-site credit balance audits"
good,"I love working for UnitedHealth Group. Although, there has been two setbacks with workforce reduction, I still enjoy working for the company. It's challenging, there's room for growth, and my managers have been great!"
good,"Ótimo local para se trabalhar, se desenvolver criar laços"
good,"I am a fast learner, so this job was really easy for me. By the time I was out of training they had me working on specialty list and training others. The company went through a restructure and had to lay off a lot of people and retrain the ones that stayed to a new product. I had no error in my 2 years there and every time I tried to move departments for growth I wasn't ever given an opportunity. I was told I was valuable where I was so that I could help the people that were struggling but I was not compensated for the work. I love the environment and I loved the staff but I love growth and opportunities and work hard to be able to grow."
good,"Big national company, with typical corporate style.  Good benefits, flexible and competitive.  Sometimes it takes too long to implement new ideas, and to quickly respond to market needs."
good,Value driven work environment not typical of a call center as there is much encouragement to service our customers with compassion.  Team setting provides good support and manager is supportive and understanding.  Flexible job as there is telecommuting available.  Many opportunities to move within the company to different areas but need to be persistent with seeking these opportunities.  Opportunity to earn compensation by selling memberships and plans (for sales).
good,"able to self schedule preferred work days in advance"
good,"The job was rewarding."
good,It was a relaxed environment.  The only issue I had was the pay.  The benefits were great and the managers were ok as well.  I would go back if the pay was fair
good,"You will have access to all new technologies here. India management is little bit ok but otherwise great people to work with."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I worked from home, which can be positive or negative. Depends if you're a loner or a people person........................................................"
good,"Great company, most enjoyable working from home is awesome, extensive training way too often, last supervisor didn't have a clue as to what our responsibilities were!"
good,"Every day is a good day at united health care, Very competitive, but in a family fun way. The pay is great but could always be better. They have pretty high goals in order to get a bonus but other than that, no complaints."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the company, but wish it was longer, spent 5 years with one department and really enjoyed my leadership, great workplace and different things everyday"
good,"This was a typical inbound call center environment but kicked up a notch.  The teams I was involved with had additional capabilities to take on complex cases and help create resolution with true follow up to the client that had called in.  If you had the right supervisor, your team performed extremely well and was very collaborative. If you didn't it was a rough road. I was lucky and had some of the best supervisors.  Hated when they did team shake ups and switched teams around.  Lost many teammates to poor supervisors, which caused turnover."
good,"It's a great job when I first started out, but it then became more and more competitive. We were put into competition with each other which sometimes meant some back biting. So, I didn't like that part. I sure did love talking with all our customers on the phone all over the United States. It was such a privilege to help people out when you could."
good,"some times it seems that everything anyone on the floor does is wrong, I do not deal well with the stress of worrying about everything I say and do"
good,"Organization continues to grow and reform.  Focus is on meeting needs of the health system.  Enjoyed direct leaders. They were progressive, authentic and future focused."
good,"I have been working for UHC over a year. It's a great company the only downside is that we are working in the health care field and we have no sick days. I am a single mother. My child gets sick from time to time. I have been sick twice in one year. If you have unplanned absences in other words you need to plan when your are getting sick, because when you call out. Is considered and occurrence. After five occurrences you get a write up. REALLY WRITING PEOPLE UP FOR BEING HUMAN AND GETTING SICK THEY DO NO CARE IF YOU HAVE A DOCTOR'S NOTE. THE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ARE NOT THE GREATEST FOR WORKING IN A COMPANY THAT PROVIDED HEALTH CARE EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE BETTER COVERAGE $1350 DEDUCTITBLE AND THEN 20% CO-INSURANCE AND THIS IS FOR ONE PERSON"
good,"Work hard play hard - they definitely reward those that strive to overachieve.  Annual culling of under performers, great advancement opportunities for others."
good,My job was remote. The most difficult part of the job was contacting members. The most enjoyable part of my job was when members improved there health with education and support provided to them
good,"At UHG we had Mimix software data replication system which was used only 2% of the big corporations. So, I did learn a lot which was a great experience."
good,"I am currently employed with this company at this time and have no opinion. "
good,Great place to work. Very busy during open enrollment but rest of the year it slows down. Great opportunity for advancement and very supportive supervisors and managers.
good,"Experienced in face to face and telephone Customer Service, Marketing, Sales, Scheduling, Accounting. Cashier experienced in cash, checks, money orders, credit cards and government programs."
good,Great company to work for and their values and mission were very close to my own.  I would highly recommend this company to anyone.  They work towards their mission every day and have high values.  Work was challenging and always very interesting.  I learn a lot working with United Healthcare and was able to move to new position within the company and grow my interests.
good,"Nice to work at UHG,"
good,Very clean and professional work environment. Offers a lot of training for career growth. Provide many opportunities for an individual to grow and cares about work life balance. Offers a lot of perks to outstanding employees.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Depending on the department you work in you will have a great experience with UHC. Their insurance benefits unfortunately aren't the best. Great culture, they strive for excellence."
good,"Good company to start a career with as a fresher, but growth opportunities are less when compared to other companies. Salary hikes and other benefits are very less."
good,"Trabalhar  na Amil foi uma experiência muito gratificante,gostaria muito de uma oportunidade,pois acredito que tenho muito para contribuir nesta empresa e a empresa acrescentar no meu conhecimento profissional."
good,"It was a big enough company that you always had other places to go and work more job opportunities good hours. "
good,"Good company overall"
good,Time spent United as a car coordination was a very good experience for me.  I learned a lot a and gained much detailed information to  complete my tasks as expected.
good,"Every day I would work with my clients performing psychosocial rehabilitation therapy with them. Assisting them with their Activities of Daily living, budgeting skills, and independent living skills."
good,Good team environment and I enjoyed the flexibility of being able to work from home.  Company has an excellent reputation in the Managed Care field but pay increases are very low.
good,"I enjoyed the corporate culture and the people I worked with, but unfortunately I was actually an employee of Connextions (a UHG acquisition) and we were sold a few times, which eventually led to my entire team being laid off."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, onde aprendi trabalhar em equipe, disciplinada,somos liderados por profissionais competentes."
good,"Great Place to work if you can get full time employment. The benefits and pay is good. If you are a contractor, you will not received benefits and will have reduced pay compared to an employee of the company. There were several times i was told I would become a full time employee and never did."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. Management was very lack luster which had a negative impact on the amount of time I worked for the company but the benefits were good.
good,"The work is not hard, good support, but can be alot due to the size of the provider market to managed..Some days can be stressful, but rewarding at the same time. Alot of interacting with other department."
good,Fast paced work day able to stay busy and work independently with minimal supervision and the ability to work from home.  Department hours were flexible .
good,"It is an elegant place to stay, and it is good for those lacking experience because they have tried their best to be in line with technology fronts. However, for those who have real talents, they probably feel the other way."
good,UHO/UHG is a great place to work.  The management is fair and your hard work is rewarded.  There are many opportunities but unfortunately  the needs of the business take precedence over if you are permitted to leave a department for other positions.  There is no plan in place to allow for help with your team if a teammate wants to transfer to another position.
good,"Empresa de grande porta porém não colabora com o crescimento profissional da maioria diante funcionários. Visam apenas numeros, esquecendo do lado bem estar do funcionário e empresa."
good,Friends of friends were promoted. I watched Team Leads in the same position for years because Hispanics hired who they want whether qualified or not. Team Leads were required to train them.Created a hostile environment because the hiring process and promoting process was not fair.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Relaxed environment, welcoming, flexible, they are willing to help when needed and have alot of opportunities. They are personable and I would recommend them as employment"
good,During my time with Optum UHC I've met a lot of great people that thought me a lot when it came to the position that I was in. It can be a hight paced inviroment but this is where I've learned to thrive the most.  With in UnitedHealth Care I always knew that if I did not know the answer to a question or how to go about performing a certain procedure someone was always willing to point me in the right direction.
good,"The benefits are pretty nice. You get an affordable health package that you can choose from around 4 or 5 options. Dental and vision are very good, but health has a fairly high deductible. You can purchase up to 40 hours time off for a deduction from your pay. There is a very nice stock purchasing program as well and 401k. The job is stressful, It involves a lot of research crammed into a short call. You are measured on metrics like call time and survey scores. You are also expected to offer additional items on your calls that can earn you bonuses, but only if you hit the entrance gates like call time under a certain amount of minutes. Many will have to do web support as well. They do try to make the environment enjoyable, with free food on occasion, activities and office decoration. You also compete for your schedule with everybody else in your group."
good,We were on a production basis here. I met my production dally and it was not a difficult job to do. The management was great and treated the employees fairly.
good,"good place to work at, nice company culture, as long as you keep up with yours stats and show up on time you should be fine. Good benefits, you must be flexible with schedules."
good,"Great training program"
good,"Fast paced. Lots of up skill. Not paid per completed up skill. Up skill is not an option. "
good,"It was a very great place to work at hands down, the ladies are very helpful and want you to do your best. They are very supportive and make learning very comfortable."
good,"On a typical day Service Now tickets on average 10 working with the IT Deployment Team and Desktop Service Team.  Working with Vendors on pricing for software upgrades and maintenance contracts. Working in conjunction with the Enterprise Sourcing & Procurement Team at UHG. "
good,"A great place to work if you are in the right department. Many changes all the time (polices, system applications, management etc.) Community volunteering is highly encouraged and supported."
good,I would come in to my desk log in and get right to work we all stay connect through the online portal. We had monthly little outings and events that came to the job.
good,"Clima de trabalho singular, que obrigava o colaborador de forma positiva a ser neutro e responsável em seu trabalho"
good,"The job was a great learning experience, it’s amazing to be able too help assist the members in get prescriptions, giving them clarity, or even just assisting them. The job can however be stressful if don’t properly balance yourself."
good,"Due  to this being a call center there are stressful intense days and then there were days of relaxation. There was a lot of changes taking place when I was an employee there. Communication for employees were minimal. Requirments as CSR changed weekly."
good,"One perk for many is the opportunity to work from home."
good,"Have the opportunity to engage with clients to help improve operations, implement information technology solutions, and help them solve tough business problems. They are key on the following 5 culture values:"
good,Good company to work for. Diverse and great team players. Communication across the board could be a lot better. The benefits are not as good as I thought they would be working for an insurance company.
good,"Empresa boa, com cultura é grande parte dos processos bem definidos. Funcionários vivem ou se aproximam ao máximo dos valores e da missão da empresa"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,UnitedHealthcare offers telecommuting which allows work and  family balance. The benefit package is very competitive and is an incentive to work for the company.
good,"I am a quick learner. I know how to tackle the situations even in the worst conditions. I always keep my line of business happy, that's why I always got awards."
good,Working for MedSynergies was a great experience for me.  I  do not have any bad comments towards the company. They were a great company who seemed to care about their employees.
good,This is a great company to work for overall. Senior management are responsive and supportive. Most positions are telecommuting which is very helpful if you prefer to not work in an office.
good,"Great customer service, great management, flexible hours, certain holidays off, weekends off, optimal patient care, continuing education, ongoing support"
good,I worked there for 5+ years and enjoyed it. Only left as part of a reduction in forces. Had there been another management position available I would have stayed.
good,The claims position is very Quick paced. Customer service oriented. They are big on giving back to the community. Volunteering and fundraising are encouraged.
good,UnitedHealth Group provided an opportunity for me to establish a career & work hard to move up into leadership.  Changes in senior leadership come with changes in business direction at times.  Global footprint continues to expand.
good,"Various learning opportunities you will get here. Best place to work in certain areas. Provides various facilities to the employees such as good transport facility ,good overall facility for any casualty etc."
good,"Absolutely a positive, happy, good experience.  Telecommuted, still wonderful resources available at any time for telecommuters. The job options seem unlimited. And the stock options are great."
good,"Everything that has to do with this company is amazing, the only exception being their management.  Management for the most part was not compassionate with their employees."
good,Each day brought new challenges. There were no two issues that were a like. Constantly learning new things. The culture was that of Integrity and striving for Excellence. We would face each problem as though they were our own. The hardes part of the job was working a provider issue but we were unabe to pay the claim and having to call and let the provider know why we were unable to pay the claim.
good,Over all UHG is a good place to work. Most of the benefits are what you would find in a typical big company. Pay is decent but they are could improve on this.
good,"Good Company to work with, great benefits, but long hours."
good,"United Health Group was a easy job. I loved the mission of the job and being able to help the get qualified candidates insurance. Its a great place to work just it requires a lot of your life, other than scheduling it's a great place to work."
good,Overall great experience. Unfortunately with my position there was a lack of career progression when the company was bought out by Optum. Great environment prior to that and ability to work remote was a plus.
good,"Good Organisation to work..."
good,"UHG tends to sometimes be overly structured, which sometimes leads to chaos due to too many minute details in process and policies. I also feel like the message and image it likes to show doesn't jive with the benefits, salaries, etc that the company offers-employees are asked to put in a lot of effort without getting as much back. But some of the best leadership I've had has been there and almost completely compensates for some of the more ridiculous business practices and polices. And the company is located in every state in the US, so transferring is easy, even if promotion isn't always so."
good,The job pays well BUT in my department you do EVERYONE job in other departments but those departments are not crossed trained to assist your department. Also I feel like you dont have many advancement opportunities.
good,Pay is OK.  People are alright. If you keep to yourself you are left alone.  Like many other places there are cliques so take it or leave it. Management isn't really into micromanagement so if you need constant hand holding this is not the job for you.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,United health group was a great place to work. It was stressful at times as with any position but overall personally rewarding. The tasks were repetitive and easy to complete. You sat for prolonged periods of time and did not have much time to recoup from a difficult situation.
good,"My role as Client Service Consultant required me to setup Cobra Administration for clients which involved; collaboration, implementation, billing and training.  Web training provided to new clients to monitor Cobra participants.  Assisted with multiple projects to meet deadlines.  Good work atmosphere."
good,This is a fast pace work environment with great opportunity for advancement and growth. The hardest part of this job is staying up to date with the ever changing policies within the company. Policies change on a daily and is ever so confusing when working multiple lines of business. Other than that is the best place I have worked so far.
good,The company itself is a good company to work for.  The majority of employees have staying power lasting for more than 10= years.  The only knock on them would be that they could pay a lot more aggressively than they currently do.  Very conservative salary ranges.
good,That is my overall assessment I personally would not go back to that job just because I was hired as a contract employee and it was not worth it as a contract employee
good,"Exceptional pay, management is loyal to employees, great benefits, but very stressful and demanding work schedule to keep up with deadlines. I had the awesome opportunity to work at home but found myself working through lunch breaks and after hours, often times bringing my laptop to bed with me until I fell asleep."
good,I'm Enjoying the work culture and life balance is good.Heath related things are very much good and its very good organization for Freshers and for who want to lean about health care domain.
good,"Great company to work for and truly displays innovation, diversity and leadership. The staff and employees are all great to work with and believes in true team building."
good,I am really glad to have a job. I would recommend this job to anyone with call center experience. I would not recommend this job to anyone who lacks patience because this job will try you.
good,"This is a great job, you can learn a lot. However they will train you in several different skills but you will not get a raise. Company policies are also manager based so reading the website on policies is a little pointless."
good,I enjoyed working for UnitedHealth Group. I was able to enhance my leadership skill and I also learned on how to show more compassion to the callers most especially those who were in need of immediate medical assistance like the elders.
good,Biggest downfall would be the lack of communication.  There are a lot of departments that all need to be on the same page. Room to learn a lot of new things.
good,"grande porte , boas qualidades de trabalho, grandes condições de aprendizado."
good,Visit members at home in attempts to prevent hospital admissions. Maintain knowledge of standards of practice. Hardest part-unpredictability. Most enjoyed-members and making own schedule.
good,My long-term experience in the service industry has taught me how to meet and exceed each customer's expectations with service that sells. I have assisted all types of customers in all types of settings. I realize that acquiring and maintaining loyal repeat business as well as spreading the word of your business through these loyal patrons is of the utmost importance in every company.
good,"Eu recomendo a Amil como oportunidade de trabalho a qualquer um. É uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar cujo ambiente é agradável e interessante. Trata-se porém de uma empresa que hoje vive constantes mudanças desde que foi adquirida pelo grupo estrangeiro, o que gera uma certa instabilidade. Há política de promoção e valorização dos seus empregados, o que considero muito importante."
good,"Bom período de trabalho, o aprendizado foi  muito importante para minha vida profissional."
good,Great training for employees.  Excellent feed back good and negative.  Calls monitored frequently for quality and training.  Awesome communication skills with management and co-workers. Plenty of training and on going education. Different events held for employee appreciation.
good,Work culture and environment here is awesome. Almost 70 per cent of the employees fall in the same age group which makes the environment more happening and work more easier.
good,"It is a great company to get started at, but only so much room to grow.  They provide a great atmosphere, to work in while making sure to keep it fun."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A fantastic place with tons of opportunities. "
good,"Improve the health and productivity of your workforce while reducing costs. This unique, cross-carrier approach simplifies administration for you and your employees. We empower employees while helping you manage your total population health."
good,Flexible and laid back environment  received the change in management was poor and caused alot of stressful days. Previous management was more on top of putting out fires before they became uncontrollable.
good,"Great company to work for.  UHG has a good benefit package and 401K plan.  The role of a CM is very overwhelming and stressful, especially if you have a large case load of members.  Management is great and they all have an open door policy.  The job can definitely interfere with personal life, as this is not a typical 9-5.   Overall, it's a great place to work, but keep in mind it could be extremely overwhelming."
good,Working for UHC was a great experience although always changing it only added to my skill set.  The training was extensive however provided the confidence to perform the tasks efficiently.  Workplace culture was intense and welcoming at the same time. Great managers which made the challenges easier. The most enjoyable part of the job were the relationships I gained.
good,"United Healthcare atmosphere is conducive to a productive teamwork environment. While most of the team is across the U.S.,  we still find a close network and help each other."
good,"My typical day at work consists of arriving at the job and loading up my systems, and I jump right into my job duties and only rest during my two scheduled breaks and during lunch. I have learned more about the healthcare insurance field. Management can improve, sometimes it seems as though the managers and supervisors have no empathy and little to none experience. Work place culture is alright, kind of dead. Same day in and day out. The hardest part of the job are the repetitive tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job would be talking with your co workers and being able to help out the customers and making their lives a little easier. Oh, and the pay is moderately okay."
good,Uma ótima empresa com cultura de programa de cargos e salários. Ótimos profissionais.
good,Benefits are not that great. Deductible is extremely high to have been a employee. Management is not very professional at time. Want you to show compassion for members but will not show you any compassion when its comes to a personal concern.
good,"good place to work. I would recommend. Nothing bad to say, just like any other job. It is what you make it. Very progressive company - good use of technology."
good,UHC is a great place to work gives you great training to put you in a situation where you can grow. Very active in the community and pushes or you to work from home
good,I was hired right out of the military as an AIX System Administrator.  I had minimal job qualifications but they took a chance on me and I learned very quickly.  I was responsible for remote support of a handful of AIX servers and the applications running on them.  It was a good company.
good,Temporary position through a temp agency. Learned to pull quotes for companies seeking to provide healthcare for their employees. I really loved this job.
good,Put a high focus on education and training of their employees.   Prefer to hire student directly out of college and train for a lifetime of employment
good,"A great company that is on the forefront of healthcare innovation. Bright people, good strategy, decent benefits. Excellent work life balance. I liked working for UHG."
good,This company has a good culture and strives to be the best for it's members as well as it's employees.  They truly believe in promoting from within.  The level of employee engagement depends on the department and leaders.  But if you do your job well it will be recognized and you can advance.
good,"very Good place to work with a lot opportunities ,the environment is very professional, I would recommencement  to any body to go work there the supervisor are very professional well educated a lot respect"
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"UHG has very good workplace culture  with open door policy, there is regular update from the management regarding company growth and future plan. There is quarterly townhall meeting with management.  UHG also have excellent employee relations policy and very employee friendly culture."
good,"Answering inbound pharmaceutical calls, usually back to back. Help is effective, active listening skills are needed. Navigating from different programs so being able to multitask is essential."
good,"For many visitors or callers to a business, my job as a receptionist provides the first impression that they carry with them into their first meeting. For that reason I seek to maintain the highest levels of professionalism and efficiency on a daily basis. Within the company as well, “my job” as the only employee that all other employees interact with on a regular and daily basis. As a result, the attitude that a receptionist brings to work, whether good or bad, can easily be spread throughout the entire office. That is why I have attempted to use my position of visibility to be a source of cheerfulness and friendliness to raise morale for the entire office."
good,"Uhg is a nice company,good  work & personal life balance,can get nice benefits.But only the thing is they are considering 15% of salary is  variable pay( RRP)"
good,UHG is a growing company which provides better oportunities to their emplyees and its enviroment is worst because total management system is fake and its provides promotions to those guys which is favorite and friends of them and too much partiality in theri management system.
good,"Can be a very stressful job, but management is outstanding, and always willing to help. Assisting members with their needs and putting their minds at ease is very rewarding."
good,"* Work is more challenging because most of the Team scattered across Gurgaon, Noida, Bangalore and HYD."
good,"Love my job and my team! Lots of potential and advancement within. The work/life balance is good, but the benefits and pay could be better. I really like my job."
good,"Good experience with UHG. It's a good working place and good organisation culture."
good,"Great place to work, be prepared to work hard to succeed, very competitive internal environment. "
good,"This was a contract position.  The training lasted for over a week. Great people to work with, team players. There were always someone there to help you, if you had a questions."
good,traveling from one member's home to the next takes a toll but quite rewarding at the end of the day.The job helped me to organized my time so that everything including charting and referrals can be shared with the member's PCP.
good,"In the 17 years with UnitedHealth Group, I've obtained a vast variety of experience from numerous rolls throughout the years.  I have and currently enjoy working for this company and would recommend employment here to anyone."
good,I have never worked with such a phenomenal team.  United Healthcare Military & Veterans has great benefits and supports their employees as well as the community.  I love how they donate to local as well as international needs.
good,"Trabalho intenso porém com objetivos claros"
good,I really like working at UHC. It had a lot of benefits and there were many opportunities for advancement. It is also a very diverse workplace. I recommend anyone apply who is interested.
good,I have been working at UHG for some time. The work environment is excellent.  It is a big company and not all departments have the same culture. The salary and benefits leave you wanting.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"Very caring people to work .  Compnay is a very nice place to work . "
good,"UHG is very good place to work . I have learnt many thing in UHG."
good,"My typical day was to assist recently retired or Medicare recipients change an existing plan or enroll in a new plan. I learned about the ""donut hole"" in which clients can easily go into a gap when medications needs increase and they may max out before the end of the year and have to pay high cost of out pocket for medications. My manager, and trainer were awesome on the United Healthcare account. The hardest part of the job would be a day when I didn't meet my goal of at least 7-8 sales a day. The most enjoyable was knowing that I helped someone save on their Medicare health plan."
good,"Nice work life balance. Collaborative staff. l am an individual contributor. At times, things can seem to take longer than usual to get done. Over all, it is a good place."
good,Working with United Healthcare you have a variety of positions to choose from with flexibility hours. Provides alot of opportunity to telecommute as well.

good,"Work environment overall is ok. My colleagues and immediate supervisor are great however, company benefits are not on par with the rest of other BPO companies."
good,Once your foot is in the door you have so many other opportunities to work toward. Great Company they really care about their employees!
good,"All in all a great place to work. Great co-workers. Managers are hesitant to let you advance. The position I am in does not advance any where, so I would have to branch out, which is hard to do here."
good,"i love working for Lincoln...I have learned so much about life insurance and the industry of insurance. I learned to give people more than what they expect, and learned how to deal with irate callers. The best part is the great calls and the employees. The hardest part is the escalations on situations that could have been prevented."
good,"I really enjoyed working for UHG, it was a great place to work , friendly coworker and mangerment. Ok benefits and the pay could have been better . I lot of overtime to earn more money ."
good,A good explorer to get a good experience in working for projects and having a team building spirit. managing the clients call and expectation with the team players.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"UHG is a great company. After the company took over Sirona Infusion, ideas from staff at networking events have quickly turned into new business opportunities! If you are excited about something, you can do it! The company does a great job of looking at internal talent for leadership opportunities and works with individuals that are interested in moving up on their areas for improvement. Employees are encouraged to hold each other accountable to the values that make this company unique. UHG has a mission - they are focused on raising the bar for service delivery and opportunities for individuals in services as well as for employees and their professional development. But most of all, they work to stand out with their clients."
good,This is overall a great place to work. The only downside is the medical insurance (high deductible and doesn't cover much)  and management (unprofessional at times). Other than that it has great pay and great job security.
good,I learned a lot from my team and staff at the Lockheed location. A very professional work environment in which you worked with military staff and government officials alike.
good,"All in all, working in the Buffalo office was wonderful!  I did enjoy my job even though it is extremely stressful!  Yes, you will work a ton of overtime and yes, the company is not big on letting you have off.  So, this job I do not recommend for a person with a family.  However, if you want to know all there is to know about health insurance, I definitely recommend it.  You will get promoted and move up very fast.  However, do not post out to jobs on the provider side of the company.  By all means, stay in the Member side of things.  It is more like family there and they will work with you.  However, the Provider side does lay off individuals that work their tails off and have been there for years to go in and find out they no longer have a job or are forced out of their job and forced to quit due to greedy management on the Provider side.  Best of luck!"
good,"Working with UnitedHealth Group taught me in a lot of areas in life. From working professionally, to making friends with my colleagues and loving the job that I have with Patience, Compassion and Integrity. It's hard being a health advisor. Sometimes, the people that you talk with just got the news that they have cancer and all sort of life-threatening diseases. It is really up to you on how you are going to provide your member's need specially all the information that he/she has to know with ease. Definitely, they don't like anybody else feeling sorry for themselves. It's hard to assist member's like that feeling depressed and all. So the best thing that you cold do, is give them all the possibilities, positivities and best options and make them feel that there are still good things ahead of them. And the most enjoyable part of it is hearing them genuinely say ""Thank You""."
good,Our day starts at 11.00 am and we have quick discussions on the pending deliverables and commence our work. I have learnt the art of analyzing a query brought by business and get to the best possible solution from legal perspective. Emphasis is on quality of the deliverables rather than quantity.
good,The company offers a lot of fringe benefits and promotes team work. There is also a lot of room for advancement if you are good at your job.

good,"Iniciei minha relação profissional com a Amil após a venda da Medial onde inicialmente fui contratada, fui me dado muitos desafios e oportunidades, porém o que dificulta atualmente é a distância pois a Amil fica localizada fora da cidade de São Paulo."
good,"Coordinated corporate communication for national sales initiatives."
good,Working within this fast-paced call center is challenging. Meeting service levels is very important in this field. Meeting your metrics is even more important. With endless career opportunities I would rate this company as a good place to work.
good,"Empresa com ambiente agradável, porém não havia muito respaldo da diretoria."
good,It was a ok job. Good pay nice people. Not a bad schedule but there is no room for growth. I would not reapply.. It was on a island so great location.
good,worked as a telecommute so there was no drive into the office. I set up my own schedule as far as provider visits go. I learned a lot of information in regards to Medicare my past two years. The previous 20 plus years were focused on the commercial side. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relations with the physicians and working with my coworkers. My current role has a direct impact on our seniors' health in working with closing HEDIS measures. The hardest part of the job is the initiatives that are rolled out by management aren't effective and can not be administered at times.
good,"I worked from home for the last 6 years of work. I handled several phone calls from both, provider and customers, and answered detailed Health Insurance questions, or routed a claim related issue to appropriate department for resolution. I learned several ways to accommodate the customer or provider, under, sometimes, irate circumstances. Management was available when needed and worked with the employees and customers interests as needed. My co-workers were very nice, well respected, individuals that treated everyone in a professional manner. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer that their medical claim could not be paid, due to their specific Healthcare coverage under their Employers plan. It was especially difficult when it was a life threatening diagnosis. The most enjoyable part of job were the flexible hours, the overtime and holiday pay, and again, the positive feedback from the public that I dealt with daily."
good,"I took this as a temporary job to pay the bills while I purse a career level position."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"No issues but in currently the administration become lack of managements."
good,"It's a call center so you are at a computer your entire shift. I learned a lot about insurance and claims processing. Management can be good and bad, depending on what they need from you."
good,"The management was good, so i am working since four years and have a nice experience working with UHG. I just want to relocate to bangalore location."
good,"Overall, UnitedHealth Group is great place to work, however, this is heavily dependent on the team that you are on and which department. Like every work place, there are pros and cons . I am fortunate enough to be on a team who is very understanding about life outside of work--therefore schedules are fairly flexible. Management is good, but has been known to entrust the wrong individuals for decision making that has been costly in the past. This can be frustrating at times, but the good outweighs the bad. The cons are the compensation package--while it is advertised as ""competitive"", I beg to differ. Benefits are not competitive and a little on the expensive side in comparison to other places."
good,"I learned quite a bit about medical terminology, filling prescriptions,"
good,The company has room for advancement and has great staff and a good team to work for. Typical day is phone calls all day assisting members with healthcare needs
good,"It was a really good time there,just that its hard to get movement within the organisation once you start performing well in your areas."
good,"Ambiente agradável, supervisores e monitores prestativos, empresa proporciona um sistema bem completo com todas as informações necessárias para prestar um bom atendimento. O ponto negativo atualmente é a quantidade de funcionários que por ser pouca comparado ao número de demandas, provoca atrasos em respostas para o cliente, retorno constante de um mesmo cliente e uma quantidade alta de ligações, gerando fila."
good,"UHC is a great company to work for. Plenty of opportunity to move around and move up. Decent wages, great supervisors. Intelligent hard working team."
good,"This has been an excellent place to work. I have received multiple bonuses and pay increases along with option to purchase additional pto hours, and days off. However the advancement options are lacking, people with less skill set are advanced to positions that require some work experience, no follow up calls after multiple interviews for a position, lots of favoritism within teams."
good,Its been great time working with my team. They are always inspiring and I learnt many new things.They are always a helping hand for everyone in the team. It feels good working with a team especially when the other team members are more experienced.
good,Enjoyed working in this company; management is superb; compensation is excellent. I learned a lot while always being supported by my manager; the hardest part of the job were deadlines but never to the point of lacking sleep.
good,"The company offers some really great benefits such as full-time telecommuting, autonomy and the ability to innovate (with some restriction, as expected with a large company.)  It is a numbers-driven company but does look toward the future.  There is much change, which always moves the company in a positive direction."
good,"excellent place to work   with good management . I love the flexibility ,the hardest part of the job is the frequent changes ."
good,"Challenging because of quality and production requirements that seemed to change constantly. "

good,"UHC is a great place to work, everyone is willing to help you. Also the management is great as well.I learned alot working with here."
good,It was hard working here because I had a heart. So members would call in and could get there medicine and I had to be the one to tell them that the insurance does not cover it. That was the hardest part of my job.
good,Overall review is probably higher than the average business environment. Benefits were quite good and a reward sytsm encouraged accurate work
good,"nice company to work for; the accounting dept is not stable due to cleint acct periodic offshoring policy in place."
good,Every day that I get to work I always try my best to go the extra mile to help all of our customer. As well as my co-worker and management staff the hardest part of my job is when one of my customer is not satisfy. the most important thing about my job I was about to provide the best customer service to all of my customers
good,"Notify physicians, practitioners, and/or clinics of any financial responsibility of services.  Conduct contract research to endure proper claim processing adjustment.  Update coordination of benefit information for member to ensure proper claim processing. Research and process claim denials, corrected claims and claim reconsideration.

good,"UHG is a place where work and personal life is equally balanced."
good,"As a Health Advisor, I worked from a desk via hands-free phone and PC.  Calls are primarily in-bound, with some out-bound calls as needed.  I needed to multi-task between responding to the customer on the phone, while efficiently operating multiple software programs and documenting the records.  Most of the work occurs through the phone and PC, but some manual mailing/faxing was also required as needed.  The days are typically busy to very-busy.  I learned a great deal about job specifics, health insurance benefit plans and claims, and corporate policies.  Co-workers were usually polite and easy to work with.  Team work is essential and abundant.  Management is helpful.  The hardest part of the job is learning to be efficient and independent.  The most rewarding part of the job is becoming efficient and independent, while also having a smile on your face!"
good,"Great pay, great benefits, fun place to work. Management is a little lack, but all in all a great experience. Would recommend it."
good,"UnitedHealth Care is a really good place to work. The company culture is based on five important principles, Integrity, Compassion, Relationships, Innovation, and Performance, and they base it all on those. UnitedHealth Care has great understanding on Work/Life Balance being flexible as long as you do and complete your job responsibilities."
good,"Em um dia típico de trabalho, o tempo deve ser bem administrado, pois são diversas atividades extra rotina que são solicitadas pela diretoria interna do hospital e pela gerência de farmácia (planilhas, dados operacionais, entre outros assuntos que surgem para resolução de urgência)."
good,"Continuous changes as new start-up division of a very large insurance corporation; some hours doing referral management, some hours doing prior authorizations, some hours being overloaded and other hours with only the ability to complete due to continual system issues were the hardest part of the job. There were times when 14 hours per week of mandatory overtime was required."
good,"Worked for 3 years and loved each and everyday , the toughness make you grow exponentially. Team mates were amazing, Management backs you all the times, and you enjoy everyday being there."

good,"Aprendi muito com essa empresa. Em como poder realizar um ótimo trabalho, para satisfazer com inteligencia e dinamismo aos interesses da empresa,clientes prestadores e colaboradores. A direção sempre esteve acima das suas responsabilidades, mostrando uma empresa preocupada com os resultados mais acima de tudo mostrava que a empresa poderia se tornar um fabrica de sonhos capaz de transformar o ruim em bom. Os colegas de trabalho eram a melhor parte dessa empresa, pois eram como irmão se importando em ajudar e acolher quando necessário."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Working productively for 7.5 hours in the office. At the start of my shift, all reports are generated and submitted, second part of the shift is allotted for the team (one on one coaching, performance review, etc). Upper management have been supportive to all my decisions and projects which boost my confidence and motivated me to strive harder however, there are instance when the company don't even have answers to our inquiries about policies. Developmental training is done through the website. Overall, the environment is conducive for learning and growth."
good,"-gave me opportunity to learn EDI"
good,"keeps you busy,  coworkers are ok some of them have great parties. production is ok"
good,A typical day at liberty was alwasy interesting.  The team of us that worked together were very easy going and all worked WITH eachother.  That positiion helped set the pace for all future work experiences for me.  My management team was always open to hear what you had to say and allowed you to make the necessary changes to make your work life better. I learned the true meaning of team work.  The hardest part of our job was during the winter when our case load would skyrocket from auto cliams.  The most enjoyable part of this job was my team.  We were the best in the region.
good,I loved working for the company and what it's mission was about.  HOWEVER....the office manger and triage nurse were horrible towards other employees and occasional with patients.  They fed off of one another and made the work environment hard to return.  Employee turnover rate is high and maybe if they would fix the problem more people will enjoy their jobs.  Under cover boss needs to take look before things get out of hand.  (Pleasanton area)
good,"Great team work, hard to get career advancement, workload is sometimes impractical."
good,UnitedHealth Networks offers a lot of opportunities for learning and advancement.  Onboarding takes a while.  It is a very fast paced environment.
good,"fun at work, fun activity two times in a month."
good,I have enjoyed the opportunity to case manage member's healthcare services and interact with agencies providing a variety of healthcare benefits for the well-being and safety of my caseload.
good,"I learned computer skills, how to manage time, billing, auditing skills. The co-workers were very enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of auditing was to ensure that I did not make any errors while auditing the enrollment coordiators. The most enjoyable part of the day was when the coordiators had no errors."
good,"O dia começa na Amil como uma pequena reunião entre o gerente e os executivos de vendas,depois entrava em contato com os meus clientes e depois iria atender os meus clientes agendados."
good,United is good place to work. Mangers work with you to develop you skills. Plenty of room to grow.
good,I truely enjoy waorking for United Healthcare as they put alot of emphasis on the company culture.  The only reason I am seeking other employment is because the inconh is laying off in our division.
good,"Great Place to work, but unable to stay in the area specified on hire. "
good,"flexible schedule"
good,"Work several different reports from the States of TN and MS. Most of them had a 24 hour turnaround time."
good,"A typical day requires logging into a computer and phone system set up to take calls from medical providers regarding an array of topics in health insurance. This includes claims processing, member benefits, contract issues, credentialing information, and authorizations of medical procedures. I have learned a vast amount of medical insurance information from coding and processing claims, HIPAA practices, and maintaining professional relationships with providers. Management is wonderful on a personal level, yet tend to lack in fundamental information needed when seeking guidance on a particular topic. The hardest part of the job requires the redundant nature of the phone calls and questions, along with sticking to a ""script"" to de-escalate irate calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing offices and facilities the proper medical benefit information and assisting in higher quality professional relationships to bridge the gap between healthcare and health insurance."
good,"A parte mais agradável do trabalho se dava a cada trimestre, quando os melhores atendentes recebiam um premio que era oferecido em voucher, como reconhecimento pelo trabalho EXAGERADO."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,Work life balance and flexible telecommuting hours makes this job worthwhile. The team I work with is awesome. The pay makes it unsatisfactory for me. Merit increase was only 1% when I was at a high performing level.  Overall I've worked for worse places.

The work culture there is very employee focused and they have an excellent program called ""Our United Values"".  All employees are trained in these values from call center to top tier executives."
good,UHC offers competitive benefits and wages ion the area.  They are willing to train and love promoting from within.  The work is challenging and depending on the department can vary day to day.  The location had about 50 different areas working under one roof so it helps with being able to collaborate cross departmentally.
good,"Good place to work, I will highly recommend candidates to apply. Big company, big projects, more chances to grow. Please go through the company's website and apply."
good,"Em todas as situações é possível diálogo e encontrar um novo caminho. Todo processo depende dos dois lados para dar certo. É uma empresa com abertura moderada a ouvir o colaborador, excelente benefício. Call center é necessário aptidão e resiliência."

good,"Great place to work, given the right resources to do the job. Management believes in work life balance and career growth. Very collaborative teams who support each other."
good,"I was more or less my own boss as long as I did what was expected of me. As I worked from home, I did not have to deal with the office drama and I was more or less left to myself. The work could be compared to case management without the clinical background or pay level.  My most recent manager is very nice and supportive but the one before that was strictly ""by the book.""  Which is not very conducive to team moral. It is a good company to work for, with less drawbacks than many other places of employment and the benefits are very good."
good,A great company to work for!  You can excel in many areas. The atmosphere is pleasant and full of compassion. I advanced some of my skills with this job.
good,I loved working at united healthcare. I would clock in and sit down at my cubicle along with my teammates. I took care of many different scenarios on the phone and training was always provided.
good,"Most convenient aspect of the job was to able to work from home.  Enables you to work, even during inclement weather such as snow storms!  Saved on gas and food!"
good,"It wasn't mundane I was able to various things different days of the week. It was a collaborative work environment, everyone was willing to help out. We did have some downtime which made it easy to get to know each other. We had a lot of opportunities to learn about upcoming changes and improvements to our systems and working environment. Had ample details to handle any new changes."

good,UnitedHealth Group is the most diversified health care company in the United States and a leader worldwide in helping people live healthier lives and helping to make the health system work better for everyone.
good,"United Health Group is a fun place to work and I would recommend people to consider United Health Group for their carrier opportunities. The company values leadership, soft skills and provides you a comfortable working environment to work in."
good,"It was a very fast paced environment. It required a lot of research, staying abreast of medicare and medicaid policies. There isn't much room for growth right away. They do a lot for their employees in terms of appreciation and incentives. The shifts bids are pretty fair. There is workplace drama, but no more than any other place of business."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,Empresa com bons beneficios porém sem chance de crescimento profissional
good,"As far as call centers go, it is not the worst.  AS long as you show up every day and do your job, no one gives you a hard time, and they do try and help you get better as long as they see you are trying.  You get yearly raises and opportunities to bonus, but moving into higher positions can prove to be difficult"

good,"I would say my experience working for United HealthGroup, has been an enjoyable and learning experience. From the Big Wigs down to the representatives."
good,I enjoyed working here. I just didn't see room for growth with the company. The health insurance was horrible. I've worked for many health insurance companies with great health insurance and this is to expensive.
good,"The culture and my direct manager were great aspects of the job. The option to work from home is a nice perk. My specific role, however, offered very little flexibility in start and end times and PTO was extremely difficult to use in the summer unless a trip was planned 8 months in advance. Career development and advancement are not a priority however they offer opportunities to do that, just not allowed within my role."
good,"Its a chill company with great work life balance. Transport has been provided nearly in all locations of DELHI NCR. Overtime is there."
good,"I enjoyed working here. The management was always kind and supported their employees well.  Insurance benefits were average.  Compensation was good.  I did not like the ""Big Brother"" technology that they had on our computers.  It became too much before I quit."

good,"I enjoyed working at UHG very much. The people there are very kind and management strives to see you succeed. The training is top notch. I mainly assisted members in processing requests for medication, but I saw a definite future there."
good,"It's nice that they allow their members to work from home. That's what I was looking forward to. Their benefits are nice. Having to sit at my desk 8 hours a day, with limitations of leaving the desk, were not for me."

good,A typical day at work with UHC includes receiving calls from providers offices regarding denial of claims. Reviewing the reason and advising providers
good,"Productive and family-like environment. Did not feel prepared in training for the calls, but had co workers to help me. Other than feeling less than prepared in training the job, pay and people are very good."

good,The job atmosphere at this place was better than most job I had. They had people who wanted to succeed and would help you achieve that success. I wish other companies were like this in what they did.
good,I worked for UHG for 7 years as compliance auditor. I enjoyed my time as a UHG employee. The company downsized and unfortunately I was one who was let go.
good,"Great company to work for, Energetic team. Absolutely loved the environment and pay! There was honestly not much of a hard moment at work. I would take on incoming calls, and I absolutely loved educating others on health insurance and the medicare advantage plans as well as the perscription drug plans. It was a very motivating job and very rewarding to say the least. Management was pretty decent, the only thing that I would say is that the position that I'd had was temporary and so I did not ever know when my last day was. So it was hard for me to plan out prospect jobs when not knowing how much longer I was to stay. Otherwise, if it were permanent then I would have completely enjoyed myself."
good,the position I had a UHC was several years ago and it was contract work however it was a team environment which I value.  A place where you could bounce ideas off each other and help out when needed.
good,Was a fun place to work it is a very productive place you stay busy the hardest part is doing 35 claims a day. work place was nice you had enough space to work.
good,"This job was originally onsite which was great but turned into a home position which I didn't always enjoy as over time it felt isolating. I enjoy people. I found myself working 50 plus hours a week and not getting enough exercise. My position was inpatient care manager. I would be assigned app 4-8 hospitals and manage United patient's care appropriately, approve their days, and assist with discharge planning via computer. I also won Service Hero award the first year offered to clinical staff for improving coworker morale by sending daily uplifting email, birthday emails, and funny pics through out the day. Part of this was attendance of a award ceremony weekend in Orlando. I left this job to concentrate on my family and getting active."
good,Lot of learning besides being given the freedom of Work estimates.  No stringent timelines . Flexible to reach out all stakeholders when and where required .
good,Great work culture giving you enough freedom to work on your pace and make appropriate decisions when needed. Awesome team that supports each other and help in learning along each other.
good,decent place to work  but does not offer a lot of opportunities for promotions. Salary was not acceptable compares to other companies for the same position.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,"My experience with UHG was good overall. They promote from within and had on the job training for technicians.  I was able to get my national certification while working here, and moved from a data entry tech, to a team lead and then to supervisor. This would not be available to a tech in retail."
good,The hardest part of the decision to leave was due in part to changing duties as in traveling.  Job functions were changed due to new management.  Pay was also a factor and is unchanging with the times and competitors.
good,"On-site gym and clinic is always a bonus. The job can be very demanding and sometimes stressful, because of the new merger. The benefits are great. The workplace environment is okay if you do not get involved in workplace politics."
good,"United give me opportunity to learn a different area of pharmacy, work with prior authorizations and pharmacy."
good,"Nice place and nice people but the leadership changed frequently so sometime it is hard to keep the cadence for a project."
good,"Optum Tech gives new hires, through the Technology Development Program, a great start in software engineering. Managers are very understanding that new hires will take some time to learn new skills and transition from college to an office working lifestyle. Managers will give you many tools to get started and will give you a good amount of time to learn any new skills that you might want. Though most teams are very disorganized and don't follow similar structures at all. Many times you'll have weeks where work is light and then randomly, you'll have so much work that you can't finish it all within a 40 hour week. Funding projects happens very rarely and many new ideas get cut a month into development. Most of the work I did was to create cost saving for the company rather than create projects to improve the lives of United Healthcare members."
good,It's a great place to work. I would work there again. They people there are very helpful and the pay is good. They can be alittle strict but overall its a good job.

good,Good entry level position into the health care field. Company is constantly seeking growth and is heading in a good direction. Looking forward to see what the company ends up becoming in a few years.
good,"My typical day consisted of being timed on everything, including going to the restroom. The supervisor does rounds at every cubicle serving cuban coffee shots to employees. Steady fast pace and yes there is overtime; and its not a request, its an order. Everyone I worked with and all my supervisors were very polite and respectful."
good,"Me proporcionou um grande aprendizado, excelente estrutura, tem um produto que eu acreditava muito e o defendia pela transparência."
good,"Fast pace, educational, support, driven, clean, spacious environment.  I love how they will offer lunches, for employee appreciation days and bonuses."
good,This company is growing by huge amounts. The culture leads to many future advancements. The company covers large areas of Fresno and Tulare Counties. The compensation and benefits tends to be larger than most competitors.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

good,Eu até o momento estou gostando muito de trabalhar em Home Care pela Amil
good,"I have enjoyed my time at UHG/Optum however I am looking for a new growth opportunity. The best part was the ability to telecommute and also to be a part of a company on the cutting edge of healthcare. Excellent senior leadership as well. The downside is that the company runs very lean, everyone is a bit overworked and, while the PTO is plentiful, it is hard to take time off."
good,The job is challenging and the folks you work with are great.  Plenty of training is offered and required.  They work to keep their environments on the cutting edge and work outside the box so keep up with the technical and market.  Change is embraced.

good,It is a average call center with metrics that must be met.  It is a performance based company that like all companies does depend on how much they like or dislike you in order for you to go up the latter; even if you out perform the others.
good,This is a call center so you must enjoy heavy phones as well as being the connection for members to their benefits and programs that will help them live healthy.
good,I am a work at home associate with the company. My day starts around 6a. I login and sign in to all systems and begin my work in production. I do have a daily quota and only ask for assistance if needed. My supervisor is only an instant message away.

good,"UHG is an excellent company to work for in the aspect that they are family oriented and care about their employees.  The managers are professional and kind.  The management is always promoting a fun and playful environment to raise the morale of the work environment and to lift the staff's spirits.  Management cares greatly for each worker.  There are no raises and the job is tough because you often get angry customers whom blame the advocate personally for things beyond their immediate control but, the managers do everything in there power to be supportive to make up for the fact that the advocates are NOT fairly compensated at ALL for there hard work by making games out of meeting goals in making appointments and other statistics by giving out gift cards.  However, at the end of the day it does not financially compensate for the work put in and after a few years of employment I have found myself still at 10.00 an hour and doing more work with the same pay.  Therefore, I believe it is time to move on to a new company.  I do love my job with UHG however, I feel I am not compensated fairly for the work I put in there."

good,"Faced paced, you dont get to really have one on one help with coaches or team leads. Friendly coworkers and work environment. I had a really great coach though who taught me a lot & was extremely helpful when he had the chance"
good,"The day at at office was typically revolved around scheduling authorization, communicating with providers and consumers during the approval process. Training was always available and opportunity for coaching and development was provided on a regular basis to improve quality service in the organization."
good,it was good. I really enjoyed working there. I felt like the environment was happy and fun. It was fast paced but you had very good support. Also training was very good and long.
good,Difficult job at first but after the training you become more comfortable. Job has strict quotas. Great room for growth. Have to be able to sit for long periods of time.
good,"I spent approximately 25 years in several different positions at UnitedHealth Group, and was very proud to be associated with the company. The level of service to insureds and stakeholders was very high."
good,I was pretty new to Case Management. United have taught me a lot and I am very grateful for the opportunity. Like every work place there's always politics but the managers pretty much leave you alone to do your thing. I did not have any problems with my Managers. They were pretty awesome. They have taught me a great deal. United is all about work. There's no joking around. They are pretty much all about work. Don't think that you're going to be making friends because the workload will keep you VERY busy.
good,United Healthcare was a good place to work with excellent help in advancing in the company. my skill set was not designed for the type of work that was expected
good,UHG really cares about it's employees. The culture is nice and there's a great work/life balance. Some of the management can get better but overall a good company to work for.

good,very good atmosphere. collaborative coworkers. Facilities are organized and all resources prompt provided. nurses and assistants always ready to help.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,Upon hiring you are given 3 months of classroom training after which you are basically thrown to the wolves. If you have never worked in a call center or are unable to deal with abusive customers you will probably not do well. The people and most of the management are great. If someone sees you are struggling they typically tey to lend a hand. Overall it was a good place to work
good,"Worked as a CSR for almost 8 years. Direct management was awesome. Upper Leadership couldn't care less about employees. Great time off (27 PTO days accrued). 8 paid holidays. FMLA, allowed up to 5 attendance occurrences per year without consequence. Worked from home full time. Uptrainings were done on a virtual basis- no need to go in office. Agents are given fair consideration when not meeting expectations for performance."
good,"Although fast paced, we were compensated well for the work, however there was mandatory overtime during peak season. We did get constant incoming calls from members, and some questions were difficult but the resources to find the answers were provided to us."
good,"I have learned a lot working with the County Hospital."
good,"fast pace, fun but stringent. number were easy to meet if yoiu stay diligent and focused. Bonuses were paid for meeting and exceeding stats.Managemant was very helpful and encouraging. I enjoyed helping member with their healthcare needs."

good,A great place to work.  Only bad part was the company was so large it was hard to get things completed.  This company has the largest number of remote employees.  Very easy to get the resources and support while working from home.
good,The company is very promising. I have learned a lot more about customer service. The management could provide a healthier work environment for the employee. The hardest part is dealing with management issues. An enjoyable part of the job is the job itself and the coworkers.
good,it is a great place to work they do not give raises however there are a lot of great people that work with UHC the leadership could be a bet better but over all great place to work.
good,"Good benefits, great employees. I had really good training as well in a short period of time. I was able to pass my state board with no issues and I had a good understanding."
good,"UHG compensates their employees fairly, engaged with their employees, management works closely with employees for career advancement by utilizing them through different projects."
good,United Health Care is a very large insurance company. My group was responsible for a set of internal tools company employees used for communication and coordination.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Wonderful company, great pay/benefits package, great life to work balance allowed. Highly recommend. The management embraced and “lives” the culture. Definitely recommend."
good,"I would meet potential patients and families for admission to the IRF, review patient profiles with the IRF physiatrist and IRF Nursing Director for acute post acute care admission, worked collaboratively with  nurse case managers in arranging admission to the IRF, obtained pre-certification from insurance carriers for admission, completed all required documentation for admission as per IRF guidelines and regulations, facilitated marketing for the IRF units. I had a great manager, very fexible with the schedule as long as the work was completed. There was a great work culture. We implemented many programs that facilitated patient outcomes and enabling them to return home. Most enjoyable about the job was meeting many people and seeing them improve and able to return home. Hardest part was the last year when I was the only one in the position as my partner was taken out of work due to medical issues."

good,Great company had great values.  The values were practiced and demonstrated by the senior leadership.  The company provided good training and the benefits were very good.
good,"UHG is growing globally.  It is a fast-paced organization that operates very virtually.  35% of the workforce are telecommuters.  With HQ in MN, it is very MN-centric."
good,"The people their are amazing. They are encouraging, friendly, and motivated. Working here makes you want to learn more and do better. It was a wonderful experience."
good,"I loved working for United Health Care, I had the freedom to work at home and enjoyed every minutes of it, if I had bot retired I would still be working there..It was a pleasure working there"
good,Lots of interaction with client on the phone. Opportunities to assist clients  with their healthcare needs. Great support from management. Wish they had telecommuter positions at the time I left.
good,"The people there are great and so is the company, but customers and providers can ruin your day with hurtful words and anger. It gave me anxiety having to worry about whether or not a customer would yell at me today. Claims/call reps sit all day and take phone calls. You get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. If you do the job well, you have the possibility of moving to a different department and there are quarterly reviews for bonuses. Vacation isn't paid, it's a grant. Every day I would dread work, but the moment I actually did the job, I would think it wasn't so bad, but the cycle would just repeat itself. So, I finally quit and my anxiety disappeared. Yay! Props to the people who stay, I can't do it."
good,"Answering inbound calls daily, we strive on the culture. Computer/phone tends to act up making it difficult to perform your duties. Enjoy the job I do"
good,"Excellent place to work, everyone is there for each other.  Help each other to succeed. Makes sure morale is high with the employees,., which increases productivity.  In the Billing department we all work as a team, one can't stand without the other.  We depend a lot on each other, and we show respect and kindness.  This is an excellent place to work for and I enjoy everyday with the staff and our Manager.   I have learned alot from the previous manager, ie how to create queries and build scans.  The hardest part of my job is when I have to recommend staff, that's not a good feeling, especially when you're worked so long with them, after fifteen years, staff is like family."
good,Una empresa muy buena con un muy ambiente y enfocada a sus clientes.
good,The companies location is actually near to our place. It should only take me 45mins to 1 hour to get their. But the main problem is the traffic situation. Due to traffic the travel time quadruples which became a challenging part on my physicality.
good,Excellent company and opportunity for growth.  Provides health benefits and discounts and credit union along many other benefits.  There is opportunity for you to show your skills and they commend you for it also.

Parts part of my job is being on the phones all day, just not something I'm interested in doing anymore. I don't mind being on the phone, just not ALL DAY. I enjoy my co-workers and I love helping people"
good,My work day consisted of answering incoming and making outgoing calls assisting doctors and nurses in the helpdesk and take customer material requests

good,This position at Optum Inc. through UnitedHealthCare was a phenomenal position that had potential for upward mobility with the organization. I had ample opportunities to meet exceptional co-workers and employers to assist me in achieving my endeavors within the organization.
good,As UHC has moved to a more work from home environment it has been a challenge to subcontractors to find growth within the company. Downsizing has also been a contributor.

good,OK. Good place to get experience and understand policy and procedures. However in order to grow you have to be ambitious and strive for mastery of the concepts

good,Most enjoyed helping and educating members on their medication and UGH services and products. Excited to advance with UGH and help members and new members.
good,"I love assisting the customers, I did learn a lot a great place to work. Learned a lot more about customer serv. The training process was awesome.Responsible for verifying patient eligibility for benefit coverage.Ensured diagnosis codes were correct and obtained additional information regarding claims Assisted both patients and providers in understanding covered benefits "
good,"I enjoyed the diversity in the work.whereas; several platforms to work from. I enjoyed the environment, and the opportunity for growth. A typical day at work was prioritizing your work for the day such as work that took priority from the CEO and or escalated work. The hardest part of the job was the lack of communication on assignments. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that, you met quality standards and that, our providers were paid correctly as well as, patients needs were met."
good,"Schedule patients on a day to day basis. "
good,"The job was dedicated to numbers and there was a constant changing environment.  The only true down side was the benefits, while they had medical, dental and vision, the medical options were High Deductible Health plans only."

good,"Overall its a good place to work at. I been here since July of 2004. "
good,"On a typical work day you would come in and AUX into the call center taking calls from members about their insurance benefits and/or claims.  After documenting their file, you will have 7 seconds before you would hear a beep in your ear and the next call would be there.  Very busy but fun place to work."
good,"Assisted departments with analysis eligibility, and validation and invoicing of client accounts.Performed data entry from ePAF into PeopleSoft system reflecting addition and termination of jobs and salary modifications. Posted Internet and applied EBPP customers payments, manage daily invoice register, compile DSO (days outstanding) reports, research and resolve collections and customer issues with EBPP."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at United HealthGroup.  If you maintain your goals and have discipline, you will find yourself being promoted quickly.  Management takes notice of self-starters and those who receive criticism graciously and as a tool for overall improvement."
good,"The team work is very good, not enough management assistance, the hardest part of the job is getting the call completed before getting another call, the systems are very slow and with a lot of issues, there is a great compensation and ethics, but there is no flexibility for school or family."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

good,"Relaxed day at work most days, I have learned commitment and culture, Management needs better communication skills. Company promotes culture. Communication with other employees is sometimes hard. Caring for the members is the best part of job"
good,"It was a good place to work, yet the compensation did not reflect the prominence of the company relative to the cost of living in the local area. Other than that, I learned a lot and have been able to carry that knowledge to other company's in order to increase my value as an asset in several health related positions."
good,Fast pace and always changing. High volume and heavy workloads. Middle management needs work. On the job training that is valuable. Overall would recommend for a new comer to the health field.
good,"They provided the staff for incentive for a job well done. A typical day would included 100-200 calls a day, setting prior authorizations and corresponding with doctors and nursing."

good,"Typical day at work consists of inbound phone calls from members, requesting insurance information, changes of primary care providers, reviewing claims, and basic member information. I learned the different parts of medicare and what they cover, how to handle members concerns and the insurance basics. Management is good for the most part. The trainers are very informative and willing to explain anything you have questions about. Supervisors are very helpful and willing to assist with and questions and concerns. The workplace culture is very welcoming and settled."

good,A great job to have and started as a contract employee and moved to a full-time employee. The managers I worked with were great and fun to work with.  I did learn a lot and the days did move fast.  The only con was mandatory overtime and it does get difficult with juggling family/personal life with mandatory overtime.

good,"I enjoyed working with United and being home based. I leaned a lot about insurances and case reviews. Case management was a  all around nursing position, I had to know something about everything!"
good,"Mainly a call center"
good,"It is a call center, and people are calling in about health care, for themselves or loved ones. It can get emotional and stressful. It is a good job, and the training is exceptional. You must be able to multi-task and listen to your customer while researching the issue and looking for a win/win solution. A solution that will bring some satisfaction to the customer while also staying within the guidelines of United Healthcare."

good,"A typical day within my office consists of arriving promptly to set up my work station, and within minutes of settling into my cubicle being informed of the latest scuttlebutt du jour - regardless if I wish to hear it or not. Once the shift has started, I field incessant, repetitive, and mundane phone calls, repeating the same information ad nauseum to people who've heard it 10,000 times before, yet still ask questions and become irate as if our processes are totally foreign to them. You are not allowed to place callers on hold, even if their issue requires brief research to be resolved.

good,"A typical day was at night I worked the graveyard shift for 16yrs and I learned to be even more independent upon myself, because I was much alone at night at the front desk which was okay because I got to study on my computer.  I saw management only when it was time to go home, because when the lead came in I was going home, so not much communication unless something required immediate attention.  My co-workers were a lot of fun to be around and I have stayed in touch with a couple since leaving.  The hardest part was when a patient came in and did not have insurance or cash at the time to pay the deposit I felt bad for them, I mean we would still see them of course but if it was not emergent then we would have to send the patient over to the county hospital for treatment.  The enjoyable part of the job was learning new things because in a health care environment everything is changing at a rapid pace.  plus once again I enjoyed the friendship I cultivated with some of my co-workers whom I think of as family."

good,UHG is a good company with good work culture. Work is done in a systematic order. The only problem is that its quite hard to get promotion and it takes a lot more than usual time in role change.
good,"Overall it is a large company with many moving parts. Not all managers are great but the ones I had the privilege to call my managers were. Sadly, the company is slow to grow the workforce they currently have and would rather cut employment to save money than to develop the great workforce it currently has without the employee working many years without expressing a desire to move up. I was once told if I did these five things within a yr I could be on my way to a higher position only to find that once I had completed those tasks, I was told I couldn't at that time due to being too new at the company."

good,A typical day at work is fast paced environment.  I train 20-25 trainees on the material and the systems that we are using each day.  Management is supportive of their employees and assist as necessary.  I'm a perfectionist so sometimes when I feel a trainee is struggling I like to spend more time than alotted on material to ensure everyone's understanding.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the light come on once everyone understands the information.

good,"being a customer service representative for UHC isnt a easy job. you deal with a lot whether you take calls from members, brokers, benefits administrators or providers. you cant take what the callers say when they are angry and yelling at you personally. the management team is always there to support you no matter what. if you need time away from the phones because you have had a really bad call they are good at giving you time to relax before you take another call. working for UHC is like one big family everyone tries to help each other out. UHC has what we call huddles which is nice because it gives you a chance to get off the phones, it gives you a nice break. UHC also has what they call CSAW which stands for customer service appreciation week. this week is filled with lots of fun activities, you get to dress up everyday and compete for who has the best costume, win prizes.
