rating,review
bad,Very prejudice. Manager only help and promote friends and family. Managers discriminate against people they do not like. Lots and lots of bullying by manager and other employees. Senior VP's and managers do not discipline employees that cause trouble. Most managers lie so much and the truth is not in them.
bad,"No clear specific answers to anything ."
bad,"Micromanage everything, understaff, felt alone be sides the long line with customers, while co-workers and management are on their cell or talking about what they should get for breakfast and lunch."
bad,I have worked for many banks in my career and Key Bank was one of the worst. There is no opportunity  for job advancement and management does nothing to help.you as an employee.
bad,"Regional leader was not professional, Key bank's doesn't believe in spending money in upgrades, still using DOS to open accounts, everything is out of date."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. Do not care about their employees, especially the ones who have been their for way over 10 years. They do not pay well either!  Upper management is not good"
bad,"Company was great for the first 2 years, but then management changed. Forged signatures on account cards, loan documents were something I saw often. Inconsistent compliance expectations for annual audit. My last manager would tell me to open credit cards for our client during the account opening process and just tell them they were approved at the end. If they weren't approved, he would tell me to just not say anything. When  refused, I was non-compliant. I alerted the District Manager and he did nothing. Compliance Officers are treated terribly. Managers treat them like they are a bother and often ignore their requests."
bad,"I was excited to start working at Keybank, and everything was perfect in the beginning. Towards the end my manager was horrible to me, she would talk badly about me to other employees and also to customers. She would make me lie to the district manager so we would look like we were doing great on our sales. The company doesn’t really care about customers just about the numbers and beating other  banks.. I have never walked out of a job without another job lined up but my manager was horrible."
bad,"The culture used to be employees would work there 30-45yrs and retire, but now, you must be young and naive and they'll kick you out after 3yrs. They oversell job titles and phony responsibilities so young professionals can seem important on social media  but management is just toying with them and laughing at their own despicable lies. "
bad,Daily tasks reaching out to existing clients to deepen relationship for additional producst and services.  Handle customers complaints and account inquirie.
bad,"Reorganizing teams, traveled every week to cover territory.  A lot of time away from family. "
bad,"Not going to waste any more time on this company.  I have absolutely no interest in ever working here again, don't want to waste my breath, time, energy, or thoughts on it either.  Absolutely do NOT recommend anyone to work here unless you like being treated poorly, discouraged from growing, and like to be paid much less than you are worth."
bad,High turnover for tellers. Always short staffed and new managment every few months. If u want a job that has stability dont work here.  U feel like your walking on eggshells everyday
bad,Key high demand job very stressful position the new manager has no loyalty to any of the older employees don't stay in one postion to long they will find a way to let you go
bad,Would never recommend working here. Culture is very cliquey and can be intimidating and often annoying. Culture needs a lot of work and they need to realize their space in the market/ competition
bad,Banks are worth billions and somehow they can only afford 13 an hour for tellers who live in a city where 1000 dollars is average for a studio and gas is 4 dollars a gallon theres no room for improvement and even a banker is lucky to make 50k with commission..
bad,"I worked for Key almost 2 years and I'm not sure why I even bothered staying there for that long. In the beginning I loved it, had great ARL (area retail leader) and managers, but that changed quickly. As Key does most of their changes without any notice, they switched the ARLs year later. Since the change, all I saw was Area 1 going down the hill! So many employees left Key cause of the new management. "
bad,The culture of key bank was awful when I was employed there. I would not recommend working there to anyone! They are all about the dollar signs and do not care about people at all.
bad,"Key prides itself on the E.V.E. conversation, but don't allow for the conversation to last over 5 min.  Sometimes these situation calls for more then a quick fix.  E.V.E. mean Ease, Value and Expertise, but only for those calls that have a quick fix.  If that cacalcacall runs over any breaks you are penalized for offering to much assistance.  Also there is no room for human error in this company."
bad,I would not ever advise anyone to work for this company. Do to a system error there was a payment that was processed early customer or bank wasn't harmed in away. But hr blame me for it and I was let go.
bad,Worst place I have ever worked in my life. I cannot think of one positive thing to mention. The training was horrible to a new hire or lack there of. The managers seemed stressed out and extremely rude. I dreaded coming back to that place the second I left it.
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for. The training is non-existent, goals are completely unrealistic, management is an actual joke, everyone has questions and no one has answers. Truly a disgrace."
bad,"Careless management, interests are only their own.  They don't support their staff, Negligence. They place heavy loads of unmanageable high level tasks on their employees and expect you to be error free. When it comes to asking for their assistance on important matters, Emails are ignored and you're left to fend for yourself, when losses take place they are quick to put the blame on lowest level reps to save their own positions."
bad,"No one knows what they are doing and as soon as something goes wrong entry level employees are scapegoats and are cut when it should be management... After Wells Fargo recent scandal ""changes"" were made to pressure off employees such as removing quotas... Nevertheless, quotas (in our daily morning meetings) were changed to ""incentives"". So, instead of having monthly quotas... we have monthly incentives..."
bad,"I showed up 20 minutes early commuting 35 minutes away, to see two lazy, not even awake yet excuse for hiring managers walk through the doors to call me up twenty minutes late! Their interview questions were as ill prepared and completely redundant. I have seen third party collections places operating on sketchy grounds that had more professionalism in a mere stretch of words than the people I was speaking with."
bad,"To begin, KeyBank does not give sick time. You have to use vacation time if you are sick.  Keybank still uses dos-based systems for their everyday procedures. All of the technology systems are antiquated and crash consistently.  Management is focused on churning out as many products as possible regardless of suitability.  There are way too many levels of management which hinders any type of effective communication or chance for advancement.  "
bad,Worked in the income property group. Managed by folks in AZ who were miserable. Gossip is rampant. Lots of politics so beware. RM’s trumps the mortgage banker so you will be in an inferior position when comes time for your review. Time for the old hags to retire!
bad,"Never work here. I would holistically say that this bloated company is worthless. You don't matter at all, the expectations are ridiculous, and the training is garbage."
bad,"Unethical sales culture, poor upper management, sales goals are not in line with what's best for the clients. All of the things that got Wells Fargo in trouble are happening at Key"
bad,"Key bank management was horrible, no matter if you were the hardest working person in the branch if anything went wrong you were basically blamed. They take the word of the most seasoned person who was usually the laziest person in the branch regardless of how many people complained. I hated going to work and never wanted to be there. The customers were great but they weren't great enough to make me want to stay. I had to get out asap."
bad,"poor training no incentive for referrals that we are reqired to have and no incentive for all the credit cards we are to sel, they push us sooo hard but we get nothing!!!"
bad,they churn and burn people like there's no tomorrow. most employees never make the goals and if you do the goal goes up. people are constantly being fired or quitting.
bad,KeyBank is very sales driven to the extent that every account opened is not above board.  There are dedicated employees that work here and have been asked to do unethical things.
bad,"I did not like working for this company because it became very streeful and competitive. I worked in King City, Or. The goals set became unreachable and people became cutthroat to meet the goals."
bad,"banking is a fun job with lots of growth potential, it teaches you money handling and financial skills essential to being a successful financial advisor."
bad,"This place hires ANYone, even people that can't do their jobs, and fire the ones that can. There is no room for advancement and if your a level 1 just start to look for something else, you can only deal with the ""basic"" checking accounts and savings account and have to transfer everything else, and get told that your transfer rate is to high and if you don't lower it to their standards they can just let you go. When you do get to a new level there is no pay raise, eventhough the new hires will make more than you"
bad,I hated everything about working there. The staff were mean and condescending. The hours were long and the rules and products were very hard to enforce because it is ridiculous...
bad,"Continually being trained to services more aspects of banking with no increase in pay very demanding of their employees with no compensation, always changing our schedules with no notifications,promised bonus for over time so many people who had to keep asking to get Key to follow through"
bad,The sales pitch to get you to go work there is very good but as soon as you start everything starts to change. They job done is never good enough and they don't care a rats rear about you. Work life balance is horrible.
bad,The position is highly micro-managed at the call center. Mid way through the year they changed their goals to a more sales-oriented approach.
bad,"No family/work balance, pay extremely low, grading scale extremely unfair and unrealistic. Treat customers terrible with a lot of fees, nickel & dime them to death. Nothing in customer's or employees interest."
bad,typical day would involve helping clients with online banking and opening accounts. troubleshooting problems clients are having with online banking.
bad,"This company is all about the numbers, not a supportive work environment. Beware of this bank and it's executive management. Extreme amount of politics and red tape to the point nothing can get done."
bad,To much work not enough money. The Moral in the office is very bad. Several employees felt the same way. this job is very unfair. So before you apply just know you will be scammed into a sales position and its really not. I worked there almost a year and never received any incentive. Their Quality dept will eat you alive so if you make mistakes they will take you down!!!!!!
bad,KeyBank use to be a good company to work for... I have been here for a number of years and have watched the bank go down fast!!!! I do not recommend anyone take a job at Keybank!!
bad,"Worked there for 23 years seen many changes they are very sales oriented, not caring if the customer was in need of product was just suppose to push it on them. Bottle line was always sales. After 23 yrs of service rate of pay was 14:00. Would not recommend working for very stressful"
bad,"My co-workers are reliable and easy to get alone with. A typical day at Key Bank is handling clients transactions, talking to them about what Key has to offer and making my referral goal for the day. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the changes. You learn something one way and then it changes just when you got completely comfortable with it. For an example, I had to relocate a few times and had to start over learning my co-worker, branch and clients. But the good news is that I also learned more about Key, because each branch does thing little different and someone is willing to show you something new. The most enjoyable part of the job is being recognize for my efforts."
bad,It was a great company to work for until the end. Lack of communication with its employees and eventually it became the largets bank to fail.
bad,"They wouldn't allow time off to care for a terminal parent, then fought my unemployment for leaving!"
bad,"•	Managed first-line tellers in an operational setting "
bad,"The administrative team does not work as a team. There is a lack of accountability for what goes on. Trying to learn what is necessary to do your job is like pulling teeth. The assistants lack professionalism, and are not mature enough to help one another.  The department desperately needs a supervisor who is competent, detailed, and has experience in managing people. "
bad,"Come in and sit at a desk and process checks. Using the number pad for processing numbers, Management was poor, Really didn't associate with co workers. Looking at the checks and trying not to look at the number keys to type in the numbers. I didn't even enjoy was I was doing because I was under too much pressure."
bad,"Management was awful, there was no support, high rate of turn over, pay compared to what was required was bad."
bad,The people were good to work with but the wage was under expected and the constant pressure to push people into new accounts and cards was extremly awful.
bad,"Workplace is nice, but managemnet is myopic. No work life balance. difficult to mangage for females with kids. enjoyble part is ggood colleagues, and good friends"
bad,"Not the best place to work if you are looking to advance in your career.  Also not a place that recognizes education and experience as assets.  Very unethical and borderline criminal sales practices, akin to Wells Fargo and other banks."
bad,Management doesn't know how to run the department with organization or respect of the employees life outside of work.  If the department is behind we are made to stay until the work is done period.
bad,Worst job ever!!!  The only thing they want you to tell the customer is no! You get yelled at constantly by customers and upper management expects you to take it.. supervisors were fantastic and sympathized with the way we were treated by customers and management but their hands are tied in regards to any help I would run not walk away from this company in a heartbeat!! Would not even bank with them .. good job FEE BANK
bad,All they care about is the bottom dollar not the customer or employee.  They are very threatening if you  dont do the sales requirement and they want you to work with a skeleton crew
bad,Not a good place to work.  No real job security.  No real opportunities for advancement.  Very little transparency.  Terrible health insurance-high deductible.
bad,"The building itself is dirty & smells funny on the third floor. It is impossible to get a week of vacation scheduled at one time. Training is literally a joke, switching teachers daily & not teaching you half of your job. Serious serious issues here. Management is selfish & unorganized. They spent most of their time coming in late, on their cell phones, or taking care of personal matters. Hiring process makes it seem like a fun, family like environment & it is anything, but that. Culture is downright garbage- no respect amongst employees, managers, or coworkers."
bad,"Allows active harassment of, and hostilities toward, military veterans."
bad,"I love KeyBank as a commpany but when it comes to managment is the worst that I have been working . They don,t care about people that work for that company..."
bad,"I worked in Operations.  My manager along with the director for Payment and Deposit Operations treated employees terribly.  Never knew from day to day, what his mood was going to be and then it would be taken out on his directs.  Management plays favorites and HR does nothing to solve problems."
bad,"horrible place to work. though the pay is alright i would not recommend  key to anyone. the atmosphere was judgmental and every mistake was judged. if you had a car accident you received a point, you could not make a simple mistake."
bad,"I do not have much to say about this company. I worked there for over a year, and hated the company within only one month. You are not appreciated, and only looked at as a number on a spread sheet. The benefits are very expensive, and are not worth the price. Internal promotions are laughable because the raise that you get is no where near the rate a person coming off the street would get. It is a common joke that if you are about to get promoted; quit, and then reapply to that job so you can get paid what you are supposed to."
bad,I worked for Keybank for 6 years as a branch manager. Our sales goals were unrealistic and impossible to achieve. The burnout and turnover rate were high. Upper-management mostly did not care about employees. The HR department was a joke. The company wanted to be both a community bank and a wall street bank and the retail bank business plan was stupid. One year I was told to act like I was the CEO of my business and the next year I was told to act like I was managing a retail store. Management never followed through with promises. My last six months with the bank were horrible. They brought in a hatchet man to get rid of everybody. I was on escalating performance improvement plans and I was expected to write up the rest of my staff at the same time. It was one of the worst periods of my life.
bad,"Loved my manager......horrible pay, too much pressure on one person."
bad,"Key is more concerned with profit despite advertising that they are a ""community"" bank. Over the course of two years I witnessed numerous unethical behaviors from managment and when I filed a complaint I was retaliated against even though I had been told there was a ""zero tolerance"" retaliation policy. I went through multiple channels to report and fight the retaliation but was completely ignored.  This company will charge you outrageous fees then lie to you about why they were charged. I have never worked for a more dishonest and deceitful business"
bad,"Zero empathy , No job security, Bad and racist job clingy Managers ALL OVER THE  company, ancient software that takes solid 15 min just to log in rest you can assume, trying to implement NOT SO REALISTIC approach to get business, biased judgment towards customers and employees. Sneaky and back stabbing coworkers. All they care is how much production and profit you bring to table, Employee assistant is just a service for Long lasting employees"
bad,I was harrassed by my manager. I was talked about laughed at in my face. Other coworkers ganged up on me. I was told I dressed up to much. I was a teller I believed that I should mimic my other colleagues as far as my dress code. Coworkers became intimidated started bashing me because I dressed up every day and wore skirts and and dress shoes. My manager lied on me to get me fired and then lied on paperwork to her own boss to. Get me fired
bad,KeyBank does not care about its employees. You get your schedule for the month but they don’t think you should make plans around it. Your not guaranteed the time off that’s on your schedule. They definitely don’t compensate you for the work they expect. They are a do more with less company.
bad,The branch was under staffed. And the manager was racist. I had a good team behind the teller line. After the merger things went downhill. Always busy.
bad,"The branch I worked at the manager was young he is excellent at his job a top performer, but when it came to running a branch he is failing big time. KeyBank as a company is not a terrible company to work for, they constantly change policies which can be hard to work with. Unless your a top performer don’t expect them to recognize you other then your welcome to the company. Some branches are fast paced and some are very slow. No one I’ve met has been particularly happy there, they are slow to hire, and fast to fire just to replace you with someone they want or is a star at another financial institution. If you get written up for something don’t expect them to help you or get support from managers to make sure you don’t do something wrong. They will just reprimand you instead of teaching you."
bad,poor support from leadership as well as incompetent processes. Very political environment with inability to upgrade successful strategy's within the markets. Lack of proper procedures disable efficiency's as well
bad,KeyBank was awful. I disliked working there. The hours stinked. The company had no give back. The workers were miserable. Nothing like first niagara. Unhappy there
bad,"Key lacks a lot of the skill needed to be a competitive bank and they do not have the right leadership in place to be successful in all areas. There is minimal training and absolutely no on boarding process, you're left on your own to find your way. There is no support, and poor resources."
bad,"I have worked for KeyBank in a branch role and have found it to be extremely difficult and disheartening. KeyBank routinely asks for feedback from clients and employees but does little to implement suggestions made. Branch employees are not empowered or able to provide more than basic customer service activities (transactional & opening accounts). Systems are extremely difficult to navigate and back office support is terrible. Products and services cater exclusively to high-end clients, and provides no opportunity for financial wellness for others."
bad,Understaffed overworked underpaid six days a week rude customers but some nice.. training was OK but very cliquish and high school-ish at that branch small minded and  not what you would expect from an innovative big company - in this area not good
bad,"Look elsewhere, not a well-run company. Processes implemented do not even compare to other banks and competition. Input from experienced employees is not considered. Standard 2% raises regardless of profits or tax breaks. Healthcare is either pay a small mortgage per check or pay half a small mortgage per check and pray you never get hurt because it covers nothing."
bad,"When key bank took over First Niagara bank, there where things that was said would not change, though did changed drastically, to were many employees quit, or were fired for not following policies that were not completely exampled during the beginning of the take over. The hardest part of the job was receiving adequate aid from management when dealing with customers while searching for what to do in key bank's policies and procedures which made it more difficult within the work day. The most enjoyable part of this employment was leaving at the end of the work day."
bad,"The hardest part of the day is being micro manage, "
bad,Management was terrible.  No communication . Not a fun place to work anymore.  Very stressful and not busy to make goals. Customers not happy. Put 15 years in banking and keybank was the worst.
bad,This position was a new one and before I was brought on I don't feel that the position was thought out.
bad,"hmmm, dealing with and helping clients was very enjoyable. in 2019, goals were increased but associated bonus compensation was not increased. essentially, bankers were expected to work that much harder just to maintain their income. really stupid move on the part of management."
bad,I do not recommend. Training is poor. Expectations are high but offer few practical reasons for the expectations. Selling bank products is main priority. Strong arm customers into going into debt. You would think banks had learned after last economic catastrophe.
bad,All about numbers - not building relationships.  You have to upsell everyone even if they don't want it.  Personal Bankers are also required to do Teller Work at most branches because they don't have enough staff.
bad,"Would not recommend working at this financial institution. Product pushing with no regard to what the client actually needs or wants. Calls calls calls--how many calls can you fit into a day, how many products can you open for one client.. not client focused, institution focused."
bad,Key Bank has zero appreciation for their employees and pushes numbers too hard with their employees leaving a lot of room for unethical behavior in the sales force that management turns a blind eye to.
bad,"If you’rein Cleveland it may be a different story but if you’re in Buffalo as part of the First Niagara take over and you’re on the collections and mortgage side, you are the red headed stepchild.   Cleveland management will beat you and it’s their way or the highway.  They either fired or forced out some of the best managers in Buffalo.  First Niagara was a great place to work.  Things got accomplished and we were very customers service oriented from the top down.  That’s not the case at Key.  The people in the branches are nice but if you have an issue with your account, mortgage, credit card, etc, there are no quick resolutions and the customer is not always right."
bad,hours suck. no stability in days or hours. no overtime even if your forced to stay. slow paced. management was bad. no career advancement opportunities.
bad,"The company itselfis fantastic however the manager I worked under had a bone to pick with me because corperate hired me and not her directly. sadly, this lead to some serios issues later"
bad,"Each area has a unique culture, and some employees outside of Seattle proper seemed happy, but after 1 year I was considered one of the more senior bankers. Turnover is a reflection of poor communication. Management is under-qualified for leadership. Advancement was due to vacancies, and people were routinely delegated tasks to which they were not compensated nor had they been trained. Needlessly stressful, and client service reflected unhappy employees. Substandard products are difficult to sell, and management seemed unprepared to improve culture. Poor compliance, substandard training, limited staffing due to turnover."
bad,"Float teller in the metro area, training was a week in front of a screen while listening to transactions around you. Teller school was a mix of new people and seasoned tellers, bankers in a ""let's make believe we're in a bank"", then off to a branch to hopefully learn what it's really like.  You must get referrals, cheeks in the seat, but you have to talk to people who don't have the time, don't know you since you are bounced around weekly, angry that they have waited in line "
bad,"KeyBank was once a great place to work.  It valued employees in their specific rolls.All employees take on ALL roles now. Budget cuts are snowballing harder then ever before to little people in the branches. Bonus's are getting cut and replaced with ""appreciation points"" where you're able to purchase merchandise. Way to feel appreciated"
bad,"I worked at Key for 5 years and it got worse every year. They do not appreciate their employees. They only pay well if you come from another bank, they don't reward loyalty. They have unrealistic goals for certain branches and the method of motivation is micro managing. I would not suggest this company to anyone."
bad,Teller don't get paid enough work harder than some of the other fields
bad,"Working at Key Bank was unsettling. Every day I watched talented employees struggle to meet ridiculous demands! I worked there for 5 years with no raise.  With over 15 years in banking Key Bank hired people with less experience for more pay. In the end, l was completely disappointed. Leaving was the only thing left to do. I'm told by remaining employees that's it's gotten no better. Sad, really sad."
bad,"They train employees poorly. Systems are slow and old."
bad,"Key was one of the absolute worst places to work. Not only was my Branch Manager disrespectful to women, he and other men in the office were always crass openly about their feelings. I clearly remember them prioritizing “attractive “women over other clients, as well as coming to work reeking of alcohol. Some of us had to clock in on time- others could come and go at will and wrongfully sell products to clients . I never saw such a poor client service in my life. I will never recommend this bank and pulled every investment account I had there’s"
bad,If you want to work 6 days a week in a high stress environment with limited options for learning and poor management then this would be the place to go. Depends completely on the manager in the branch as to how the life is in the branch you work in.
bad,"Senior Management does not care about employees, clients are no longer clients they are numbers. You Made to work with very minimal staff but still produce results."
bad,"Managers manage upward. Don't care about staff or clients. Just need to impress bosses. Raise fees and provide less service to clients. Called FeeBank for a reason. Investment performance is bad. They fired most good employees over 50. They said they are too expensive because of healthcare. If you are getting older I suggest you leave before its too late. I was well ahead of my sales goals (180% YTD), whiles others that are still there have not met goal for a few years. They brown nosed management. Unfortunate. The bank could better serve both shareholders and clients/customers with new management."
bad,"Was contacted by a recruiter for a management position.  After 4 interviews started the onboarding process only to find out last minute that the position had been filled internally and I was being offered the internal candidates former job with the anticipation of being benched for future management opportunities in the area.  Was given barely any training and thrown into production almost immediately.  I never shadowed or observed a *single* transaction before being expected to handle all customer interactions. For comparison newly hired tellers were required to shadow for a week before being allowed to transact on their own, while I had accounts, lending and investments all under my purview and was expected to run teller transactions daily.   Other than a brief 15 minute overview on my first day I was given no direction on how I was compensated or what my production goals were until I had been in the role nearly 5 months.  Meanwhile, due to total lack of instruction I was also making numerous operational errors that were not made apparent to me until I was corrected for them. Despite being “benched” for future management opportunities, in the 17 months since my onboarding 2 of the 5 branches in the area have been closed, including the one I worked at. "
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the remote drive up.  Working by myself (the location was locked to any customers).  I had to close and re-open the remote branch by myself.  I had to wait on customers, balance and maintain the vault and ATM.  Since I was one of the only two tellers, when I closed the drive up, I had to leave the location and go to the main branch where I would relieve that main branch teller for lunch.  I would than take my lunch break (30 minutes) and than re-open the drive up (by myself).  I had to balance the ATM daily in between customers.  I had to balance the ATM within a certain time frame otherwise Key Bank would get a fine (I was told).  So if the drive up was busy, I did not have any help.  I did not have any support at the drive up concerning sales or general knowledge (FNFB was taken over by Key Bank).  Most of the time, the questions I had would go un-answered by my manager.  I am a very customer oriented person, This went against my customer service skills."
bad,"unfair practices and procedures"
bad,KeyBank is an employer that believes in their ethics. If the company does not think an industry is not ethical they will not do business with it. It kept the work day interesting.
bad,"Poor management. Very unprofessional, and uncomfortable for that matter. No hands on training, only computer training. Harsh communication. Inappropriate behavior from coworkers and was not put to a stop after consulting manager."
bad,"Terrible merger from prior company, seemed like every change made was to negatively effect clients & employees. Employees are interchangeable to them and they frequently receive feedback from clients that there is not enough staffing. It is Key's prerogative to keep staffing low, which strains branches and employees intensely. They also say that they are willing to take on risks with clients which is NOT the case. They are extremely conservative and have their own backsides to protect, not actually helping clients who have been loyal for 10, 20, 30+ years."
bad,"Initially KeyBank was a company that cared about clients. More recently the bank has striven to be sales over customer satisfaction. Constant hounding to have calls made, constant shifting between the teller line and the desk make this job extremely stressful and frustrating. Throw in upper management blaming you for branch goals not being met and you'll very quickly find yourself looking for another job. Although you're overtime eligible, you're constantly pressed to find ways to reduce your hours, whether it's coming in late or extending a lunch."
bad,Procedures are horrible. Management is good but resources provided to workers are bad. Constantly making errors and we have to clean up the pieces so constantly dealing with rightfully upset clients. Relocation to save company money but no compensation for workers. Hardest part of the job is that key bank drops the ball on everything. Most enjoyable would be co-workers everyone is like family.
bad,"Fast paced atmosphere, management spread to thin to assist employees in difficult situations with customers needs more people on floor to assist agents"
bad,"Read only if you have the time to listen. No one from KeyBank had time to listen to what happened to me at my local branch so I hope this review saves someone from the same disappointment that I experienced. When I interviewed for a full time teller position at Key, I knew I had done exceptionally well. The operations leader and her boss were the ones to interview me and they promised me a place where I could grow and do well. Needless to say, their promises were not honored on their part. The bank I was working at was so understaffed, I was given responsibilities that were not in my job description. After my first week, my manager made me wash the staffs dishes after work because I did not sell a credit card that week. With the job becoming increasingly stressful and my life at home falling apart, I became unable to stay focused on my job and was making mistakes I hadn't made since I was new. One day, I was notified half an hour before the bank closed that my sister had been trying to get ahold of me since 11 am. When my manager finally told me and I got to my phone (which the bank makes us put in an employee locker, policy that we not have our phones on us behind the teller line), I learned that there was not an emergency, but a recent tragedy and I needed to get home. When I finally composed myself, I went to the manager and was blown off because she was on a call. Luckily the Operations Leader was there... except not really because when I told her what had happened and broke down, her exact words were, ""I can't deal with this, have you talked to your manager?"", and, ""You"
bad,"I worked at Keybank in the payment processing center.  We earn incentive pay, and very early on I learned that several people on another shift were claiming credit for my work.  When I wouldn't stop bringing it to the attention of senior management, I was harrassed and then laid off."
bad,"Absolutely no support or team playing attitudes. Extremely stressful because your left to do all the work alone, then things go wrong and your told to own it. Worst job experience of all time. In my year we went through 4 Tellers 3 PB's and 1 Loan officer. And floats complained and refused to go to the Lewiston Branch."
bad,"I worked for Key Bank for about a year after they had bought the bank I was working at before, which I had been at for 8 years and had a perfect record.  The biggest thing I don't like is they are not customer friendly.  They don't care about if the customer is happy, only what you can sell them.  They push and push and threaten people's jobs if they don't have sales.  This led to some not so ethical behavior by some of the employees.  That is where I had decided to leave.  The management is also poor and after going to them with my concerns, I was told that the branch needed the money.  On top of that they is barely a staff and that seems to progressively be getting worse.  They do have good benefits for the most part.  I also enjoyed spending time with my coworkers but the job itself is not worth it."
bad,If your looking for a that can work around your life this is not the job for you. Also this job has shift bids and there could be a chance that you might not get the shift that you want and once the shift bid ends you're  stuck with the shift for the next six months
bad,Worked at keybank for a whole year and a  half. Was a good experience but decided I did not want to work in the field of banking. Loved working with people but I'd rather work in a office/ receptionist setting.
bad,"I remember working here while I was still young it was my first “real job”. I enjoyed what I did, I loved talking to different people and making new connections with the customers, however, the manager was very childish. The staff was older than me they treated me like I was a child had not respect for me and constantly put me down. I don’t like to play the race card but it’s reality sometimes. There was many comments made regarding race. Working for the branch I was in was awful.  The full time teller had  no  patients training me. The bankers never put me teller code so I wasn’t getting credit of  convincing people to open new accounts with us. Keybank should put more attention on creating a safe work  environment."
bad,Low staff levels are killing employee morale and customer service.  Bank managers in busy branches working teller lines shows how disconnected middle and upper management are from the branch needs.
bad,"This was the worst job I ever had. Management was so slanted and had their favorites. The culture is terrible and they only want certain types of people to advance. Actually, the job itself would have been fantastic had the culture been tolerable. Good pay but not worth the stress and angst. This is not sour grapes either. Just keeping it real."
bad,"Offices are grossly understaffed by design.  Very heavy handed sales culture.  It's the type of culture that got Wells Fargo in trouble.  If you can't sell, it's difficult to stay there.  A lot of telemarketing to force feed customers into buying products and services that aren't always in their best interest but instead, to fill a sales quota."
bad,"Would I ever recommend anyone to bank here or work here. Terrible management and lack of job advancement. They pride themselves on their employees however when a new position becomes available they would rather hire externally."
bad,I was wrongly discharged from Key Bank for a situation I had no control over. Upper management could not prove the truth. It has changed my life style but I will survive. I wish I could sue the Bank for wrongful termination but because if the dtyI live in its not possible.
bad,"its good if u don't have kids. the hours are all over the place. the manager was the sweets person. clients tend to be super rude, because you ask for id."
bad,Overall its great place to start in the financial world but don't expect to grow in the company. Because its a bank your hours are fixed so no overtime and no bonus pay either.
bad,This is the worst job I've ever had. The management is terrible. It's a good ol' boy mentality. They hire the flunkies from other institutions and it was embarrassing the turnover. Clients noticed the turnover as well. Terrible.
bad,"Poor management style. Management had their picks of what employees they liked and didnt. The employees they didnt like, management would always find something negative on them to get them terminated. Any questions you'd ask, they always made you feel stupid and looked down upon. To advance in your career you had to be kissing management's butt to get anywhere. I would not recommend working at Key bank. If you do currently work there i suggest finding a new job unless your ""that"" employee and kiss butt"
bad,"Management never took the time to know their employees. Their approach was that they were superior so as an employee you respect them with no questions asked. Respect in return was not anything given. "
bad,"Customers are very rude and management doesn’t care about staff. If your not family or dating someone u will not get attention or help needed. Pay is ok but could be better. "
bad,"if you love reports and not selling...this is the place to be. You sell the loan, process the loan and underwrite the loan. Terrible comp structure. You do reports all day long and meetings."
bad,"Treat customers badly. Treat employees badly. Always looking to charge customers more for no more service. No pay raises for years, but upper management went home with millions. Poor work/life balance."
bad,"It was a great experience in the sense it taught me things about myself like what I hated. I would never want to work at a bank again, its a soul sucking adventure designed to collect fees from people in byzantine ways."
bad,KeyBank is on a backslide in the working culture. There has been a mass exodus from the area from part-time tellers all the way up to branch managers because of the staffing model and lack of pay.
bad,"During my time at Key Bank it was horrible. My personal banker went to a different bank, my teller got fired, my manager went on leave. It was just me in the branch and constantly getting pressure from upper management to do better. I would put 50 hours a week to do everything and they never once said thank you for everything I did."
bad,Micromanaged. Pay is not competitive at all. Health insurance very expensive. Less than 2 weeks vacation. The atmosphere is very hostile. No recognition only constructive criticism. Does not pay for mileage or travel time when traveling to other locations unless it's over 30 miles and only what's over the 30 miles. Horrible training.
bad,Working at KeyBank has opened my eyes to how bad it can be. After the merger many employees left the bank and I really didn't understand why until I became more involved with our managers. The way they work and how unfair they are is very unprofessional and unethical. If you aren't in their in circle you can work and do as much as you can to benefit the company and department but they will always find something to hold over your head. The biggest reason I want to leave is due to how management has treated me and how they push their employees in the wrong direction. No one in my department is happy and that is 100% because our management team doesn't put forth the effort to understand processes or help improve them from employee feedback. This has been an ongoing struggle and as more people are leaving the tougher it has become on the few that remain.
bad,Instant burn out. Twice daily calls of shame. Could not keep up with cost of living. Upper Management bullied staff.
bad,I was hired to do an interim job to assist with work flow as they began to outsource the work to India.  I was brought in to fill in jobs for employees that left because they knew their jobs were going overseas.
bad,The best thing about this company is your coworkers. its a good place to work if you just want your bills paid. Management sucks. when i first started to work for key it i loved my job. Then things changed. The company changed. The grading of your calls is very harsh. And dont even think about having issues at home because they dont care about you. everyone is replaceable
bad,I believe there are some faults in leadership in my experience with the company which resulted in low morale and a less than enjoyable work environment.
bad,"Very busy, very stressful, Co-workers is nice. Management expect too much with no time to train. The pay s not enough for what is being done. There is no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Underwriting treated poorly, upper management unskilled. Promises made made were not kept. Double standards. Would not recommend working here to many issues within mortgage depts."
bad,"For the past two years (out of a total of 15 years) I have worked with the Corporate Medical / HR group which includes three nurses who are very knowledgable in all things medical, since they come from several different medical backgrounds from surgeries to geriatrics.  I am learning alot of new medical terms from our daily converstions that are not necessarily related to my Work Comp position, but the information is very valuable to me.  I certainly enjoy learning new medical terminology."
bad,"KeyBank can be a good place to work depending on who your manager is. The one I had was horrible and didnt want to see you suceed. The pay was horrible, I am a single mom and I barely made it on my income. After years of service I was still part time and could never advance to full time."
bad,The vacation time was good and generous.  I liked the generous vacation time.  Upper management ain’t treat ppl fairly.  I had to transfer and then was accused of stealing my regular customers who went faithfully to see me at my branch who closed.
bad,"Non existent training. Luckily had 11 years experience in banking so I was able to train myself. Still wasn’t sure what my daily tasks were day to day, week to week even when asking my OL on multiple occasions. The communication is absolutely horrible since there are SO MANY regional management layers. The working hours are six days a week because they will not hire any more help or are able to keep people there. They told me I would have a day off in the week if I worked a Saturday l. Barely happened. I would not recommend working st this bank."
bad,"I found the technology outdated and lacking.  The customer resource management tools were very outdated. The management was not focused on the people.  I witnessed a teller put in advanced notice (approx. 6 weeks).  She was fired a few leeks later.  There was a great lack of support from management.  Whenever I had a deal worked out, it was discouraged.  The medical benefits were so bad, I ended up using my Veterans Association medical benefits, and had to leave my wife without insurance.  It saved us money."
bad,"A typical is basic payments and processing in the IPG world. The growth rate is slow, with little upward movement. Many have been in the roles the are in for years. You will have to go far above and beyond to get noticed. "
bad,"Key Bank's team player environment was excellent. Management was not conducive to positive work environment. Co-workers were wonderful! Hardest part was fulfilling expected operational performance levels. Most enjoyable part of job was the customer service of Key Bank's branch offices, which I excelled at!"
bad,"Personal banker; loan originator; basic customer account review; opening of new accounts. A lot of duties, and very little support from management. Not understanding management of geographical location, and limited opportunities to try to grow business. Used scare tactics to try to increase production from employees."
bad,"I wasn't a very good banker, I didn't care for the sales quotas. I just wanted to work with the customers."
bad,"If you're a disabled veteran, or a disabled civilian, it won't matter to Keybank.  You have to function at their expectations, and they don't care about your health/physical limitations.  I thought I had something absolutely wonderful in terms of a career, and soon found out it turned out to be a nightmare in the making.  I'm glad that I don't work for them anymore, and never will again."
bad,"The bank laid off employee just before make changes that increased work volume causing a very heavy work load for remaining people.  instead of hiring more employees, they made overtime mandatory.  The communication within the departments is terrible and getting worse.  When issues are brought up to management they are ignored."
bad,"It’s a job. Overall, it is what you expect in the typical call center environment. There isn’t a lot of open communication through management to staff which results in blame shifting of why numbers are off. There’s a lot of stress on stats at the job so be ready to feel like you’re under a constant microscope. The job can be draining but the clients and calls are the least of the problem here. The management is faulty and goes back on decisions and tweaks major components of policies with little notice or explication. Be ready to make up reasons of why things aren’t working correctly in a way that sounds believable to customers because a majority of times you’ll be improvising reasons why something that should have gone completely correct, did not, and there’s no proof or record of any error. It is stressful to ty to take your time to resolve the client concerns to be then yelled at about how calls take too long and getting measured on that ."
bad,I was hoping for a career at key as there are a limited number of mortgage operations in the WNY area.  Due to poor management decisions forced layoffs
bad,This was by far the worst company I have ever worked for. There was little management support & miscommunication on compensation. The manager was verbally abusive & threatening in their management style.
bad,Most managers/leaders are insensitive and lack common courtesy. It feels like everything is a fire drill that's it's difficult to properly prioritize initiatives because everyone is running around with their hair on fire. Upper management preaches leadership but seem to do everything in their power to not practice leadership. Technology funding is severely absent resulting in unstable platforms and poor data.  Constant org changes and lay-offs make for an unstable environment and low morale.
bad,"Took care of clients banking needs via the telephone. Transferring funds, setting up auto pays, adjusting fees. Working in teams with the support of supportive leaders."
bad,"Dramatic change to a worse working environment and dynamic within the branches since FNFG purchase."
bad,"The work day required a lot of attention, and making sure all money was counted correctly. The management could use a refresher course on how to supervise."
bad,If you don't mind change this is the place for you. The managers are sometimes fair with letting you know what kind of changes are happening in the organization.
bad,"a lot of selling products needed.nice coworkers, pleasant and helpful.  clients are pleasant. busy work environment. need to have product knowledge to help clents with problems."
bad,"Assist with customer request and inquiries, poor management within certain branches. There is a disconnect between corporate and the people at the bottom of the company."
bad,"I have worked for Key for 4 years. I am in the retail banking side and in the past 4 years I have seen them from a customer service focused atmosphere to a higher sales demands then maintaining high customer service. No raises, compensation plan is horrible. Benefits are horrible...the only saving grace for a 3 star rating was the vacation time. I would not recommend this as a bank to work with since they do not look to their inside staff for advancement, no raises, low work-life balance."
bad,I gave my two week notice because I want to find a job closer to my home. And have better pay for my expereince. I am a great people person. I am a team player and a dependable person looking to grow with a company.
bad,"Key Bank, places unqualified individuals in Branch Management and Executive Management positions. This causes a trickle down effect of incompetency and an unhealthy work environment. Poor and unqualified managers with extreme egos end up forcing good quality employees out the door. Producing high turnover time and time again. Sadly KeyBank executive management ignores this back to me"
bad,management was difficult.  the style was my way or highway. very hard for them to listen & be present when presenting another view point.  Offered good vacation time
bad,It is a job for those that like sales and can handle high levels of stress. I would not recommend it for anyone otherwise.  It's not for everyone.  Just saying.
bad,"KeyBank gives with one hand, while simultaneously takes back with the other, so it’s increasingly difficult to keep one’s head above water. Also management’s(low level) style could be described as passive-aggressive intimidation, with a dash of bullying thrown in for good measure. I’m assuming this is an executive-management approved strategy, or it would not exist. Also giving low-level management this role to play, keeps our executives looking “perfect” shiny and new to the majority of employees."
bad,"1. No cost of living increases."
bad,"The systems & programs were difficult to navigate and cumbersome. Policies and procedures were complicated and not in the best interest of our clients or staff."
bad,"Great job opportunities, great pay, great location but poor management. Management was inexperienced, did not care about employees just getting work done!"
bad,"Unfortunately this company is about who you know and if your ""in the click"". If you don't find your way ""in"", you will never make it here. Management has been together here for many years without change and no matter what your production level, if they do not like you personally or feel you are a threat to their social game, you will not succeed."
bad,Dealing with customers is always difficult and the management teams did not help in easing the burden of endless calls from unsatisfied clients. Sad that customer service is a dying art
bad,"Upper management not aware of how difficult it is to reach sales goals, horrible onboarding process, awful training. Area Leadership motivates by intimidation."
bad,"Key runs staffing at the bare minimum. There is no support from your leader UNLESS you are one of his ""CHUMS"". They have gone through 6-7 managers in 10 years which speaks volumes!"
bad,"I feel that this would be a great job for someone starting out, or a college student. They have great hours and friendly management. On the downside, the pay is not competitive, and being such a large company they have an extremely high turnover rate."
bad,You have five sale goals to fill that are extremely high to reach. You have people in charge of the goals and are constantly micromanaging about what you are doing to reach the goals. With being understaffed at most locations there would be some days it will become busy and you couldn't do your initial job because you would have to do teller work for a few hours and couldn't get anything for your goals. When times are slow it consist of a lot of cold calling; around 5hrs a day would just consist of cold calling. Training is not to helpful especially if you're new to the role. You start off your first two weeks at the branch and if your manager is busy they expect you to start learning and help the customers with no training yet and you'll be expected to have done everything right.
bad,"A fast paced environment, difficult systems, minimal training provided, not a strong sense of teamwork, participated in a very difficult merger. Extremely short staffed, so it is difficult for a Branch Manager to go out and cultivate new business."
bad,"If you live far away from the location, it's not a good place to work. I mean the people that work there aren't the more intelligent. I spent 30 minutes trying to teach a branch manager how to turn on the desktop in his office. The job is stressful enough without having to add traffic into the mix, and when you live over 50 miles away, they won't give you precedence over hours."
bad,"I absolutely enjoy coming to work at Key Bank just to work and see my co-workers and to help and assist our customers. I have learned a lot about banking here at Key. I don't think there is anything hard about the job  that I do because I enjoy doing it. If I had to say one negative thing about working here at Key, it is definitely Management."
bad,"I worked as a floating teller for Keybank for fourteen months. This gave me the opportunity to experience many different Keybank branches, and while I'd have to say that the majority of my coworkers were wonderful, just about everything else about this job was awful."
bad,"This is a sales job, and don't forget it.  Once you hit your sales goals, the goals are raised.  And you better hit the new ones.  Advancement opportunities are dangled in front of you, yet completely dependent on your sales."
bad,things were always changing. I was their for 2 years and they went thru so many changes. big turn over rate too.
bad,"From the year of being employed with Key Bank, what I have learned is that not all employers do not put their best interest at heart! Their doors are so revolving that you can't predict if your position is secure. It's good to work their until an offer is better presented to you but don't expect longevity."
bad,They tell you to do one thing then say no do it another to the point you are ready to just go to another company. They used to offer free pizza days for moral boosters but now they charge.
bad,Worked with nice people.  The business model and goals were not realistic or attainable.  Management knows that but refuses to admit or accept. The stress was too high for my role and pay grade.
bad,"this was a nice place to work,  I did have to travel some for hours, which I wasnt aware of at time of hire.  Branches I worked in were very slow paced."
bad,Low salaries for 1st line employees. No local advancement opportunities. Too much emphasis on sales and profits regardless of what position held. Cut-throat.
bad,"I was with FNFG when Key took over, and we lost (not even joking) close to 85% of our clients to the turnover. Back office is terribly trained, Operations Leader thinks she’s better than everyone and doesn’t help when you need it, they say sales goals aren’t enforced but write you up if you’re not making enough? What the heck?! The only good thing about Key was the PTO (15 days when you first start for FTE and your hourly work week multiplied by 3) AND the staff at the branch who have been around since FNFG and who are struggling with you but you’re in it together. There’s even a branch manager in my region who literally doesn’t do any banking related thing because he chooses not to, and it still has yet to be addressed! I’m looking to advance my career in another field because Key turned me off to the world of banking. Key has so much potential but the big wigs in the big building won’t change a thing if that means they get a pay cut. It’s a shame. I wouldn’t recommend working for this company to anyone."
bad,"The audit teams do not work together very well.  They do provide opportunities with other teams but it is limited to those deemed 'favorites'.  The environment is difficult and even though there are guidelines for flexibility, it just depends on the manager."
bad,"My working environment was less than ideal. Management was contradictory  and inconsistent. Management style was Micro vs Macro. Depts seemed to be ""silo'd"" in nature which made it very difficult to advocate for my clients."
bad,work with a machine all day. Sorting checks and paperwork for clients and scanning them. The job gets busy quarterly as a lot of client file taxes and data entry.
bad,"Company sets high sales goals but then places barricades to achieving them.  Local managers are highly skilled and want to help with success, but corporate bank ties their hands and they really have no power."
bad,Company acquired loan servicing from ORIX and kept team together. Basically just to get their policies and procedures and then closed down the Dallas office. Never felt wanted.
bad,Poor work culture. Not incentives or motivation. I almost felt like Key Bank was a white collar prison. Employees including management did the minimal to keep jobs because of a salery/hourly salary based approach.
bad,A typical day at work is never consistent. Training is horrible and they do not train you on everything you need to know before you start and you get in trouble if you do it wrong or not at all whether you like it or not. Some of the leaders should not be leaders and do not hold leadership qualities. DO NOT WORK HERE.
bad,"Unrealistic goals, with no support and no staff.   It seemed that upper management did not care about the clients and more importantly their employees.   Lots of confusion on how back office worked.  Management seems that they would rather terminate people than help them.   Smile in your face and stab you in the back type of environment.  Absolutely miserable for most in my area."
bad,"I loved the work my co-workers and the environment. However, management is clueless and will throw anyone under the bus to avoid responsibility for problems. You are not a person, just a number."
bad,"This was my first experience with computers,phones, and office routines. I enjoyed it but it did not pay well at all.................................."
bad,This is the worst Bank to work for 
bad,"Nice coworkers but lots of slow paperwork. From my experience in the company it seems difficult for employees to move up the corporate ladder, only lateral moves within the company were possible for most people."
bad,"I was a float teller with Key for almost a year. When you first start there they tell you all about the great benefits they offer. And at first it's a great job. It pays well to start off with but then things go downward from there.  They start to push sales goals and they push them extremely hard. And as a float teller I didn't have all the resources and know all the clients to get the referrals. Nor did I really want too. It was a stressful job and brain killingly slow. I shopped online daily. I planned out all my bills in my planner for MONTHS. I worked under the operations leader for my manager and both of them were great. My manager ended up leaving to have a baby but her co worker who took over was wonderful. When I asked for advancement they told me they would do everything they could to make sure I could advance but when the time came they passed me up. The area I worked in was so understaffed. We had about 20 people leave all around the same time. Most left willingly, other fired. A former and now current again co worker was actually paid to leave. She was told to go quietly and they would pay her 2 weeks. Its just stressful to work there. I left myself for a credit union and while at first I didn't like it, I didn't give myself enough time. I now love my job at my credit union and wouldn't go back to Key again. If you're looking for a banking job go for a credit union. They are happier and all around a better place to work."
bad,"was ""trained"" by someone that didn't know how to do my job so didn't get in the correct training which led to a lot of stress.    told manager that I wasn't trained right and was told I was wrong"
bad,"Inbound financial calls, performing account transfers resolve issues respond to client needs uncover and explore opportunities to sell additional products and service. "
bad,"A typical day starts at 8 a.m. and ends at 4 p.m. Banking in general has a LOT of laws and regulations that need to be known and adhered to at all times. One of my managers was strict but fair, pressure was there but realistic. Upper management was no as fair and lots more pressure. Hardest part of the job was remembering all the regulations and how they intertwined with each aspect of banking. Most enjoyable part was helping customers who appreciated your help and going home."
bad,Key Bank has too many various promotions that overlap.  This makes it difficult to achieve success as there isn't a concentrated focus on only one or two key areas.
bad,Phone calls from clients and I leave that it very place that when people are product of their environment. Grateful I learned the behind the scene about banking and management.
bad,Meetings and organizing a project. Learned their applications. Management was great. Culture was awesome. Hardest part- my GUI person kept changing the system without myself and management approvals. She was an idiot straight out of college and did not understand if management wants something they don't want to be asked about it again. Best part of the job- met a ton of new colleagues I can call friends!
bad,"Very poor management. Referral goals are ridiculous you are basically forced to sell people on stuff they do not need. Pay is not great for what you have to put up with. Management is helpful, and they all rally against you if they do not like you."
bad,"prove your morning draw, customer service, withdrawals, deposits. learned customer service, teller marketing, management was ok, staying in one place for eight hours."
bad,"this was a just a temp job, I didn't work there for very long and don't have anything to say about a company I worked for over 10+ years ago.  thanks for the chance"
bad,offered limited products and pushed to sell - rather than customer service driven environment. Felt like a cold environment.  good employment if you are analytical and don't mind pushing products that are not needed by the customer
bad,Very few advancement opportunities with harsh and unfriendly management.
bad,"Here, I spent eight hours a day continually answering phones from agitated customers who had overdrafts and bounced checks. I solved their issues, with the resources provided, and then tried to cross-sell other items to meet a monthly sales goal. Every minute was managed and there was no autonomy."
bad,"Not a great company, bad senior management and the company does not care about employees. I was a top producer and still did not get treated the way other banks have done in the past."
bad,Was a nice place to work and manger was very flexible.  Enjoyed working with the customers.
bad,to many chiefs and indians alway making things very difficult for the employees
bad,"Managers are okay, very numbers oriented, care little for you if you don't hit numbers. Just had one of them tell a group of us that they could replace us in a heartbeat if we decided to quit."
bad,"the company itself had a wonderful culture and the CEO has the best view on how we should be working as a team. When the ""big bosses"" visited the branch, the branch ran as it should and everything was consistent. As soon as they left their visit, the Manager didn't care, the Lead Teller would disappear for more than half of the work day, the Manager and the Platform would take lunches together leaving no one to help clients when they wanted to open an account or get special services done. "
bad,"I can't say as It is a friendly and comfortable work environment. The Team Leads are generally pretty decent but their hands are tied as are yours In flexibility In assisting customers."
bad,"very stressful sales environment-sales goal that are unrealistic and impossible to achieve. management is never happy with sales sucess always looking for more, only as good as your last sale"
bad,Branches are pressured to aggressively push bank products to customers.
bad,"As a Relationship Manager you must understand that your are required to meet your sales goals, deal with client needs, teller transactions, etc.  The type of sales include personal loans, mortgage , small business,  Investments,deposits, credit cards.  To name a few.  Every time you seat with a client you must, I mean must fill out a Financial Wellness guide and document information from each client.  Lastly you are expected to make at least 12 outbound calls per day and set 15 per set appointment per week. Fun right."
bad,"Managers don't care about you only number"
bad,"While overall not a bad company, they have a tendency to churn and burn entry level analysts. Little focus is given to training which can make it hard to reach the lofty ""goals"" they assign. Goals are same for entry level analysts all the way to senior lead analysts. If you have experience, you'll fit in fine and be able to contribute but it is not the place to start out. Most entry level analysts leave within 18 months due to being burned out or being left in the corner when they couldn't master something on the first try."
bad,"Working here was fun because of the coworkers and it was a pretty easy schedule but there was no promising rewards or incentives for your hard work. You could give the best customer service and exceed your duties everyday ( as I do I ) but see no rewards or growth for the work you do everyday. Management seems to be there for you in the beginning but you quickly see that they will throw you under the bus and not care about your feelings very quickly. It was an OK wage but not for all they expect of you, and even when you exceeded those expectations there was no recognition or surprise by it."
bad,very strong emphasis on sales goals-   little or no emphasis on customer care -more focus on customer sales     good communication from upper management
bad,"During my employment at KeyBank, there was little to no support on a daily basis.  After you get hired you go through a lot of online training, you spend a few days in a teller class then a few in a banker class. Most of the material covered is surrounded around taking applications and counting money. After that you are thrown to the sharks and I hope you can swim!  There is zero tolerance for any mistakes. In short, no one teaches you, and you are to blame if you mess up. Do not recommend this job to anyone, except if you are desperate, but don't plan to stay long! (Research turnover rate.)"
bad,Key Bank doesn't care about it's employees and branch managers. If you get too old your gone or if you use their medical benefits too much. This bank should stay in Cleveland and out of New York.  Products and services are way behind the times. The company thinks that the Hudson Valley in New York is a terrible market and won't invest or advertise in the Hudson Valley.
bad,Most boring job I have ever had. I enjoyed my role as Teller.  It simply was not busy enough.  The Customer Service Representative was helpful.
bad,"Typical day is a normal office cube job- "
bad,The job was great and working with the people was fantastic.  Did not think that allowing Lead Teller a lot of jurisdiction was favorable
bad,"An average day for Key Bank for a float Teller: assisting clients as well as performing maintenance on accounts. The hardest park of my position is making clients feel that I know how to assist them.  This is due to my floating status many clients believe I am a new employee.  Once the clients trust me I am able to help them, and that is the most rewarding part of my position.  At the end of the day the drawer is balanced again."
bad,Opening window to prepare for daily transactions. Management was not good. Not all co-workers easy to get along with. The hardest part of job was meeting referral goals. The most enjoyable part was the customers.
bad,Not my favorite place of employment. Management isn't very good.
bad,Systems are behind the times. Training was a joke. Liked working with co-workers
bad,"It's retail. There's no room for advancement if you don't have anyone in your corner. There's a huge divide between client-facing colleagues and back-office representatives. "
bad,Company has a strict performance management culture. Has been moving Buffalo jobs to Cleveland over the years or eliminating them altogether. Security should be a concern.
bad,"Pros: "
bad,Management is just awful. They solely care about themselves. They can call off or adjust their schedule to fit their needs but you’re not allowed to do the same to yours. The clients are wonderful but the pace is rather slow compared to other banks. They’re closing banks left and right.
bad,"Stress full environment where the transition of ownership,after 1 and a half years, is still in flux. Could not recommend employment with this organization"
bad,"i don't wanna give a review, because i thin k it should be completely voluntary opportunity to give or not to give a review, you enforce applicant to do it"
bad,It’s ok if you need the money. Just cover your ASSets. You should be fine. There’s high turn over. Hard to get promoted. Too many huddle meetings and conference calls. Like many banks they hire one person to do several jobs so expect that.
bad,Although a good place to train; compensation and treatment were below par. Never met our CEO in 17 yeas. Upper management was very uncertain and put on an act in front of you. Would never go back to work there
bad,i have seen keybank go from a local community bank that cared about the employees to a big bank the no longer care about employees. with this said I did enjoy my coworkers over my years of employment.
bad,"When I started working at KeyBank it was the greatest place to work.  There was adequate coverage and sales goals where attainable.  After 5 consecutive years of change each year, which to me is a lot for a corporation of Keybank's size, I couldn't keep up with the understaffing and expectations that were required.  Upper management was notified of circumstances but yet nothing was done.  Working conditions were stressful and every day you wondered if it would be your last.  "
bad,"More red tape than anywhere I have ever worked before.  Very little common sense as policy was set in stone even though it created work in triplicate.  Manager was rude, unable to assist in resolving any issue, etc.  Work load grew exponentially while promised assistance never occurred."
bad,KeyBank Mortgage uses an outside third party processing company making them really nothing more than a broker.
bad,"Pros: Exstensive paid training, benifits, pay."
bad,Very difficult to manage your own time with all the meetings and ever changing priorities.  Managers are constantly at meetings and focus is on things to just get numbers made rather than a true focus on what produces what matters.
bad,"I enjoyed working from home remotely on a permanent basis however that changed.  KeyBank acquired First Niagara Bank and rolled out a new system, procedures and products and did not thoroughly review all possible issues that could have occurred along with limited training for all."
bad,"Great place to work if you are young. I started working for this company in 1985 at the age of 20, moved up the latter quickly. By the age of 35 my progress slowed and now at 52 I am stuck in a position and can't get out."
bad,Key Bank is limited with staff so when you have high goals they are nearly impossible to meet. At one point I was hitting 9 of the 10 goals and was threatened that I was going to lose my job because I was not hitting the 10th goal. I also had managers tell me I would not advance because I was too fat. When I addressed these issues with HR it was ignored.
bad,"A day at work at Keybank consists of meeting the needs of clients that come in on a daily basis. Being in a sales role I constantly have to be profiling clients for other opportunities. I have learned how to work with clients to help them with whatever banking needs they may have. This role has helped me to grow professionally and build upon my current skill set. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with some many people on a daily basis. My personality is conducive to a position where I get to work with people. Although it can sometimes be difficult to deal with irate clients when an issue arises with one of their clients, I pride myself on being able to reach a reasonable solution and leaving the client satisfied that they have a trusted adviser."
bad,A typical day at work includes long hours on a computer. I have learned a lot though about the banking industry and especially markets and how an opinion can affect others.
bad,"Had to keep track yourself because too many departments, too many people trying to do one thing. customers requests always got lost in the system, but problems always came back to you, but I wasn't even in charge of keeping track, I wasn't an interdepartmental manager. At the time, they were not ready to throw money at it to fix things, felt thrown under bus, made me physically sick, mouse infested building, I left for a non sit down job with less hours."
bad,"Working day was filled with phone calls, being on the teller side from time to time, and just getting people into the branch as banking isn't what it was 5-10 years ago."
bad,"Typical day at work was handling cash transactions, and interacting with the clients, which was not bad. But the goals you had to meet each month was crazy."
bad,"I liked to build customer relationships, and be their trusted advisor. Gaining the customers trust was important to me, so that they  would come to me for their financial needs. Providing an excellent experience, so that they would refer my services to their family and friends."
bad,"poor management, little advancement opportunity. Internal advancement comes with low salary increase compared to outside new hires."
bad,"Focus on clients, answer phone, and look for opportunities to upgrade clients accounts."
bad,"Job cuts were a daily practice. You never knew if today was the day you would be let go.  Management always targeted the employees with the most seniority first. It didn't matter if you were an employee that historically received a high mark on your yearly review or won various awards as a result of your hard work and delivery on your work commitments.  The work load was more than a person could get done in a 40-hour work week. This meant you had to work more hours and were never compensated monetarily for your extra time. Some of the managers had no people skills and I have been thrown under the bus more times than I can remember.  From my experience, I would say that Management can Talk the Talk but they could not Walk the Walk.  Reorgs happened frequently and in the 20 plus years I worked there I had a total of 27 different managers. Some of these managers were very difficult to work with and rarely welcomed suggestions for process improvements from the employees. And in the rare times that they did it amazed me that they got the upper management accolades as they proposed they employees’ suggestions as their own. I could go on but I think you get the picture."
bad,"Training should be way more detailed considering you work with thousands of customers a day. Every call will be something different. Management doesnt seem to care about the employees as much as they do to as per the clients. Which shouldn't be the case if you want people to care about their jobs and be movatived to help the client, then u need to show that you care and put time and effort to be there for your employees also. They rather put the blame on you then actually listen to your needs as a employee"
bad,"I enjoyed working here.  At the time my management team was very good.  I supervised 6 tellers, proved out cash draws and vault on a daily basis.  i liked assisting my customers"
bad,"bad, banking hours-9-5:30, working Saturdays, pay isn't good, not good culture.. Not good at promoting work/family balance. I wouldn't recommend this place"
bad,"Offers great benefits but could offer more training to employees to improve performance. Especially, those that would like to explore other opportunities within the bank."
bad,"It was an interesting 5 years and I did learn a lot. I felt overlooked at a dedicated good employee. I put my heart and soul my job, and received very little encouragement or compensation no matter how much how much progress was made or how I committed myself to my job to go above and beyond. As long as an employee does mediocre job and their metrics and numbers are meeting the satisfactory requirement, the management will be OK with that. Even when you bend over backwards to help a customer or go out of your way, there is no recognition, no encouragement or uplifting compliments. There is only a fake appreciation and raises for those employees who meet there over the top requirements, but those who contribute to good moral and work ethic and have a true passion for their jobs are just a number to them. I was tired of being a number, the job was not enjoyable for me at a certain point."
bad,"I was really hopeful about my career with Key Bank, but unfortunately I walked away from the job because I was so unhappy. It is a disorganized company, with many inconsistencies in processes and customer service, the training was subpar, and there was a ton of turnover. I would not recommend this workplace."
bad,nice to place to work at learned so many things its a very good company for a beginner who wants to have their way to be a business analyst
bad,"Years ago, this was a great job. These days, with technology advancements, they are eliminating positons and run on a bare bones crew. Most people don't even know what their job title is because it changes due to restructuring (layoffs and renaming old positions) every year. Pay is not competitive. Coworkers are good for the most part. Management and those who generate policies have no clue what is actually going on.  Vacation time/schedule flexibility is decent i suppose."
bad,Really enjoyed the diversity of the job. Worked close with the Telecommunication department.
bad,It was an inbound call center you helped people who were locked out of online banking.
bad,"KeyBank was a great company to work for.  They were big on team building and company goals.  It was a intense job with great rewards.  In the position I held, I worked with many people from all over the US, and was required to have great people skills.  Sometimes the only way for us to communicate was via email and phone conversations.  I had close relationships with all my co-workers and we were all focused at completing the projects at hand within budget and time restraints.  It was a fast paced company but very self rewarding.  The hardest part of the job was distance barriers.  With communications being sometimes restrained to conference calls and emails only it was important that communication was clearly stated with project details, analysis, and barriers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to take vacation time and the people I interacted with on a daily basis.  As a Manager, I learned how to break down production barriers, I learned to cut costs, and project deadlines within each project.  I learned that when working with so many people there were bound to be issues, and I learned how to deal with those issues.  I also learned how to deal with a wide range of personalities and upper management."
good,But don't  lose your job to outsourcing while they keep people who been there 2 weeks and move them to another position in the bank . Management wants so much for so little and if you don't  kiss their butts and play suck up you'll be gone. Oh and they love to have snitches who keep an eye out for them on their days off  offf
good,My branch manager and leader teller were horrible. My lead teller was a  hoarder and everything was disorganized. Definitely made it hard. My branch manager was always bringing me down. I loved my clients and that’s the best I part other than that wouldn’t recommend.
good,"Depending on who you are Key is a great fit. However, the majority of their employees would disagree. The compensation and benefits package is horrible and below industry standards."
good,"calls are back to back with little breathe time"
good,"Processed image files from federal reserve , ATM deposits, checks, Loan payments for branch scanning. Balanced transactions and reports  and overall balancing at the end of each day."
good,"They do value their employees, however the expectations they expect their employees to hit are astronomical and sometimes prevents a positive attitude to be taken to work. Their management style is stuck in the Stone ages because it's filled with people who have been there far past their prime"
good,"The employees are put in a position to have more control than managers. Managers are expected to personally produce as well as lead a team in a micromanaged fashion. The company will always put the blame on the manager, and has a lack of loyalty."
good,"Worked in three different departments. In each department, management was not interested in training or professional development and lacked emotional intelligence. There was an instance where an employee refused to train me because she said she didn't have time. No one in leadership challenged her to do her job (which includes training). When I spoke to the head of the department, the reply was, ""that's just her attitude."""
good,"While upper management seems fair and consistent, their policy of promoting young agents to high positions naturally causes conflict. You can't expect a 22 year old with no family to understand the problems and complexities of someone with kids. This results in a lack of understanding on their part which naturally leads to disagreements and contention."
good,"It was an o.k job did not like third  shift lots of call offs and the workload got passed on to other employees, it was production so longer you were there your numbers went down"
good,"Proactive leader obtaining business acquisition, sales and service, contacted new and existing clients.  Responsible for acquiring new personal and business clients. Expanded relationships with existing clients though Business to Business, Business to Customer, Center of Influence relationships, and generating referrals."
good,"At Key, a typical work day consists of providing clients with everyday banking and financial needs! Being completely foreign to the lifestyle of a newly trained banking specialist, I've learned more about pushing my own personal limits in situations I never thought I'd find myself at the center of! The supervisors and team leads are for the most part, on hand if and when you may require their assistance but for the most part, you are trained so as to be well off on your own without the assistance of others, which is a little scary if your not used to it! The workplace environment in and of itself is very relaxing and very independent! You have your own desk and workspace to create the best environment for you! The most difficult aspect of this particular position in my personal experience is learning how to remain calm when de-escalating difficult calls and yet the most enjoyable part of it all, was coming to a resolution to satisfy both the client's needs, as well as the pure inner satisfaction about being able to turn someone's day around :)"
good,"Assisited both Business and Consumer client with all aspects of banking. Went of Business calls to any/all clients in need of assistance. Usually, no breaks due to staffing issues. After business hours, attended many functions on behalf of Key Bank. Work week paid for = 40 hrs. Actual hours worked including Saturdays, late nights, events after hours and on days off=60-70 hrs."
good,The corporate communications are not fully supported by local leadership. Change management and communications by local leadership are inadequate. Corporate provides work-life balance not supported by local leadership. Corporate polices not consistently applied by local leadership.
good,"Daily interactions assisting clients with all their banking/financial needs."
good,Work place culture is okay but could be better. For the most part people are friendly and cooperative. Management could be better at leading instead of managing.
good,Outsourcing and downsizing are the status quo. Not much respect for or investment in their employees. Employees simply become a point on the profit margin.
good,"These guys will work you to your grave (literally with a handful of folks I knew). Management by consensus and fear based. Not all groups are this way, but many are."
good,"when I started working it was easy, only there when I was asked. The longer I worked there the more they expected to go above and beyond my pay grade. The money I was making was not worth the overall stress of the job."
good,"Very unorganized, childish, unrealistic goals, poor communications, favoritism, strong office politics, poor employee/employer committment, poor pay wages."
good,"Long work hours without reflective pay. Tough place to move up within your department. However, not a terrible place to work, always busy in a fast but stressful environment."
good,"As a banker in Keybank you have a-lot more responsibility and play more roles than most other banker positions in the industry. You are responsible for all of your own loan, submissions, communications with underwriting on outdated programs and systems, while also at times being required to cover your own teller window, in addition to most standard banker responsibilities."
good,"Its a very stressful workplace in my opinion and you can only advance so far and then you plateau as far as moving up the chain, and to be quite honest it really isnt worth the pay you recieve and it feels like the management doesnt really care if you have emergencies and you have to leave cause it still counts against you and they micro manage quite a bit."
good,"Overall, Key was a good company to work for. I still have connections /relationships there. I would likely still be working there if my job had not been eliminated."
good,Great Job - great people - free parking - comfortable work place.  Very diversified
good,"There seem to be lots of room for advancement, but with all the staff cuts many jobs are going unfilled."
good,Collected past due automobile payments using a dialer system.  Skip traced and issued vehicles out for repossession
good,•a typical day at work
good,"A typical day at work consist of making numerous outbound calls to customers and prospects alike, in order to have a set schedule appointment that will perhaps enable me to profile and review existing products and services they may currently have or don't have with Key Bank. Thus far, I have learned establishing trust with customers is extremely crucial in cross selling the many different products and services. The management styles are fairly different, and just like any other places you must learn to adapt. The hardest part of my job is getting customer to remain committed once they have scheduled an appointment. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customer."
good,Got to be a people person...treat others like you would like to be treated. Try to remember their name....be happy to see them....acknowledging their birthday...etc...
good,Very rude management and positions move around all the time.  They don't care about they're employees and move them to different branches any time they please.
good,Clients are rude and don't ever want your financial help. Upper management only cares about numbers - No matter how hard you work or how many times you prove yourself it is never good enough! Full time with KeyBank is hard to come by as they are trying to phase out tellers - I was an employee for 2 years and was never given full time no matter how many times I applied.
good,"Good place to work if there was more support from up higher. Working without a manager and the higher ups do not want to put someone in charge officially, even on a temporary basis. That leaves too much room for individuals to be more concerned with themselves rather than the clients."
good,Key was an ok job. Wasn't anything special. The lowest people got the worst treatment. There was so much inconsistence information and treatment between branches really makes your job hard.
good,"Absolutely no consistency with the company. I loved my job when I first started as a float, but once I became a lead it went downhill. No one is on the same page as far as operations. Management seems to be lacking follow though. Managers are either stuck in their ways or trying to be a young success story with a huge lack in communication and  care for wellbeing of employees. It wouldn’t be so bad if there was some consistency but sadly there isn’t. Training is minimal at best but is basically non existent."
good,"A lot of great people at Key, unfortunately there are some terrible people at Key as well, and if you are not aware the terrible people can destroy your enjoyment of the opportunity."
good,"This may be exclusive to the location I am currently working. However, I've never worked anywhere that treats their employees so poorly with the expectation that the company will come before family."
good,"When I originally got hired there was a good work environment.  The entire building felt like a team.  My department management was great as well as the management for the site.  As time past the mood of the group slowing turned monotonous.  A lot of lay offs and department outsourcing followed by a site move.  Eventually leaving only a small handful of employees.  Atmosphere turned into a site against sister site, resulting in site closure.  "
good,"I worked for 14 years with the Corp Management & Insurance Group and I felt that my Manager at that time did not work with me to help me exceed in my workers' compensation claim adjusting work style.  He did not take into consideration my ability to grow in this position.  Luckily I was transferred to the HR department for my final two years."
good,"Not a bad company to work for overall, however I think it depends on which location you are employed. The people were typically great, however there was a lot of disorganization."
good,"I really can't complain about this job. Key is a good company to work for as long as you have a good manager. Most branches however are very slow and you will be making a lot of out bound calls to make your goals in most cases. Key systems are not the most up to date either which can be very frustrating. However, Key does offer good pay and for the most part a good work enviroment."
good,Things may have changed since I worked for KeyBank. The management was not very understanding when it came to my disabilities. It was more about fast and up sale not fast and accurate assistance with up sales. I found it more stressful than enjoyable environment as well.
good,Corporate pushes a different agenda daily and rarely follows through with much.  Good pay compared to other banks. Can be a good place to work if you have a solid manager and co-workers.
good,Make expectations more feasable and attainable. Need to make goals more attainable and fully look at the entire professional background of the employees.
good,Pretty challenging work environment. Continuously changing. I had a good team that helped each other out and continued to succeed. Management was questionable. I had quite a few day to day tasks and it usually kept me on my feet which I enjoyed. One part I like about the job was building client relationships and the satisfaction of being able to help them out day to day. The hardest part of the job would probably be learning the meticulous habit of counting money and keeping everything in balance throughout the day.
good,Managed and grow the branch production to achieve set goals.
good,Productive work days but lack career  advancement and development
good,"Employees are miserable to work with, underpaid, understaffed. No advancement. Union company and all the union does is keep employee pay down."
good,"A typical day involves treating the bank as if it was your own franchise but lacking the ability to fully control what is asked of you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with arbitrary goals set by Cleveland with out being able to tailor them to your individual area and market place. "
good,Bad pay and management with no vision. The healthcare is a joke. I can only say it is a job....not a career.
good,You will develope great relationships with your clients and co-workers. Management will demean and disrespect you in private and in public. HR will do nothing. One regional manager has been there for about 20 years and how there has not been a law suit is amazing.
good,Key Bank is very customer focused and tried to look out for the clients best interests. Co-workers were nice and easy to get along with.
good,"Good learning experience, but no way for advancement and you were stuck at a determined pay, no raises."
good,"Compensation was fair, but certainly not at the top of the banking industry. Original direct management was good, less so later. Talked client relationships, but never ""walked the walk"". One needed to always be politically correct."
good,"Stop pushing tellers to sell products , personal bankers can do that, if clients aren’t interested in products and you can’t get them to the personal banker to take the products, it comes down on you.  Not fair. If clients don’t want, they don’t want, can’t force products and services in them"
good,The monthly service requirements were tough in the location I was in but I did enjoy getting to know the clients and being able to help them with their finances.
good,January through June involve managing very long hours dedicated to compiling data and preparing trust and individual income tax returns.  June through December time is utilized in maintaining records and data throughout the year in preparation for the upcoming tax season.
good,In my time at Key I have not had a manager that was willing to take time to help grow me or my skill but rather would talk down on what I couldn't do.
good,Well I was thinking to get  more hours it's majority 16 hours out of 2 weeks some times it's 24 hours  you get paid every 2 weeks and it went from morning shift to 11 to 7 at night hard to juggle with kids
good,Key Bank expects all lines of business to refer to other partners. Expects Mortgage Lenders to be in branch every day versus out developing relationships with Agents
good,"My training at Key was minimal, they use so many different systems in order to complete one task and they do not even train you on the most important one because they say they are getting rid of it. I was there 2 years and had to learn that particular system on my own. "
good,"Good company overall however the environment is changing which causes poor employee morale and engagement.  Recent expense freeze however the company gave millions to the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.  Color printers were eliminated so flyers and presentation materials are all grey - look very unprofessional. "
good,"Keybank is for people who are good at handling multiple things at once such as angry customers, phone ringing, assisting customers after customers. Its a very fast paced environment."
good,The team I work for is amazing. It’s a very fast paced environment to work. The upper management I feel lacks in understanding the branch level needs.
good,Company is no longer active in the area.  It's been too long since I've worked there. I believe the company shut down in the area due to financial issues.
good,Work life balance is nice. Allow work from home as needed. Favorites are clear and obvious and receive significant share of incentive pay. Most in the department were great to work with.
good,"It was pleasant. "
good,"I do not feel the training was pertinent to your job specifically, you would train with people from all different departments. Felt that management  never followed through with you or thoroughly explained what was required of you."
good,The bigger the bank the less important the individual is. The culture is nothing like the previous Bank (first niagara Bank). It’s a good job for strong individuals who can self motivate and preform well with high sales goals.
good,Business Development focus on relationships.  Learned ways to sell to clients. Results driven organization.  Enjoyed supporting our clients.  Hardest part was navigating changes in operations.  Enjoyed helping the clients the most.
good,"I Like the people i work with, i just done like the company i work for.  it is to corporate and they do nothing for the people who get the brunt of it all.  The health care is so expensive and it covers nothing.  they give you pennies for raises."
good,Overall my direct manager was fantastic and understood my job and role extremely well.  The district manager for the bank was new and learning her job but was spread so thin that she was covering 24 branches the majority of time I worked there.  The branch managers were difficult to work with and had high turnover in all 4 branches I covered which made training a constant.  Additionally some of the managers were licensed and some were not.  The ones that were were consistently out of compliance on their education and licenses updates.  Made it stressful to work there.
good,"No interaction with coworkers, no praise for going above and beyond. Management behaves poorly and are allowed to do so. No real training offered on the job."
good,The bank expects you to bring people into the bank when the entire goal of all banking is the convenience of online and mobile banking. They will tell you about all the opportunity for promotion and advancement but they pigeon hole personal bankers and do not support their efforts for advancement in the company.
good,"Job offered and Description did not match with daily duties."
good,All the programming jobs are outsourced.  And the management treats programmers like factory workers.   Any good and ambitious software developer would not stay with this bank.
good,Unrealistic sales goals and micro management. Health insurance has gotten worse every year. Computer systems are outdated. I worked there for 6 years and It got worse and worse. 401K is good. There is reason why the stock price has done so well and that is internal layoffs and benefit cuts.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but retail referral expectations are set too high for many branches. You are expected to sell as many referrals in a small branch as the big branches with many clients and they are unrealistic goals. If you don't meet your goals, you are terminated. Period. Downsizing of branch personnel has made it virtually impossible to attain full-time positions or advancement."
good,"Very challanging organization with ever changing expectations.  Trust no one, everybody is willing to do whatever it takes for the next promotion.  long hours and ever  make the jobdifficult"
good,"Many of employees were from low income and it was a great opportunity for me to give them the resources to succeed in a career...Became a successful mgr until recruited by the banking industry.   Long hrs., away from home and wanted to use my financial insight with retail banking"
good,"Good company, needs better hours, products could be better for clients. Overdraft protection products should be better"
good,I handled all changes with ease in order to help maintain being a strong supportive coworker. The hardest part of the job is the staffing restructuring which is making it much more difficult to balance job work/life and also the almost doubling of monthly sales goals. I don't really enjoy the sales part of banking. The best part of my job is having a great client base to work with.
good,The leadership in the company neglected to ever let us know what the actual direction of the company was; which never me feel safe a day at my job.
good,"I am in charge of many compliance regulations such as holding meetings, filing and manage inventory. I work with co-workers to help meet monthly goals, as well as met my own. Cold calls to bring in business and follow up to current clients."
good,"We were robbed at gun point and our alarms failed, upper management viewed this as a minor infraction. I left due to concern of my personal safety"
good,Its very stressful. I would ask for help from co workers and get responses of negative/no I can’t help you. Very childlike ask atmosphere. An the manager was a micromanager as in He would want you to park in a certain spot. But then the next day it would be a different spot or something else as you really need to do when it really dont matter.
good,Since changing the business model tellers got force promoted to bankers with little training but a big raise. So those who were already in the position and trained for it have more work for lower pay. And key wonders why there's such high turnover and so many disillusioned clients.
good,"The teller position at Keybank is very stressful. We are expected to balance, sell, and be highly aware of risk management in a fast paced environment. My immediate manager was wonderful, however the stress from above was almost unbearable for all of us."
good,Out of touch with life at the retail level. Consistently making money decisions cutting whole departments and positions to reach their “savings goals”
good,It was a nice place to work but definitely could improve in the management area as well as job security . Definitely helped me advance to what I wanted to be.  The best part of the job was working from home and more flexibility with my children and family.
good,"As soon as I became a part of this company I wanted to get out.  They have an issue with seeing through promises.  Upper management is largely out for themselves.  I experienced racism, and sexism at this company. If your whiling to kneel and sing praises of upper management they will work with you, but if not you become a lost cause.  Only way to get promoted is to bend backwards no matter how ethical or unethical it is."
good,"I have seen my manager 2-3 times a years for about 2 hours each visit for the last 6 years.  There is no coaching, mentorship, or professional growth plan development.  I have been operating a branch with three and sometimes only two people in the building at any given time.  The branch model was developed with 8 staffed positions.  The overall expectation is to move clients out of the branch to independent online account management but the sales goals required steady in-branch traffic.  Incentive plans are adjusted and manipulated away from compensation for sales goal achievement.  The management culture is operated around rhetoric that is not met with action to validate it."
good,The work environment was relaxing and productive.  The training provided is great and you continuously learn several new things.  The hardest part of the job is paying attention to detail and just ensuring that you are sending in what each specific county is needing.
good,"the hours were okay, but not what I wanted. I was pushed every day to sell credit cards or some kind of checking account. the branch I worked at was kind of hidden and it was very slow, with no customers. and the only customers that came in would reject my offer to sell them anything. so if I didn't sell anything for the day or the week, I would get yelled at and told I need to try harder."
good,"I enjoyed working for Key Bank. It allowed me to use the skills I have obtained through my work experience. It was a challenging, but rewarding work environment. There were times where working as a team was more important, but having the ability to work alone as well."
good,The culture was inclusive and I made life long friends working for the company. The salary compensation was not competitive with other Financial Institutions in the area.
good,"Very repetitive, no over time, very strict on hours, nothing to do other than look on the computer, you have alot of customers that you see everyday that do the same thing, you do get alot of experience dealing with cash"
good,"Not good training. Hard to be successful without accountability put into place. Potential for growth, but not exactly somewhere I want to grow within."
good,"They will always train and help you become what ever you want to be. They have great employee perks and the ability to work from home which helps with work life balance.Unfortunately job security is a concern. There is constant restructuring, but that often comes with a large corporation."
good,The job can be stressful because virtually every department has a sales goal. Most supervisors are good . The coworkers were great to work with . The teamwork is excellent and good benefits
good,some of the managers were absolutely useless and others great leaders it was really hit and miss. pay was decent but constant layoffs. cant depend on keeping your job
good,Another example of a bigger bank and making very high goal expectations service staff pay has always been very low for all they are required to do and what they are responsible to do and for.
good,Executive Management team can be a bit of a closed network. Outside hires never feel fully integrated or totally accepted. Their regional footprint makes it difficult to get things done in a smooth manner.
good,"Overall, working for the KeyBank I worked for was fine. Though I hated going to work everyday, a pay check is a pay check. My co workers were lazy, would constantly walk away from teller line to talk to co workers who were at desks. They would also constantly make personal phone calls. I felt like I was the only person working 95% of the time, since I helped almost every client that walked in. Most clients were nice, some were absolutely awful though. Manager was really nice, but constantly stressing on making ""sales"" for different types of accounts. You don't get paid extra if you are in charge of different things, while others get paid to do less. Meaning, if you were the one who had to service the ATM once a week, or were in charge of the vault money, you didn't get compensated for taking on that extra job. I didn't think it was fair."
good,Key Bank is a numbers driven bank that relies on fees and sales to generate a lot of their income.  If you don't mind sales then this company is not bad to work for....just hit your numbers.
good,It really depends on what department worked at KeyBank. Some departments can be abusive and stressful to maintain a healthy mindset. I feel that KeyBank should one the opportunity to work where skills will succeed as oppose to seniority or certain qualifications.
good,The most fun part about the job is helping clients meet their needs.It was a good atmosphere to work in and the call center is in a good location. One month training was very helpful.
good,The employees are not treated like people merely numbers. The typical day is spent working closely with clients. You educate clients about different product that are offered and find which products are most appropriate for the particular client.
good,"KeyBank would have been a great place to work, however I made the mistake of working at their New York City location. It's the only one, after that the closest is New Rochelle, NY (outside of New York City). KeyBank expect you to make referral goals each month and that is difficult if you are the only branch. Fraud was a huge problem for the New York City branch which made working there stressful. Instead of allowing Branch managers in manage their staff, branches are micro managed by those who do not work in a branch. If KeyBank is a place you are considering, just make sure the branch you are applying for is supported by other branches. If it has only one location, DON'T."
good,The bank paid above the average for the lead teller position. The benefits were pretty good and the hours were a typical 9-5 day. Everyone worked together as a team and helped whenever short staffed.
good,"Answer questions for clients, always prizes and games to be won. Explaining policy's and procedures. Move fast within the company. Always positive, raises yearly."
good,"The location was convenient, however, the travel was long. The connection between work and real life was tough because of the hours that I was working, but for the pay, I had to work these hours. Then management wanted to change my hours to an earlier time, however, I would have taken an almost $2 pay cut and I did not really have the option to decline. The customers at times could be very mean and vulgar which made the job stressful."
good,Overall KeyBank was a decent place to work. Compensation was fantastic - and benefits were amazing. The culture is completely variable - dependent on management. Best advice for anyone entering or considering entering the KeyBank team is to interview your manager thoroughly.
good,I'll say this. The majority of people that I work with on a daily basis are wonderful - they are dedicated to making sure their clients receive the best service possible and that their financial needs are satisfied.
good,Working more than 8 hours aday. I learned that companies can change from looking after the employee to looking out for them selves. management was two faced. They did not treat employees fairly across the board. culture was different from the east to west coast.
good,Keybank as a whole is a good company but inside the branches they have some poor management. Its not a team effort like it is suppose to be. Keybank has a high turnover rate for part-time tellers.
good,"Worked as a teller which became very routine after awhile. They did a lot of training though, and had a good benefit plan. Don't know if that's still the case though."
good,"Missed advancement opportunities with current employees"
good,"Talking on the phones for 8 1/2 hours of the day, I learned to deal with angry customers. The coworkers were all wonderful I've never had a problem with any of the coworkers"
good,"I was a part-time teller @ Keybank for almost 1 1/2. I was located in what is called our uptown area. Their is another branch in our area, the business district. I was recently terminated for the sheer fact i did not attain my monthly goal, not for poor performance as a teller."
good,"A typical day at KeyBank is spent profiling clients and engaging with prospective businesses.  Frequently, the challenges lie in the immediate needs of the clients and obtaining new business.  Goals are very aggressive yet attainable with unwavering effort."
good,KeyBank certainly values its shareholders and makes many tough decisions based on the bottom line. Well established culture and procedures.
good,"In Columbus, KeyBank is not a great place to work for. There are slim to none opportunities to advance and the staffing is so minimal that the work environment is hard to bare."
good,"Hours 8-5, M-F. Learned a lot about the mortgage industry.  Management was good to work for.  Co-workers were a lot of fun to work with.  Hardest part was learning the government loans.  Most enjoyable was the interaction with internal and external customers."
good,"Learned a lot about benefits administration and human resources, however, there are no opportunities for advancement. The employees are fun, but Key allows employees to goof off quite a bit."
good,"Constant tracking sheets on top of other tracking.  No trust in employees to get the job done.  While the entire economy is depressed, our goals increase and making incentive bonuses impossible to achieve.  "
good,KeyBank has many valuable assets there. The structural changes going on internally right now are a step in the right direction. I have letters of recommendation from my previous direct boss as well as co -workers.
good,Key bank is a great place to work and for some it's a great place to make a career but it doesn't seem like it's the perfect fit for me.
good,good co workers and team members great supervisors and great call center setting
good,"Helping and getting to know customers, in somewhat of a family environment."
good,okay place to work
good,"The company is well run, but the area I was in was kind of a clique.  Best part of the job is the campus and year end bonus.  The company has excellent business systems."
good,The problem with Keybank is frequent change and instability. As soon as you learn something they change it and you can never get used to anything to make it routine. Management does not care about employees and advancement is rare. This is why there is a lot of turnover.
good,Management is not in tune with its employees HR is not working n tune with times some actually work hard raises are unheard of bonuses don’t happen goals are not realistic or achievable
good,"I have a love/hate relationship with Key. Constant restructuring and management who are loaded with politics make progressing anything from a program level difficult. Things take forever and some of these processes are super lengthy. However, the work from home is an amazing pro and the salary is good to go."
good,"Loved the people I worked with, had the worst manager ever. She was rude and unbearable to work with at times and let her home life/ stress affect her work life on a daily basis. Ended up leaving because of her."
good,"Work from home available in many areas of work. Can work with minimal supervision getting your tasks completed. Disciplines of work though are highly siloed, making it difficult to master more than the discipline you are working with. Generous PTO and many other benefits available."
good,Difficult work environment without a lot of opportunity for advancement. High turnover throughout the bank which feeds low morale and fosters toxic relationships between colleagues.
good,"Bankers and tellers are trained and shadow someone until they are proficient; managers are thrown in the fire and expected to produce and lead, with little to no guidance on Key policy or day to day tasks. I asked leaders in certain areas such as Small Business and Key @ Work for help, and never received a response, but would get chastised in conference calls when we didn't meet goals. Speaking of conference calls, we average six conference calls a week, sometimes as high as ten - rather than being able to learn or lead my group, I had to sit in my office many hours a week listening on what needed to be done. Waste of time to have that many! "
good,I started well and had opportunities to move on but was offered a different position. I worked with many people who helped me grow but we all went our own ways.
good,KeyBank was a good company to work for.  There was room for advancement.  It was a fast paced environment which made the days fly by.  All in all it was a great experience working for them.
good,"the job was stressful and dull. they made it impossible to actually reach your referal goals, and made teller stay late for call nights with the management."
good,Provided strategy recommendations on all physical properties in the retail bank channel (branches and ATMs).  Used relationship management skills and communicated to 8 regional retail market leaders about their networks.  Worked with consumer analytics on strategy input and financial analyses.
good,"My branch was pretty laid back. It did get robbed once. That was scary. As far as the work, it is easy and being a teller is pretty nice if you like dealing with people. They were not overzealous with their goals that they had for tellers like other banks. Your main goal was strong customer service."
good,"The company when I was there had a old boy culture and if you did not fit in with that culture there were no chance for advancement.. Management did not choose many of the right people; which made the delegation of duties difficult, with many knowing more than the one they put into the role. Many times the people who is in charge relies on people not in charge to get their job done due to lack of their knowledge."
good,I was a contract employee they encourage you to apply for positions but they don't  really take you seriously .If you don't ave a college degree don't bother applying as they will tell you they found other persons to fill the position and continue to post the job
good,"Good opportunities here. Open communication.  Difficult to learn your department resources.  Lots of latitude for management. Except for my last year there, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here."
good,"I like working in Key Bank's loan center, but my current role is mind numbing, mundane and is just overall boring. I would definitely recommend this job to a person who likes to sit down in a cubicle for hours listening to music, eating cookies and getting fat."
good,"I enjoyed working for KeyBank.  While the pay was less than admirable for the work you did, the work life balance with PTO and the 401K were excellent.  The insurance was a lot of out of pocket expenses so this was not very good.  The job atmosphere is good, however, it is very clicky and if a manager decides they do not like you they do everything in their power to discredit you.  Key was an overall good place to work for and I would still be there if it was my decision."
good,"management is a joke, no room for advancement. pay is ok, no annual raises given. systems are horribly slow. On the plus side is actually is a relationship bank that cares about customers."
good,"Consistently deliver distinctive client service that is knowledgeable, empathetic, patient, prompt, and courteous. Build rapport and strengthen client relationships while servicing client needs with account inquiries, service needs, and issue resolution."
good,"Key has good vacation, paid holidays, and most IT positions work from home at least 3 times a week.  Health care is on par with anywhere else I have worked."
good,"The best part about working for Key is that there is ALWAYS something new to learn. This could be frustrating to some but I enjoyed new obstacles.  The worst part was the customers. Getting cursed at is a usual circumstance and as much as you feel for the client who has several overdraft charges, there is still a guideline to follow. Management was okay but people move around frequently. Benefits suck and pay/bonuses could be alot better.... But it pays the bills."
good,"The company is still adjusting to a large acquisition.  As things progress they will likely find better ways to integrate talent outside of their Cleveland base.  However, the current environment lacks clarity in regards to potential for career growth and development."
good,"High goals, quite a bit of pressure. Management does not really have employees best interest, corporate takes over."
good,Work Life Balance is okay. Compensation/ Benefits are average. Lots of opportunities to grown within the company. Job culture needs a little work. Management also needs work.
good,"This was a long time ago however, I enjoyed my experience there. Great people. Great customers. Loved the policies and procedures they had in place."
good,"The day to day work at Key Bank is pretty standard to most banks.  You get a book of clients of whom you're supposed to maintain and grow.  What differentiates Key from the rest is how hands-on the bankers and managers are with clients financial needs.  The bankers will originate loans and work with underwriters to help expedite the process as well as go through the loan document signing to start the loan."
good,Key is a good bank and offers a lot of products for it's clients. The management and staff in the area where I am seem to be very inexperienced and not too customer friendly
good,"Pay is average to above average. Decent insurance and lots of incentives.s. They try to have a lot of activities and seminars for employees. Overall however, it it seems to be a stagnant place- people do a lot of lateral job moves, they seem to be content with what is offered to them. Antiquated and convoluted operating systems and processes. I work and bank there, the new mobile app is terrible. Not clear is Key trying to grow the business or remain strong as a regional bank. Kind of all over the place. Too many fees and not enough options to provide good customer service. Huge disconnect between branches and operation side, everyone looks dumb to customers."
good,Liked working here great people and they are very into work life balance. Great Culture for getting into an industry that is not always easy to get into.
good,"KeyBank is a very stable bank.  As far as progression with this company, it is little to known.  If you are someone that wants to be in the same position for years with little progression.. This is the place for you."
good,Clients can either make or break your day. Pay is low and morale in the department is also low. You barely see you manager during the day because he/she is in meetings. Lengthy training but you are thrown to the wolves as soon as its finished.
good,"Great atmosphere and fun people to work with. If you enjoy people and numbers, this is a great place to work. Location dictates the type of clients you will encounter, This is something to keep in mind."
good,"The best part of working at Key Bank is the people. Like most jobs it also helps to have a good direct manager, which I did. The only draw back is that it is difficult to move up, but it can be done. I went from making $10hr ten years ago to making about $22. The job is what you would expect it to be."
good,"- take 50+ inbound calls daily"
good,Enjoyed working for company.  Company downsizing.   Not stable work environment.
good,"Like many financial organizations, Key has external forces that require it to change. Encumbered by a Midwest-centric focus, the bank is not an early adopter with technology and marketing practices."
good,"The job was constantly changing, which was exciting and contributed to a dynamic work culture"
good,Good place to work. Working with the public and helping with financial needs is fulfilling.
good,The Call Center in WA was closed. But i found advancement difficult.
good,The ability to multitask and complete daily tasks.
good,"Great overall training program but lacks computer training efficiency. Typical job for the description. Cashier, teller, customer service. Know what to do if you get robbed."
good,The work isn't relatively hard but you are asked to do a lot. We have been understaffed for the past 12 months. Long overtime hours have become a regular shift for most. Excellent benefits but the pay is not as competitive as other employers in this field.
good,"The job offered a very slow pace. Systems are antiquated and slow. Their work requirements are rigid. Training was for the basic, straight forward transactions. Nobody does basis transactions anymore."
good,"Keybank is great for entry level positions. It pays well starting out and if you want to make a career, you can. There are a lot of advancement opportunities to move up. However, once you are promoted, you are expected to work 24/7. Pay raises are minimal or non-existent. Managers are great people and have good intentions but the corporate expectations are continuously changing, overall vision is never clear and expect to have a new target to hit monthly along with all other 9 targets you are already expected to hit. The company is very much do more than what is possible with no room for creativity. My way or the highway."
good,"bank has a lot of hidden fees which upsets customers. nice environment, laid back. meet a lot of different people. must be able to multitask and think quickly"
good,"I worked as a contractor at Keybank, but was unfairly compensated in comparison to other contracts with the same/less work experience. I worked primarily on the help desk."
good,"KeyBank itself is a wonderful company to work for. The only problem is with the managers they hire. Some of them are not necessarily ready for management. My current manager is phenomenal, but at my first office where I started out at the manager was never there and not a very strong leader."
good,"Good company to work for. Culture is great. Casual dress code. Larger mid-level size bank, with many locations across the country that one could transfer to."
good,Eh it was good company to work for I just needed change I want a more fast pace working environment and a more fun atmosphere and something rewarding to do
good,"Fast pace, making call and getting calls back, working well with others as a team. Being on time and making sure the reports were completed each day before closing hours."
good,"Location location location! Depending on whom the branch manager is, you could either have a good experience or negative one. Keybank used to offer a program where if you were in school they would work around that schedule. Unfortunately they did away with that not long after I started. The work is not hard and very laid back. But there is a lot of attention to detail that you have to be mindful of when handling money and customer accounts."
good,This job is ok and I feel the company takes decent care of there employees . The job I am in now is very motonous and tedious and it is the same thing pretty much every day. There is not a lot of room for growth in my department which leads to people being stuck here for 15-20 years or looking for a way out in 2-3 years.
good,".Good company and good bosses"
good,Worst manager ever. She had been with the company for 20 years and didn’t even know the basics of being a manager. Also I was physically assaulted by her and she received no repercussions
good,"Its alright place to work. Has great benefits, however the management is inconsistent. Goals are not clear, and anybody can get away from doing anything or nothing at all."
good,"Just like any job it would have its ups and downs, however the branch I was at was becoming a very toxic work environment and things had to change. The clients were the highlight of my day."
good,"No review of typical day at work, what I learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, nor the most enjoyable part of the job.  None whatsoever."
good,Many people at KeyBank have worked there for more than a decade.  This reflects positively on the company but has the potential to make it difficult to implement needed changes
good,"i went to work on a daily basis and gave my all to working at Keybank.  i am dependable, honest, flexible.  i was a teamplayer, i had a good relationship with my clients and my co workers"
good,Key Bank is an Ok employer. The firm is average even though it is a Giant in Cleveland . Compensation is not the best but competitive.  Kind of slow to adapt to changes but good employee in general.
good,"Work hard and then enjoy the benefits of our labors.  Expect a professional work environment and equipment, training activities, and development for future positions within the organization."
good,"great place for work/life balance; bank believes in its people and providing a nice work environment, bank is committed to the local communities it serves"
good,"Great pay with this company, however it is a bank and banks go through many changes. Working here is like working for any corporate employer. There will be back biting and shady things going on and a lot of nepotism. However, if you're a person that keeps to themselves and work hard, you'll do well. There's a lot of opportunities to learn new things here."
good,"Ok place to work, no type of growth within the company. Workplace very competitive and favored for people who have been there the longest. Regional Manager is no help for Fairfield county."
good,I held two different positions at Key which positioned me for success in a large corporate financial institution.  I met lots of great individuals here and had an opportunity to learn and grow in my positions.
good,"Micromanaged.. many area's over staffed very narrow focused job responsibilities. Bottom line is more important, customer\user support not a lead priority.."
good,Key Bank has given me an opportunity to expand my knowledge of risk governance.  The hardest part of the job would be learning the third party system. The most enjoyable part of this job is the staff at Key.
good,from 8am to about 5 pm. I learned how to do wire transfers then manage workers. Management was ok it was so busy time went fast. The hardest part was learning the trades. The  best part was getting the job done
good,"key is an ok place to work no major complaints or issues. not quite as friendly of an environment, but was an ok place to work benefits were good but somewhat costly."
good,i was a teller and the bank got robbed twice. for the most part it hasn't been a bad place to work for minus the robberies. the people are great and the pay was okay.
good,"Nice place to work - good people and great benefits"
good,"Did credit cards of Visa, MasterCard and Visa AAA on merchant side. Called in daily for Visa AAA the amount paid to Visa AAA. Had time restraints on submission of debits and credits for accounts.  cut checks to credit card cardholders that over paid accounts or received a refund for a purchase. Ordered new credit cards to cardholders for either lost, stolen or renewal cards."
good,Breaking into the banking industry at Keybank was a positive experience. It enhanced my knowledge of financial products on the bank side and made selling those products very easy since Keybank was the leader in many product lines.
good,"Okay place to work.  Does not have any kind of flexibility.  Strict policy, one mistake means you're on your way out the door.  If on third shift, your stuck for life."
good,"when I worked for Key Bank, it was more about selling products to the customers than it was about helping the customers. As an employee I felt under valued."
good,"During my year at Key, I was without management for 8 months. Competitive and stressful culture without management in place. Key uses many outdated tools for bankers and is in need of an upgrade to keep with the times."
good,"KeyBank is not a bad place to start if you are acquiring skills and experience. The best way to earn a promotion or a raise is to quit, go to a competitor, then return to Key."
good,"Depends on the team and the branch you work for, it could be great or it could be horrible. I was a float teller so I had some experiences working for an awesome team, and the rest were just toxic managers that were out to get each other."
good,"The environment is good, and the people are good. Management can be unwilling to help sometimes when it is needed. PTO is good but they make you feel like you shouldn't use it all."
good,Working Remotely is a strong plus when reviewing this company. I wish that the company offered more opportunity with professional growth and that compliance were a little more hands on in reviewing certain department processes and procedures.
good,Key Bank uses so many different computer systems that it is a challenge to get the simplest tasks done. Seems like each banking center followed their own interpretation of policies so their isn't a sense of uniformity.
good,The work environment was great. left for a similar position at another institution that paid significantly more. interview process was relatively easy.
good,Company was going through a lot of management changes and losing market share when I was there.  This led to an unhealthy environment and our department head finally departed.  The company has revamped and I understand is doing OK but not great.  Typical bank environment - not a lot of innovation but not an awful place to be for most employees either.
good,"40 hour work week, short staffed most of the time makes it a challenge to do required outside calls or log required call reports. Wish they would go back to old staff model with more tellers so managers could get out of office."
good,It has been many years since I worked at Keybank but while there I was able to work at several positions and there were always possibilities of moving around and learning.
good,Very good company to work for - growing company. Hardest part was when there were acquisitions. I ran programs - wrote cobol programs.  The management is easy to work with - great plac for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and got along with everyone. I left Key Bank for advance my career as I didn't find growth opportunities within my department.
good,"Job is quick paced. Pay and benefits decent. Management is okay, good some days frustrating others, new hired management makes for confusion about rules and regulations."
good,Calm place to work not alot of stress Good managers and so so bonus pay structure Overall a fun realxed and nice place to work. Excellent benefits and hours and always overtime avail to work if needed.
good,"Working at key sets a different tone. Non stop.. back to back phone calls, continuously explanations. Over all it’s a good place to work. You definitely need patients to work in any call center."
good,"The structure of rules was a little bit lack, breaking rules for regulars that weren't allowed for local. Dealing with angry customers had to be the most difficult job ."
good,"Key-bank was a nice place to work if you like working with people and money. Enjoyable most of the time, but stressful as well. Great developing relationships and trust from individuals that entrust you with their financial affairs."
good,"After a 30 to 40 min ride as a floater i work in all the Buffalo downtown area. Arrival  and parking was not a problem. Enter the branch and introducing myself to find out what station and get combination to retrieve my cash draw. with goals in order as a floater you had to get 20 checking/saving accounts per month, no matter where you worked. Cashing checks, referrals, cross selling, Listening to clients and finding out what they are looking for and what product that would be good for them."
good,"Give great customer service, learn new skills, management trains, workplace is fun with the right team, the hardest part is when customers get angry . The most satisfying part is at the end of the day and you see a customer leave with a smile"
good,"Just like a normal bank. There are sales goals, the team was great and managers were always supportive. Need to work on staff turnover, sometimes branches were short staffed"
good,I had a strong team that I worked with.  working with the clients is the best part of the job helping them to manage their financial goals.  worst part of the job is balancing all the goals set for the individual and branch to be successful
good,I was tasked on doing more work than the job description required. This is not an issue as long as I know that my work is noted. They did not take my position seriously and wasn't given any chance to move up.
good,I have gained valuable training and experience since the beginning of my employment however my position requires excessive hours and enormous responsibility relative to income.
good,"Selling to clients in the Bank Branches Life Health Mutual Funds"
good,"I've learned a lot working here, but there is a lot of favoritism. It takes a couple years to get any advancement. They don't really hire from within. If you can find a solid team to work with i recommend it."
good,"Working as a licensed personal banker after successful completion of management training program. Responsibilities include:"
good,Key Bank was a great place to work.  I left to only further by knowledge and career.  I would recommend Key Bank to anyone looking for bank employment
good,I was part of Key Bank for only a few months after the sale of First Niagara; my department was eliminated and I was one of only two people to stay on during the transition months.
good,keybank was a great learning experience for me and i appreciated everything i learned at the bank fun atmosphere room for advancement and great team players
good,"As someone who is very driven and desire to be highly successful, there was little opportunity to showcase my skills and accomplish what I wanted to. I felt that management was very supportive of my endeavors."
good,"In the beginning, KeyBank was fun to work for.  Towards the end, they started to become like any other bank and wanted everyone to push product.  Our goal became outrageous and was not realistic."
good,"Promote Bank that was considered an in-store bank.  Handle customer deposits, withdrawals, open new accounts.  Promote the bank with various give-aways, incentives, and speaker announcements. Balance cash drawer, answer phones and try to be of service to customers."
good,"Typical daily duties: Handle incident tickets, build and support RedHat servers on blades and VMWare."
good,"Large Regional Bank with locations in Trumbull, Portage, Summit and Mahoning County.  Lines of business include Private Bank, Commercial and Consumer lending and Cash Management"
good,I learned how to work well under pressure and extreme deadlines. Position had reasonable goals and a great support team to help answer questions. Small family like atmosphere
good,I was treated fairly. They were a nice place to work for. My team leader was a great person to work for. It was a nice office environment. The facilities group help myself with my career.
good,Very steady industry that is going through changes from years ago. Bank consolidations have changed the environment to much more large corporate environment
good,This is a new bank in my area. It is still a lot I have to learn and a lot of training that I need to do. Personal Banker position is pretty much the same as my previous banks.
good,"customer service,  problem solving, training, scheduling, lead Teller, team player, enjoyed waiting on customers, and learning something new everyday to facilitate to other employees"
good,"KeyBank is a great place to start a banking career. It is easy to get promoted from a teller to a lead, from lead to a banker."
good,"Keybank is a wonderful company to work with, but in it's transition from First Niagra to Keybank there are aspects that are lacking. Management is not encouraging, but rather hostile. However, this has a benefit of helping an individual to advance their professional and communication skills."
good,This was a very difficult bank to work for. They require way to much out of their employees in comparison to what they have to offer. Systems are extremely outdated and  branch goals are set way to high
good,company schedules all breaks and isn't willing to take in to consideration that being in a call center and that there will be times when you cant go on break right when they schedule you. it causes a lot of stress and anxiety trying to follow that and assist the customers. they also aren't willing to work with you when serious family matters come up
good,"Working at HSBC introduced me to the world's local bank, giving me a new view on banking. They are no longer in my area due to a bank merger."
good,"Pay is average to above average. Decent insurance and lots of incentives.s. They try to have a lot of activities and seminars for employees. Overall however, it it seems to be a stagnant place- people do a lot of lateral job moves, they seem to be content with what is offered to them. Antiquated and convoluted operating systems and processes. I work and bank there, the new mobile app is terrible. Not clear is Key trying to grow the business or remain strong as a regional bank. Kind of all over the place. Too many fees and not enough options to provide good customer service. Huge disconnect between branches and operation side, everyone looks dumb to customers."
good,It's a fine place to work if you do not want to work full time . The pay is okay for a salem living area. There are a lot of opportunity for charity funding .
good,Great starting job out of college.  Management expectations are unclear.  They have performance reviews every quarter which makes you feel micromanaged.  Job is not challenging if you have a finance background.  The job can be very stressful during busy season.  During these times expect to work 60 hours
good,"I did not work at this job for very long due to the branch I worked at closed and went back to Ohio due to economic struggles. "
good,"-Multiple systems that do not talk to one another"
good,Key bank was a decent place to work. Though the higher ups tended to look at those who kissed butt than actual decent work.
good,"Consistantly busy office with a friendly staff and a even work life balance. "
good,"I have previously reviewed this company"
good,"Drive to protect the company against risk by doing things in general accordance with established standards."
good,"I was a bank manager, they would not allow any loans for me to process, they were looking for large companies, and forgot the little small town principles the owners had, They turned down everyone of my loans I tried to get for the business owners in that area. So the business owners started giving their Business to another bank. They downsized and put assistant managers in managers position and paid them half the salary. I was new to the area and one of the first to loose job"
good,I want to branch out and work in a field that is important to me. I like to help people achieve their potential and I am concerned about the environment. Which is why I left mortgage banking. I didn't feel I was achieving my full potential and I have so much to offer any employer who agrees with that philosophy.
good,I enjoyed Key Bank because of the opportunity of learning  a new job field. My co-workers and I work daily as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was management.
good,It was good to be able to work in the community where I recently moved and be able to meet the local people of the community.
good,Not very stressful.  Staff is very knowledgable. Lack of follow through. Very disappointing to be passed over SEVERAL times to people who were NOT qualified
good,Key bank is a larger bank them Home Savings and I feel that I got lost there. I was a Customer Service Associate/ Acting Manager and Lead teller all in one. I had a lot of responsibilities but not a lot of good training. That is the major reason I left Key.
good,The job was too confining and the sales goals were unreasonable and unattainable.
good,"Worked as a banking specialist resolving customers issues and offering/selling bank products. Spent all day on phone, good amount of customers upset and unpleasant convos.  Management was very kind and understanding.  Poor computer systems made day more difficult."
good,Adhere to policies and procedures for banking industry. Build and maintain client relationships. Consumer and business lending.
good,"Analytical and performance-driven financial professional with diversified experience in financial and mortgage portfolio analysis.  Expertise in quantitative and statistical analysis, asset pricing models, and financial reporting.  Persistent and driven; working towards the CFA credentials. High astute, energetic, and team spirited with a strong work ethic able to fill numerous financial and investment roles."
good,"On a daily basis, my functions included reaching out to new bank clients and establishing stronger relationships with them for the bank as well as exploring new opportunities with existing clients.  I learned a number of things but one of the most important would be becoming emotional intelligent in business and always having a different sources of businesses to achieve objectives.  One of the most difficult parts of the job was the regular changing in corporate structure but be able to work with such a diverse group of colleagues and more so clients would be one of the best."
good,A great company to work for! Good benefits and work hours. Downside is the many changes that occur in the banking field that are to be dealt with.
good,"Processed Mortgage Loan Applications, heavy Customer Contact."
good,Company is good to work for however is changing from a service to sales heavy focus
good,"Reviewed and advised on credit structure and approved credit requests up to $15 million in support of Community Bank teams to deliver credit products to new and existing clients."
good,"Client profiling, setting appointments, opening accounts, financial reviews"
good,"A typical day at work involved taking incoming calls, processing on-line and call center originated applications for new account openings. This process involved processing new account numbers, answering client inquiries or making outgoing calls regarding next steps of completion and follow-through with general maintenance and ensuring compliance regulations were met.  Also acted as a go-between with branch personnel to ensure successful account is accurate and complete. Handled inquires from internal clients from account-related departments (ie..call center, on-line banking, retirement, private banking and investment, business banking).  The most enjoyable part of the job was ensuring customer satisfaction and retention."
good,Achieved highest review for the area. Worked with and trained other employees on various products and service.
good,"Ran their Robbery Prevention Unit, worked with many great people over the years"
good,"May have remained working there, but company relocated to Florida."
good,"Good Employer friendly atmosphere nice place to work. Management and Co workers are great best part of the job is working to resolve customer issues and concerns, very rewarding."
good,servicing customers with all aspects of banking needs. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and the customers. 
good,My day was very bus from 8 in the morning to 4 in the evening. My co workers were very educated and had lots of experience in the field. Sometimes the hardest part of the day was the customers that did not have accounts with the bank and wanted their checks cashed without proper ID.
good,"I enjoyed working for Key, it was a great place to work. The people really helped each other."
good,"Good Company, their systems at the time were not up to standard."
good,Everything done by the book. Once skills were mastered it was not a challenging at all.
good,"Young culture and a lot of departments to grow within. Compensation was low, but that tends to be the trend for the banking industry."
good,"No real complaints about Key Bank, very average employer. The offer meager wages and average benefits. Too much focus on referral goals. Tellers end up doing too much work to make the managers look better and aren't compensated accordingly."
good,"I love to be around the clients, and enjoy helping them meet their needs. The hardest part of my current position is staffing, and a lack of leadership. My typical day includes compliance training, helping my tellers achieve sales goals, and cash control. I also provide sales support for the sales professionals."
good,"Served as focal point for marketing strategy development & management in support of National Banking (B2B) business segments and product groups, such as commercial real estate finance, public sector, treasury management, derivatives and foreign exchange. Supervised three direct reports in development of strategic plans and execution of multi-faceted marketing programs."
good,This company is up to date with the technology and products they offer.
good,* Fast paced environment
good,Low Salary and Reducing Benefits
good,"I am every hard working. I put all i have into my job. I am reliable, fast, accurate and multi-talented in many fields. I am very adaptable to new enviornments and very out going friendly person."
good,"Elicit requirements using interviews, document an"
good,"I had a great branch manager and worked for 2 great advisors on the investment side. "
good,"Very tough, the company is great for the most part. Customers are extremely abusive... not worth the pay in my opinion. But you can move up quick if you apply yourself."
good,"Strong local culture. Focus on clients at local level, but corporately it is not there yet. Too many conflicting systems and no technology in place to achieve many of the items required.Strong leadership at the very top and locally."
good,"I was only on- call. So the hours weren't all that great. The manager I had, played favoritism. Did not report other employees actions. Just the people she didn't like."
good,"Key has ok benefits and ok pay. They aren't the highest and they systems that they use are old and outdated compared to other banks like Chase, US Bank or Wells Fargo. The leads that they provide are horrible and mainly useless. You will need to develop outside referral sources to be successful. Pay raises are usually in the 1-4% range. Bonuses are on the low side."
good,Enjoyed working with others in my department.    Was willing to help out whenever I could but it didn’t matter asi was layer off before more recent hires.   Got along everyone and liked coming to work each day.  Too bad Keybank didn’t like me as much as I liked them
good,"Worked in customer service call center and telesales. Training is phenomenal and on going. However, progression is limited and other than working in the branch, there are very few options available to do something other than phone work."
good,Key provides great PTO and work life balance. Lacking on pay/compensation. Leadership seems to not be on the same page. They also expect tasks to be done that are not realistic in a branch setting.
good,"KeyBank was an ok company to work for, Not a lot of perks for employees . It was all work, nothing in place for employee morale. No sponsored events from the company . I worked there in the 90's and at that time you had to wear professional attire (including pantyhose with skirts) Im telling my age."
good,"Co-workers are excellent! Tons of friendly people work at KeyBank. You’ll find a lot of good people with the same interests as you and you might make some life-long friends. Work culture in most back office departments is very laid-back. "
good,"multiple systems to learn and could use a tech overhaul but they have recently made some changes to hours which helps with the work life balance. you have sales goals you need to meet, no matter what they tell you in the interview this is a key component of your review"
good,It is best to do your job and keep your head down.  If you are not a networker you will never get anywhere.  Most people are quite friendly.  Must network.
good,Similar pay structure and sales goals as the larger banks. Work life balance is slightly better as you do not have to work all Saturdays. Training could use some improvements to teach systems more in depth.
good,"Solid Company, horrible technology which hamstrings your ability to service your clients, mostly good, ethicial people, flavor of the month management. Strong CEO, Competitive compensation."
good,KeyBank is you typoical corporate company. They are highly goal driven; which is good for them but bad for the workers. As the goals raise the work environment becomes much more stressful for the employees. With the Company recently going through a merger with First Niagara the staffing model has been chaos. Many areas are understaffed; and that cause major problems with customer service.
good,Key was basically every negative stereotype of corporate culture rolled into one. I was fortunate enough to work for some really great direct managers and an amazing team who were consistently restricted by bad decisions and top down worship of the status quo.
good,Your experience depends a lot with what District and Manager you have. Under-staffing is a constant. Branches often are slow and turnover is constant. The systems are 10 years behind the times and the lack of training is a risk for all new employees . You are often required to work 6 days in a row to cover Sat
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,It's been a long time since I have worked there and my experiences with my immediate supervisor and manager were great. I learned a lot from them about the banking world. However I do feel that district managers were unfair and did not recognize the potential of the staff in their areas.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was creating a  successful team and knowing that I was a part of building that team. There was a management team that was supportive of our efforts.
good,"Management could use improvement; however, the company overall is an excellent place to work. The benefits are great, the coworkers and employees are nice, and the environment overall is a pretty great place."
good,"Over all the company has grown 50% with the merger with First Niagara Bank. Many existing KeyBank employees have lost their jobs due to the merger, giving former First Niagara employees preference for job opportunties with less experience and  qualifications. The work load has doubled with limited work force to fulfill basic customer service and customer's needs."
good,The bank is too strongly focused on fee income from customers and expects too much from their sales staff. The goals are outrageous for the saturated market.
good,Its a nice place to work. Everyone is very helpful if you ever get stuck on something you may not understand. Hours are convenient and pays well.
good,"Worked as an Analyst to gather requirements from stakeholders and interpreted to developers. "
good,Co workers are great to work with to achieve overall goals of the branch. Working with the right manager also helps reach goals as well. I learned the complexity of retail banking  during the times of internet banking.
good,"Typical day at work consists of prospecting for new clients as well as servicing the large book of business the branch already maintains. Focuses are checking accounts/credit cards, small business, lending, deposit growth and investment appointments."
good,When you start work the first thing you do is you get your deposits and count them. The main thing you have to make sure of is that there are no discrepancies. It needs to be better managed but they do come through when needed. The hardest part of the job is not only making sure that your work is done in a timely manner but to make sure that the other employees are as well. The best part of the job is the people that you work with.
good,This companies values and culture are great but the management was some times difficult to work with. We were often under staffed and moved around from branch to branch.
good,High diversity. up to date technology. tuition reimbursement. flexible work schedule. Employee engagement programs
good,"Tough transition to post recession profitability."
good,"With upgrades in systems due to technological advancements, always new projects to get involved in."
good,"Great product and services although very limited. Micromanaged management structure in place. Software is out of date (Windows XP, Microsoft Office 2003 without outlook)"
good,"Having worked for multiple banks, I would find Key to be above average.  It was one of the few banks that broke the glass ceiling a with a female CEO.   I have nothing overly negative about the Key, they are just like any financial institution."
good,"For the last 5 years I was charged with the task of taking our department paperless. I had 18 boxes of paper reports that I had to figure out what reports were actually needed, then find them on line & learn to use them on line. It cut costs a lot. The paper, ink cartridges, print room fees & storage fees for 7 years. I learned to process the reports on line & annotated what we did & also with customer calls & comments. Then I had to train everyone in the department & help write the instructions for the jobs."
good,"A lot of changes in company, but all of banking is goi9ng through changes."
good,my typical day at work was to lead the loan officers to build their book of sales. Contacting customers and marketing Key way!
good,"push push push those sales!! Sell credit cards, mortgages, loans, bank accounts, doesn’t matter if the customer will benefit from it or not, as long as you get your quota for the day that’s all that matters. They claim they care about the customers but they only care about selling products. Great pay for the tasks you do, but would not recommend."
good,"Come in call different companies to obtain customer payoffs. Very flexible in regards to doctors appointments."
good,Way too many departments doing way too many projects at once. System implementations are stunted. Too many management positions. Need to update structure and invest in production positions.
good,It was a wonderful experience. All my work experience before was in Puerto Rico and this opportunity to work here in the Capital District of NY opened a new doors in my desire to reach more goals and develop my self to the max.
good,"I held multiple jobs in different departs at Key.  I had 5 different managers while there, and each one had there own style.  The departments either thrived or slowly declined based on your direct manager."
good,"I loved my job at this place, however the manager of our area made it impossible for me to move up from my starting position even after taking all the steps I needed to advance."
good,Working at Keybank is better than my last few jobs. The people I work with are very nice and we'll help each other out and work together as a team. This is the best decent job.
good,"A typical day at work can include assisting clients with their banking needs while trying to transition them to work with a Personal Banker.  There is an emphasis on these transitions and you are expected to make at least six transitions per week."
good,We were always learning about the banking industry are always new test to take.  You come in and set up your drawer balance it I was the vault teller so I am balance that I would order money for the ATM and supplies for the bank.  Wait on customers and answer phone calls direct people to the platform side if they needed a loan.
good,"The division that I work in for Key Bank is very small in Colorado. I only have one other person working for key insurance and benefits in Colorado. Because of this, it is hard to get all the resources I need for the job. It is also hard to meet people within the company because I only work with one other person."
good,"Transitions, sales, whatever you want to call them...Key retail is a typical bank. It talks about ""financial wellness"" but if you don't have the right credit score, we do nothing to help you improve your financial situation."
good,After working here for over a year they started to downsize the number of employees per branch causing less and less options to be available for advancement.
good,"I really enjoyed working for keybank until they switched me to another branch with a new manager who was constantly gone ""getting new accounts""  but I was restricted on my time outside of the branch, when he was approached for help during a time that accounts were short he would only say do it differently but not offer any additional assistance."
good,"I found that the tellers are overwhelmed at times with long lines and impatient customers and management was not much help. You are expected to hurry through the customers while also offering them credit cards, savings accounts, etc. which you are responsible for opening a certain amount of each week. It can be challenging."
good,"Good Hours, Prepare for Sales Culture.  Holidays are paid, which is nice, and the company provides good benefits like the 401K matching program."
good,In the Mortgage department all process was mostly processed with an to other company and was difficult to process in a sufficient timeline.
good,A very fast pace and the ability to learn quickly.You;re in charge of certain accounts .They had to be maintained on a daily bases.We had to update all procedures when it was necessary.Daily  communicate with other department.
good,The nice thing about working there is the clients. they are very friendly. Can be busy at times. I have learned how to multi task efficiently.
good,"I learned a lot and my coworkers were excellent. a typical day starts at 8:30 arrival at the branch, taking out the cash ordering more for use and logging in to begin processing transactions. It involves long hours of standing, customers can be rude and insensitive at times. My fellow coworkers always had my back. I loved my job, but left it as they moved me to another location."
good,Department was out-sourced.  Really liked working there.  Co-workers were closed to each other and worked very well together.  You have all kinds of ways to learn and advance yourself.
good,"This was a great place to work, but it wasn't ideal living so far away from the banking center. Key helped me gain a better understanding with getting all types of loan products approved."
good,"As an IT manager, I am responsible for FTE and Vendor Resources assigned to our organization in order to improve quality across the project engagements. "
good,I would say I loved the job and my co-workers. I would start at eight o'clock open vaults also do night drop with a second person for security and follow guidelines. I loved my clients and in return they also loved to talk to me. If you ask the hardest part would be referrals because alot of the clients use online mobile which took them out of the branches which made it hard. I love people and doing a good job which I did great.
good,"Key allows flexibility in performing duties from various locations, including home. Work/life balance was able to be maintained."
good,"Start the day with security check, greet your co-workers with a warm good morning. Open the vault, gather the materials needed to preform the days work. Meet together for a short huddle to discuss the days activities. The most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the clients."
good,"Within the Retail banking environment change is inevitable.  Keybank is no exception. Anticipate the business model to continuously change, sometimes it benefits the employees, sometimes it doesn't."
good,"I enjoyed this job and position. The banking world is ever-changing, so if you don't have attention to detail or  cant work with people, this bank is NOT for you."
good,"If you are salary be prepared to be told you need to work a minimum of 45 hours a week.  I was told that by more than one of my managers.  Also, in some areas, 45 hours is a good week.  I would carefully screen that amount of work that needs to be done if you don't want to be tied to your job and want to have a life."
good,Mediocre at best. Nothing changes. No one in upper management will ever change a thing. which is sad because I have a been a stockholder for a long time.. time to sell..
good,"Overall good company, many co-workers are incredible, hard-workers. Some questionable experiences. Would like to see some more consumer friendly goals."
good,"had a couple of good managers, but most were so poorly trained and ill suited to managerial roles that it made work excruciating. was beyond happy when i got my chance to leave."
good,"Overall Key is a very good culture with a lot of flexibility when it comes to work life balance, overall a good place with good people. I think management is very good."
good,"It was a really good learning opportunity, I grew a lot as a person working at Key since my job forced me to work on myself and the things that I was always bad at."
good,i loved my district manager but i wasnt given a fair shake in my situation and was let go for unfortunate situation but it was a unique job and could turn out to be a good career
good,"I started working here while I was a student. They were great in terms of flexibility, clarity and what they demanded from me. I feel as if they can do better on in terms of communication with their employees, as well as their staff. I have enjoyed working here and I hope things get better in the aspect of the company as a whole. One day, I envision KeyBank to be worth as much as a Chase Bank for commercial banking, specifically. I have learned a lot more about the banking industry being in it then I did in the courses I took in college that were about the banking industry. As a kinesthetic and more hands one type of learner, I have enjoyed the training I was giving and the knowledge I have received thus far."
good,"very busy, required to wear many different hats through out the day, lots of spreadsheets and tracking to do. Always short staffed long hours... love the customers that came in."
good,Perfect atmosphere for those individuals with strong social and people skills that like to use them in a sales capacity.  Revenue generating positions are very supported and rewarded.
good,"Fun company to work for, and great training programs. It was a great atmosphere. The customers were very pleasant. They didn't offer raises or promotions within the company."
good,"Responsibilities: Teller performance coaching,  internal  branch audit s, enter/clear cash items, annual audit (KSAP) tasks, NSF review handling, improve customer service ,cross-selling, and develop customer relationships."
good,Was being ivolved inthe down town Seattle market and all the down town community events.
good,"A typical day included processing new accounts, processing deposits, reviewing account, calling account holders, visiting other local business in the area. Maintain cash limits/cash control, ensure ATM replenished and balanced."
good,I liked the people who worked there but the technology is behind compared to other banks. You can pick your shifts when it's shift bid but make sure you can work them because points add up fast arriving late/leaving early or calling off. The pay and benefits are competitive but the health insurance could be better. You are able to bid into days Monday through Friday so you have nights and weekends off. I would have stayed if the technology was better.
good,"I very much enjoyed the family atmosphere when working at Key Bank, "
good,I like working in bank and clients. In 1980 I was first deaf teller was very first approach to clients meeting me came achieved . Fun job but hardest part to keep up cash balance . Great teams helped me relay issues
good,I enjoyed working at Key Bank. I had opportunities to work in different offices and rotated working weekends. The management was friendly and attentive. I started off as a part-time employee and worked my way to full-time. I would recommend working here and I would go back to this job if the position and pay was offered.
good,"Besides poor management, no HR department, little room to criticize management without retaliation, and workplace politics that has everyone acting like high school mean girls if you are unliked, the company has great pay and benefits and great opportunity for advancement. "
good,"Working at KeyBank comes with many challenges.  It is fast-paced and detail-oriented.  It also came with many perks, mostly food.  They had food ordered in for extra days (Saturdays & Sundays) worked and for birthdays and holidays."
good,"In the morning we sorted the mail into bins . Then, we were given trays of work to sort by payments whether it be cash, credit or checks.  After processing the work some of us would do the data entry to input the payments into the system."
good,"Working for the company wasn't a bad experience."
good,"Work/life balance and compensation are above average for the role. Internal systems and back offices are a nightmare to deal with. Underwriters are not consistent - the person you get determines how easy your application process will be. Internal systems are backwards. Tellers cannot even reprint receipts. Base pay is very good, but sales incentives are not."
good,"The company is unique in the sense that there is a sense of community between employees. "
good,"Growing market segment"
good,"Worked in varies departments through my life at Key.    The last position I held was as a Administrator Assistant of Commercial banking  department.  I had to make sure when a new hire came in they had the proper equipment and all the information needed to do their job.  I also set meeting up, employees training binders, created and ran monthly reports and set them to the correct officers.  I had to learn the basic jobs in the department so that I could step in when needed."
good,"I had ongoing projects as I was system's administrator for the Access and Excel databases. Ad hoc reports were generated and distributed. Data was accumulated and loaded for reporting purposes. I learned how to create databases and get them to interact with each other for the creation of reports and information required by management.There was no longer room for growth as I was as far as I could go. Management was good but very demanding as some reports could not be generated exactly in the manner requested. Some data could not be isolated as it would destroy the integrity of the queries created."
good,Meet the needs for the community providing products and servies to improve the qualiy of financial needs.
good,"The  company just began to change in a way that just wasn't communicated well with workers. The company just wasn't the same from when I first got hired to when I was let go. I loved some of the people I worked with as well as the customers but the company, higher ups, began making changes that they felt were best for customers when they were never inside the branch to know what was best for customers."
good,10 key I learn check and balance got to no a lots of people  learn to count learn how to used different computers learn how to do check encoding I enjoy all of it
good,If you have a good support staff in the branch it is great.. anything else you should look elsewhere. If you want a free securities license this may be worth it as well.
good,"As a teller, its busy from the start, pulling and processing ATM and night deposits, pulling reports on opened, closed, and safety deposit box accounts, not to mention interacting with clients in a friendly manner while processing their transaction. I have learned that communication goes a long way and that you must be clear in everything that you are explaining to keep satisfaction. management has played a generous role in the inner workings of a bank. my manager specifically, is very good at delegating tasks to each individual in the branch and following up to ensure all tasks delegated were done properly and in a timely fashion. As for co-workers i have had an exceedingly helpful, generous, and intelligent group of workers. Each brings a small piece of individuality to the table be it their honesty, their thoughtfulness, or their ability to sympathize with customers and their individual needs. These traits in my co-workers are handy in the foreseen battles and struggles that make up the most difficult parts of my job. Selling and creating not only referrals that you are tracked on but ensuring that those referrals you are suggesting to a client are actually there to benefit the client. It is always a fine line between meeting goals and meeting needs of clients. With all of these things combined or thought of individuality it does not compare to the most rewarding part of my job. It is nice to build a relationship with people, to know that you are somehow impacting even a small portion of their day in a positive manner, and treating them with the respect they deserve when"
good,"GREAT COMPANY with good benefits.  Excellent work life flexibility and vacation package. "
good,I am the first face that the client comes in contact with to handle their personal banking. I have learned to work better in a very professional atomphere. The managment of the company was always so helpful and informative. I was always update on any of the new products or procedures. Working with the people that I worked with was experience inside of itself from the team work to learning. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients and making suring that they left my window satisfied.
good,"Fun work environment, lots of people to talk to and help with questions. The management team is fun and doesn't seem stressful. The hardest part is reaching your numbers on sales. The easiest part is that there is not too much pressure or threat for losing your job if you don't reach your numbers."
good,If you can make a little less it's a good steady job. The PTO is fantastic! They match 401K up to 6% and the benefits were pretty good if I remember right...
good,You need to be a special kind of person to answer back to back phone calls for 8.5 hours and be able to provide assistance without the customers being confused or upset with you or the bank.
good,Being a bank teller is a job where where you'll like it if you enjoy what you are doing. It  is also a good job if you love the banking industry and you want to move up the ladder.
good,Company as a whole Is a good company. Management only cares for themselves. You give they take. Worked extremely hard through no manager for 6 months took on all manager roles. Then was picked over and told my hard work didn't matter. They never know how to say thank you only do better and to scrutinize.
good,"I loved my job up until July when the relocated me to a different branch in town. The manager is awful. She talks down to employees, threatens you with HR if you're ever 1 minute late, and she frequently leaves early just because she can. It's not like this at every branch but this really made me start job hunting harder."
good,"KeyBank is a good place to start off in banking with little or no experience, however there is not a lot of room for advancement. They do have decent pay, and good benefits."
good,"I loved working with the customers there."
good,I worked there too long ago to say anything about this company at this time.
good,"very understaffed, too much pressure, but very employee oriented other than being."
good,A typical day a KeyBank consisted of reviewing loan documents for accuracy and completeness.  The work environment was comfortable and my co-workers were easy to work with.
good,"They don't reward loyalty. If they snag you from somewhere else the pay is great, otherwise your pay is average and the raises are a joke, Half the time management has no idea what is going on and there is no communication at all. This company is falling apart"
good,Not bad if you've never worked in banking before.  Will some times feel as if you do not have management support.  Depending on which branch you are at you will either be very busy or not busy at all.
good,"I show up for work with a goal and expectation of providing an exemplary client experience while engaging clients and co workers with a positive outlook for resolving issues, I enjoy helping others resolve issues and complete tasks. My management team style is the hardest part of my job."
good,"Not a fun place to work. Promises, Promises.Do not take criticism well, rather ignore red flags and react instead of prevent."
good,Great place to work. The only reason I left is bc I wasn't in a sales role and that left very limited room for advancement
good,"High productive work, very long hours. The work area was very isolating and quiet. Very little interaction with co-workers"
good,I really enjoyed Keybank as an employee. They really try to show employee value. I do think the systems and platforms they use are redundant and dated. The training lacked and management was more concerned with numbers than properly training an employee.
good,I left this position due to management and the high stress i was under due to the management. This was a part time position and I was miserable both at work and at home from the stress.
good,"Many times we are short handed on the teller line"
good,Very good autonomy with relation to my role......would like to see a bit more constructive feedback from direct manager as a guide to the direction my department was heading.
good,This job was an early job in my career.  The bank trained me for this position and I feel that I have learned fast.  I left the position due to a relocation of my husband.
good,great atmosphere only challenge was adjusting to the huge merger. they arent very understanding when it come to family issues or schedule changes so if you have a family especially little ones this company isnt for you they also dont have many tl or coaches so your pretty much on your own when it comes to resolving client issues
good,"Busy work environment, very sales focused.Very competitive Salary,decent benefits and pretty good payed time off.Equal balance of men vs women in the work place."
good,"This company is filled with great people, and a very hardworking culture.  However, the bank as a whole can't decide if it wants to be a main street or a wall street bank"
good,"Has a tendency for slow growth for employees.  There is a lack of structure. If an employee is self motivated, it helps. My time with this company has been a challenge,  that I have met and have been  successful."
good,It is a good place to work just need more room to advance. The specific department I’m in has people that have been there over 20 years and aren’t going to be leaving for a while.
good,Wore many different hats within this organization. Great place to work if you like to be right downtown in the middle of everything. Enjoyed working here.
good,"Great co-workers, third shift a lot to learn.  Easy-going atmosphere.  Managers seem to be open to suggestions.  team work environment.  Too much stress about productivity and error rate."
good,"Typical day was making phone calls, gathering in needed documents .Tend to tell you what they think you want to hear to get tasks completed and end result didn't match more often then not."
good,A very enjoyable work atmosphere but constantly doing the same tasks. This sometimes leads to a very boring day and just the feeling of being burned out.
good,"Nice bank to work for, days are easy with normal customers, new situations to learn about, updated training, daily morning meetings. Management is very focused on doing what is best for the clients as well as the bank. Great atmosphere with co-workers, ""family"" feel. Hardest part of job is not having consistent hours, otherwise very enjoyable. Opportunities to work with the community, customer and employee appreciation activities."
good,It was a good company during my time there however the company relocated. Overall during my time there the company was great I'd still be there had they not relocated.
good,"good place to work, benefits, lots of perks for the employees, benefits, bonuses, flexible hours, casual dress code, cafeteria on site, banking  perks"
good,Your experience at keybank depends on the managers you have and your relationships with them. I have been in good positions and great positions and my expeience has always depended on management!
good,"depending on the job, you either are used and abused, or just underpaid.Coworkers are always a joy, but in the multiple offices i've worked, management was either terrible, or wonderful. Hit or miss."
good,Company seems to be experiencing difficulties.
good,"Regardless of my position, my workdays were always 8:30 AM - 5:30 PM. As a teller, I learned effective interpersonal skills - necessary for interacting with customers and providing quality service. Problem solving and planning become a daily part of my responsibilities when working with client products and compliance and operational procedures. I was able to get clients into the products appropriate for them and generate revenue for KeyBank at the same time. Other attributes that became useful were being detailed oriented and thinking analytically. These skills were put to use when having to adhere compliance and regulation standards when balancing and auditing the branch vault and ATM."
good,"I enjoy working at KeyBank and he working environment. However, I don’t feel as though there is much room for growth which is unfortunate as I would love to stay in the company but feel as though I’m not meeting my full potential staying in my current position."
good,its work and sometimes Saturday work. I dont want to fill this section out so just typing. Apparently I need 150 characters so almost there im now at  1
good,As a Personal Banker the role is diverse and inconsistent. There is no give on sales goals while being forced to be a teller. Lack of staffing is rampant in the company. The stress you feel from day to day at work is hard to let go of at home.
good,Welcoming environment with employees ready to help and be of service. Upper management not isolated. Lots of opportunity to initiate positive change. Potential to move up in company.
good,sales goals are tough to meet in this competitive environment. being new to the industry proved difficult. establishing COI relationships in the area is key
good,"At the Kansas office, there are a lot of opportunities. Everyone there is very nice. They like to promote internally too, which is great for the people to grow and develop at a fast pace."
good,I felt like when they want you to build a rapport with a client and you do that you end up losing your job for it. While working there a customer would always call in and request to speak with me. After a while Key bank didnt like that.
good,This is a great company to work for they are a big national bank but with a real community feel to them. They take pride in really getting to know the employees and the customers.
good,"I had a good overall experience at KeyBank. I held several positions over the course of 12 and a half years so my typical day went from very vanilla (at the beginning of my career) to not knowing what to expect as I progressed throughout my increased level of roles."
good,"I have great memories of this bank it treated me as an employee well"
good,"Good place to work but not much room for advancement. The job will challenge you. Good working environment. New Management, think were heading in the right direction."
good,"KeyBank provided all employees with the opportunity to create their own career path and management would assist by mentoring employees, finding another peer to mentor them.   Management typically gave their teams the authority to make own decisions with little to no assistance.   Of course there were those managers that micromanaged their team, had favorite employees on team or another team which made it difficult for others.  The pay and benefits were great."
good,"Some branches are much busier than others"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this company  as I gained new information, and valuable experience in the Banking world. I was recognized by my Superiors to move up to become a trained Level @ CSR after my 1st year on the job. After this additional training I learned that I would be best suited for the CSR/Healthcare field where Ive gained most of my working experience."
good,"8:30am-5pm "
good,great place.  It is a nice place to work.  I don't have any complaints.  People are friendly.  Training is OK.  There is good support as well.  Overall
good,"Great people, great company. Initially brought in to handle a specific portfolio. My immediate manager was a great person to work with, allowing me great latitude to handle and create opportunities. When management turned over the environment changed, the position I was in changed, the dynamic changed, creating a much different environment which, in turn, created substantial turnover in my area."
good,Great place to work till you have to deal with upper management. Key investment services way ahead of bank in terms of culture. Tenured employees forced out consistently in bank branches.
good,Very Productive and helping Company that interested anyone who is willing to join the company. I have a balanced work and life while I am working for the company.
good,"Decent place to work depending on the department you are in. Most managers are understanding and are willing to help you get through the job but others could care less. Pay is good, health insurance is horrible, 401k is excellent."
good,I needed a job and banking hours are amazing. now i am just filling in for the minimum. Key bank is alright but it just just depends on the branch you work at.
good,KeyBank allowed me to climb up the ladder as quick as I could handle.  They are well established and a great place to learn and excel.  They had a Key culture that was fun to be part of.
good,"Key Bank is a great company to work for. Allows for a flexible work schedule, and allows working from home. Provides career development opportunities and potential for growth."
good,"Okay place to work for starting out in banking but all management cares about is referrals. If you don't meet your monthly referral goal, you get written up."
good,"I worked in a number of roles at Key.  I started in entry level and worked up to senior agent, team specialist, and to section manager. HR recruiting for Key used to be very good but has become extremely poor over the last 4-5 years. The application process is easy, but recruiters are over worked and they are very difficult to get a hold of."
good,"Key Bank was a great company with benefits, including 401K with match, vacation, health care, etc., and had the ability to provide flexible work options to their employees."
good,"Employees were nice and overall the company is decent. "
good,"Overall it was a good experience. People are friendly and do what they can to help you grow and reach your career goals. Have modest commission goals though, as you probably won't be making that much."
good,"This was my first post-graduate position, and I learned a great deal and a great pace over 5 years. Key Bank was acquired during my employment and I moved to Cleveland as a part of the move which was an incredible learning experience at such a young age."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Key Bank. i learned a lot about the banking industry, and there was plenty of room for advancement. I enjoyed working there as a whole."
good,"As a summer analyst, given a vast suite of responsibilities and work.     Cultural emphasis on learning and professionalism.  Would recommend to any potential candidate."
good,Enjoyable work atmosphere with knowledgeable leadership always willing to lend a helping hand and provide guidance.  Flexible work hours and good incentives.
good,"KeyBank allowed me to grow as a banker.  They train, teach, and give you the opportunity to help clients to meet their needs.  I am relocating to a place that doesn't have KeyBank's."
good,"Out of college I was hired into the Retail Management Associate Program. It trains employees as tellers and bankers, preparing them for a role in banking."
good,"Relaxed!! The staff really shows an interest for each employee. They have good benefits and perks, it's really great and a decent pay as well. Lots of fun days!"
good,"I haven't worked here long but you have good pay, great hours and training to move up the ranks as long as you say that's what you want. Management is helpful"
good,Provided a collaborative work environment while allowing the free exchange of ideas between colleagues.  Consistently demanded a high level of service for clients.
good,"Skills need to updated frequently.Team work is the main advantage.Whenever there are any issues we will be asking our manager to get the solutions.During deployment all the team mates should be present the whole day and work together.Its is very fun place where we will be having weekly activities,there we can explore out extra cultural activities like singing,standup  comedy etc.."
good,"KeyBank offers opportunity for growth and values diversity. Recently acquired another bank therefore increased opportunities for all employees around the US. "
good,Excellent company benefits.  Leadership changes a lot in the past 5 years.  Ongoing training available. Stakeholder's value is of paramount importance.
good,"Awesome daily hands-on customer assistance that was a major part of my daily routine. Team members were friendly and respectful. I learned patience, money handling and multi-tasking skills while with this company."
good,"Nice place to work, you can advance if you have a supportive manager. Not enough training , mostly hands on learning. You have to be a really good problem solver using system applications."
good,"it is very nice place to work with this client."
good,"Good variety of competitive products to sell and was supported with continuous training opportunities, marketing materials and tools.  Lucky to have great coworkers that promoted teamwork culture."
good,"I was responsible for many things in my department including writing up and emailing reviews of all meetings, etc.  I passed all audits.  I left this position to advance myself after achieving my degree in Business Administration & Acccounting"
good,Good and genuine place to work for. It has taught me a lot since the conversion with First Niagara. I am looking forward to seeing what happens in the future
good,KeyBank provided a great work atmosphere.  They maintained a fun environment while keeping the focus on producing sales.  There were contests as well to keep the employees engaged.  Overall I enjoyed my time at Key.
good,The best about Key was the work life balance. I enjoyed my time there. Upward mobility was difficult at Key and management at times could be difficult.
good,"A Typical Day: Worked off reports, documentation, booking, funding."
good,"Great Boss.  Learned allot.  Many challenges working across many different teams.  However, the amount of growth gained in such a position makes it worth it/"
good,I enjoyed working here. Just wish the pay was better. My co-workers always made days fun here. The bank is not very well known around Indiana so there was a lot to do throughout the day. The expected you to get sales but no customers made that hard to do.
good,Gained a tremendous amount of experience to advance me personally and my career. The experience has allowed me to expand my knowledge of banking product management as well as advance my skills as a manager.
good,"Liked management I worked for, and the department I worked in, Co workers for the most were nice, did not like my supervisor, hardest part of the job was traveling there in snow storms, enjoyed completing the work"
good,Good job work and life balance. Compensation/ benefits is average compared to other banks. Overall rating is good. Job culture needs improving
good,Was a good place to learn how a formal place of business worked. Got to interact with various age groups and have a high level of responsibility at such a young age.
good,An ever changing environment with structure and training to help achieve success. Incentive driven goals where you are rewarded accordingly. A sales and customer service role where flexibility is a virtue.
good,Enjoyed working here while in college. The people are very nice and the clients are well respected regardless of financial status
good,Key Bank is a great company with exceptional benefits. Must be very sales oriented and like to help people. Very customer service orientated and people friendly.
good,Wonderful experience and great co-workers. Management supported your learning process and gave you opportunity to work on independent projects.
good,KeyBank has some very nice people on the team. It also has a great vacation policy and matching 401(k) policy. There are opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"Great place to work. I receive lots of training and support. I continue to learn valuable knowledge about banking, great customer service, as well as problem solving."
good,"this job was funned informational,  Management was really bad not understandable and communication is not easy to address at this job.  The pay was good but the options to bonus was not easy"
good,"Mid size regional bank.  Focused on Community Banking and enhanced services.My work related to improving lending pltforms, assessin operations functions end to end, assisting management with efficiency gains, future use of technology using BPM tools to streamline workflows and technology investments."
good,full time from 830am-4pm. teller is easy job. very demanding with sales even if you are a teller. loved the paid time off they give you with the holidays as well. pretty much a fun time but can be boring if your at a slow branch
good,Typical 9-5 job. Hardest part about working in customer service is dealing with clientele finances.
good,My typical day was taking inbound calls at a call center. Excellent Service is the only service.There were good knowledgible co-workers. The hardes thing of this position was doing the same thing day after day. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help people.
good,It was just a temporary position the company I worked at was fine.
good,I learned how to handle large amounts of cash and balancing evenly.
good,"Depending on where you are geographically, there may or may not be a lot of growth for your career."
good,"A typical work day for meat Ace Cash Express was very busy and overwhelming. It consist of money managing bill payments loan processing and etc. i have learned how to count and manage cash, process loans and verify documents. I also learned the value of great customer service. My coworkers were very helpful and nice. The hardest part about the job was keeping the customers happy no matter what the case may be. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that the people was satisfied and happy with my services."
good,"Started out as a training coordinator but quickly moved the ranks to become system admin.  Have learned a lot, made many connections due to the opportunities with this department."
good,I loved working at key bank. A typical day involve encoding bank document at a non stop pace. The job was not hard at all. Had to be a very accurate data entry clerk. The incentives were very nice.
good,Good place to work (it was years ago that I worked there). Strong emphasis on sales goals for tellers.
good,Key Bank is an intranet project which is developed for the architecture of it. Here it shows the architecture of the bank that where the rooms and furniture resides. This is team of 2 members. From this i learned to avoid rework on the things i have done. And this gone well to launch.
good,Offered a lot of opportunity for growth. Enjoyed the experience.
good,"I worked with a great group of people ..."
good,I reviewed insurance limits for commerical real estate portfolios
good,"The company was great and I helped create he growth we enjoyed.  By managing operations and traveling with sales I could utilize the input from our clients and develop quicker, more production solutions to customer service issues."
good,I had quite a great experience at Key Bank which allowed me to learn about the financial industry and help me grow as an individual.
good,KeyBank is a great place to work if you enjoy retail banking.
good,Enjoyed working for Keybank. Great co-workers and enjoyable work environment.
good,I loved being a teller. You have a client base that you get to know and almost feel as if are part of thier family.
good,My Job was to assist my Manager to learn and train to be a Key Bank Manager. Through Key Bank I obtained my Health & Life Insurance License. I enjoyed my customers and the ability to business develop.
good,"Dedicated Associates, very flexable work schedule, fair compensation, greate benefits"
good,"middle market corporate and investment bank, aggressively building out oil and gas practice In Houston and Dallas."
good,Very good experience working at many different branches in Key's organization. Met a lot of nice people and got along well with everyone.
good,"While site visiting for our quality review, I found the management and employees very easy to work with."
good,Currently there are changes happening within the company that has everyone on edge on whether or not their job will be secured. Some times it is way too stressful.
good,I love keybank.  There are things as an employee that I love and there is things I dont agree with. Nothing immoral or anything.  Just no advancement training or opportunity.
good,I had a great mentor. I was in a class training to be a lead teller but  the classes wasn’t consistent andI wasn’t trained on the things I should have been trained on.
good,A day at KeyBank is being on the phone and averaging 15 to 20 phone calls per hour and getting rated for every call.most of the time Going to lunch at 10 to 15 minutes in your to your shift.
good,"Partnering with peers was beneficial for implementing projects as well as professional development.  Co-workers were cooperative, talented and improved value daily."
good,"KeyBank itself seems to be on the right patch but in my department specifically, I feel that there is a lack of responsibility among peers and guidance from management."
good,Management isn’t directly involved with Human Resource to develop and promote proper growth and to help reward good workers within the company as opposed to hiring outside of the company.
good,Keybank is a great place to work. The environment is pretty fast paced depending on which branch you are at. The employees I worked with worked together to get through the day.
good,"good place to work, develop networking and growth, there is a lot of job growth opportunity if you seek for it. great leaders. systems are a little sluggish but makes you a better person. overall, it was a good place to work"
good,This was a temporary position for me which kept me busy for the duration of the day. I think that they could pay alot better though. The employees were ok
good,"My typical day was staring early 7am until 4:30pm,  I did daily overdrafts, process transfers as requested, paid bills from Trust accounts, provided direct support to Trust Officers, Relationship Managers, & Investment Officers.  The hardest part of my day would be not enough hours in a day to complete all tasks.  My world there was very fast paced and you had to be very willing to jump from one task to another with most time not being able to finish what you had started first.  Also, KeyBank was beginning to centralize a lot of personal client processes to Cleveland.  I thoroughly enjoyed my clients that I worked closely with either by phone or email on a daily basis.  I enjoyed the flexibility of my job in general.  I was allowed to come in as early as I wanted and allowed to work from home when weather interfered with the workday."
good,Fast paced strong culture.  Growing to compete with large organizations. At times initiatives change quickly so a need to adapt is mandatory. Good work life balance
good,"Competative for employees but overall a great place to work."
good,There are only 2 issues I have with them. Having to cold call people and the low salary. The do have good holidays and paid time off. The hours are very good.
good,"I found my satisfaction level had much to do with the kind of manager I reported to. I've had great managers that knew the work well and would always help/advise you when needed and manage the workflow so you were always set up for success. However, I've had a few managers that I wouldn't care to work for again. I'm sure this is nothing unique to Key."
good,"Working for the bank is a good time, I get to help people.  I come in to work open all 15 systems that i use on a daily bases and began to take calls, depending on call type id trouble shoot or provide resolution to clients issue."
good,Worked here with my grandmother.  This was my favorite job I had and got me hooked on my financial career.  Met a lot of good people in this job.  Met some wonderful clients as well.
good,"Strong, capable senior management in Cleveland that does not translate to every field market. The company can be a great place to work; however, it is entirely based upon your field office and management there."
good,Upper management is ok. Had a great relationship with manager and supervisor. As long as you do what is expected you should have no problems. Benefits are decent.
good,Very flexible work place that cares about their employees. Good benefits and caring environment. Advancement is high and also provide you with the tools necessary for you to do so.
good,"Good job for the most part. Long days and sitting at a desk can get boring. They pay you well, and benefits are adequate. Management could be better,."
good,"I have a very good supervisor who is very patient when it comes to training.  The culture here is casual, and I have never felt under pressure to maintain a work quota."
good,It was good to learn a new skill and be able to take it with me. I loved always being busy and having many task to do makes the day go by. Everyone worked as a team.
good,"At the time, it was hard for a ""woman"" to advance.  and Pay was not equitable for woman in relation to men. I thoroughly enjoyed the work I did, but did not feel valued due the lack of pay."
good,I loved it until they moved me. The manager was just a nasty person. I hated to come to work because of her. Very rude and no personality.  I would have never left there if I would have stayed where I started.
good,Liked working for Key Bank in the operations dept. Thought I would work there until I retired. Didn't expect that upper management would close the worksite
good,"First thing at 8:15 every morning, you go through your opening list"
good,"I enjoyed working with the people I worked with, much like a family. The only reason I left was because my husband got relocated due to  being Active duty Army."
good,"The employees at Key were generally happy and stayed with the company through various management initiatives to become more efficient.  Employees were asked to do more with less, which is typical for the banking industry.  Key is conservative and micro manages its employees.  A decent work/life balance."
good,"I have had the opportunity to meet some great people, not just my co workers but my clients as well.  I love to interact with them, help them, and service them."
good,Management is really only concerned with sales numbers. Customer service is just something they talk about. Alot of hypocrisy.
good,You have a daily routine but you never knew how much work you have to complete until maybe an hour into your shift. The amount of work to complete determines when you could leave. The co-workers made it a good atmosphere to work together and complete deadlines.
good,"Worked in retail banking environment with the typical 9-5 hours. Started off as a teller for a year and a half, then promoted to Client Service Manager (CSM). While a CSM, trained and coached multiple tellers who were my direct reports. Spent almost 5 years at 3 different locations and took away a lot of knowledge from each branch. I enjoyed working with clients everyday and expanding those relationships."
good,"Pretty much every day was in at 8am, out by 5:30pm. The duties never really varied, and there was always work to be done. Management varied, some locations had great managers, some had good ones, I never met any that had issues with me. Coworkers were always good, but there was always turnover at the branches. Hardest part of the job was doing cold calls for sales. Best part was the clients, I loved interacting with the people."
good,"A majority of my knowledge regarding AML/BSA and all related functions was learned during my time at KeyBank. Due to the bank being smaller each employee is required to wear multiple hats allowing for a wealth of knowledge attained while employed. While this is great, the need for individuals to perform multiple tasks outside of their specific assigned role speaks to the banks inability to pay wages commensurate with those same roles at other financial institutions."
good,"Great place to work besides the constant crazy people and homeless people that live in the area. Expect people to try and scam you at least once a month. Bad checks fake bills, and ATM fraud."
good,"Became a nice friendly place to work, location was nice and easy accessible, customers nice, management helped when busy, easy drive thru"
good,"opened accounts, processed loan applicatons, guided clients to products that were useful them."
good,Daily collections on delinquent accounts 30 to 60+ days past due. Managing calls via automated dialing system. Adhereing to compliance procedures and using independent judgment to determine appropriate collection steps.
good,"This place was relaxed and fun. Dress down fridays. Management very fair and flexible. I liked everybody there, daily meetings and monthly carry ins with job and interest themes. Prizes for time and attendance. Also for job recognition."
good,I have held many management positions over many years.  I do not wish to use any of my past experience in any future  positions  I only hope to demonstrate my ability to relate to people at all levels  and to be of assistance in any ways I ca
good,Key is filled with great people that enjoy working hard for the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to branch out into many different aspects of banking throughout the company.
good,Key acquired First Niagara and once all the systems were converted to Key's systems my position was eliminated. I had an extensive and rewarding career with First Niagara and look forward to being in a similar position with a company that values my skill set.
good,BoA has a competitive culture and face pace environment.  Executive leadership turns over quickly as new roles and opportunities come up as the bank pivots into new directions.
good,"Keybank is a good place to work. The PTO they give is nice when you first start. They also have flex time, which is nice to be able to make up the hours in one week."
good,"The culture has changed over the years.  Having been employed for over 20 years, it has grown to offer conveniences of today's workplace.  Depending on department of employment, remote work is an option.  Job Work/Life Balance/Compensation/Benefits are very good.  However, very few talented managers.  The company should invest resources to improve management across the board. Also, cost cuts have been extreme this year which have resulted in mass job loss to many employees.  Most job cuts should be completed for 2019. However, it is part of the bank culture going forward so security is limited long term."
good,"I dont know about their benefits since I was just a temp, but I heard they weren't that good. Advancement might happen, but it didn't for me oh well!!"
good,"The pto sydlsrem used makes it so easy to tequest days u want off, you can also move up in the company quick but if you wait to long it seems to be harder to do"
good,Enjoyed working with HR and Audit groups as an enterprise information security consultant. Ability to work with other groups on projects provided a good overall view of technology.
good,"Fair wages, company is very sales oriented. If you apply yourself goals are attainable.  Quarterly bonuses could be better. Staff in branches are great. Loved my Manger and ARL. No sick time, but PTO is decent.  Health benefits could be better."
good,"While working for KeyBank, I had the opportunity to learn and be promoted from within.  I was laid off when the department moved to a different state.  Otherwise, I would probably still be there."
good,"While it's not a perfect place to work, you can tell that they are trying to do better and care about the feedback provided by the employees. You will do better being hired from the outside from a compensation standpoint than you would being promoted from within."
good,"Overall great place to work, plenty of opportunities to advance.  Key offers a lot to their employees, they really do look out for the people that work for them."
good,"really liked working there, but when it's time to restructure, sometimes your whole team has to go.  real bummer because I really liked the job and the people."
good,"Key Bank is a good bank and I am still and always will be a client.  The work environment lacks a little support when it comes to management, however, I enjoyed my time while working their.  The staff are great to work with."
good,Overall a decent company. Hard to move up however. Good co-workers and direct managers will support and help you. Large learning curve with multiple new and outdated systems.
good,"Worked in the Private Bank group for most of career. Good people and team, management rotated every year. Never had a long consistent manager was only downside."
good,I enjoyed working at KeyBank until a change in the Human Resources structure shrunk the size of the Training department. Many positions were eliminated as a result.
good,"I worked as a conventional mortgage underwriter for Key bank, SGS. It was my responsibility to check whether the customer is eligible for loan or not. i do this by verifying the documents submitted."
good,"Very busy, fast paced and always changing environment. Must be willing to adapt to change easily. I enjoyed every aspect of my work and completed all tasks in a timely manner."
good,Stay to yourself and learn as much as you can. Don't get caught up in gossip and you will be just fine! Management is never on your side. They are always willing to replace hard working employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was leading people and teams to success. Helping them develop and grow into different roles.
good,"I believe that KeyBank is a great place to work.  I feel like the people are great to work with.  However, there does seem to be a lack of strong leadership throughout the company, and the only way to advance far with the bank seems like to relocate to its headquarters in Cleveland."
good,"I work at a good branch with, high volume clientele,with merchant services, fast paced enviroment. Emphasis on sells and referrals. Credit cards and new accounts as well as lines of credit"
good,"This was a great company to work for, low starting salary. Not much wiggle room for growth with education in Banking and business field."
good,Working day to day with customers helping them achieve their financial goals and becoming a trusted advisor. Fast paced environment training is excellent allows you to take your career path to the level you want to grow.
good,Co workers are great to work with to achieve overall goals of the branch. I learned the complexity of retail banking during my time working at Key Bank. Overall rating is good.
good,It is a very progressive bank with a lot of smart people. The bank uses a lot advanced technologies and methods to improve the banking operations. Good place to work and learn.
good,"Working for KeyBank for over a decade has been wonderful. KeyBank offers great benefits, such as Paid Time off and holidays."
good,Hard work is rewarded.  Being a self-starter is the best way to be successful with this company.  They regularly promote from within.
good,Great amount of paid time off and ability to work from home.  Allows for flexibility with family and work.
good,"High number of transactional approvals"
good,I great company to work for. Very positive work environment
good,"I don't mind working in the vault but it is hard to keep up with not enough staff since staff have transfer to new job or etc.  Not easy to work many different duties if they don't replace someone.  I always like working when there is team work who help each others.  I like working at a desk job and meeting new faces.  Now, I'm learning to use the Outlook and Excel 2010.  It is interesting."
good,"Daily activities involved calling clients to set relationship review appointments.  Conduct two client appointments per day.  Uncover client credit, deposit and investment goals and sell tailored solutions to attain both short and long term goals.  Build solid, repeat and referral business."
good,"Each months employees Happy Birthday parties retired parties  and special Pizza Day and special  Holidays dinners enjoyed eat foods and drinks left over can take another extra foods drinks and cake enjoyed extra little minutes parties  ( employees pay foods $$$  )   "
good,"Key is a typical large banking organization."
good,.. with that said.. they seem to be going through a dramatic identity crisis.
good,"Good place to work. Enjoyed the work, co-workers and environment"
good,I worked for Key Bank for 10 1/2 years and was very happy. I worked in 4 different branches/locations while I worked for Key Corp.
good,I spent ten years in an office environment honing my communication and tech skills. I could never thank them enough.
good,"Key has great medial and retirement benefits. I enjoy the coworkers I have within my branch and we all work well together. We have had a lot of turnover within retail during the past year, which I feel is a negative."
good,"A good company to work for.  They fostered a team atmosphere and there were there with support should you need assistance with anything.  One thing to watch.  If they promise you health benefits, make sure to follow up on it to make sure they actually provide you with those benefits."
good,"Enjoyed working here, the management for guest services was flexible with days I needed off (vacation, sick days, others). Great job for kids in high school trying to make some extra money."

I felt like there was no where for me to move upward with my skills and my circumstances changed so I needed to do that financially.
good,"I loved my job at Key until they changes the regions around and I lost my boss and the new supervisor is awful.  He is non-responsive. He really doesn't get to know his employees.  He promoted a manager with limited experience and it will backfire soon. I make great money, but it is hard and challenging."
good,"Customers are mostly awesome.  Coworkers have been great and pay is finally at a good rate.  It can be hard to find a M-F job that gets you home at a decent time but banking is perfect for that.  And all federal holidays off is awesome.  Works out well with kids.  Branch managers have been mostly great but upper management from there is a little scattered, to say it nicely.  Short staffed a lot and no one come in to help.  Have worked many times a full 9 hour day without a break or lunch because of this"

good,"If you get a good boss KeyBank is fantastic, if not it can be very poor. Remember you can't do anything if it's sucks for a full year if you plan to stay within the company. Good luck."

good,"I worked for Key for 5 years. There were good times and not great times. Overall I'd say it's a good company. I found that on the retail side there was some shady stuff, which is why I left."
good,"I love working here, the only thing i would say- it really depends on the branch you get for you to be able to make money (bonus) They hire you with the expectation of commission (bonus) but only 5% of bankers actually make it to commission (bonus)."

good,"Key Bank was a very good bank to work for. I was overwhelmed when I first started there. I came from a smaller bank and was not use to the banks structure. They had a department for each business and I was not use to that. In a small bank you did everything and called on any business that you came across. I felt that I was stepping on toes. I soon learned the structure and was able to work with them and refer business to them as they did with me. "

good,"* Good work life balance options and PTO"

good,Working for Key was a good experience overall.  I was able to work with many great people and I felt that they provided an enviroment to build relationships with team members and clients.  I spent most of my time as a manager and mentor.  I also spent a lot of time performing problem resolution for customers and I was able to build great relationships with customers. I was truly able to become a trusted financial advisor.

good,What I enjoyed most was meeting new business owners and helping them to grow their business. Sharing products they might need such as a larger business line of credit. Helping them get a loan to open a new location. Helping a young child open their first savings account with a jar full of change. I really enjoyed so many of the wonderful people I worked with.
good,"I currently work as a Vice President on the Commercial Banking team.  Companies that I work with have revenues of 10-500 million dollars.  There is no typical day.  My work days consist of working with coworkers and collaborating, calling on prospect accounts, working with existing customers, attending community events, analysis of my portfolio, structuring of business loans, lines of credit and real estate financing opportunities.  Also, I have a focus on healthcare since I spent many years in that field."

good,I loved working at KeyBank! They were honestly a great company to work for. I had an amazing team and wonderful customers. The only reason I left is because I was a lead teller and was only going to be making $0.75 more than someone just starting with no banking experience. After 5 years I felt that I should be making more than that.
good,Has been an absolutely wonderful company to work for the past 4+ years. I have been lucky to have had constant support from not just my peers but upper management as well who have all taken an active interest in my success.

good,"Keybank is poised for the future, forward thinking, progressive and embraces a culture of continuous improvement of both the organization and workforce."
good,Training is an 8 week paid class. Bring a notepad because there is a ton of information to learn. You will have assistance once you are on the floor and on your own so don’t be afraid. Your supervisor is there to ensure your success with the company. You can opt to bank with Key Bank and benefit from all they have to offer as a bank.
good,"I really loved working for KeyBank. There was always room to grow and manager that are willing to work with you to reach your goals HOWEVER the pay is extremely low. For example - Key Bank offers a banker $20/hour to start, where other institutions are offering $24/hour for the same position. "
good,Key is a service focused company that provides outstanding opportunity and benefits to its employees. It is a revolving door of change to stay competitive and ahead of the market.

good,"Great environment and upper management extremely helpful."
good,When the focus was on providing excellent customer service I loved working for Key Bank. When we got a new manager and the focus changed to sales it became stressed and disagreeable between employees.
good,"I’m glad I came to Key,I’ve learned so much about banking and was promoted within 2 years. I love the relaxed atmosphere in the Consumer loan center, and appreciate the opportunity to work from home 3 days per week. There’s also a lot of opportunities for overtime. I wish the medical benefits were better and additional PTO or Sick time would be great. I don’t like that we have to use pto for doctors appointments."
good,Great place to work - got plenty of extra training when needed and was given the opportunity to float between branches quite a bit to learn even more. Management team were great mentors.
good,A typical day at work is easy going but it gets busier around lunch time and before closing. The management could be great or average depending on the branch you are working for.
good,"I retired from Key Bank in 2006. I am sure that much has changed since then.  Therefore, I can only comment on the years that I worked at Key. "
good,"Great job KeyBank provides a focus on wealth planning that is customized to your individual situation and which follows a consistent, disciplined approach.

I developed healthy relationships with my co-workers. I was presented with opportunities to grow and learn throughout my time at the company. I would recommend the company to everyone."
good,Not a bad place to work with the people but was laid off years ago. The decision was made to shut down the entire building after redoing and investing into the call center.
good,"The bank continues to grow and compete in all areas. Viewed as a good bank in the community and takes care of its customers. Good Benefits, Pay is fair."
good,"With the bank over 10 years and I liked nearly every position I earned. Great opportunities to learn and grow. Day to day workload could be overwhelming at times but manageable. Fantastic work/life  balance that made a difference in my life. I had one truly exceptional manager, some that were so-so and one that was extremely poor. Management tends towards hit or miss due to lack of training. A good company to work for!"
good,"The company really gives you all the tools for you to be in control of your career advancement. Whether that is within your department or not, management will help you get to where you want to go within the company."
good,"Worked as an intern in the Technology and Operations program, in Adjustment Operations. Managers were on top of their projects, and were responsive and helpful when needed."
good,"•	Created new trucking sales through leadership, digital, CRM and niche marketing strategies"
good,Key is a great company to work for. They have a really strong since of community & believe that employee's are what drives there company to be the best. The management & work culture is truly one of the best in the state Ohio. One of the things that I would believe that people would be surprised about a bank would be the willingness to help those customers who find themselves in difficult time with the current economy. They are always committed to putting the customer & share holders first. I think this is a winning combination.
good,Strong community bank with focus on the client and growing the bank through relationships with business and personal clients.
good,"Reviewed debit card claims"
good,At first it was a great place to work and I enjoyed making my goals.  Over time they became ridiculous and then flat out laughable.  This is why Well fargo got in trouble.

I learned how to do loans, and was always offered other opportunities to learn more.The manager was very difficult to be around,but the other co-workers were always very helpful and willing to pitch in to get a job done. I cannot think of any part of the job that was difficult,but the best part of the job was getting to meet new people all the time."
good,"Key Bank is small in Vermont but growing. The vault working environment is comfortable and close knit. The downside is that maybe wont last in the state. They had a production incentive when I was there, if you were fast and accurate it was very profitable to the employee."

good,"I was hired at Keybank to perform a specific job.  Due to realignment, the job changed to something I had little experience in, nor did they provide training.  As a result, I lost my job.  The pay was better than average and the benefits were generous.  The higher administrators weren't as approachable as the direct manager of my branch.  All in all it was a good place to work."

good,"As a Client Service Manager I was responsible for the day to day operations of the teller line including sales and service. I was responsible for all branch compliance, record maintenance, and was the primary contact for all customer service needs. I was a manager for two direct reports and performed all necessary functions as a manager.

good,Working with KeyBank was absolutely amazing. The managers were always there to help. The only issue I had myself was advancement. There weren't very many openings for higher up positions.

good,Each day started with meeting to clear up any questions from the previous day and to update tracking of these items. Then we meet with various lines of business to clarify requirements. Workplace culture was that of a large IT department of a software firm. There was occasional stress.

The most enjoyable part of the job was working with professionals who obviously had done similar projects.

They were willing to sit with you and teach you as much as they could before sending you to work independently but even after that time, they are willing to answer any questions you could have.

The company is headed into new directions which include more sales. This could be good or bad. Insurance is expensive but it’s coverage. 401k is excellent with 6% match. However work becomes repetitive and customer service in banking is tough. You have to leave work issues at work and not take the frustration home with you.

Depending on the Lean or analytics tool the team is using, we are reviewing what the Voice of the Customer focus groups are saying or we could be looking at our performance metrics for root causes to performance concerns. Included in the team sessions are just in time training for Lean or data analytics as appropriate. The hardest part of the day is the teams have not received full training so it is taking longer to scale than anticipated. The most enjoyable part of the job is to attend sponsor meetings as those I am coaching present improvement ideas, are succinct, able to articulate the problem, improvements and achieve approval to move forward."

I would recommend this place."

I have been working in it, the banks are trying to give the customer all these alternatives of banking 24 hrs. a day, which means in some cases, no one coming in the branch.

good,"My manager was awesome and I really like working st keybank. The hours are great, the pay is good. I would say the stress of your job depends on the manager you get and what branch you work for. A part time teller doesn’t have much responsibility so it’s pretty chill."

As the banking world changes the biggest challenge is seeing clients in the branches.  Through outreach in the community and networking this has become an easier task.

good,Again interacting with people is important and this allowed me to continue this.
good,"• Monthly preparation of client financial reports for analysis of actual results as compared to forecast, plan and previous year."
good,"Key is swiftly moving to a client focused culture, meaning they are making decisions from the clients perspective. Operations is still going through a complete make over. The goal is to streamline all processes and to shorten the time that clients must wait for answers to problems.  Bankers use a financial wellness platform to ask specific questions when building client relationships. The ratings that clients give about their experience, are actually used to rate the Bankers performance. Key is investing heavily into digital banking and leading the industry in how to best satisfy the clients desire to do banking. The reality is, these changes included job elimination, branch closures, realignment of back shop support, and new partnerships. If the market pressure makes it too difficult to grow revenue, then what is left, is cutting expenses. Long term employee are taking the hit as Key looks for fresh talent to build this new culture."

good,The work day is pretty nice. Morning huddle followed by opening the branch. It can be hard to produce and handle the load of customer service but overall it is a nice bank to work at.
good,Company unwilling to spend $ needed to make significant advances (e.g. tech). A lot of ppl who work there really don't care if the company does well or not. They don't pay you nearly enough and hard work / results are not really rewarded.

good,This companies values and culture were great. The management often moved us around because we were short staffed at certain positions.
good,"I would come into staff meeting with the supervisor.  I would relate the information to the staff.  It would be my job to motivate them to get the backlog done quickly.

good,Served as a Systems Analyst working in the Production Support area for a Trust system as well as a Securities Lending system.
good,Created and wrote DR plans for the corporations 700 some cumputer system allowed me to gain knowledge in areas of the bank that I would have had no need for contact with.
good,Worked in a very fast paced enviroment. Had to make a certain quota each day.
good,Calling and emailing my potential and current clients is big part of my success. Working with my branch partners to uncover ways to help clients save money is part of my day as well.

The hardest part of the job is that if there are problems throughout the day, you are required to stay until completed."
good,It is exciting when you go to work. specially when you get great referrals!
good,Fraud Department was repetitive. The hardest part was working in a cubicle.
good,"A typical day at work would mean lots of work and deadlines to complete. I learned how to be detailed oriented and stay focused on deadlines in the middle of changing lanes.

good,Key bank was a great place to work but I was a on call teller and the hours were just not that great. Other than that it was a really fun job. If the hours were better I would have likely stayed.
good,"2 weeks paid vacation. "

good,"Dynamic and engaging environment; guidance and training provided, but emphasis is on the individual to determine their career course and development. Focus is on the client and providing best in class service."
good,"Good salary, attainable goals, most managers are unfortunately hired from the outside, tough to attain jobs in outside lines of business but it is possible."

good,"The management team in the Loan Services Department (CC&R) is very supportive and encouraging. They are always asking how they can help you grow in your current position and beyond. It's very fast paced and stressful, but management works hard to make sure everyone is recognized and rewarded for a job well done. They look for ways to make the workday more enjoyable and ask for feedback from the employees. The company regularly has fun activities for all of their employees and they encourage/participate in many charitable causes. For the first time in many years I dread the morning rush hour traffic more than walking through that door at my place of employment in the morning."

I learned that you can not hide anywhere when a company wants to find you to reposes the vehicle or make payment arrangements for that said vehicle Management was great the Supervisor Vickie Voller was the best supervisor that I have had to that date. Work place culture team spirit, example your having trouble trying to close client a more experienced consultant will assist and get that client to see the right thing to do.

The most enjoyable part of the day, is when you can make payment arrangements with client and they keep them to completion  of the loan."

Although I was not at one particular branch regularly whoever I was working with that day we got along as if I was a regular teller at that branch. I most enjoyed the interaction with clients while working as a teller, The hardest part of the job would have had to be the busy lunch time at some branches where it was only one teller and a line out the door."

Hardest part of job was performing the Securities related functions which were not my preferred job task, and needing to leave to return to live closer to my extended family. Most enjoyable part was the employees and the Private Banking/Wealth Management customers."
good,While working with Key my Father became ill. Key was very compassionate and patient with my time off and returning to work. The management team and staff were so supportive during my time of grief.
good,Key is a company that has a terrific benefits and life/work program. My only problem was that Key was freezing salaries and downsizing when I left voluntarily. I should have tried to get back in.

To date, the greatest career decision I ever made."
good,"Lots of career advancement for most people.  However, they are quick to keep adminstrative assistants in admin roles instead of helping to advance them."

good,I went from working in the micrographics department developing film and creating microfiche to working in the Information Security Tech department. I was in charge of monitoring the system for employees miss using the areas they did not have access to.

Begin answering calls and answer any questions and/or concerns they may have about their account(s) and/or card(s) (i.e. Credit, Debit, etc.). Main form of communication throughout the call center is chat room for the teams so no one generally comes to your desk if you have any questions or concerns. However, the staff is fun to work with and management is very supportive and offers advice if you need assistance servicing a client. You're average handle time per call is monitored and how close you stick to you're work schedule for each day. It can be stressful if you're not used to working in a fast-paced call center environment and sometimes the clients can get to you if they're angry or upset and yelling on the phone. It was really interesting learning about how banking works and about the different policies they have."
good,I never had a bad experience working here. when the company was first Niagara they would buy us lunch all the time they would play games they would make work enjoyable everyday. If you had any kind of problems the management team would always try to help you in any way that they can.

good,"I really enjoyed my time at Key Bank. All my coworkers were excellent at their jobs and truly wanted to get to know you and create a work place bond. Everyone was very helpful and tried to help you as much as they could. Challenged enough to keep the job interesting, but not to the point where are you are overworked. Mostly handled transactions with customers and referred them to relationship managers if they had questions I was not able to answer. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry clients, but the most enjoyable part of the job was the great team I worked with."
good,This was interesting.  Key Bank was reducing their workforce and i was there to help train the off shore staff on how to support the call center applications.

good,"Key Bank is a great place to work for. The environment is great and the pay is great for not having a degree.  It provides great opportunities for advancement.  Management is very nice and very helpful.  Coworkers are really great too. The hardest part of the job is with the economy being what it is most jobs are being condensed into one person doing about four positions. It is a lot of work but since the pay, people, and environment are great it is worth it to work through it."

I believe Keys culture truly promotes the well being of those who work hard, but also provides the flexibility for those days where “life happens”. I am happy to work for Key because I know other company’s would not value my work as much."
good,"A typical day is to come in, you have five minutes of read time (emails, work instructions), log into your system and take calls. If you work eight hour shifts you are provided with two 15 minute breaks and you can choose from a 30 min-1hour lunch. the longer your lunch, the longer your shift is.

They always gave encouragement in any situation. The customers were like family!  a typical day at work would be come in and assist your customers, make daily calls, go to lunch come back and repeat. The job was very easy and relaxing. The hardest part of the job was coming back to work after lunch because you are so full from the wonderful lunches that the manager or customers provided.. lol The most enjoyable part of the day would be when I greet my customers and can help guide them in the right direction regarding their finances and sometimes even their personal lives. I really can honestly say that the real hardest part of the job was when I resigned to relocate to another state and there was no Key bank to relocate to. That was very disappointing. If I ever move back I will definitely be going back to Key Bank. I miss them so much!"
good,KeyBank is a great place to start and grow into a role that will define your career.  I started with an entry level position and was quickly promoted as they saw my potential early on.
good,"A typical day at Key involves processing customer transactions, maintaining good relationships with clients, and doing office type work. This means a lot of forms, calling on clients who have over drafted, suggesting new products to clients when they are at the teller line to try to transition them to the bankers, and many hours on your feet in front of a computer. You have to comply with federal regulation working at any bank, and that means that there is not so much flexibility on how you can solve a problem for clients when something goes wrong. You need to have the ability to break bad news to someone with a good attitude. "

On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams."
