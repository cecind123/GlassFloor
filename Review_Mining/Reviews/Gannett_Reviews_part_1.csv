rating,review
bad,This is the absolute worst company that I have ever worked for. Upper management was completely useless and made working there miserable. Taking complaints to HR was also useless.
bad,Micromanaged by folks who know less than their teams. Very unorganized structure. The job itself was fine - pay/mgmt made it a TERRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!!!
bad,Unsatisfied promises. Don't fall for we care about our people story. They like to rah rah rah then let team leaders and performers go. Is it because we exceed target then you have to payout?
bad,Keep looking don’t stop here they don’t pay well and they offer no job security . New paper is a dying business you will be overworked and under paid they have zero compassion for the worker .
bad,Supervisor is unprofessional and belittles people. Not qualified for job he was given by manager. Work environment is unprofessional. Not given proper resources to succeed. A lot of repetitive movements that aren’t always safe. HR isn’t around enough and union rep isn’t qualified.
bad,"At first, I loved it, then it went downhill FAST. Management was horrible. Always on you about every ad you designed. If you had one mistake, your coach was meeting with you about it. They give you a horrible schedule. I was working 11-7:30 daily and had an hour drive every day. I begged for months to change schedules or teams. Wouldn’t allow it."
bad,"Receiving clerk position, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, Low pay, Poor Management, Inventory is not locked down, numbers are always off. Impossible to cycle count, Anyone can walk in and take parts without recording. This place has a high employee turnover rate. They take advantage of you. This company wastes a lot of money, frankly surprised they are still in business and OSHA has not been called in."
bad,I would never advise anyone to work at this location.  You will be cussed out daily by customers you must meet sales even if you are being treated badly by the customer. this was a horrible place to work.
bad,Very unprofessional. Only concern is saving money and cutting jobs. Safety is least of their concern. Awful benefits. No advancement possible. Very low vaction time. Difficult to take time off.
bad,"The company is a joke, they do not train you and the employees are very rude and clickish. They focus too much on meeting and not enough on employees. Horrible place to work"
bad,Worst job opportunities I have ever had. Management is not together this company treat there employees  terrible. The company needs to be restructured
bad,"I hope Gannets goes out of business for the lack of integrity they have shown me. "
bad,"The work day began at 11pm and it is hustle and bustle until 4 am."
bad,"Suck, low pay and just ridiculous people. Don’t go to this company also a lot of people that’s been there for years don’t have a job they are self destructing"
bad,Company just outsourced IT Dept's. Gannet is circling the toilet drain as a company. Losing more valued employees on a daily basis. Poor compensation.
bad,"Upper management beyond supervisor didn’t care . They openly had favorites , didn’t care about customers just how fast you could handle the calls. They would lie to your face. Walk around and not even say good morning."
bad,If you have health issues do not work there you get 7 strikes if you get 7 strikes you will be fired if you are not a favorite at this company!!! Never again!!!!!
bad,"The management is not good. They need more training on how to management employees. My experience was not good. I experienced racist comments, religious prosecution, and experience the management berating and making fun of former staff members intelligence and availability to complete their task. It was a bad experience. "
bad,I was with Gannett for 5 years and I can say in the begining it wasa great place to work but after management changed the place went down hill..I had one raise in 5 years which is terrible and I was one of the top commision employees...worst job ever
bad,The whole management sucks.  They don't care about their employees.  They don't care that their employees are lazyl and don't do their jobs expecting the rookies to do it all for everyone else.  SCREW YOU.
bad,"Gannett had a lot of potential, but I didn't get a chance to grow and develop within my role as I had planned.  Management was disengaged, disrespectful, and flat out didn't listen to employees, regardless of your status or tenure within the company."
bad,Gannett used to be an OK company until present management took over and now Gannett has become a very unpleasant place to work where you feel unappreciated for everything
bad,"A horrible environment.  You can immediately understand how the company is basically folding."
bad,"yes they will hire anyone as long as you have a car they do not do background checks. You work all year round no off  days no sick days. its to much wear and tear on you car to be honest most of the money you make is really going back to the job. No reimbursement on gas and you stuck with any repair your car need. When you calculate it you really no making no profit. money gets taking out you check if a customer complain about anything. Even if know for a fact you throw it at that house they need proof its not like you going to record over 200+ house to show that you are really throwing it. You have to pay for your own bags which they are very expensive. The job is not safe I had got chase by random car and it didn't only happen to me. Do not provide with LOGO'S for your car.truck come late all the time. This a job if you really cant find a job and you need something for the moment and if you don""t have a life."
bad,"Don't waste your time. The management here is horrible, they treat you like you're irreplaceable, and then when you point our their flaws and want to improve the job. They'll throw you under the bus faster than you can blink. Newspaper Delivery was something I've done my whole life, and in a dying industry, I tried giving it all I could. "
bad,"There's  alot of favoritism that goes on, and people that deserve better treatment just don't get it and they are hard workers. And the harder you work the more you get the bad jobs, why because you don;t have any relatives or friends that work there."
bad,"Gannett is supposed to be a goal oriented company. This job requires long hours, overnight, and risking yourself getting hurt specially when it snows. There are no opportunities for advancement, the pay is not good, and the people are very difficult to work with.  A typical day includes tons of driving in dangerous neighborhoods. While this has been an experience that I've never had, the environment is not a welcome one. As a manager, you work in very close quarters with the other managers, and unfortunately this company does not provide management training or require regular evaluations of employees, making it hard to work as a group. Horrible place to work at."
bad,Delivery newspaper to stores and homes. Collecting the payments from the stores and the newspaper racks. Using your own vehicle. Most everyone that works there is friendly.
bad,"Poor training, poor management, over worked and under paid. Management really does not have your best interests. Management is caddy and petty. Management like to exercise control tactics on employees, they are awful. People resign regularly some don't even give notice."
bad,A terrible place to work. Management shows favoritism to certain sales people and the rest starve. They do not care about their clients at all. A lot of training takes takes you off the street. Must be proficient in Salesforce!
bad,"A failing company kept afloat only by continuous layoffs, vapid clickbait, and cringe-inducing boot-lickers who call themselves ""sales leaders."""
bad,I delivered newspapers I drove 140 miles a night taking papers to stores and putting them on racks I  took pa[pers to other routes to be delivered that was my night
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever worked. Bad management, micro-managers at one time and aloof the next with no support. Hours and days always changed, products continuously changed, company was always downsizing and increasing workload. Getting overtime for one stretch and then nothing for months. Salary did not meet the increasing demands placed on me plus no respect or accolades for the extra work I did, nor did I receive a raise after more than a year on the job. I received a review that was false and misleading. We were furloughed for three months, meaning we were given less hours of work. Pitiful organization."
bad,"Management don't care.  No room for advancement. High turnover rate.  That is why they are hiring.  You can't have your cell phone on the floor with you but the back office, management, and QA can have their phone out."
bad,"Since I've been employed with Gannett I have seen several changes in the business. Declining staff,  office relocation, management changes, work load expectations changed, the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people in the community."
bad,"Expect you to do the job of 2 people for the barely the salary of one. Management(if you want to call it that) never shows up. "
bad,They sale you when you come in for the interview saying all you have to do is do your job to get bonus.   Well that is not true.  The customers are evil.  Supv do not take supv calls.  Training teaches you the basics everything else you learn on the floor(not really).  If you have no patience and want to get cursed out everyday then work here.
bad,"RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN...Unfortunately the Corporate office are unaware of the lack of skill and maturity level of their management teams or fail to address the problems and this greatly affects the bottom-line. "
bad,"Extremely poor management. None at all, just people with job titles. No training and unapproachable for help. Left alone to get job done with extreme lack of communication. Often receive bland forwarded emails with no interaction / problem solving options."
bad,"I enjoyed my job but no matter how much I gave , I never got much back. THey will use you and spit you out. Not a good place to work, communication bad"
bad,My  mornings were good. learned nothing. Management of the first company were great the second company was not so good. the hardest part of my job was learning all my addresses. The most enjoyable part was being alone.
bad,The company had bad management and they tried to keep your earned sales commissions. The company was very disorganized and unethical.
bad,"I've worked in the outbound department and it was the worst experience working for the call center I would NEVER work there or recommend this job. The managers suck and Don't know what they are doing, the managers and leads are sneaky and messy and they start problems with employees, they are bullies. This company is unprofessional and lazy. They want unrealistic goals and pay you NOTHING. They treat employees like trash and they show a lot of favoritism to the point where they don't know how to help everyone. It was the worst place I've ever worked. They are UNPROFESSIONAL!!! Don't ever work there! The supervisors and leads are the worst people to be supervising and leading employees."
bad,"I worked at Gannett in sales for over 6 years off and on. When I first started it was great with helpful managers and unrealistic goals. By the time I left if was constant threats of being fired, not keeping your SFDC current, a battle to keep your job and impossible to make any real money."
bad,This company offers no pay increases. There not LGBT friendly and treat their employees like cattle.
bad,"I hated this place. Staff, upper management, customers. Very unorganized and not very flexible when it comes to personal issues outside of work."
bad,The ONLY good things about working here are your co-workers.  They are very talented folks and you can learn a lot from them.  You spend most of your day changing ads. There is very little creativity involved.  It's a good place to get some experience.
bad,Horrible experience at both a print property & their 'new digital' company which they just laid off 70% of their work force for the G/O Digital side.
bad,"They always changed their name which was a red flag.  The turn around rate is ridiculous, they can't keep people in positions due to the lack of management, fairness, yearly increases and most importantly honesty!  Instead of paying people what they deserve, they will allow that person to quit and put someone in that position who is not qualified."
bad,"some coworkers disrespectful, unsafe, and lazy.  I was a manager."
bad,"Takes advantage of every employee as much as possible. They will misrepresent commission potential and make promises they won't keep. Micro-managed to the max. If you want to be miserable, this is your job."
bad,Company does not appreciate their employees. Overworked and under paid.
bad,No room to grow the company hires everyone on part time tokeep from paying benefits
bad,Managers don't care about the employees and the hours are terrible. They hardly hire any good people. Typical day consist of ten hour days with people yelling at you on the phone. They say you get commission but its a scam.
bad,After 24 years of service laid off and then they hire 3 part timer employees.  All about saving money company has no loyalty.
bad,"DO NOT work here unless you have no other choice. You will be told that you have to work harder and harder every day, but that the company doesn't have enough money to give raises. Managers here are nothing more than tools for upper management, coercing their people to kill themselves working hard for no incentive. "
bad,The Tallahassee Democrat is completely void of competent leadership from management. The reality is that by in large those in a leadership position for the Tallahassee Democrat have been promoted simply due to attrition.
bad,Ownership and upper management only care about the bottom line and stakeholders.  No room for advancement.  Treated as sub-human by Management.  If they are wrong then it is blamed on you.
bad,"This job seems like a garden of roses in the beginning but it isn’t. Marie shows favoritism and the pay is poor for the amount of work that you do. They penalize you for the smallest things, they micro manage and treat you like children."
bad,"I would highly recommend to stay away from this company it your an artist. Management will present your ideas and give you little to no credit. If you enjoy not talking to people all day long and being a robot this is a great place for you. No incentive for going above and beyond."
bad,"Be prepared for daily stress, continually bewildering direction from management, rapidly changing expectations, a ""star"" culture, and feeling dispensable."
bad,This place is a mess. They are doing you a favor letting you work there. They think! They have not given raises seven years. There is no future here because all this company cares about is the online news.
bad,"Gannett USA Today is a good company to start off with. If you need experience this is the place because they have classes in Design, Marketing and imaging. I say stay there at least 2 years, then find a job and get what you are worth. Gannett's pay is not good at all. You've invested money on college or University to get a great paying job. But you get extremely low wages here. Like working for a fast food place. Gannett USA Today lay off people often. Any job is not secure but this one you can expect it anytime. Benefits.    If you are married with kids you can have $478.00 taken out of you monthly paycheck. One person you can pay $187.00 a month. See all reviews from this company. May the Lord bless you all."
bad,"I was recruited under the guise of working better accounts with an excellent list and when I arrived in did not happen.  I feel completely duped by management and no one in upper management seems to care about the situation.  they shrug their shoulders and say oh well."
bad,"If you want to spend your time helping your customers find meaningful solutions to their marketing needs... If you love a management team that puts the client's needs first... If you are looking for a career in advertising sales, LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
bad,"Over all, my experience was awful! Management was the worst, pay raises were never seen by a majority of the ""small"" people, and the company seemed money-greedy. My station hired all young and inexperienced workers, job turn-around was quicker than I've ever seen, and the money budget plan needs to be reevaluated! "
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for.  To make it short and sweet the right hand never have a clue what the left hand is doing at anytime.
bad,"I worked in the Shreveport, LA office selling advertising. Management had alot of turnover who never learned their job. Lots of favoritism and good accounts went to the favorites. No room for growth. Don't do it. Numbers were moved around on purpose so you could NOT make your commission."
bad,Dont ever work here. This job will drive you crazy. The turnover rate is really high that when someone get fired we call it the green mile cause many people walk it but never come back
bad,yelling customers
bad,Horribly mismanaged and the upper management staff doesn't care.  They're familiar with their mediocrity and fully resistant to any changes that may improve the situation.  District Managers are told one set of expectations and demanded another.  Was promised a 45-55 hour work week with time off and bonuses.  Typical work week is anywhere from 80-100 hours with no bonuses and I have to use accrued PTO or vacation time to even get days off.  It's a nuthouse and no one seems to want to improve it.  I'm honestly waiting for Corporate to shut us down. Plus side they're so desperate for people to fill such an unwanted role that they will go out of the way to not fire you for fireable offenses. Downside is literally everything else about the position.
bad,"Major staff cuts, increased workload"
bad,"No room for advancement, no pay raises, Point system on attendance which creates high turnover.Have to come in early off the clock to prepare to go ready.off the clock bathroom breaks"
bad,"good location , nice people but stressful job,  upper management doesn't care about you after the supervisor. customer where just a number they really didn't care that's why they sent jobs overseas."
bad,Made great friends but gannet runs the greenville news ... The management is ran by goofs .. You dont get time off .. If car breaks down they fire you ... If you dont put in 30 day notice they take last paycheck even if they fire you they keep your check .. Over charge for supplies.. No incentives .. Treat you like dirt
bad,"On-boarding process was two full weeks of painful misery (PowerPoints with voice-over reading you the bullets). Hardware was antiquated. Additional tools and resources needed to do the job didn't exist. There was little to no understanding of what advertising is/should be beyond buying media space yet there's a mistaken belief that they can/should/do compete with ad agencies."
bad,The Cherry Hill office is old and in bad shape both physically and management wise.  Upper management straight up lies to employees especially anyone in a sales role.  They lay off employees and march them through the office then try to tell everyone left some lame excuses why.  If you make your goal they will raise it to make it pretty much unobtainable.  Pay is low and “benefits “ are way too expensive.
bad,Moved me across the country to have job eliminated in 18 months!!!  Do not go to work here.  Management changes all the time and no clear direction...
bad,"Call center supervisor emailed me informing the first five days of short-term disability must be PTO/vacation days. And even though I followed her instructions and emailed confirmations to everyone that I put it in, they did not pay me. Something is very wrong when the company you work for does not pay you and/or does not pay you in full and on time. I was an actual employee - not a volunteer. All they care about is hitting their sales goals. Apparently, they could care less about you actually getting paid. When I asked the call center supervisor (same person) if she wanted to answer my questions, she said no. And because of their failure to pay me, I started looking at everything and found out they were overcharging me for parking ever since the day I was hired. They had to refund me more than $200 for overages. And I was not the only person being overcharged/duped. I warned my coworkers, so they could review their paychecks and get refunds where necessary. When you overcharge people that much for so long, it's not an accident. Let this be a warning to you to stay away. I wish someone had told me to stay away."
bad,"I would say working at this company for 13 yrs. They were unfair to csr by far. Never any promotions and always overlooked. This company is for the good boys or if you are in the club. Management is horrible, but the hardest part of leaving this job was my co-workers."
bad,They have an 18 month plan and that plan is to layoff as many individuals as they can and farm the work out to their other facilities. The management was not focused and did not tell you in advance what was happening.
bad,"The interview process makes you think that what you are doing is the right thing for you and your family, like you are about to solve all of your personal issues with this God Send of a job. I don't think so.. "
bad,"After going through several rounds of interviews, relocating to the market, and given promises to have the autonomy to rebuild the advertising department to take advantage of my digital background, I was rudely welcomed with poor training, micro-managing, and no autonomy. My first day I was welcomed by the HR person when I was going over the paperwork and she told me ""I was going to have my hands full. There is a lot of dysfunction here."""
bad,"To begin, I have never worked in such a filthy office and the cubicle is not ergonomical. As an Inside Sales Representative for the Gannett DESC you are required to call customers that have advertised with Gannett since 2006 to solicit recruitment advertising. Many accounts are disconnected and some are not valid businesses; however, those accounts remain in your account base regardless and you are expected to reach out to these accounts to meet your KPI. Most of your contacts are selling to voicemail which, in this modern age of technology, you are required to track. Secondly, you are required to call the same clients month after month after month after month after month...you get the picture. Many of the actual businesses are small 1-10 employees, the likelihood they are hiring is infrequent but you are still required to call. For example, you will call ever doctor and dentist within a market. Lastly, although I could go on, the favoritism is blatant. Managers will give sells to their favorites and are very impartial.  It is a popularity contest for promotion. Upper management has the conception that if you are popular and can sell or at least skew your numbers, your are promotable. This harbors an environment where management has a lack of people and coaching skills but also promotes a lack of sales integrity."
bad,"If you hire in, watch your back. There is so much downsizing in the industry, that a horrible culture of mistrust and back stabbing exists."
bad,Circulation manager is incompetent and treats women employees badly.  The schedule is bad and there are no days off.  They do not prompote a team environment and do not promote based on merit.  They do not give raises but give you more work than can be done in a day.  Human resourses covers up any misconduct by management.
bad,"Circulation manager treats women badly and you have to work seven days a week.  The company does not gives rasies and only promotes employees that management can completely control, not merit.  Human resourses covers up any misconduct made by management. "
bad,"I worked here 4 years. In the end I was working an average of 60 hours a week, bringing home my laptop & working from home while sick. If I requested days off, I was told I had take my laptop with me. Very stressful work environment. New supervisor was hired on, I trained this supervisor but was not offered the position. HR has no confidentiality. If I went to them about a problem, the entire department would find out by the end of the week."
bad,"Henderson KY location.  District Manager talks about assistant district managers and carriers.  Verbally combative and abusive.  Job itself is very easy, but don't plan on this District Manager actually teaching you how, or allowing you do to anything within the scope of management.  As an ADM you are nothing more than a ""glorified carrier""    Routes go down all the time and that is how you will spend your hours, delivering newspapers.  Admittedly, once route is learned, delivering can be peaceful as it is just you and the papers.  If you have no issues with being majorly disrespected and cursed on a frequent basis, as well as continued bad attitudes and dischord amongst carriers, assistant district management in Henderson, KY is for you."
bad,"This job is the job that made me desire to work for myself and no longer be held back by supervisors. The training was fantastic, but there was a lot of micro-management, and the wrong people would get promoted. I had a coworker that had better numbers, and more experience than anyone on the floor and kept getting overlooked for management spots by less productive and less experienced agents."
bad,"Working at Gannett was very difficult as there was absolutely no training on their computer systems. They expected you to be able to learn their system on your own with no training or help from fellow co-workers or management. The management was quite snippy with me from day 1 until she let me go, saying I have absolutely no computer skills at all and I don't even know how to use email, which was so not true."
bad,"Upper management always walked in late and expected everyone else to be early, no care for anyone. You are just a number to them. They lied to employees and treated them terrible, yelling and cousing them out on a regular basis."
bad,Manager was on a power trip. They treat people less than human. It was a commission based job but then took every one commission away and refused to pay for over time hours. Made changes to policies and never communicated the new policies to the employees. Overall terrible place to work. Wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.
bad,"I love the position,and would love to excel but the benefits aren't meeting the rewards. I don't feel that with all I do,I am appreciated. My numbers are excellent and I would want that be noticed."
bad,"Worked there for nearly 14 years. Not bad until required furlough days, 6.5% pay cut and pay freeze in 2009. Saw too many good people eliminated or leave because of cutbacks and unrealistic pressure on sales with little or no compensation and broken promises. Only real support you have is your co-workers. In the last 2-3 years (before my position was eliminated) nearly EVERYONE was looking for another job! Most of the great co-workers I had have moved on to better opportunities and are happy in their current environment. Even those who are still unemployed are happier!"
bad,A More diverse group of people is needed in the Sales and Marketing department. This location didn't have a clue on how to treat persons of a different ethnic  background.
bad,"Wonderful co-workers who support you and back you up, a great deal of mileage and wear and tear on your vehicle-constantly replacing tires and car parts, vacation time available from day one, but you have to use this to get a day off.  Very long hours, there is no end to your work day, you have to be available to email, text, and phone at all hours (company provides iphone so you are always available).  This is a third shift position but you also work part of the day as well.  Very rarely work less than 60 hours per week. Very little time to sleep.   Physically and mentally demanding job, 9 out of 10 nights you are on a paper route along with your management job duties-sometimes 2 routes at a time (7 nights a week for weeks or months).  Great direct Supervisor-is working right there with you, other supervisors/managers do not help unless an absolute emergency, they put in short days with weekends and holidays off.  We do not get any holidays off and no alternate holiday days in their place.  Regular scheduled days off do not happen and no alternate or replacement days are offered.  Salaried position so you end up averaging less than minimum wage most of the time."
bad,"Let me start of to say, the job itself, advertising sales was great. While there were long hours, you had a flexible schedule. Working with local business was very satisfying."
bad,"Low, not livable wage. Staff and management very unprofessional letting personal opinions get in the way or work... OFTEN. Way over worked for the wage."
bad,I worked for my original company for many years and they were overall good to their contractors. But once Gannett bought the company it very quickly went downhill. Sales started falling and never stopped falling so year after year we made less and less money. Since their contractors only get paid commission you understand how that effected them and why I finally left after sales dropped so much that my income was less than half what I use to make. They did not understand their customers for the business they bought and why sales suffered so badly
bad,"Lost my jog because they moved the company to Milwaukee."
bad,"Not only are you left to your own devices as far as figuring out your job and goals, it's possible you'll go above and beyond and NOT get paid for work you do. Not only are there issues with payroll, the entire environment is toxic! No room for advancement. They tell you all about job security, and you come to work one day and then you're told in 2-3 months you won't have a job. Yet they continue to hire temps. Not only did they lay off over half of the center, a bogus attendance policy was put in place which resulted in nearly half of the people who kept their jobs being fired. Then those laid off were offered to ""interview again"" for the same job they currently had at $2-$5 less per hour than they currently made. Management is joke. No one from the site director to the front office managers to work force management help you. Actually getting work force to do their job is a joke, you'd think you were asking them to sacrifice their first born. Management you never see. They hide in their comfy offices afraid to even speak to anyone that doesn't have a management title. As for supervisors, if you're into office gossip and NEVER getting help with assisting a customer then this is the place for you. Supervisors would rather gossip about you rather than help you. Then gossip about you more and talk down to you because you asked for help. This place has so many lawsuits against them it's ridiculous. From workplace bullying to racial discrimination. You name it, they have a lawsuit for it."
bad,I loved my job for the first few years but in recent years they have made structure changes and nobody knew if they would have a job each day.  Layoffs came around all the time and for no reason.  No communication with staff.
bad,This is  the most unorganized place you might ever work for. I have been employed as a delivery driver. Once you start they try to explain the pros but not so much the cons of the place. Every morning i would deliver the paper the truck drops them you get them count and throw. Trouble is they never give the accurate amount of papers so you are always short and when you tell management they don't care but when the customer complains then its a problem when you have already told them you were short. Paperwork is not right you have to double check when someone doesn't want a paper but sometimes they send out a misprint for what the customer is suppose to get but when the customer calls management they blane it all on you. Truck issues if the truck break done it slows down the route and obviously its no back up plan so you may sit waiting for a truck for hours and no one from management lets you know the truck will be late you just stay up at 1am waiting until 4 am for the truck to come which is hours you could have been sleeping. If someone else comes with the papers from the office they always send someone who don't know how to distribute the accurate amount for your route.  Management is a joke they don't resolve any issues you complain about to try to help things run smoother. They also make promises that they never keep management does not respond to calls or texts on purpose. Inserts are always missing other papers its to many instructions as to time of delivery on specified houses and where exactly to throw the paper besides just on the drive way.  Also if you short papers
bad,"New changes are ruining the company and management isn’t listening. Overwhelmed, under paid, and depressing. People were crying on a daily basis. People went weeks without knowing if they had a job or they were getting laid off."
bad,"When Knoxville News Sentinel was a Scripp company it was a wonderful and challaging place to work.  When it was Scripps I did lots of bookkeeping, purchasing and router detail.  Managed and created carrier accounts. The last couple of years the News paper business has slowly been dying.   The attitude towards the customer was terrible."
bad,"You will work very hard with little to no recognition. "
bad,"Port Huron editorial department is understaffed and management has no ken for training new hires."
bad,"Unfortunately, that is all there is to love. Everyone in my department is family. However, the money is terrible and there seems to be little to no organization from department to department. They love to lay off entire centers and sites. They also love to keep secrets that could be potentially harmful to you. I honestly think this job will not be in existence in the next few years."
bad,"Direct supervisor is next to non existent. No training no support and not helpful at all."
bad,"Fast Paced and Demanding, probably several positions that are less stressful, but data is currently really stressful."
bad,"Lack of Transparency"
bad,Start out in a terrible market and turn that market and make it profitable and then for your appreciation they move you to a worse market. Pay is below standardrd. Good go a college grad or early in your career job but not a money maker.
bad,"The newspaper business is dying. If you're looking for a part-time job, and you dont mind working a 7:30pm - 3:30pm shift + Saturdays, go for it. But for full-time? Dont bother. The hours are awful & by now, taking care of the workers is an afterthought. This place is picking up the work from all of the other defunct newspapers."
bad,"great pay, great benefits needs, flexible hours if in school, needs new management, stressful job, non motived work place"
bad,WE were an independent site till we were moved to another site due to budget cuts that's when it hit the fan. it was like they hated us and wished we would disappear. it was like that till they closed the entire operation down. And the buyout we got was a joke but I am glad i was sort of prepared for the future
bad,"i worked there for years and liked the job."
bad,Constant layoffs as revenues continue to shrink. Unreasonable goals make it difficult to hit commission payouts. It is a dying industry with no career growth.
bad,"I applied for the position of Art Director at Gannet in Cincy. I interviewed with hr, and two other people in person, plus one phone interview. They were very encouraging interviews. I wrote my thank yous and sent follow ups to express my interest and enthusiasm. Okay, so maybe I wasn't what they were loking for. But, I heard NOTHING back from ANYONE of these people. Nothing. Extremely unprofessional handling of a job applicant. I now have a HORRIBLE opinion of Gannet management. I'm sure it's reflective of the environment over there, and I consider myself lucky."
bad,It was great company years ago. Like every company you have to be prepared for a company to cut cost. Corporate America revolving door. The management could be a little more sensitive to their subordinates
bad,I enjoyed talking to some of the customers and being of help to them. The co-workers were nice to work with and very helpful if you needed assistance. The computer were outdated and caused a lot of errors
bad,"Plant closed and more closures . Never got raises, people were great. Would have never left but we kept in the dark about the plant closing. Should have been milwaukee closing not us"
bad,"Great company, flexible work environment, fun culture. Management was very motivating and helpful. Lots of potential to grow within the technology sector"
bad,"Many things conveyed to employees appear to be the best for everyone.  In the end, much like most companies it is about the bottom line for the company."
bad,"The company is a great company as a whole but in the small markets and other departments the lack of staff, resources, and training to do well at my job was a problem."
bad,"Poor Management, lots of favoritism, uneven workload, management promoted based on popularity instead quality of work and value to the company.  Promises and encouragement for growth and advancement never realized when helping manager achieve his/her goals."
bad,the company is stuck in the 90's and every which way most of all with compensation is very very low. more work less pay no direction wish they would listen to there employees
bad,"There seems to be a much greater focus of doing admin work as opposed to actually achieving sales dollars.  The fact that goals are based on the previous year is antiquated and counter-intuitive to sales and business sense.  If a business is running a ""one time"" sales campaign, how is a sales person to cover that in the following year?  It's impossible, therefore you miss your goals and that is considered 'strike one'."
bad,"Blood, sweat, tears. I've been through every iteration of growth for this company and just as it finally turned a corner that could have been the very launch-pad needed, they brought in the wrong leadership who are trying to replicate the failing models of Yodle and ReachLocal, nearly a decade too late."
bad,"Enjoyed delivering newspapers, but it takes a major toll out of your vehicle(s). Management is not supportive, you can barely get a hold of anyone, so god forbid you are too sick to complete the job. I ended up getting routes transferred out of my route, which didn’t make sense as they were still in my area of delivery, but my supervisor was retaliating against me which caused me to lose $400 a month. They don’t pay mileage, oh and if you end up in a snow bank, it’s all on you. They don’t do a thing to help you."
bad,Doesn't matter what kind of degree or experience you have. Everyone is started out at the same low wage pay. Not worth it for people who have real bills.
bad,The most difficult part of the job is the hours required to do the job properly.  Long work days are expected. It was difficult to maintain motivation at times.
bad,This company is stressful to work for. The managers take you as a joke and don't to do they jobs. Well there is three supervisors who are great they will do what they have to do to help the next person if they can. They don't promote you only look out for their close friends who has been with the company for 10 plus years. There is nothing to enjoy about this job unless you enjoy being mistreated. They don't give raises.
bad,"My cousin worked there and it was an awful experience for her. She is very polished, professional and one of the best dams sales professionals in the tri state area....Management lacks the people skills to stop the revolving door. Hardworking individuals are passed over for advancement regardless of tenure and ethic, not a place where you can feel secure about your job. Be ready to get yelled at on a constant basis, if you enjoyed being belittled and pushed to your limit this would be a great opportunity for you"
bad,Some very talented people have come and gone from Gannett. Upper Management is living in denial about their print products and won't invest the resources needed be successful in the Digital arena.
bad,"Worked there for about a year in S/E/O. A typical day at work was reporting to a manger who one had less than a year of S/E/O experience didn't know how to manage a team. Typically the last to show up everyday and the first to leave. Providing quality services to their clients in not top of the mind because there are so many new clients coming in the door everyday because of the name. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is that they fired or let anyone go who knew anything about S/E/O because we were not happy giving such minimal service. The hardest part of the job is so much turnover at the company. I wish I had not wasted a year there except for the great people I met working there. If you have a different option take it, G/O  or whatever they call it now is not a place I would anyone to work at."
bad,"Typical, unpleasant corporate news environment where management has staff chase trends rather than practicing journalism. Standard low pay and unqualified management."
bad,....It's a call center.....Enough said.  No room for advancement.  They manipulate the system to count you out of a bonus.  Always trying to find ways to get rid of someone and pay you less for working more.
bad,"The threat of lay-offs and furloughs was often. There wasn't job security. The pay was low, the work hours long, and leadership not supportive. Working with the community was fulfilling and  you learn a lot within your beat."
bad,"I loved working with the people, hardly ever got breaks because always had to have things ready for part time to get packages done for the upcoming week."
bad,The carriers arrive before the heads arrive and wait for the track to arrive.  Sometimes we end up waiting for several hours.  The for does not open until 1230 am even if the truck has arrived and been unloaded.  I do not feel the management cares for the carriers at all.
bad,The nature of the business has changed to the point where Gannett being a great company to work for was reduced to a workforce with overwhelming demands.
bad,"The management is beyond poor. My trainer was fired my second day of training, with that being said, my training was cut short. The customers are old and senile and rarely let you speak or help with their problem. The work environment is like high school with a lot of drama. Managers will send private one on one emails company wide to make an example of you."
bad,"...the company has returned to its old ways. The CEO is absent, teams do not collaborate, leaders do not have the expertise to do their jobs and are not solid leaders/managers. Despite saying otherwise, people and purpose are NOT key focuses. Less and less resources and ever-changing priorities or tasks that have no means to the end. No matter how successful some teams are at their jobs, at some point, the business has to do its job."
bad,"split days off nights."
bad,While as Gannett and USA Today I had the pleasure of working with and getting you know some great people.  Some of these individuals are still good friends of mine.
bad,"Stay away unless you are ready to be managed by the invisible corporate machine that doesn't care what customer service means. You will be frustrated and judged harshly by the local managers who are required to enforce ridiculous expectations, again via the corporate machine. Worst work environment I ever experienced.  "
bad,"A typical work day would be trying to meet production with subpar equipment, always behind the deadline. I learned that great managment is hard to find, my co-workers were left to find job duties as they went. The hardest part of the job was compensating for others and the most enjoyable part of the day was the large amount of down time we were paid for."
bad,"This is where creativity goes to die.  You're expected to work on 30 ads a day, or more so,  you are working ridiculous amounts of OT with no raises,  we are paid ridiculously less than the average pay for a job like this.  Its a poor environment.  No wonder we lost 20+ people in the past 3 months"
bad,Always busy. Had great co-workers got along with everyone. The hardest part of my job was not able to talk to other co-workers when new management came in.
bad,"Recently purchased, there are huge commercial paper liabilities that will hamper any business activities that don't pay off those loans as soon as possible. Undermanaged and understaffed for the expectations presented."
bad,REcruited hard personally - promised the world and resources need to make the necessary changes to be successful. The changes were so numerous and company wasnt ready to hear nor adopt how ill equipped they were for existing media marketplace
bad,"The company is closing its local office in South Carolina putting more than 100 people out of a job, the company started out as if they cared for the well being of its employees but changed to being all about numbers and again are closing the local office as of December 31, 2018."
bad,Staff is over worked and under appreciated. No matter how hard you work it is never good enough. Management is either too micro managing or no communication at all. The only good thing was the staff (not supervisors) helpfulness and training.
bad,"I'll admit, it's a great place to learn the basics of the programs you'll use in design. That is, if you don't already know them, which you should if you'r coming into this job as a graphic designer. The role is very deceiving and they're tell you all you want to hear until you're a part of their team. Then they'll give you no support and lie to you multiple times about what you signed up for. This is a production artist role, at best, with no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Promised raises and took them back due to ""lack of budget"". Management was unfair and picked favorites. Co-workers were awesome but would never go back."
bad,"Place was a joke!! Management was terrible they use fear and negativity. To receive a bonus you may often lose your breaks just to say in""adherance"" Supervisors walk around causing drama  and avoid helping employees who were poorly trained. They treat employees like cattle. Meaning they make it pretty known they care less about a turn over and more focused on replacing anyone with a random replacement . You never feel appreciated you always feel anxious that you're not  saving customers from cancelling subscriptions due to erroneous billing. Good luck getting off the phone in 2 minutes or less with an antiquated computer program that usually lags and sometimes can't find customer info."
bad,"If you land at a well-staffed operation, you'll be fine. Not many of those are left though. Expect little guidance and the weight of a depressing corporate bureaucracy limiting your skill and potential. That said, it's a decent starter job: great job training through Poynter that the company pays for, you get to learn on quality equipment and you get experience with a sophisticated content management system. Great skills for you to take to a better employer."
bad,"Nice office, unfortunately it's closing. Company has proven it doesn't really care about its employees; making money and saving money is all it cares about. The company continues to buy newspapers, hire, fire and lay off people like it means nothing."
bad,Not much to say other than we are not paid for the level of service that is provided. There are better opportunities out there
bad,Company offers below average compensation and benefits are average. Work culture is negative. The industry is decline.
bad,Culture is do more with minimum or nothing. Rewards based on hierarchy not on performance. Work-life balance doesn't exist or focused.
bad,"Gannett Publishing Services's closed the door on us, The stress of not working has been a very heavy weight to carry. 24 years of printing cut short. 11years at  Gannett Publishing."
bad,I answer emails & chats from newspaper customers regarding billing & delivery issues. Morale is horrible because we are unable to effect any real change for our frustrated customer base. Upper management has a massive disconnect with the day to day operations of the job. Hiring practices lead me to believe that they have no long-term plan for growth.
bad,Employees very loyal but hard work is not rewarded. What started as a great job slowly turned into hamster on a treadmill
bad,a typical day involve dealing with customers who received poor service from the carrier in which that make them want to cancel their subscription.
bad,"This was a good place to work. A lot of editors and reporters who deeply cared about journalism, and the community in which they lived and worked. The"
bad,"low pay, no raise in 20+ years delivering"
bad,I used to love my job but the role I ended with a few years after I started was completely different than the role I was hired for. I was expected to do about 3 times as much work by the end of my run as I was doing at the beginning; I received two raises over the time span each of less than a quarter an hour. The morale in the studio dropped exponentially over the last year and I basically got to the point where I wanted to quit before anyone else on my team could because I wasn't sure I could take on any more work; they've stopped hiring replacements for people who quit. It breaks my heart because I loved my boss and my manager but I got to the point where I dreaded going to work every day.
bad,"The company is not stable and goes through lay offs every quarter. They will even let go loyal employees who have been there for decades."
bad,distribution division was run like a old school utility company ignoring future competition from on-line publishers.  The company relied more on advertising than on content creating even less value to customers or internal synergies for innovative growth.
bad,Gannett has too many managers and not enough workers....... hence hard to get the work done when all the managers do is manage.  Also makes for a very stressful environment
bad,"Most days were typical, being a majority of products were printed on a daily basis I learned how to operate the plate room department and eventually was moved to the press operation. Despite the move from the plate room there was not much advancement opportunity as nearly all employees involved in the manufacturing side of printing stayed there."
bad,"This is a good place to start, but you do not want to consider making a career there. Two to three years, learn all you can, and move on. The company is awash in dumber-than-usual politics."
bad,"Don't let the title fool you.  You will be delivery papers when routes are down, and there is always a down route.  7 days a week 365.  Snow or rain.  Management expects it to be done, ""your salary get over it"".  Heard that a few times.  I wouldn't wish delivering papers on my worst enemy. I didn't even mention dealing with the independent contractor work force.  Nightmare."
bad,"Great organization with a great plan but poor execution, unrealistic sales goals and bad management. Benefits are expensive for average employees, great coworkers and clients but difficult work culture"
bad,"A typical day consisted of receiving inbound calls from patients who wanted to start, cancel or change their existing newspaper subscriptions. Management was not really there to help much. Any time you needed help, they would advise that you tell the customer they'd receive a call back but never would. Co-workers were very immature. There was lots of unecessary drama. The hardest part of the job was convincing customers to keep their subscriptions."
bad,"Gannett is a stimulating, interesting place to work. Teamwork is a must."
bad,"Recent layoffs, lack of training, and commission plan unstructured.  Benefits not great.  Negative culture"
bad,"For a corporate environment, the culture is not bad.. however the driving force against the newsprint industry has resulted in something of a negative environment."
bad,"It was a good job for the time being. There is little to no room for growth. Being able to work remote was great. Management was great until they were let go. Its an industry on the brink of collapse and they are doing anything they can to stay afloat. Including ""call parties"""
bad,The company changed so much from the time I started to when I left. I witnessed a great change in how people consumed news and information and I dont think the company did very well keeping up with the changes.  It always seemed we were two steps behind the competition. Over the years downsizing stripped me of all my resources and made it impossible for me to provide the customer service I knew my customers were entitled too so I had to walk away. The pay and benefits were nice - but I found myself working crazy hours and it took its toll on my personal life.
bad,After 10 years with no kind of pay increase they give us .37 an hour.Health care plan is a joke with a high deductible. No real room for advance. All of older employee are just wait to retire.
bad,"And so is Gannett.  Although I've learned a lot at Gannett, they can't keep revenues up and are struggling financially.  They're already outsourcing a lot of their IT dept with people who know nothing about the business and are halfway around the world.  I hope that's worth the lower salaries."
bad,"This place is so unprofessional...the overall company expect you to exceed goals to get commission but after a while, investigate how you consistently meeting your goals. The over company is unfair...one manager may allow something that the other one does not....or may let one employee get away with something and not let the other."
bad,"Gannett was a very interesting experience for me since it really deals with one demographic of customers. These customers deal with many issues that can easily be solved by more staffing or more local offices. It can be a process for a customer to get an issue solved because of poor service and not enough representatives to take calls, which in turn causes even more issues."
bad,"Gannett was a decent enough job when I first graduated. However advancement is non existent, as are raises; and the only motivation provided by management was threats of cut hours or termination. Management wasn't chosen for their positions due to their leadership ability, they were chosen based on their production rate as an individual in a cubicle farm where you are not allowed to speak verbally to anyone including those sharing your cubicle."
bad,"For over 9 years I looked forward to going to work everyday and helping my clients. Now, it has become so cut throat that it is not enjoyable anymore. I feel like I have to sell things that my clients don't even need and I have to justify it. I care too deeply for my clients to just sell them for the sake of selling."
bad,Expectations are unrealistic.  Goals set are not achievable.  Your performance is rated on a team basis not a personal basis. Micromanagement from everyone who is over you.
bad,Multiple applications being used for the same purpose. Too many meetings that did not produce results. Teamwork did not transition between groups. Lack of respect from senior analyst toward tier 1 analysts.
bad,"When I started at Gannett, directly with USA Today 19 years ago, it was a growing, fun and enjoyable environment to work. There was plenty of opportunity for advancement, as demonstrated by my continued promotion detailed in my resume. Over the years, as print media has begun its inevitable demise, the management structure, tone, company focus and overall culture has degraded, causing those who remain employed to become disengaged and distracted by the threat of being the victim of the next downsizing.  It's unfortunate, because as I stated initially, it was once a great place to develop one's career. I'm grateful for my time there and all the transferable experience I have gained."
bad,"i hate this place, they suck. They don't care that you have kids or that you get sick. All they care about is they have ablr bodies answering the phones"
bad,Shortly after starting the company began downsizing right before the holidays and tenured employees were let go in a manner which was anything but professional. Everyone seems to hate their job and has little respect for management and rightfully so.
bad,"Gannett Digital is a fairly new side of Gannett; it was very un-organized and the criteria changed each day; even after you had signed contracts from merchants.The upper management as well as Area Managers, RSM's, Operation Managers were too busy competing amongst each other, as well as trying to ""prove"" sometihng, that they completely lost site of what the initial goals and objectives were. I had to ""fight"" every day to get GOOD deals approved that met guidelines and were important to our community. My area manager was the type that if it wasn't ""a certain color, certiab size, certain area"".... then it wasn't ""good enough"" for her. In response, ALOT of area merchants were offended. I tried to select one star, above, for the management option but it would not allow me to do that. My first RSM was great; she, like I, believed in the community and in presenting a true and accurate product/service; she was ultimately ""re-assigned""."
bad,If you want a good helpdesk job we have plenty in INDIA!  This company is extremely liberal if you are a conservative you are not welcome here.  If you're into alternative  lifestyles it's a great work environment
bad,We were responsible for printing 3 daily newspapers plus other printed products. It was a stressful process with the biggest concern being getting the product done right and out on time.
bad,"Unfortunately,  the newspaper industry has lost market share and has been downsizing for several years.  Many of my friends and co-workers lost their jobs after I left."
bad,Not that great of a place. Commotion structure is terrible. Al'll they care about is calls. Even when you're killing it but down on calls they are more made about the calls. Their priorities aren't great.
bad,"Most of the time very few people were working, the same few had to work the whole time while others watched.  Worked mostly as a team and helped each other out if needed."
bad,"A company who hires over 10 people at a higher wage than giving people who have worked there for years a raise, because they can't afford it while giving the senior workers twice the workload."
bad,"This company has a very high turn over rate, and this job made me HATE call centers, I will never do that type of work again. Management was good, work place good, hours sucked and co workers that I associated with were pleasant."
bad,Employee diversity and fast-paced work environment for simple hands-on approaches to work; there were an abundance of unhealthy Supervisor-to-Employee relationships however.
bad,It was not an easy place to make a living. Employee turn over made it difficult to build lasting relationships with clients. In the beginnning we should have ben given more one on one training with our manager.
bad,"Their customer service sucks. Management does not want to assist you. The only assistance they offer is telling you whatever you have to tell the customer to keep them from having to speak with the customer. They do not treat their customers right. They try to brainwash you as a csr that only 1% of their customers call in with issues but I've seen that it is always the same 1% and they obviously don't care. It is ghetto. The people that work there are ghetto. That also says a lot about their customer service. They are basically just looking for credit issuers. That is their solution for everything. Issue them a credit. After the same person calls and complains 5 times a month they claim that it goes to a resolution team but they never call anyone back. I was even told to not tell a customer how he could save money on his subscription because his new rate was going to be $80 higher. They do not care about their customers. They will not reverse anything if someone messes it up. They do not get in touch with their carriers. To someone that has never had a decent paying job, a young person, or someone with no education this may be a decent paying place to work but 12.50 an hour is not good enough for me. If I wanted to listen to complaints all day and not be able to do anything about it I would work for more money at a collection agency."
bad,"Having a sales background is very helpful.  Having to ability to maintain a positive attitude when a customer is upset, name calling about an issue with there newspaper.  Have to be able to adjust to some crazy work hours"
bad,"Corporate leadership in the past ten years has reeled drunkenly from strategy to strategy trying to keep Gannett afloat. Layoffs seems to be the one common factor with every new initiative. Two years ago it was Newsroom of the Future with assurances that those cuts and forcing everyone to reapply for their jobs would achieve sustainable staffing levels for years to come. Enter January 2019 and another massive national layoff, this time noticeably crippling the news gathering process and limiting coverage across the board. "
bad,"After working at Gannet Imaging and Ad Design Center for over a year I became really disappointed that a company of this size had no clear pathways for advancement or professional development. While I appreciate Gannett's editorial work and find the Des Moines Register credible and important, I can not reconcile this with the terrible experience I had working in the Ad department. We worked around 50 hours each week. My group of recruits were placed on the night shift and within 6 months three quarters of the group had quit. Feeling burnt out, without purpose, and with no chance of moving to work more reasonable hours or receive further training, I had to leave as well for something that would be more fulfilling. Unfortunately, the GIADC does not let designers keep images of their work for portfolios or give recommendations to future employers."
bad,Work environment started with less low level management/coach; Lots of moving from work station to work station as teams developed with increased micro-management and too much emphasis on numbers rather than fixing the communication and training issues between designers and account managers
bad,Only care about making/saving money.  Cares just enough about customers to make the employees feel underappreciated.  Often dangles promotion then gives it to an under-qualified individual because they can pay them less.
bad,The job itself was challenging day to day the people I worked with were varied and enjoyable working on machines and rebuilding equipment was very challenging and interesting
bad,"Gannett started as a great job, but as time went by, it went downhill. They changed the commission structure, making it nearly impossible to reach. The health insurance was terrible. They changed the sick day policy. A lot of the time, it didn't feel as though the customer was cared for, simply wanting to get them off the phone and hopefully keeping them on as customers. I was also supposed to get a raise in April and as of leaving the company in October, it was still never applied to my paychecks."
bad,Large media company grappling with turbulent changes in the print media industry. Great benefits but very complex management structures for each department. Constant struggle with budget constraints.
bad,I enjoyed working for my local community newspaper that was owned by Gannett. But I felt like corporate (Gannett) did not understand the importance of the small town newspaper and they did not recognize the work I did and seemed like I was an outsider since I didn't work in the main corporate office. But I did enjoy working with my local advertisers. Gannett laid off a lot employees and people who stayed was over worked and spread thin
bad,Management is always influx at Gannett and does a poor job of communicating to their teams. It has the makings of being a great place to work as their are many talented folks that work there but due to the company evolving so quickly it causes a lot of stress.
bad,"I worked for the newspaper for nine years. However, when Gannett purchased it from Digital First Media, they reduced staff massively across the board. Many people have lost their jobs and there is little that is handled locally. The managers that are remaining have done little to improve working conditions or profits."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with but the benefits were too expensive and raises were nonexistent.  Lost money every year I worked there.
bad,"Loved the company except that the only the employees with 40 hours were able to be reimbursed for their courses they take after proven they received a ""B"" or better. I was hired to work 36 hours or less that benefit I could never use."
bad,"A typical day at work is me logging into my workstation and taking the first call. It could be a call ranging from someone wanting service to someone complaining about their bill. I learned patience at this company because the majority of the customers were elderly. I had very friendly and warm co-workers who were willing to assist you when needed. The hardest part of the job was the management. I know that being in a call center is very unpredictable. But they did not follow their own handbook and were very unprofessional at times. As fall as the calls, that was something that I was used to with being in the call center field for more than 10 years. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers, they made my day go by."
bad,"Working for Gannett has been interesting, learning, interacting with the customers, giving support to customers would summarize my day with gannett. Talking on the phone and giving informations and helping the customer with their concern or problem with the service."
bad,"This job seem promising when I accepted the position, however once I started working it was not what it seemed. I was put onto the phones in less than two weeks after barely learning the systems. The training environment was good but the rush to get us on the phone was unreal. They clearly do not have enough employees to meet the demand of their customer base, customers generally wait almost two full hours before they are able to speak to you and are very upset when they come on the line. Overall decent pay, stressful job."
bad,A typical day consists of quickly and effectively creating and correcting ads for various customers.
bad,Having the flexibility to come and go as needed is a plus. Many changes happening at Gannett that make life unsettling.  New merger not sure how it will go.
bad,It was my first producer job. I didn't like the station but I appreciate my experience there. I gained knowledge of producing
bad,"I worked at Gannett for almost a year. It was the first time I have ever worked for a call center, and working mostly retail my whole life I figured it wouldn't be that bad. Customers are way more rude on the phone and have no problem using foul language with you or showing off just because they did not receive his/her paper in the morning. The company overall did take care of me and I enjoyed the fact that we had sick days, personal days and vacation time. The people I worked with were very enjoyable and the hours and pay were good, but it just wasn't worth it."
bad,Did not like the company. Poor training. No assistance on call center floor. Met my supervisor one time. Never knew where I was going to sit. Only offered part time. Company closed location shortly after hired.
bad,"There too many contradictions and inconsistencies. Most of the Supervisors were not well trained in handling supervisor call requests, the ones who were adequately trained where overloaded and mostly unavailable. The center in general was not on one accord and this lead to many calls and complaints about billing issues and account/subscription concerns."
bad,They need to work on hiring better management and people that have a background in their position.  Tighten the ship on negative attitudes in the senior positions.
bad,"Working in a daily newsroom was a valuable experience, and I managed to succeed despite the crushing hours, poor pay and daily deadline pressure. I worked with some of the smartest, hardest working people I know. Daily schedule would include editing, writing, designing, assigning stories or photos and approving pages to be sent as well as uploading photos and stories to the web."
bad,"Overall, Gannett has been declining for the past 10 years. It continues to make decisions that ultimately will eliminate the paper in print form, and thereby laying off hundreds of people. Most of the decisions made by the CEO's and higher ups in the company are detrimental to the people who work at the sites. And they keep getting thousands of dollars in bonuses at the end of the year. And now, at the end of this year, they are laying off all of the IT personnel to outsource those jobs to a company in India. Terrible place to be right now."
bad,"I love my job at Gannett Publishing, however, working third shift really does not fit my life style. It is a great company to work for, but you always feel like your job is at risk due to the economy."
bad,"The hardest part of my job was being glued to a chair for more than 4 hours and being held responsible for being off the phone with a customer in time for lunch/break. Management need improvement, you're told one thing but something other than what you're told is done. The most enjoyable part of my job were the activities Gannett did. "
good,Was laid off at 11 years. New President was horrible as well as other senior staff members. Colleagues were great but management was not. Half of them didn't know what they were doing and shouldn't have been put in those positions.
good,only wish that there was a better advancement in this company. Also Job Work/ Life Balance is not great and needs lots of improvements. Supervisors need to be more experencied and better commuctication skills
good,This is a company that will furlough employees in order to preserve management bonuses. That's about all you need to know about their attitude toward the people who work for them.
good,"The best part about this job is your coworkers. The hardest part is the customers and management. When you're hired in, you are on probation like any job. But what seems insane is that the same rules they set for you to follow are not enforced for management and other employees. In training I can recall the lead saying that ""You may see people wearing and doing things they shouldn't. Even though they may not follow the rules, you still have to since you're new.""  It was ridiculous how blatant the favoritism ran throughout the small call center. No cell phones were allowed on the floor but many employees and supervisors would be on their phones on personal calls for hours on end daily. I ended up leaving due to this very reason."
good,Over the course of the time I worked for the Gannett Media Company it has become an unfortunately reality that printed newspapers are beginning to fade as the online news subscriptions are becoming more popular.
good,Work was good but great training with the job. Goal was hard to reach and sometimes unrealistic. would not recommend for friends or family to work there.
good,mrg had an attiude they showed favortisem to people they never understood when someone would have to leave cause of an emergancey
good,"All you need to know is that unless you are in a very senior position and no one else can pick up your work load, you will most likely get laid off within one year. They cut 20% of their work force virtually every quarter."
good,"The job was exciting and fulfilling, however, management was not open to new ideas and cultivating a quality work environment where employees could work in a fashion that felt as if management trusted in the competence of the empoyees."
good,"While employed at Gannett, the company treated me good but the pay was horrible. I was responsible for setting clients up to get the newspaper and selling them on getting the paper as opposed to using the internet, ect. There was not much room for improvement and we were required to work 4 hours every Saturday without a break."
good,There's not much room for growth. A lot of turn overs and plenty of lay offs/downsizing.
good,Busy morning that slows a little after lunch. Great co-workers who are always willing to help out.
good,I was a contractor for a new months at Gannett. They company had very rigid structure but it was not bad at all. My only gripe was they did not treat contractors as well as full time employees
good,"Working at Gannett was stressful. The staff was unprofessional and Bias. Managers,Supervisors always picked and choosed their favorites. I went in and made my money and went home."
good,The newspaper is a dying company. There was very little room for advancement. I worked at several different warehouses hoping for different results but the same result at each location
good,Turnover at this workplace is horrible. Never felt like one of the group. Thrown right in and expected to get max results from customers that didn't even know who was contacting them.
good,"A productive was taking over 300 calls per person, and meet the goal so we could wear jeans instead dress pants, so we were taking call after call, and also we did our best to make all the sales we could by meeting customers needs."
good,You get what you make of it here. It seems you're either made for this job or you aren't. You are quickly thrown onto the phones without being properly trained to assess what needs to be done in certain situations.
good,"I was here a few different times and the best experience was the initial one in NJ, coming to AZ, it all went sideways, my first mgr at the paper was a total nut, natch they demoted her within 2 weeks of my resignation."
good,Lacking in care for the underdogs who live paycheck to paycheck but work the hardest in the company. CEO makes rash decisions. Not given appropriate working tools to get the job done.  Changes made greatly impact our work yet we are the last ones to know.  Lack of adherence to policy and procedures.  No backbone to stand ground on deadlines.  Lacking in clear definition of responsibility.
good,"During my time at Gannett I had the opportunity to work with so many amazing people. People who are sincere and genuinely care about one another.  I've supported incredible women in power who I respect and trust wholeheartedly .Through the furloughs, turnovers, layoffs, reorgs and company splitting the people are the main reason I stayed with Gannett."
good,"I worked for this company for 2 years and never had even one day off, it was work, work, work and when you even thought about asking for a day off be prepared to be told ""No"". Forget having sick kids or yourself being sick, Oh well! Other than that it was okay, laid back environment, decent bosses, nothing to boast about though,"
good,"I didn't see any room for growth. I gained little job training, Therefore I wasn't successful with the company because I wasn't prepared."
good,Management is completely aloof to the direction it wants to go. I've learned to be self sufficient and understand that CHANGE happens daily. Transparency is as clear as mud.
good,"YNC was a great place to work. Not easy, but challenging. I was able to stretch and grow. It was very sad to hear that my job, along with many others, would be cut."
good,subscribers are very passionate about newspapers. sometimes feel helpless when we try to promise something that we don't know if going to happen
good,work place environment is very relaxed. there is no in house or external training. there is no motivation to succeed at work. the culture does not encourage employees to grow towards productive efforts.
good,"A typical day; stressful assignments, was challenging at times."
good,The nature of our work in the Content Production Center and our place in the production of newspapers is such that we have no incentive to value our work because we receive almost entirely negative feedback from the upper echelons in the chain of command. Any positive feedback is generalized and insubstantial. The workload can be unrealistic at times and the distribution of work is consistently uneven. Local management invests little in office morale and particular supervisors blatantly neglect tasks and shirk responsibilities onto other team members.
good,"Gannet Co Inc recently merged so there is not enough information to give on the workplace culture, and what the most enjoyable part of the job would be for future workers as it all is about to change."
good,I learned to be a very good independent manager with little supervision.  I knew what my job was and did what was expected.  I was efficient and reliable.
good,you can come into the building anywhere from 10 pm to typically 3 am.  If you arrive late you need to contact a manager on duty to let them know you are on your way.
good,Very dull place to work. Half of the building is shut down. They only allow employees to use one restroom. No sunlight. No informational meets to keep you up to date on new accounts so you have to lie to customers.
good,"The ability to be able to work from home gives me the flexibility to move back closer to my mother as she ages. I am her only child, so it is important to be there in her time of need."
good,"Nice place to work. "
good,Its like starting a new job every few months. Constant turnover and reorganization. Culture is temporarily good until something else changes. Management is not top level for such a large media company and micromanage instead of seeing the bigger picture and nurturing top talent. A lot of challenges and helps you learn to get through major obstacles and adjust to constant change.
good,Sales diminishing monthly with unreasonable goals in correlation. A recent change in product  is causing a consistent decline in sales potential. Goals are based on the sales performance of a product which is no longer sold.
good,"Was on the print / newspaper side -"
good,"This company is really big. There is no advancement available and it is unclear of what is in the companies future for position opportunities as everything is becoming remote or eliminated. Very micro managed, not a ""fun"" environment"
good,"No room for growth. The ceiling is very low. Gained great relationships, but nothing more than that. That is all I can say."
good,The attendance policy needs to be revamped but its a job and it pays the bills. I wish the attendance policy was a lot different
good,"The overall company morale just seems to be nonexistent. A lot of good, talented people have left jobs due to management."
good,"This job gives a lot of benefits and experiences, have a lot of great team efforts with easy working environments. However this job do have a downfall to it and it is management. There is not any hard part to the job and the most enjoyable part of the job is that all the employees including the temporary workers get along."
good,"Nice place to work.But not too challenging as I wanted. Great experienced with my colleagues, especially their hard work and team spirit and co -operation I enjoyed with them."
good,"Working in a large company is what it is. It's great some days, not so great on others. People that stay do it because they love it. If you love it enough, you'll be fine."
good,"Prepare and design ads for Gannett’s various newspapers. Had freedom on the layout and design of the ad. Effectively multi-tasking by managing multiple programs simultaneously, such as Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator."
good,"I had a lot of good times, meeting people and taking me to parts of the state that normally i wouldn't have gone. I kinda made made my own schedule based on product arrival. Management was very lacked, but it was only because I knew my job, in and out, so they dependent on me to get the job done, and I did. Most of the time my supervisor didn't even have to come to work, because he knew there's was nothing I couldn't take control of."
good,Easy Job poor management . Customer service is not the issue it is the no follow ups with publications which lead to irate customers. So there is really no resolve to carrier issues.
good,"Starting out Gannett will hire just about anyone that knows the basics of design (InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop). You have no negotiation in salary - either you accept the job or walk. Just a couple years ago when you were hired you received $12/hr. Now you'll be offered $14, but if you were hired before, your pay doesn't get matched. Raises are a joke if you even get one. The highest raise I've come across, regardless of how well you are at your job, was $0.25/hr. The average pay for Indianapolis in this line of work is $17."
good,"My first management staff was a dream come true.  Laid back and very supportive.  Then they were all let go as this business is being snuffed out by online.  Too bad as it was a great paying job with m-f & 9-5. Once they laid off everyone, it was a nightmare to work at with unreasonable expectations and a traveling management staff who oversaw 3 separate papers and were very hands off in helping anyone succeed with the outrageous goals set."
good,"Working day and night (Company had only 2 shifts).  Continuously called in due to skill set even though 10, 20 and 30 year men worked there.  It was an honor to be so desired and needed, although, days off, vacation and even honeymoon was interrupted."
good,Fast moving office and culture great for new grad or millennial worker. Fantastic place to learn new technologies and gadgets for the multiple digital platforms.
good,"This was a very unorganized place, they are definitely looking for the person who will work for the least amount of money to do the most amount of work."
good,Was like getting paid to work out. Enjoyed most of the people that I worked with daily. Enjoyed solving problems as they occurred. Hardest part of the job was having more bosses than workers.
good,"Not pleased with the management or how they handle thier employees, people with longevity in the company are poorly honored for thier achievements."
good,Overall Gannett is a good employer. Ultimately it will come down to your position and who your manager is. The workload can determine how you like your job and how long you will want to stay.
good,"Great group of talented folks. I assist all of the Account Executives with strategy, developing effective presentations, and closing sales. I'd say there could probably be more ""remote"" days incorporated into my schedule, but that's just not the culture developed here."
good,"Assisted with starting accounts and processing payments, documenting subscriber complaints and compliments and saving accounts from closing. Answered questions about billing, including updating subscriber addresses, credit card information and etc."
good,"The good thing about this company is the sales commissions.  Speaking with the customers about the product came naturally.  Taking the challenge of the contest any particular day, to do my best to achieve or exceed the companies expectation."
good,"Hunter's position"
good,"When working here, you definitely need to check your commission sheets. They are almost always wrong, but management does correct them. Not a very professional environment. Co-workers were great. It is a more relaxed, low stress work environment."
good,Selling advertising to customers. Current retails sales manager is now director.  She played favorites and if you did as she wanted you moved up. Most staff are gone. The chosen ones are still there.
good,Much of my work is independent. The company provides the product in a efficient and timely manner to allow me to handle my daily obligations to my customers.
good,Gannett was a good opportunity for a person in the customer service field. It was an extremely high stress job which is great for teaching one patience. The most enjoyable part of the job was the communication and adaptability. The hardest part of the job was the constantly changing rules and operating procedures.
good,place was big and not that clean. thay had a lot of work they would got out every day
good,Gannett offers production experience that would be hard for any graphic designer to come by. I've learned how to speed up my designing while still turning out a quality product.
good,"Opportunities to learn are available.  Usually a low key atmosphere.  Teams are dispersed through multiple locations, making inclusion difficult at times."
good,"I enjoy working at my company, the creativity freedom and coworker relationship is excellent. Although over the past 5 years I have not had opportunity to advance my career and more and more responsibilities get thrown my way with out pay raise or sort of growth development."
good,All depends on what job you have...shrinking industry but they try hard. Its complicated lots of change. High turnover. Lots of new structure consistently put into place.
good,"The company does provide a very laid back culture. However, they are constantly changes ideas and never keeping up to date on sales training with products. They simply say ""here is a new product, talk to customers about it"" without properly training employees on the topics. Management always has some sort of excuse as to why they haven't yet or when they might do something yet nothing ever comes from these statements."
good,"My number 1 complaint is the fact that we are not properly trained. However, I learned from this position. It looks GREAT on your resume! "
good,This is a good place to work if you want full benefits. Paid time off was one of the best features of this company.  Even part time workers were granted a week of PTO.
good,"Job could change in a moment. Learned a lot on the run. Good mix of personnel.  Produced a good product. Ended too soon. Lots of hard work, cleaning. Many electronics."
good,"It was a newspaper environment and I was responsible for developing and maintaining new business with local business and it was my job to contact and then inform them of the wonderful opportunities that advertising in the local paper can provide for their business.  I was there every step of the way from beginning to end. The design of the ad was my main focus , I was in constant communication to make sure that the client was very happy."
good,"Management was very disconnected in all facets from the sales staff.  However, the commission structure was fantastic an the respect for the brand was very much intact, which I respected."
good,"Decent entry level job."
good,If you are looking for a fast pace sales job its a great place to be. the people are like family and very helpful. The management is ok as long as you make calls you can see a pay check with results.
good,"Although challenging, Gannett was not a company that I would recommended someone to work for.   A typical day involved many needless conference calls that took away from the work at hand, which had very tight deadlines.  The management was acceptable, yet stressed as well. The most difficult part of the job was handling the tight deadlines, especially if they were last minute while traveling.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning Social Media advertising."
good,"Worked here for an opportunity to advance. The company offers great benefits, but rarely does the management want to see you advance if you don't work in a certain dept."
good,typical call center job they harass you abt call times and only pay you pennies on the dollar for the work you do but the hourly is decent enough I guess
good,"Fortunate in that I had a strong, smart manager.  Not everyone does.  Gannett is like many large public companies in that shareholders come first e.g., keep costs low, lots of reports, top-heavy, slower to react than one might like."
good,"Gannett has a GREAT sales program and provides vital industry experience. It's very ""Corporate"" and sometimes that got in the way of being able to excel."
good,"As a digital desk producer, I engage readers through social media and the newspaper's website. I post stories and promote them. In the evening, I copy edit the entire paper and aid designers to create effective designs."
good,"I enjoy the job overall, however, the company is not great to work for. There is very high turnover...in my opinion this is related to poor management, terrible insurance and a company that is not 'family friendly. I personally would not recommend working for this company, or at least the National Shared Service Center located in Fishers, IN. Just an example of the high turnover....we have lost 5 employees (in our department of 10) just in the last 2 weeks. "
good,"A typical day at work includes multitasking in a fast paced environment, providing support and customer service, problem resolution, decision making and management of both on site and external locations and employees.  "
good,Gannett is a well respected company and a good opportunity for anyone coming out of college. I've been in sales for 11 years and I'm looking for oppotunities that better utilize my sales experience.
good,Do your job well and you will not be a statistic in the turnover rate! :)
good,A typical day is 35-40 calls to your current and past clients. A meeting every morning or at least once a week to discuss strategies and improvements.
good,"It was a great career in the beginning, but, the development of the business, re-organizations (I was there for over 4 enterprise placement shifts), it became a place that didn't seem to care about it's employees' well-being. There were so many layoffs and now a merge that too many of my colleagues were being cut out. My job evolved into something I did not enjoy doing, and the management team, VPs and Directors are having a hard time keeping up with what they are tasked to do also. The team became such a mess that most of us did not who to go to for what purpose anymore."
good,"My ADM was a snake , changed my mileage pay ! That's just one of the things that was done  since I stood up to her about her being  untrustworthy. It's sad cause I like my job. I'm not the first this has been done to there are 4 others that have been done like this the ADM needs to go."
good,This company is pretty average despite being centered in a down trending print industry that has many layoffs and position attrition. There's still a lot of ...
good,I think the job is good for someone who don't like to work with crowds of people. You can come to the warehouse and bag your papers there if you choose. Or get your paper and bag on the go.
good,They were good to me bc I missed a lot of days and had to leave early quite a bit due to personal/ medical reasons and they didn't fire me. The part time employers get 401k but not as good of benefits as full time such as health ins. Etc.
good,good place to work at. atmosphere is laid back and everyone is friendly and helpful. we had monthly meetings to go over things that needed to be improved or new items.
good,If you don't mind getting up at 3 every morning every day of your life then this is a good job for you. The only thing is that they are trying to phase out the carriers and all the customers will be getting the newspaper on the computer.
good,This job was stressful but offered great benefits and commission structures! The commission was good and enough to take care of my family. I would not recommend for people that have low tolerance or stress levels
good,The company is in a constant state of change and communication needs to be improved.   Great benefits and work life flexibility.   Ability to work from home.
good,Appeared to be a great place to work as long as you were not in the delivery area of the business.  Constantly pushed to do more with less as the industry continues to dry up.
good,"Great work culture, but could be demanding due to daily deadlines. Great for entry level job candidates but needs improvement in communication between corporate goals and current community markets."
good,The Company it self is a little iffy.. The people are great the managers are everything i personally think if the systems were fixed and give more hours they  job would be alright.. but i dont see it being long term.. just something to get me by
good,Ok place to work. Was close to home and decent pay for duties expected of me. Get a little overwhelmed at times in all areas with transitions. Great coworkers to work with.
good,"Gannett came into Tulsa a robust new player on the scene and I enjoyed the people I worked with. At first everything was going well but as the company earning declined in the Newspaper Division, there were layoffs, reorganizations and generally the morale declined as you would expect. "
good,Decent place to work but always worry about downsizing and very small raises.
good,"independant contractor, so cant really assess the value of the company itself.  the job is pretty easy and straightforward. i pick up papers and drive and drop them off"
good,Basic job nothing bad but you get cussed out over a news paper. You would think if you meet your goals and stay professional they wouldn't stay down your throat.
good,great pay but hours are weird and management is not to good or fair. The commission is great as well and the people are fine but parking is not good for employees
good,Its a good start.  Name recognition.  Looks good on resume and shows ability to support large user environment.  Good clean office space. Long hours not really necessary.
good,Rather boring and dull. For the most part you are by yourself just maintaining the reel arms. Not very diverse in the workroom besides the warehouse. A lot of old timers are stuck in their ways and don't like to train or advance people.
good,The inside sales position was very high turnover with unrealistic expectations. The commission structure only benefited the top 10% of performers. Print is a dying industry.
good,"work was fast paced"
good,Decent place to work. Very lenient attendance policy. Good started pay compared to some other similar companies in the area. Have to pay to park. Good bonus structure.
good,"Worked in circulation, obituary department and legal ads. very deadline driven learned very strong customer service skills, hardest part doing obituaries"
good,"Professional work culture, writers who are well connected in the DC area. Great events in and around the DC area. Diverse staff with multiple perspectives on current affairs, politics and the state of the nation. Nice cafeteria, gym, walking trails."
good,the call center is fast paced and the phone calls are continuous. the management was stern but understanding. they were very informative about your position within the company. can be stressful and very hectic at times.
good,"4 stars its great company but the hours are not consistent as far as 40 hours. This company is great as far as working nights and easy going coworkers and supervisors. there are no opportunities s for advancement working here, however you can acquire your hi low licence thorough training here."
good,"Gannett was a great place that help me gain more experience within the customer service field,  love being in contact with the customers, enjoy providing service and being able to help"
good,"Dealing with customers, doing print order, performing press checks."
good,"I liked the job itself but it was a hard company to work for I enjoyed my co workers and it was very diverse, young and older people i learned alot from my peers and meet a lot of good people"
good,Evaluate and determine the proper preparation of all electronic documents for images and print medial for newspaper.
good,"Gannett DESC is a great atmosphere to be promoted quickly and learn a lot. Everyone is very helpful, and it is a good work atmosphere."
good,good company decent benefits full time is worth it if you live in nashville. trucks run when taken care of. generally when you start your day you preload trucks and then you have down time before the press starts.
good,no real room for advancement and constantly cutting of jobs and replacing with younger cheaper employees.  Learned to master office  products.
good,working in this company was ok not really a lot of people. all you did was run the machine.. the machine (inkjet) woudl put the address and  name of the person the propaganda was going to be send to.
good,Long years ago.  The work place wasn't what I would consider the best.  The papers were easier to sale because no technology.  I moved on to JCP.
good,"fine work place good people to work with. staff was well trained in their positions,desent health care and dental benefits."
good,"some miscommunication"
good,Though the upper management train as best as the can on different scenarios but on the job training is where you will get the best experience in the field. It is high stress environment and the position I held you either had success or you failed
good,"trying to convience customer to start or renew subsciption to the newspaper,Management helpful and co-workers fun to work with. Trying to sell news paper. Stressful but at times enjoyab. Trying to sell the newspaper to some customers that are already taking paper"
good,"Business casual work environment.  Management is very helpful, easy to talk to. Staff is pleasant. Could use some updated procedures to enhance a more productive work environment."
good,The hardest part of the job was finding a balance between work and home.
good,"I have learned a ton while working at a Gannett, a corporation of over 30 thousand employees. The most challenging part of my job is the routine and the most enjoyable part of my job is when a new project is assigned to my attention."
good,"Every day is the same. This is an outbound call center focused on selling employment advertising for both print and online. Call volume is ridiculous, and unsustainable in the long run. Revenue goals are based on what a respective market earned the previous year, as well as how many accounts an ISR has in their book of business. However, an inordinate number of accounts are zero spend, meaning they've never actually done business with the company. In other words, ISR's are being goaled against accounts that have never spent money with Gannett and never will. "
good,"Automotive Key Account Manager"
good,"Gannett Company is a multi-media company and leading integrated marketing solutions company that reaches millions of people every day through digital, mobile, broadcast and print media."
good,Working there was pretty good. We were all like family. I will miss them all.
good,Great products - would be better if senior management would encourage/require collaboration between the different business units.   Too political and too compartmentalized - prevents best in class products from being built and sustained.
good,I enhanced my financial and analytical skills while working here.
good,"Assistant Editor of newspapers published bi-weekly. Wrote articles, edited articles and assisted with layout and design of publications."
good,Friendly work environment where there is always something to keep you occupied. Professional setting and up to date software. This job does not micromanage so self sufficiency is a must. You are required to work at least 90-100 accounts per day averaging 450 accounts per week. You must also meet certain goals each period.
good,"Publishing business focused on getting the ad dollars. Quantitatively driven market analysis on the publishing side, however, corporate research consists of qualitative research opportunities. Secondary research metrics drive the ad sales business."
good,"My experience is varied, so I have done everything from copy editing to page design, to deciding which wire stories make it in to the newspaper. I now am being trained on posting items to the Web."
good,A good place to work. They use cutting edge technology. It is a stress free environment. They encourage new ideas.
good,"My job duties kept me busy kept me busy daily and there a verity things to do. I never had the chance to sit back and watch the clock, due to this fact."
good,"The newspaper industry has been good over the years, but people are switching to other avenues for their news. In a panic to try and stay profitable, they have made a number of blunders recently and tossed loyalty to the employees out the window. watched many long term employees walked out the door with not so much as a good bye."
good,"Print publications are in transition leaving an uneasy feeling.  A typical day is calling advertising customers to collect balances due.  The management depends upon your individual supervisor and their experience as leaders.  Some are good, some are not.  The overall hardest part of the job is stress-stress to perform and collect-to meet goals and maintain customer satisfaction in the balance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is team members.  Most are great to work with and the atmosphere is relaxed."
good,"I enjoy doing my job and going to work each day. My immediate supervisor is great. He provides the necessary resources to do the job and allows you to manage your division without micromanaging. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the culture at Gannett. The newspaper industry is dying quickly, and many employees have been laid off recently. Most employees come to work wandering if they are next, including me."
good,With this company what you put in is what you will get out of it. Apply yourself and seek training and you can advance. Depending on the department the workplace culture changed. Some departments were geared towards a fun environments and some departments were much more sedate. Plenty of training opportunity available in the call centers. Human resources were supportive. Worked long days and had flex time which was appreciated. I had many great managers and some mediocre managers that were still learning how to become great managers. The hardest part of the job was the glass ceiling
good,count newspapers load into the trucks make sure every one has wright amount to do route load rider truck with papers make sure monroe papers are good for every route load coupons id papers
good,My immediate co-workers were team players willing to work together for a common goal. This was not the case working with other IT groups. There was an issuewith big egos and power trips. I did enjoy working with our customers to provide solutions and implement necessary changes to make their job easier and fulfilling.
good,Seeking better opportunity for my circumstance.Good place to gain experience in Industry.  Clearly a place that is respected in the Industry.. Great learning opportunity.
good,Overall Gannett is ok to work for. The pay is nice and the work/life balance couldn't be better. The reason I don't like it is the lack of transparency and not being able to work on projects that you are interested in.
good,"Last 10 years were a forever changing often unreliable place to work.  However in the department that I worked there were only a few of us and we worked in a casual environment that was manageable, if not at some time pleasant.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the ever increasing workload.  The most enjoyable was the casual environment."
good,"Smaller facility, where everyone knew everyone. At times it got to be repetitive. Flexible for the most part. Short staffed at times."
good,"Working at this company I've taught myself and been taught so many things I never would have learned otherwise. The employees and management are really understanding and do their best to help wherever they can. However, if you're looking for a place to advance and move up quickly, somewhere else may be a better bet as higher positions only open as senior employees leave."
good,"People are awesome and talented"
good,"In office on Mondays and when not in the field prospecting for new business or holding appointments."
good,"I have always worked in smaller sized companies and this was whole new world for me. I enjoy the structure and how everyone has their place in line. I have had the opportunity to work with several Department managers and was able to watch and learn as the years progress.  All the different personalities has been a delight in both management and co workers. And of course being exposed to may ideas from fellow coworkers has expanded my horizons."
good,Putting news papers is very challenging. Love making things for the population that is useful.
good,I am seeking opportunities where I can effectively utilize these skills with an environment that includes opportunities for advancement
good,"I learned to deal with a variety of personalities. Having to deal with irate customers on a daily basis was a challenge, but it was fun also. It taught me some humility & integrity and not to take things personal."
good,The company is a long standing entity in the publishing landscape. The business however has been going through intense change and significant revenue challenges.
good,I've learned a tremendous amount in a relatively short period of time. Everything moves at a very fast pace because of daily deadlines. Excellent boss and good team mates. Would become a tenured employee if I felt there was a future in it for me.
good,"Worked remotely on a national 6 member L3 team to troubleshoot all sorts of complicated desktop, OS, Office, application, phone and network issues in a 24,000 user population community."
good,"Can be a great place to work; depends on your team, etc.  But they do have quarterly layoffs so it's hard to recommend it to anyone in general.  There are pockets of teams that are hiring.  Overall it is a very tumultuous industry."
good,"i learned computer skills , time management, professionalism, patience. very stressful place to work, communication is not so good and sometimes like feel like no one cares."
good,"At the time I was with Gannett they were evolving from print to digital.  This created some confusion and conflicting needs as revenue for digital is different from print.  Great people, I'm not sure how the company has evolved since I left."
good,Due to working at this place I would not like to disclose any information. This means the job is neither bad or good. Continue on with your search and good luck.
good,"It is sad to see the newspaper industry dying, and I've watched it die.  It seems that local, independent newspapers still have a great environment and are doing great things. Sadly, once a big corporation begins to manage many papers spread over a large area, it tends to lose focus and charm. The industry is killing itself honestly, it is hard to break in because it isn't sustainable."
good,"Working with Gannett has afforded me the opportunity to advance within my career.  Very fast paced work flow, and enjoyable team environment.  "
good,"Very friendly atmosphere with nice people and nice accommodations for their workers. Pay could be better as well as structure and organizational matters. My only reason for leaving was that they eventually wanted me to strictly outbound call for new ad business with an unrealistic quota. It is very hard to sell ads from the phone, especially display ads, especially when you can't see the customers in person. According to employees that had been with the company for several years, outbound calling for ad sales from an inside sales position has never been successful. That is why they have outside salespeople."
good,"Answering phone calls, transfer ticket to other teams, troubleshooting user's issue(s), account unlock and password reset, management is not the greatest.  Hardest thing to do is getting in touch with other userss."
good,"Typical Day - "
good,Great place to start at very awesome dev managers and great work life balance. Ability to learn on the job. Some design decisions might leave you scratching your head but overall a great place.
good,"Good big company, Springfield News Leader. I was just delivering the newspaper / There was not too much to the job so it was basically easy money. I truly enjoyed working there until I had to quit due to the overnight hours and my sons school started"
good,"Great time off , after 3 years you get 25 pto days which you can use however you want, vacation, sick, or personal days.  Pay is very competitive also."
good,"95 percent of the day was taking complaints from customers.  Many of the complaints were legit but company policies as they were, there was nothing we could do to help customers.  Pay was decent for part time work and we had incentives.  Management was helpful and always there to help.  The company was very left and a conservative could not voice their opinion.  The hardest part of the job was not being up front."
good,Fun place to work but compensation in relation to goals lack. Goal expectation is unrealistic in comparison to the total amount you have to sell
good,"Busy with lots of outbound call traffic. Very deadline driven."
good,GPS is going thru many changes and at this point job security is an issue.
good,digital only. print is going out of business so many people are getting laid off. they don't give you much time to look for another job because they don't warn you of your last day
good,"A good starter place to work.  Very flexible with my schedule while attending school.  Great benefits.  Great working hours.  Fun at times, and sometimes hard to deal with."
good,"it's not bad, depends on where you work, at my location it's laid back but you also have to be quick on your feet and need to be able to fix your equipment without having to think about it"
good,Great place to work. But it is shutting down it`s Appleton operation.Management was great. People were great. Learned alot about high speed printing electrical and mechanical equipment.
good,The work culture of Gannett was excellent. It was a fun culture with excellent departments that come together several times a year for events. The IT department was a very busy environment with frequent changes in adding additional assignments unannounced that make the work/life balance a struggle sometimes.
good,"I have had a great experince at the site i was at, i learned how to help customers with the billing and subscriptions. I also loved the people that i worked beside i not only had friends there but poeple that were there to help if i needed it. also i loved the way that they set up to get comminssions every period which i did"
good,This company would be great to work for if they provided job security and promotions. They also do not offer full time to their circulation department and expect full time work. No benefits are offered. And you will never be promoted within the company. I have worked for this company for 7 years and still am at the same pay and same hours.
good,"Learning the routes is a bit time staking,  But once you learn your route it's a breeze. You can get your papers delivered in a timely fashion, you won't have any problems."
good,Learn a lot on how customer are passionate about their newspaper.
good,"5 hours or less."
good,"Good job, ok benefits, very to their self team. A lot of phone calls about missing pay for newspaper carriers and a very busy time during 1099 tax season"
good,"This was an easy job besides getting up super early to delivery, and the pay is not the greatest. 12.5 cents a paper delivered is not that much to compensate for the mileage and gas you put money out for."
good,Great place to work and have great leaders there that actually help and provide you with the skills that you need to be successful in life wonderful place to start working if you're ever in Arizona
good,I worked at gannett from 1999 to 2017 great coworkers. Learned alot from supervisors to partime everyone was treated the same.  If it didnt move to Milwaukee id still be there. Very one was treated like family
good,I worked there many years ago and thought it was a good company. I was able to further my career by transferring to another newspaper. I made a lot of friends at work and we laughed a lot.
good,Overall it is a good company to work for. The job is very relaxed in certain aspects. This is a good option for someone seeking a second job for extra income. The management is fair and easy to access if you have any concerns or questions.
good,The DESC at Gannett is a fun and challenging work environment.  Pay is not what it needs to be though. There are opportunities for advancement.  Goal setting for commission seems to need a little fine tuning.
good,"Worked for many years and throughout those years the company kept it interesting by promotions etc."
good,"I worked flexible hours which was great for the flow of the position.  Daily I entered timecards into the accounting system and balanced with the corporate timeclock.  Matched receivers to PO's then coding and entering into Hagen/Monarch Accounting system.  I also handled matching the weekly freight reports from EDI to our accounting system before paying.  I entered all expense reports, invoices and payables to prepare the weekly check run.  The corporate P-card statement was sent to me daily for reconciliation and payment.  I enjoyed the busy flow and good working relationship with my co-worker in Accounts Receivable.  The hardest part of the job was watching the company prepare for shutting down and having to walk away without finishing up month end.  Corporate handled and switched out of systems we were using.  This position gave me more experience in learning a different accounting system, payroll and financial reporting.  I feel this will contribute to my next position."
good,It's ok former manager was great current manager ok.  Nothing much more to say about it other than it's ok.  Great coworkers but that's about it.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is getting breaks in between jobs.
good,"There are parts of the job you will and wont like. "
good,A typical day at work would be making over 100 calls a day trying to sell the enquirer. I learned how to deal with people problems and all types of different people. Management was good at Gannett. They worked with everyone and they gave us prizes for accomplishing goals.
good,"Great place to work, was allowed to pitch stories, explore new storytelling formats. Experienced lay-offs during my time there, and pay was on the lower end. People were very friendly."
good,"I've been in several positions with my recent being a System Administrator for Windows Servers.  I've worked closely with my peers to learn and provide the needed support on and off hours.  I work from home supporting the needed systems, answering phone calls, completing help desk tickets, coordinated with off-site properties in emergencies, attending meetings thru Skype and Microsoft Teams."
good,"Responsible for all sales of Automotive accounts for the Gannett media company. Travel to locations for presentations of all media products including but not limited to print, digital media products."
good,Quick paced enjoyable job. Get to see the sunrise everyday. Enjoy dealing with customers. I got the job after taking care of my grandmother as she progressed through life. Taking care of her was more than a full time job. Best years of my life besides raising my to boys. Only one more to get through college! Life is a joy. I just require more income. I like working as an independent contractor/ courier for Gannett. I just would love to advance in the company.
good,"Working for Gannett as an independent contractor, delivering newspapers,  is a good first job because it makes you be self motivating and helps you become more  disapplined.  Cause your job is done 7days a week ...."
good,Awesome work environment. Pretty easy job. Low pay. Laid back place to work. Not a lot of creative freedom. Pay could be much better considering what we do.
good,"They do a great job of informing and training staff, they have a visible presence on the call floor most of the time. There is the typical office politics, with any job. The mix of management personalities was a pleasurable experience and the employee staff was so diverse it made the work environment amazing. "
good,"It is exciting place to work, learn and grow. I love the independant work atmosphere. I would recommend the job to peoplework love working with others."
good,"As a newspaper designer, your hours are not the greatest. Our studio had a great workplace culture and my boss is the best in the industry. It's hard to move up, you have to put in heaps of time to make the smallest more forward. Raises are small and done only on a yearly basis. "
good,"As an administrative worker, my job with Gannett was fine.  I didn't feel like I did much.  I worked mostly with scheduling and management for the sales team while maintaining the office calls and emails."
good,"Delivering newspapers sounds easy but it's not. It low pay, no time off without having to pay someone and can be very stressful. Gannett does not seem to care enough to keep carriers happy so that they will stay."
good,I had a very satisfying career with Gannett.  They are very forward thinking and manage themselves very well.  The overall size of the company allows them to be more cutting edge than most media companies.
good,I worked with wonderful people. I learned how to problem-solve in a calm and efficient manner. I helped people and developed relationships with customers because they keep us in business. The hardest part of the job was recognizing that the Newspaper business is moving away from the print and onto the internet. The most enjoyable part of the job was discovering how good I was at helping people leave my office satisfied with their service.
good,"I learned a lot but ultimately, neither the salary nor the ability to advance was going to keep me in Salisbury. The paper changed hands more than a few times making it difficult to hang on to quality staff."
good,"USA TODAY NETWORK has a great company culture that is a big reason why it is a great place to work. The people are what makes the company. There is constant talk that if there's a job you want and it is not there, they will create it. Although, often times people found it challenging to even move up within the company. For a news organization with 100+ locations there should be more diversity across their local properties. Some managers are better than others but there needs to be mandatory management training as it is best to be able to know how to manage people if you are a manager. Especially, when it comes to communication and career advancement. Then heart of the company is in the right place."
good,"Great place to work, friendly people to work with. Work load wasn't that demanding.  Upper management could be more hands on with employees.  Micromanagement of job projects.  Friendships."
good,"Definitely not a bad place to work. There are some great people there. But at times, losing your job hangs over your head. Morale isn't always the best"
good,"the company is great, there is always someone around to help if you need it. it can be fast pace at times but overall the workplace is pretty decent. they do a lot for you here. they always have some fun raffles where you can win things etc."
good,"Producing print ads for newspapers all over the country in a fast paced, daily deadline environment. The people are great, the management is organized, it's a fast growing company."
good,Chilled out. Great people to work with. Relaxed environment. good management. Laid back - sometimes a little too much for their own good
good,Great work environment and office space. Very flexible working hours and work culture! It's been a pleasure working here.
good,Enjoy working at Gannett. A lot of customers call about their newspaper account. Nice environment. Helping others that take their newspaper very serious is the most enjoyable part.
good,News and Information provided to Middle Tennessee and a suite of over 160 products that are available to clients in the form of print and digital media advertising.  They can be a one stop shop for clients looking for a total agency feel.
good,A typical day at Gannett was a busy one. The large workload could be difficult to keep up with at times. My co-workers were fun to work with.
good,"I have learned a lot from my daily team and also, I got trained on Ruby test automation. QA teams member are very nice and friendly. Also, the daily team i am interactive with is best team i every work with. Our scrum master is excellent."
good,"National Media company where I managed Sales Managers in 4 states on sales, service, receivables, distribution, training distribution contractors, Partnerships, national and local sales accounts, SCAN sales accounts, Hotel accounts and Education accounts.  "
good,"Went out to meet with new and existing clients.  Serviced weekly accounts, and picked up payment.  Sold new display pieces, and tried to upsell newspaper sales to stores"
good,"everyday was a challenge just to be able to complete this task, the job was in the middle of the night and tiredness would sometimes be a challenge"
good,"I would monitor receivables from customers, making calls for collections when necessary and solving reported issues with mispayments or billing.  I was the main timekeeper for 5 community newspapers, keeping track of about 250 employees' hours, vacation, sick, and holiday time,  Other duties would change as the dynamics of the business changed."
good,During the prime vacation seasons there is plenty of work to do.
good,This is a call center environment and I am required to take over one hundred calls per day on a constant basis and make follow-up outbound calls according to specific customer account issues and concerns.
good,Great company to work for.
good,deliver actions and reporters and journals daily by deadline. only downfall i have to drive for over an hour in the winter
good,"When I began this job I was not familiar with the programs such as APT , AD MARVEL, ADSOFTWARE and Helios. Halfway through my first year not only was I able to schedule in these programs I was part of a company wide transition to a new scheduling program DFP. As a result of the transition I was able to better master not only scheduling campaigns but learn how to become an effective campaign managaer for my four markets."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Gannett, it was, however, cut short due to reduction in workforce. The newsprint industry isn't exactly on solid ground when it comes to stablility."
good,Company is downsizing. When I first started there I reallyenjoyed it
good,The work day starts at 3am
good,Work hours 10 am to 6:30 pm  did fit with my life style. The job itself was ok.  Co workers and management where nice. I learned a lot about appliances.
good,Very few raises are given each year. I think somewhere around 40% of hourly employees will get a raise once per year depending on performance. The raise however is minute. Talking .5%-2% once per year.
good,"The enjoyable part of the  job is meeting customers and providing excellent service. Typical day at work is basically the same thing daily sorting mailers, Positive work place attracts happiness and satisfaction. I love my job because everyone is dedicated to the mission and enjoy helping others. Management shows great concerns  when dealing with something fragile."
good,"Great place to work. Unfortunately it is in a declining industry, that does not provide for job security. The culture and company mission are great make for enjoyable work."
good,Fun place to work when wanting an entry customer service job but managers will blame you for things you were not at fault for and there is favoritism.
good,"The hardest part of the job was working with the other consultants who made more money than you."
good,Nothing to add for this employer. My employment with this company was fine. They are competitive in pay and benefits. It is a dying industry being in newspaper.
good,A fast paced environment that exposes you to many different businesses in the community.  There are never boring days and the people are great to work with.
good,I love working for Gannett. I've met great entrepreneurs and great business partners working for Gannett. The company takes well care of you. Fun place to work. Professional environment. The only downside is job security
good,A typical day consisted of juggling multiple deadlines. The very best technology is provided to employees. Turnover was high. It was extremely busy at times.
good,"Great, if you like working 7 days (nights) a week, 365 days a year. You need a shift off you have to pay someone to deliver your route. Considered self-employed part time."
good,"Gannett was a great place to work while looking for a job in my feild."
good,A day working at Gannett was good. I had learned a lot of needed skills that I am able to use in another job. Gannett was a good and satisfying company to work for.
good,"My day could be anything from making sheetfed and/or web plates, producing various products on digital presses.  ie: Business Cards, Flyers, Brochures, Booklets and Posters.  Sometimes cutting raw material or finished product.  Maintaining digital presses and plate imagers and processors."
good,Love the freedom they give you. ability to work from home. Training for new hires need to improve. The environment like any sales job the pressure to sell more is always there. The good thing is if you are a top performer management doesn't bother with you. You manage your own book of business. Friendly people I work with is a plus.
good,"On a typical day the work was not difficult, I learned how to work with the Integrated Crestron System.  To up-sell and generate mode business was not encouraged.  The majority of my co-workers was a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to be creative.  I enjoyed working for Gannett Co Inc."
good,I enjoy the work environment and my colleagues.  There are many opportunities to move around in the company and great networking and mentoring groups.
good,"The overall company is a find company to work for, but there is an incredible amount of stress related to the position of account executive.  Management is not always willing to consider new ideas to improve the work environment."
good,Excellent experience for entering the workforce.  The media indusry has gone from newsprint to digital media.
good,"I typically arrived at work around 7:30am each morning in order to get all programs and connections to remote desktops ready for the daily procedures. By 8:00am I was clocked in and ready to help solve any problems encountered overnight by the Gannett Production Centers and assist the sales staff with ad production issues. I spent 75% of my day dealing with problems and finding solutions. I also worked on ""home accounts"" by designing ads to help co-workers, correcting any errors I found and providing ad proofs to sales staff for presentation to clients. When approved, I would send final ad files to the GPC. I learned how to use all the programs necessary to complete the assignments. The hardest part of the job was getting the sales staff to send their ad materials on time so that deadlines were met. The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering an ad that the customer loved and met their needs and expectations."
good,"Dedicated employees whose mission is to make communities stronger. Inform and engage them — as an award-winning, trusted news organization, and as a modern media company pushing the boundaries of what content is, how it’s experienced and how it’s used."
good,Overall decent place to work. If you meet or exceed your qouta management will let you cruise. if you don't your stay will be short lived. Overall good place to work.
good,"Just recently got into my new role here. Overall, my experience is so far more positive than negative. Management does give a hoot. I'm not dealing with any manager that doesn't listen nor degrades me. I feel valued in my position by my managers. My role works with everyone in the office but only in the most basic ways as I'm an Office Manager/Admin so I probably can't speak to the nitty gritty of what really goes on but for the most part everyone here is very hard working, fast-paced and extremely motivated as these are young sales people after all. One thing I don't like is how every department is very cliquey. Granted, this has happened at every job I've ever worked at but we are trying to integrate the entire team in the Chicago Office. My two managers for the most part are really great. My one manager seems like he may have a temper sometimes but I think he just deals with stress differently than my second manager. There are also some sour fruits with bad, negative energy here that have worked here for years but that goes to say for most offices. What I like is that I don't get micromanaged but I do have to check in with my managers. Also, sometimes I feel like people look down on me for what my job requires me to do but I think that goes with the territory of the position. We do get weekly lunches and as someone who is responsible for ordering them, they're awesome. We do get discounts from a company called YouDecide which gives discounts on a lot of things. The insurance is average. I've worked in insurance before, the medical is nothing to write home about but it's also"
good,"This is a great place to work, however sales management is unstable and inconsistent.  Clear direction is rare and confusion is common."
good,"No complaints, just constant threat of losing your job because of their constant ""reorganizations"" that never work. It doesn't usually make sense what corporate says but management here in Jackson has been fantastic the whole time. No micromanagement, lots of autonomy, great benefit. Only complaint is company keeps trying and failing to re-invent the wheel. Newspapers will fail, but reorganizing won't solve it."
good,"this is a good job for someone starting their adult life, days free, decent pay, great benefits, not stressful.  I would have stayed longer but it just wasn't enough money for my life but I really enjoyed the job.  I would recommend."
good,Nice place to work if job security is not a concern. The CEO is completely removed from the company and has no idea whom his employees are - definitely not a man of the people.
good,"The work, depending on what you were doing, can either be undermanned with everything depending on you or slow-paced with too many people in one area."
good,"Work well with hours, Management is a lil bad, strict on coming to shift but everything else is okay. Great work environment, no drama, everyone is very friendly."
good,"Laid Back Work Environment, work with scheduling, no micromanaging, work at own pace, needs better pay, needs more growth opportunities, overall good place to work."
good,"Very busy, always doing something, but I thrive under busy, deadline situations, it brings out the best in my work. A big problem, though, is job advancement is nearly non-existent."
good,"Very interesting experience reviewing article before publication."
good,I would meet with retail partners to develop cooperative marketing campaigns.  Once we determined the scope I would then meet with our internal design team to develop the overall campaign.
good,"Great company, great environment, great team.fast paced and ever changing in the world of media. Very family oriented."
good,A typical day at work is come in to office then go out on cold calls or appointments then end the day back at the office. Management will micromanage you if you're not at goal but relaxed if you're doing what you're suppose to do
good,"In my first stint at this employer, they gave me my first shot as a professional. They had good leadership which I lean upon in case of question that arise. Management was key in transitioning into becoming an Account Executive where I thrived in Advertising and Marketing."
good,"Workdays last between eight and ten hours.  Work is fast-paced and competitive...but colleagues and management are courteous and professional."
good,A solid company in an ever-changing industry. Must think quickly and move even quicker.
good,"There is no typical day working at Gannett, we are an assembly line that runs off of a press line. Sometime there are break downs but when everything is running smooth, the line is very productive. The people I work with are friendly and you could say that some consider eachother as extended family. I would say for me the hardest part of my job is the downtime waiting for something to get fixed.  The most enjoyable part is the people I work with, we all seem to work together as a team to get the job done."
good,I enjoyed working at The Newsleader. I was forced to pursue my career in another direction when they started with furloughs & layoffs otherwise again I like to challenge myself in my wor.
good,Good place to work as long as the printed newspaper industry lasts. USA Today was an excellent experience for me. I would return to work there at any time.
good,"Gannett was a good place to work about 10 years ago, when the newspaper industry was thriving. Now with all of cutbacks and layoffs most papers are working with a skeleton crew."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Gannett.  Our commissions were cut, bonuses were as well.  Love the company, manager, etc.  And my team was the best!  I would still be working for TALK/Gannett if the pay had remained the same or close."
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with older customers and finding a compromise that fits into the company as well as the customers, the best part is the ability to grow within the company as well as growing stronger customer service skills"
good,"I have greatly enjoyed my time with Gannett. Management listens to your concerns, there is very little micromanagement, and the culture is open to diversity."
good,I would still be with Gannett if there were positions open.  I never got up stressing about having to come to work.  I enjoyed the tasks and goals that were given.
good,"A typical day consist of establishing and acquiring new prospects by independently  planning and organizing daily work schedule to identify and to nurture prospective clients through sales pipeline for media/ social media and paper advertisement.."
good,Gannet DESC is a great place to work! Your basically selling recruitment ads for a specific paper and attaching careerbuilder.com to each ad package. They are located in the Indy star building downtown.
good,"A very fast pace environment in a 3rd shift setting . One of the things I learned the most was to deal with a problem on my on at a very fat pace "
good,I was able to expand my knowledge base beyond what I knew before starting with the company.
good,"Work was interesting and sometimes stressful, but if you like a challenge it was satisfying.  Management was fair and helpful. Paid time off was great and the health benefits were good.  Attendance policy could be more strict.  Most co workers were easy to get along with.  Dress code was relaxed.  Overall good place to work, until  corporate decided to consolidate and reduce work force."
good,"Quick pace place, non stop learning. Lots of communication and planning. Co workers and management are great to work with them. The are more willing to try and work with you."
good,"Gannett is one of the largest news publications in the U.S. Always forward thinking, willing to make changes as it meets the challenges of digital communication."
good,"Flexible with schedule and friendly employees. The hardest part of the job is the commute if you don't live nearby. Very laid-back, jeans and t-shirt/polo."
good,"Gannett generally provided a rewarding, challenging, professional work environment during my 14 years there, but the company also made occasionally questionable decisions in buying technology -- our publishing software tended to be glitchy and unreliable. Downsizing was a constant threat, as with all news companies. I feel lucky to have worked with an outstanding team of reporters at Gannett."
good,"I deliver newspapers in the early morning.The hardest and most stress full part of the job is waiting for the newspapers to get to me to deliver. I have to out them together and deliver by deadline.Also do not get days off , no day off in last three years, that is one of the reasons plus the fact I miss cooking and working with the public."
good,Progressive and hard working environment dedicated to providing their clients the best digital solutions for their customer acquisition and brand challenges.
good,The people are great. Almost everyone is a joy to work with. Loose organizational structure and discipline can sometimes cause headaches when there are cross-team dependencies.
good,Great work invironment. Wonderful boss. really enjoy my coworkers. Wish we had more room for advancement. Nice stepping stool for another job since you are prepared to handle things on your own.
good,We are a family and treat each other as so.  A fun place to work.  Very family friendly.  I put out fires more than I do my job.  It's nice when management notices good work and rewards you for it.
good,"I had fun in the company, i had learned a lot about Marketing and how to manage my time with clients to cover what they require in calls for the day"
good,"I have no compaints with my time at Gannett (USA Today Sports).  I've made alot of great friends i will keep for a lifetime, learned alot about myself and different work environments"
good,"A job that truly rewards performance.  Shifts, bonus, and evaluations are all based off of the work performed."
good,My crew was well versed in their knowledge and I feel have taught me well. Grateful for the experience.
good,"I started with the company before I graduated school. In that time, my skills have grown exponentially thanks to the constant day to day grind. It's been great to sharpen my program skills and develop as a designer."
good,"Each day begin with talking to subscribers who were experiecing a problem with delivery of our products.  My team was a experienced team and one that provided a great department chemistry.  I learned if you treat a person with respect you generaly recieved their best work.  Our carrier force new if there was a problem that my team would take care of it.  If for some reason one of my managers could not handle the issue the carriers new I would help with anything that was a problem for them.  The hardest part of my job was to make sure everyone was on the same the page when it came to the ever changing newspaper industry.  The thing I like most about my job was the people that I managed were well experienced and this made my job a enjoyable one.  We were like family and when one of our team had a problem  we all did.  And when one of the team had something to celebrate, we all celebrated. In 2012 most of Gannett's newspapers had price increases and took losses because of it.  Our team however were one of a few who did not take a loss in sales.  Thanksgiving each year was our largest paper of the year, full with advertisements for black friday.  Our team was number two in all Gannett with year over year increase.  We showed a 18% gain when most of the Gannett papers showed a loss.  This shows when you show the respect to your team and let them know how you appreciate them on a daily basis they will go above and beyond their duties to achieve their goals."
good,"USA Today provided me with many opportunities for personal growth.  As I moved through the company I learned about managing staff, accounting, budgets, reconciliations, sales, computers, telephone systems, building maintenance and more.  Every day brought a variety of work so there was never a dull moment."
good,"Hours = 1:30am to 9:30am"
good,"News is a tough business to be in now -- low pay, questionable standards, and the sudden need to be tech-savvy as well as being a hard-core journalist. The people at GGMC, in the newsroom at least, bring traditional journalist values and modern newsgathering techniques together to serve the military and federal employees."
good,"Work/Life balance was a key factor and was very much respected at this employment.  Unfortunately, the company merged with another company and my position was eliminated."
good,Laid back and great work/life balance. There is plenty of room for growth and development. The pay and job security could be better though. I made it through three rounds of lay-offs in three years
good,"I was promoted 7 times in 11 years for more than $100,000 in raises. But opportunities don’t seem to be the same now. I learned a lot from some very smart people - and learned who I didn’t want to be from some real creeps. But it was great experience"
good,"Gannett is a great company to work for, but is challenged by the fact that it's trying to reinvent itself from its newspaper history.  If you're a dedicated hard worker willing to go above and beyond for your clients, there is great opportunity for advancement and excellent financial compensation.  Good training and experience working with local businesses in the discipline of sales and marketing."
good,"A very comfortable, safe, and clean work environment.  Adequate parking and amenities access.   Proper supplies and equipment are always provided and requesting they make sure internal tools and facilities are easy to access.  It's a very productive work environment."
good,"very good manager, and independent sales role fostered.. I learned more about internet marketing campaigns. Thought very interesting  industry enjoyed the outside sales element."
good,"They say if you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. That's true. Working for Gannett, you're a cog in the machine surrounded by other cogs. I just happened to be enjoying my cog work and I was surrounded by other cogs that made coming to work wonderful every day. "
good,I have worked for Gannett for 21 years and have enjoyed my experience working with many great people. It's sad to see the facility that I work in closing in June.
good,USA TODAY Sports Media Group has a great company culture and very supportive management teams. They champion people who work hard and like to promote from within.
good,"productive fun place to work, but job security (due to changing World) job security became low. In he 10+ years working at Gannett I learned so much in Customer Service - as a result I became a better employee that customers could depend on at all times."
good,Worked for Gannett for 22 years.  Enjoyed working for them.  They believed in my work knowledge and promoted me to management positions even though I did not have a college degree.
good,I worked for the company for over 20 years at several of their locations.  I transferred to the Nashville locating.  Two years after moving their was a consolidation of operations.

good,"At first Gannett was an excellent place to work, during the time I was there management changes occurred and the structure of benefits changed which was not a beneficial change for the hard working employees it was more for company revenue growth."

good,The company has very strict guidelines and obligations. The training was very helpful before graduating to the floor. GANNETT helped me with customer service tremendously.
good,It’s a good company to work for even though the newspaper industry is dying. A lot of time off and fair pay.  A lot of friendly people here. Management has a lot of experience so they know what they’re doing. I would recommend people to this company if the industry wasn’t on the downturn.
good,"Management was great, so were the coworkers. Very laid back, boring at times. You wont get hours though. You'll start only doing 25/week until they decide if they want to keep you after your 90 days."
good,its was a workplace that was fun and it was a workplace that was local and a workplace that had a lot of people working and a work place that made you work weekends

good,"A typical day at work in the I.T. department was just me taking internal help desk calls all day, nothing too special. I learned a lot while working there because the culture is very open and it is encouraged to ask questions. Hardest part of the job was we were short staffed for a few months, which required a lot of extra calls, and the I.T. department ended up getting outsourced."
good,This is a good company to start a career in digital marketing. There is plenty of training resources and the management is supportive. There is autonomy with accounts and reasonable growth goals.
good,"Create designs for different types of projects, research and book events for kiosk vendors.  Assist the different team members with projects for each specific channel as well as making posts for Insider, The Arizona Republic Membership Program."
good,In the beginning with the Celebro products Gannett was virtually a dream job as it was transitioning to digital it became a place where you didn't know who was going to be there from month to month due to positions being eliminated.
good,"This is a place that you can come in and feel relaxed, focus and make the money. The manager will put you in different campaigns for you to sell and/or collect for publications across the country. Don't get distracted and follow the script."
good,They are all very friendly people and it provides a great work environment to keep you nice and relaxed. There is alot of other opportunities in the building that can come up for employment that you are able to take advantage of.
good,I started working for the Asbury Park Press in 1969 in Asbury Park when  i was 18 years old Started as an apprentice in the print shop and worked my way up as an assistant foreman in 1990. After that I became a shift superviser in 1995 and continued in that possition until the plant closed down on June 2017.

good,"A quick-paced environment with certain time sensitive operations."
good,I was given a different perspective here -- working with national and international content every single day for a national readership. Quality standards were extremely high.
good,This was my favorite job.  But that was a few years ago when small businesses were buying print marketing.  Business is simply tough in this industry now.  Gannett is a great company to work for though!
good,"Had a long , productive (30 year) career with Gannett."
good,"I remained at Gannett for an extended period of years. I started in a technical position and eventually was asked to move into management. To my surprise there was much fulfillment in managing staff as I worked hard to remain as technical as possible while working to challenge staff to reach the top of there game. There were several times I attempted to leave but new opportunities would come up that I just could not leave. I moved from supporting Digital Equipment Corporation systems to IBM, to VMWare, to new storage to managing Data Centers and Operations, to finally System Management and Collaboration where I worked with an exceptional team to migrate the entire company to 365. It was challenging as O365 was cutting edge but I obviously love a challenge!"
good,The place is very organized. At my workstation I had software that brought the newspaper ads I worked on to me. I did the necessary tasks and the system brought me the next ad. Management was always accessible. They worked with me knowing I was going to school at the same time. The hardest part of  the job was an ancillary item. I disliked having to park so far away and pay for it besides. The most enjoyable part was the minimal pressure I felt. Many of the artists new to the job market thought the pace was rough. They just haven't been around.
good,"Working here was like working with family. I was pushed to do the best and be the best. Moving on from Gannett was hard, but I was able to strive because of the knowledge gained."

good,There is never a typical workday. Each day has its own challenges and accountablility for facilitating the changes drives the desire to succeed if you are business minded and results driven. Gannett is forward thinking and driving the culture to that of inclusive and desirable.
good,"Gannett is wonderful to work at. However, you are just another worker bee in the giant colony that is Gannett. Entry level and high management lack communication."
good,"Great place to work, room for advancement.  Great management staff and very caring. I've learned how call centers operate and learned a lot about customer service."
good,"Come in at 9 get on the phones and assist customers with there needs."
good,I really liked my coworkers and the culture at Gannett Publishing Services.  In my position as an account manager I also had some fantastic customers during my time there.  The biggest negative was the overall down outlook for newspaper and newspaper related printing.
good,Depending on who you work for this can be a great place to work.
good,Great to work for but print newspaper circulation industry in decline. Jobs are available in Virginia and with local papers
good,"I enjoyed the work environment. East to move up in the company. Co-workers for the most part were easy to work with, The management were approachable. I did enjoy the fact that they had company outings and the employees had access to many other perks. Such as box seats at Hockey games etc..."
good,"I new exactly was what was expected with a few unseen challenges."
good,A typical day at work was posting ads on career builder and on the employment section of The News Journal. The Director of Classifed Advertising was dynamite but the Manager was new and inexperienced. My co workers were wonderful. I composed excel spreadsheet downloads from the data base and presented the online vs. print advertising percentages for reporting requirements but the manager wanted the numbers crunched to suit her goals. That was the hardest part of the job and I perceived it as unethical. Therefore I resigned to pursue other employment.
good,"Not a bad place to work for the people are kind and respectful 😊. The pay was the only issue , I just felt that the position can get overwhelming at times."
good,They skip over promoting you even though you may be a better candidate than most to promote friends and family. There’s a lot of favoritism here. They gossip and lie bad. Best to keep to yourself.

good,"Interesting job that involved plenty of travel to fun locations. Get to learn many different sides of the business and truly feel like your work is valuable.

The Job was very rewarding and I always wanted to make sure the product looked good. It was the advertiser who paid the bills, so it was very important that they were happy. I really learned to deal with people, as I was responsible for running the press and making sure the crew understood what their responsibilities were. The hardest part of the job had to be the hours. The printing industry can be very demanding that way,as your always held accountable for your time. I can honestly say that I'm a pretty upbeat person and I work hard. I consider having a good work ethic very important."

good,"I worked 8 hour shifts with commission paid monthly and regular paychecks bi-weekly so I always had money to spare. Work is fast-paced and customers are calling you, so no ""call center"" vibe. We do have to call out to customer who left messages to be called, not to random ""potential customers"" who may or may not want us to call. All in all, this is a great place to work if you enjoy assisting and communicating with customers."

However, my boss at Gannett is the best supervisor I have ever had in my professional career. There are ample opportunities to advance if you are willing to relocate."
good,"The job was difficult, but rewarding.  The best part was the competitive camaraderie with my co-workers.  As collectors we were always pushing each other to do more and to do better.  The hardest part for me was knowing when to get tough with the customers.  I was told more than once that I was too nice. "
good,Multiple accounts worked on at one time. Interaction with numerous department and clients on a daily basis.

Management is very understanding if you can’t handle stressful situations easily. Work with them and they can work with you. Can make over $500 in commission.
