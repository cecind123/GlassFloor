rating,review
bad,Worst place to work. Ghetto and ratchet.  Management only looks out for those they can control. Family members are management and work under family in higher management. No opportunity for growth.  Raises are promised but ways are found not to get one. Wouldn't recommend this job to my enemies.
bad,I worked for Centerpoint in Houston. They do not follow the company values or mission. It's very retaliatory to it's employee's.  They do not balance home or work life. The managers are not helpful and they work you like a dog. The base is 11.00 and the goals to obtain to get the commission pay is not obtainable. I would not recommend this company.  Very high turnover
bad,"Unless you are a favorite you will be horribly mistreated at this company. "
bad,It was very ghetto. You could wear anything you wanted to wear. Any color hair you wanted to wear. I would not recommend this place at all. Any and everybody could work here.
bad,Electric and Gas should be separate departments.  More training to assist with ongoing changes is needed more often than just the foundational training at the beginning of the job.
bad,I’ve worked for Centerpoint for over a year and it just got worse and worse over time. No room to grow with this company. Management is the worse and dealing with customers make the job even worse. I would only recommend someone fresh out of high school to seek employment here just to have experience and income. I wouldn’t recommend for anyone to try and make this a career.
bad,"Average call center. No communication, rules and policies change ever other day. Ok as a first job! Changed a lot of rules and pay information for new hires which wasn't fair."
bad,Management is very cut throat and have that good ole boy routine.  Minorities are ok as long as they don't complain about being harassed or mistreated.  They will black ball and look for reason to fire you
bad,"A typical day at work you would go in and take calls, there is very unrealistic expectations of the role. also working in this role there is always another department transferring calls over to us when it is not something we support, about 8 out of 10 times it is the department that transferred the call supported the issue and nothing is ever done about the issue. Causing irritated callers when this is not needed. However in the site itself you work with very friendly people and make good friends."
bad,I like the people I work with; average work day is 8 to 5pm; good place to work if you don't want to work hard and just collect a paycheck; don't recommend working here
bad,high volume call center utilities. Fast paced environment.
bad,"Attracts potential customers by answering product and service questions, suggesting information about other products and services."
bad,"I quit this job after a few weeks.  The training was ok but the trainer was very immature."
bad,"needs work of company culture. Alot of politics, hard to advance due to outdated company culture. Its not about what you know at this company more about who you know."
bad,HR has no clue how to operate. No room for advancement. Management in most cases dont know how to operate or run their departments correctly. Over all not a great place to work if you are looking for advancement opportunities.
bad,"I worked there for 8 months and paid union dues from the start, but back then (I don't know if it's changed) CenterPoint had a policy of no unexcused absences over 40 hours the first year of employment while you're under probation."
bad,"I could not wait for an opportunity to work for CenterPoint. I had heard great things about pay and benefits.  Unfortunately, that is really the only reason people stay there.  It is a company in flux.  Held back by the phrase ""that is how we have always done it"" by the skilled and experienced personnel while being pushed toward innovation and new processes by new management hired from outside the company.  There is a rift in the two mindsets that makes working there uncomfortable.  The way the Union personnel is treated is subhuman.  They recently merged with a company called Vectron and to be honest, they should have gotten their own house in order before trying to merge with another company.  Shareholders take priority in this company, and they will do whatever it takes to keep the stock price up."
bad,"The Morale is Terrible and supervision walk around with their chest out , also the only way to move up is to volunteer at company events in your free time so you can show up just to stroke your supervisor ego .... basically CNP is more important then your family. Younger new hires with no experience move into supervisor positions faster because most have no family’s and nothing but free time to volunteer at CNP events , it’s really backwards , the idea of someone with no experience telling the people with years of experience what’s best.... it’s like the blind leading people with 20/20 vision lol"
bad,"Sounds good, looks good.. But its not good. They dictate your time off, even if you have it available to take, they dock  you for every little thing possible. Give you points for using your sick pay, or forcibly taking the day off to handle business since they will not approve time off for you. Pretty much if you have a life this is not the place t work, if you depend on your finances for certain things.. This is no the place to work..They pay you low salary but expect you to be here doing everything.  Its horrible, awful and nerve shattering. I could go on but .. I still work here.. Smh"
bad,CNP terminated me after I was sent home by a supervisor during training for informing them I was exposed to strep throat. I was sent  home under the impression I was excused for the day. I was asked if I had a doctor's note which I did well the following day I received a call from the supervisor saying I was terminated. I caught strep throat from one of the new hires in the class. This is wrong
bad,"takes 20 people to make a simple decision, if you do not want to be held accountable for your job then work here.  No repercussions for not doing your job and no reward for doing your job."
bad,They say they are working towards being employee focused however with the many changes and diffrent schedule changes the company shows more so of being company oriented.
bad,many calls
bad,The hardest part is keeping up with sells. The managment is okay. They say sells is a big part but not a big part. The lack of compassion for employees health is not good but are big on safety.
bad,"Terrible Office Environment, no office cohesion worked with PRIME LEGACY RECORDS, terrible supervisor. I have worked here for a year and other employees try to get you fired to gain an upper hand"
bad,"CenterPoint Energy is a stable company but it is difficult to come in contact with appropriate management that are truly helpful and knowledgeable about the work being done. I do not feel you are given all the resources that could be available to do your job effectively and efficiently and they are behind in technological advances regarding employee resources. Work/life balance is hit or miss. They try to teach a strong ethical company with HR support but after 11 years of loyal employment, I had to leave due to retaliation after going to HR with a legitimate concern. However, CenterPoint Energy did have good benefits and is a stable company."
bad,"promotions are based on personal feelings, not merit. workplace culture is not good. nothing more to say because i cant find anything suitable to say about it"
bad,"This company is okay to work for if you are not looking for a high salary or advancement. Everyone is very nice. This was my first office job so even though the pay wasn't that great, it was good experience for me."
bad,"Seems like a lot of incentives but very time consuming . You are given a lot of vacation and medical time. The only thing is getting it requested off is impossible ."
bad,I have no review for this particular company. I would like to remain silent in this instance. I am not the person for reviews. Long hours though. Training is okay
bad,"Pay and benefits are competitive, but management likes to make things personal and then hide behind their management positions for their own vindictive natures."
bad,Over worked with little help from management.  The company still uses the Good Old Boy system when promoting.  There is little help from supervisors during emergencies due to fear of termination because of company policies and procedures.  Company only enforces policies when it benefits them.  Trying to get other departments help with issues is like pulling teeth out of an alligator.  Management and personnel hide in the field and don't answer calls due to fear of having to work.
bad,a typical energy company that allow you grow within the company if you have a degree 
bad,Has no interest in what is best for their employees. Management treat employees as if they are inferior to them. Your ideas does not count.
bad,"Good place to work though very fast pace and stressful environment.  Some great people in various departments; however, very few opportunities for advancement or growth."
bad,"Not a horrible job,  but a lot of things done based on management's favorites.  1 year probationary period attendance policy is unrealistic.  No such thing as  an excused absence,  if you get sick you have to be at work even if feverish, vomiting,  etc. Many employees regularly violate rules regarding time away from desk or using cell phones at desk but as long as you are supervisors favorites it's ignored.  Not a favorite of your supervisor,  called out on every possible error. This is not just my experience but also other employees."
bad,"My co-workers were the best. Customer Service was a must because you were always going on to someone's property to do a job. What I learned was how to handle people, pets, electrical line systems and electric meters. Hardest part of the job was pets. The most enjoyable part of the job was the others I worked with out in the field."
bad,"A typical day working as a electrical service consultant at CenterPoint started at 7AM. The job consist of project management/organization, in which I initiated project start off by scheduling multiple meetings a day with new clients to meet on site to discus construction plans, and possible electrical options. After all field visits I would head back to the office to begin paperwork and compile an electrical construction schedule and electrical layout for the client. Once the client approve and sign all legal documents I would put the project on our internal construction schedule and manage until finished."
bad,"Great management here. Beautiful office in downtown Minneapolis. Flexible hours which is amazing. I love being organized which is part of my job.  Ability to ride the bus is a must, but I have grown used to it & now enjoy this portion of my day to relax."
bad,"The company preaches diversity and gives all kind of training on the subject, but the office I was in was all white, and every year they fired a black employee until they got the office to their liking.Very racial atmosphere. I don't recommend this job."
bad,Great work life balance but no hope in advancement. Great benefits but since there was no hope for advancement it made it hard to break the barrier of the set relationships of already hired employees.
bad,"as a new employee they're management skills weren't up to par as expected, but overall is a good place of work! For students they have  good work to life ratio!"
bad,If you like walking and being outside with no one watching your every move than Center point is a good fit for you but if you have a problem with being outside for a long period of time than I wouldn't suggest that you apply for this career.
good,"no comment.  I really don't have the energy to explain.  the company as a whole have opportunities, but they are restrained and its necessary to know someone"
good,"Good opportunities to learn many different skills in a short period of time. A lot of young and senior talent, however this can be overshadowed by poor management choices."
good,"The company is good, most people are very nice they become like family after a while. You only move up if you know and are in the good graces of the right people. It consumes your life and the call center/customer service department is the worst place you can work at but it's a good place to start to get your foot in the door."
good,I liked working this job in the beginning until I started realize somethings were not as said they would be. The pay was okay but i didn't have as much responsibilities then .
good,If your looking for advancement don’t waste your time. Life is not fair but customer service is unfair on so many levels. M............................
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with associates and reaching and exceeding team goals. We brought in millions of dollars for our department alone which cast a positive light on the team.
good,"This is not a professional environment. Long hours at a small pay rate. Hard to manage with children. Loud and ghetto. I could've went back after I had my daughter, but I decided to go back to school. My experience there made me realize that i deserved more."
good,"Identfy opportunities to promote gas technologies.Learned how to increase personal effectiveness, the natural gas process from shale to the customer, effective communications."
good,"Great place to work if you love sales, overtime, and long hours during the busy seasons. As a Service Technician you essentially have 3 jobs 1) Utility Worker "
good,Center Point Energy was a great job for me the only problem I was a FEMALE WITH MAD SKILLS but the pay sucked GREAT FOR THE MEN just like they were the bread winner so was I a single mother taking care of business not BEGGING or WAITING ON THE GOVERNMENT TREAT CHECKS.BUT The Father I made it 29yrs I stayed to long for the raise to get good for in 2010 -15-152015
good,"Great place if you aren’t on the phones in the call center ... we were rushed out of training because they needed people on the phones. If you work flex don’t even think about having the holidays off unless that’s your normal off day .. petty, miserable co workers and more annoying customers who complain about things like the wind.."
good,Rates are way below the market average. Lowest I’ve seen in over a decade comparable to the market. Technology is well rounded and secure which is nice . I also tech side of things are very well managed.
good,"CNP used to be a great place to work, as shown by the huge number of employees with really long tenure.. New management came in with the new CEO a couple three years ago and some of these top level management people are changing things just because they can. They didn't look at how things were working, they just wanted to make change for the sake of making change. This has led to a lot of disgruntled employees. CNP is a utility company. Its never going to be a sexy company - its just a utility company!  This new top level of management wants to run it like its an oil and gas company and it just isn't.  They are going to run into a roadblock at some point that will stop them in their tracks, but until then, I'm afraid many very talented people will leave the company."
good,"Great wages after the first couple years. They will pay you just enough to keep you from thinking about leaving. Overtime is expected and often mandatory, you will make lots of money after you get passed your assessment tests."
good,"Company was in the middle of transitions when I started my employment there.I enjoyed being mobile, provided with company vehicle,uniforms,and tools. The company began to outsource soon after my employment.My position was very hands on, outdoor and extremely physical.The division of the company where I worked was in the process of being phased out.Overall my time with the company went well."
good,"I've been here for over 8 yrs and loved my job until recently. Since CNP had decided to take the company into a new direction, life has been awful, training has been non existance, stress has been through the roof and customer service has been thrown out the window."
good,It was all about the company and money and budget. Nothing for the little people. If you aren't in management don't bother.
good,"Would you like to spend your day doing ""meetings"" without getting any actual work done, all for below-market pay? Then CenterPoint Energy is for you!"
good,Not much opportunity to advance in the company unless you are willing to move. Great supervisor and co workers that will teach you if you are willing to learn.
good,"I work in the customer service department and it drains you everyday. For the amount of stuff that we do, we should get paid more than what we are currently paid."
good,"easy work , not to strenuious, 8 hour work days, every day varied in what job you may be doing that day. was a union based job"
good,"This company has issues with management and personal feeling towards employees, exp. I management does not like a person they will not let that person advance. no matter how well the preform on the job. "
good,I have grown as a operations supervisor with cemterpoint energy. As a business tey are innovating to gather information that allows me to be successful
good,Management could have been more professional and helpful. Shifts were fixed and were attainable only by raise. Breaks consisted of 30 min and 2 fifteen minute breaks distributed in morning and evening.
good,"Most of the company has a lot of opportunity. If you have an engineering degree then the sky is the limit. If you don't or don't have other industry experience you will be relegated to a frustrating position. Also be willing, no be pushing, to relocate to Houston."
good,OK. Depends on your department. Hard to post out to other groups. Health benefits costs more than previous employer. 401K matching is 6% plus another 5% in a low interest account.
good,Stable company with opportunities for advancement in certain departments. Opportunities for knowledge transfer as many employees are retiring. Family culture.
good,Install poly pipe mains and services to homes and business's.
good,"I work on HVAC, ranges, refrigerators in customers homes. I find gas leaks in customers homes; repair gas line. Install gas lines to appliances. Inform the customers what I found and how I repaired the appliance."
good,Great work life balance
good,"I was hired for my ""innovative mindset, entrepreneurial spirit, and can-do attitude!""  However, it was those same attributes that made me disliked by my peers.  Management is a joke, and you can only get ahead at CenterPoint based on who you know, or who likes you.  You're expected to bend over backwards and kiss butts.  I don't do that very well, so since no one liked me....well, you'll figure out the rest.  "
good,the work environment for the most part was good.  the management was not so great.  a lot of micromanagement.  also managers did not know all the ins and outs to help with specific job functions but were quick to tell you that you did something wrong.
good,The company overall is great to their employees. However management is very unprofessional. There is not a lot of advancement with in the organization.
good,"I feel like a robot. There is no time for the unexpected.  Every minute, every second must be accounted for with very little wiggle room. Dont get me wrong, it's a good place to work (once you're out of the call center)."
good,"The benefits are great.  The job was stressful and demanding.  However, it is now under new management and stress has been reduced. The work schedule and work location is more flexible."
good,"Centerpoint treats union personell much different than Non Union personell."
good,"Poor management in my group.  Lots of restructuring and lay offs.  No job advancement, hard to move within departments.  Managers are difficult to work with."
good,I am assigned as temporary so my duties vary which I enjoy.  I would like to receive more challenging assignments and be more included in larger projects.
good,Great place to learn about the Natural Gas Industry... Learned several aspects of the Distribution side of Natural Gas Business....
good,working at center point was very interesting.
good,The company has been moving more towards more sales oriented service work than just come in and repair appliances at least for service technicians. Other than that its a good company to work for and they have many places to advance and expand your career with them.
good,Centerpoint recently acquired the company I work for in a merger. The culture at Centerpoint seems very team and goal oriented while striving to succeed for their customers.
good,"People are friendly. Good on the job training. Management is open, approachable and flexible. Compensation is decent. comfortable work environment. Opportunity for growth."
good,"CenterPoint Energy Services is a highly competitive department and working for the company has it's benefits including longevity, security and benefits.  I would say management is pretty poor and needs to be evaluated much closely.  Should have more work/life balance options and consider the needs of the employee."
good,It's a big company corporate culture.  My previous company was bought by CenterPoint Energy and we went from a small company culture to a big company culture.  This is not what I am interested in.
good,"it was very stressful environment, some of management was difficult to work with, Some of project were pending for a long time due to lack of coordination among different teams."
good,"like any job, most will depend upon who you work for.  there are a lot of good bosses and just a few that unfortunately only know how to look good to their boss."
good,Good company. Worklife and culture enhances ones outlook. Hardest part of job was the constant meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,A great place to work if you not into traveling and want to make it home to see your family every day. There is a good workplace balance. The only drawback is most people are there for 40 years and there are limited advancement opportunities.
good,We have deadlines that needs to be met daily at the U.S.P.S. Productive and fast pace job. Make sure inserts are inserted correctly to all the right SBU.
good,ok work place. pay is good. management is lacking. not much room to move into management. you will get on the job training.
good,Good Solid Company to work for.  Good benefits and work life options that makes an employee have the option of working at home.
good,"I worked thru my employer. It was nice working in CNP, great people and nice office. Office is in Downtown to commute is bit hectic"
good,I am working from my employer to Centerpoint. I find center point working environment is good. Only drawback is office is in Downtown so driving to work take lot of time
good,"At CenterPoint, I learned quite a bit about electricity.  The hardest part about the job was grasping all the information about the electrical side of things since I have a background of Mechanical Engineering from school.  The most enjoyable part about the job was getting to meet many customers and talk with them."
good,"Depending on your role, this can be a good company to work for. Once you pass the 5 year mark, you can do anything without having to worry about getting terminated. I've seem employees get aware with ""murder. "
good,CenterPoint is a stable company and has a good work-life balance.
good,"I have learned a lot & developed many relationships. I have been with the company since 3/2011 & my schedule has changed (3) times & is due to change again in January, due to this factor, I am seeking new employment."
good,"Taking calls and responding to emails is part of our responsibility. I have learned a lot about the gas and electric industry. "
good,My experience was good as a overall company. My co-worker was not as social and did not really help me exceed and may be the cause of me not being there anymore. Our boss did not help with getting me educated from my co worker to do my job. He called us family and brothers but I did not fell that way. I did not have the best experience doing my job but the work place was great.
good,"Many working and volunteer experiences through varied work locations.  I learned the natural gas utility business first, then the electric utility business."
good,It is an odd working environment. A valuable and experienced programmer was not getting along well with the project leader. However; most of the programs were written by him. I realized that the project leader were frustrated and teared one time because of this.
good,I feel to work at center point energy you must work hard. the only thing I will like for the company to change is that they can be a little understanding when it come to employees that have kids. you will still receive points if you bring a doctor note.
good,"This company provides training and has great pay with benefits, the safety culture is strong but so are consequences for mistakes."
good,"Currently I am in a department were the management is awful, they say inappropriate things and each time I try to transfer they refuse to allow me to do so. I have been sexually assaulted and looking desperately to move to another department or find another job with another company. Other departments I have worked for where so nice and wonderful. I loved every minute of it, it is about who you know and what department you end up in that will determine how your experience will be."
good,although it was a nice place to work it take forever to get out of the call center. if you work in the call caneter stay on top of your game so that you can advance any little small mistake will have you there for the entire duration of your career there.
good,"CNP is a good company to work for, benefits start asap and pay is good, however often Mandatory overtime with little notice, self paid parking (downtown location) or you can have an amount deducted from your pay ($60/month) to park at a hotel downtown. Strict Strict attendance policy ( if you have kids especially young kids...THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU) and if you are in the Customer Service Dept.....good luck trying to promote to another dept. I know people say this all the time but here at this company you have to really kiss A** to move up."
good,The typical word day consisted of helping CenterPoint employees with their fitness needs while maintaining a clean and orderly wellness center.  I learn how to create exercise programs and how to conduct myself in a corporate environment.  Many of my co workers had different tasks then me even though we had the same title.  It was confusing on who was actually the supervisor or boss.  This made working there difficult at times due to the lack of proper supervision.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping employees reach their fitness goals and being able to work out during breaks.
good,"I love my job, but there is no room for growth here, I have out grown my current position here and I am ready for a new challange."
good,CenterPointEnergy was a great place to work. Its full of culture and thrives off of customer satisfaction. Ive leaned how to work various systems and how to put customer first.
good,"Just,a great,working place,with,high potentials,for advancement.got,injured,on,the,job,due,to,workers comp,taking,too long,on,the,dispute,of,my,injury,and got terminated,have since then been released,to full duty."
good,Call center environment. Lines stay busy. Customers can make calls overwhelming because you are dealing with their power and gas services. Pay is not worth it.
good,"depending on management CNP is a great place to work, I would still be there if it wasn't for poor management. Every day was great working with the knowledgeable people there."
good,"•	Act as shift manager for crew if management is off and/or sick."
good,You are union and have seniority rules so you will get a bad shift. They promise to you that you will be able to move up but you would have to move to be promoted.
good,Very good pay howevet the entire day is micro managed.  We had sales goals as well.incoming phone calls from customers from a combined 7 other call centers combined.
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by customers who don't want to wait x days for an appliance repair appointment. We have sales goals, but it's kind of hard to sell to a customer when they have to wait a week to get their central air fixed. It's weather-driven, so we're very busy in the fall and early summer. Basically, it's a very stressful job and I would gladly take a job that pays less, if it's also less stressful."
good,"Typical day at work would be to answer calls, as many as you can possible and give customers there full on attention. I learned to better my customer service skills. The management needs more work only because the workers did as they pleased. I can say over all I did enjoy my experience with this company."
good,"*A typical day at work would consist of assisting with member billing inquiries,and report gas leaks."
good,A typical day at CNP involved daily interface with IT clients reporting or obtain work requirements.  Learn many computer languages.  The hardest part of the job was the on-call rotations and the most enjoyable part of the job included many system implementations that required long hours and end with a successful applications.
good,"The receptionist passed her work off on me, while she flirted with all the men continually. Once a suitor visited her 14 times in one day. The distractions were maddening. Somehow, I got my work and her's done. The people seemed unmotivated--typical of this type of company."
good,Good place to work if you do not require a lot of guidance and like to figure out a lot of things on your own. Management might not provide direction when needed.
good,"Holidays company feed employees. If safety is met for the quarter food is prepared for employees. Pay is good. Customers are friendly. There are some days that are busy (example: 1st, 3rd and the 15th of the month). Learned how to read orders and remove disconnect orders."
good,"Every day differed, from paperwork and proposals; to in the community events and support. Management taught me to be an active team-player in a highly diversified environment, that encompassed working with four generations of individuals (20 year olds to 70 year olds), and global coworkers, whom became more like a family to me dispite our different languages and backgrounds. Leaving the people was the hardest part for me. The most enjoyable was knowing one person can really make a difference."
good,Really Enjoyed working in a call center ..Great co-workers and Management
good,"The people are great, but the work gets to you after a while. The customers are cranky. You are always timed on the calls and have to get through them very fast. Answer all their questions and make them happy and sell to them the repair plans. The bosses are good. It is a union job so the pay is good. But almost no chance to move out of your time slot unless someone retires."
good,I would go back to company just not the Customer Service Department. Gained a lot of knowledge and met some extraordinary people
good,"A typical day there is pretty busy, your always working very nice employess and good enviroment, nothing hard about it, just alot of training, enjoyable part of the job is you good bonuses every year and monthly prizes"
good,"Evaluated construction design information such as detail and assembly drawings, designed calculations, system layouts and sketches and specifications. Conducted site visits to plan the location’s interconnection to the site’s existing natural gas line system. Completed fusion process of polyethylene pipe."
good,I worked there 32 years . I worked days and night somtimes never came home. After a few year of this they hired trained mecanics to take load off my meter tech. Job. I put my heart and soul in that company. Then one morning I was sick so I e-mail my so called supervisor that I was sick. Then I decided better try and get up and go check location that was going to be audited that morning by superviser and oklahoma corp. Comission I have had some dump valve problems there the day before. When I got there I had gas blowing so I got out and fixed it took awhile up and down tank and breaking out dumps. So I checked temp.On dehy it was low so turned up temp got in truck was very tired and weak. Supervisor pulls up with corp commision I was leaned back in seat sweat rolling of me had my eyes shut feeling terible supervisor walked up hit the window I hit it back told him felt bad been working he told me to leave nexst day he calls me up said he turned me in for sleeping on job . Later I was fired....I loved working there . The supervisor that fired me quit to much pressure.He had been caught runnig me down. Up till then I had very good supervisors smaert and trained supervisors. The one that fired me had no feild exsperience.
good,They were slow to accurately train New Hires. There are no Procedures within certain departments. Not great with getting employees the necessary training. Lack of Ergonomics support and you must purchase your own.
good,Prioritizing is very important as well as communicating with the team. I learned how to use a new software and how to problem solve when I didn't know how to do something. The most enjoyable part of the job was playing ping pong and pool while getting to know other people at the company.
good,"CenterPoint is a great place to work, but not in the call center as an agent.  I had to resign as they would not help me with my school.  I was two months from graduating and receiving my bachelors and management refuse to work with my school schedule."
good,The work was awesome. I could work at my own pace and enjoyed my coworkers. Miss working there and the people I worked with. My supervisor was really great
good,"Great atmosphere to work, with an open office concept. Management are courteous and friendly, the organization values family and team bonding. You are in charge of your own success."
good,"I learned about the structure of union jobs.  I learned a lot about natural gas lines, gas meters, and the nature of natural gas leaks.  My co workers were friendly and a huge part in making the job so enjoyable.  The activity level and the long hours at times made the job difficult."
good,"Each day was different. I was able to meet new customers daily and offer great customer service. This job also allowed me the opportunity to travel across the southeastern region of the US, which was also very enjoyable too. Compensation was accurate."
good,"As a Team Leader, there was usually never a whole lot of down time except break time.  The work environment was pretty fast-paced and very busy.  As part of Special Services, we provided supplies and materials to our Fab shop and construction crews which consisted of both CenterPoint employees as well as CenterPoint contractors.  Other aspects of our work environment was Shipping & Receiving as well as dealing with CenterPoint vendors and working closely with our Purchasing Department."
good,Answering calls and making calls from customers. Always on a fast move keeping up with the company goals and requirements needed on a daily base.
good,I learned how to grow as an individual and lead a team of employees.
good,Start at 7:30 get the company trucks go to my routes. different peoples in the world. i manage my own hours the fast i walk the quicker i would get oence on  I got along with all my co workers never had any probelms . jumping fences on a daily basics. getting paid to stay in shape.

Trucks were stocked and we headed out to the job site. I learned various tasks and procedures in the transmission unit at CenterPoint Energy as well as distribution as needed. I learned and followed new and previous safety procedures that need company had in place. Management was always there to help when help was needed. Very positive and encouraging to the crews. The hardest part of my job would have to be working with live lines. The most enjoyable part of my job at CenterPoint Energy would have to be seeing the views from on top of the tower.

good,"•	Total 9 of SAP Testing Experience with SAP Cross Modules and 3+ years in utility Industry."
good,I learned how hard change is on a company.  The really good associates have the character to follow and support new strategies.  Most stand in the middle not wanting to take risks to join in the effort until they feel their job is safe.  Then some in affect hold to the old strategy and culture and try to destroy the change effort.
good,I worked a 40 hour  week.  There were two guards on duty per shift.  I had a good crew to work with.   The biggest problem was finding a parking space when  there was an event occurring in Houston.

good,This has been a Great life time job  . I love my job meeting the public taking care of their problems and doing the right thing treating everyone the same that’s customer relation. The company job functions have changed to more contractors to be able to get the jobs done with less company employees

I feel like with my experience, qualifications, certificates and all around natural skill, I can make a difference on a much larger scale in the Highline inspection field.  I’ve taken my duties and responsibilities very seriously and feel like I am ready for more."
good,"CenterPoint is a great company and excellent benefits - Expect to work hard, but well compensated for your efforts.  The expectations are set very high and you will be pushed to meet, but  you will be well compensated for your efforts."
good,A typical day is getting the crew truck ready and heading out to fix gas lines or install new. You learn about gas transportation and maintenance. Management is nice and resourceful. Working in all weather conditions is probably the hardest part for people. Most enjoyable part is being outside all the time and working with others.
good,"CenterPoint Energy's value proposition is multifaceted.  Leading such a firm, especially when rate regulated (partially), presents a unique challenge.  On balance, the culture is slowly evolving."
good,It’s a good paying job but can be long hot hours and the field is none for being a dangerous job. The crews are fun to work with and give you a feeling of accomplishment to see the final project on an line being built.
good,"The people and manager were very nice to work with, but unfortunately there was not many room for advancement or moving around on the company , since I don't have a college degree."

good,was a great place to work but tend to keep people from advancing
good,great job awesome benefits responsible for 30+ employees and safety meetings
good,"A typical day at CenterPoint Energy (CNP) depends on the department where you work. Some departments are all work, all the time with little flexibility. Others have much more downtime and flexibility. The benefits of a company the size of CNP are the number of opportunities to develop your skillsets. CNP is shifting from a traditional utility mindset to a more data driven company and the transformation process is challenging as the company determines how to use the data, how to allocate the most efficient resources who know how to interpret the data, and how to securely store the data. The people who work at CNP are hard-working people and there are numerous instances of people spending 50+ years with the company, as well as instances of multiple generations within the same family working for CNP. The hardest part about the job is advancing. Many departments are very flat organizationally and unless someone retires, there are few opportunities for advancement beyond certain points within the department. Job positions with advancement opportunities are posted internally, however, many times it is as a formality and a desired candidate has already been identified, making the interview process an HR formality. CNP realizes the importance of work/life balance and many departments are able to enjoy flexible work schedules and dress."
good,"A typical day at work would be on the phones 90% of the day helping customers from paying their bill or setting them up on payment plans. I learned alot of ways to help people thru difficult times, by just listening to them how you can turn a bad situation into a happy outcome. Co-workers are great! They always are very willing to help. The hardest part of the job is being able to handle all the customers who yell at you thinking it's your fault their gas is being shut off. But the greatest reward is the customers who say thank you."
good,"Would work for them again, unfortunately my position got eliminated when they got purchased by a Texas based energy company."
good,Great & Growing Company that is currently looking for a way to establish itself as a leader in the industry and community that is constantly headed to leading the future of the utility industry.

good,"I loved my time working at CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. I got along very well with my co-workers. It was a very relaxed and fun environment.

The management team is wonderful and works well together. The hardest part of the job is the customers that have a hard time paying their bills and there is only so much we are allowed to approve. The most enjoyable part of the company is the management team from our location as well as the corporate office treat everyone as an equal.
good,"Great company to work for.  Takes too long to advance, but overall great work environment, great people, good management.  Would go back if given the chance."
good,I loved working there. I loved the work. I loved the people. Too bad they had to let me go over a medical issue. Others were let go shortly after hiring them from temp to perm.
good,Design safe and reliable gas distribution systems. During my time at CenterPoint I gained significant project management experience. The most difficult part of this job is the volume of work you are expected to complete.

good,Excellent management. Great environment with room to move up and grow. Slow at times when there are no issues or jobs that need to be done.
good,Great company to work for with alot of team support. Lots of charity involvement.The only down fall is being a contractor without the option of being coming permanent.
good,"Difficult job, but you are trained for several years.  A lot of information to cover.  Service consultants are used as the dumping ground for all other departments who do not wish to accept responsibility for any decision making.  Consultants are the face of the company and deal with all sorts of issues.  While that may sound bad, the job is rewarding and a good work environment with the department helps make it a good place to work."

good,"I worked at CenterPoint for almost 9 years as a professional.  In that time, CNP went from a mid-size company feel to very corporate.  I assume that the lineman and substation guys didn't feel the same.  Overall, CNP is a great company to work for. Pay and time off were excellent.  First line management was great in my experience, but mid and upper-level management seemed to be a bit disconnected."
good,"The colleague is very nice and collaborative. However, it is also competitive, I always need to complete the work before the deadline. This is very good for a team, but need sacrifice my life sometimes."
good,"Relaxed work with great work/life balance and friendly culture. There are good opportunities to move up as long as you obtain your PE license. The benefits are definitely above average. The compensation is relatively low for engineers, and the management could do a lot more to generate productivity. People aren't really pushed to be better. Granted there is great job security and minimal stress, management could still strike a better balance towards productivity."

Then we take customer's load analysis, and architectural, electrical and structural drawings for our design to create a Terms and Conditions package including drawing plans and estimates to have the customer to review and approve. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is to have the new customers comply with all of the requirements needed that are needed for new services, but the most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to do my job with wonderful people and being able to learn from them."
good,"Good customer relation, helping clients as much as possible, every one doing their part"

good,Wonderful company to work for.  On the job training with encouragement to advance your career.  Salary is good and great benefits with company matching.
good,"Most of the people who I worked with were nice and generally nice to be around. However, the workplace was politically charged to some degree. Regionally it makes sense for a place in Texas to have strong opinions, some even valid opinions. But FOX news was literally playing in the lunchroom all day, that should give you a good idea of what I'm referring to as ""politically charged."""
good,I offered office support for field techs.  I used  Microsoft office products daily.
good,"well everyday I will go in at 7 am assign route wait for my co worker so in can explain what we were going to do for that day ,my manger he always help me with any problem that I had that I couldn't solve by my self,the hardest part of the day was getting the skip read which mean that we can get we would pair up cause most of them well bad dog or no one home,the most enjoyable part of my job was being outside in the field im used to all time of weather"
good,"Great company, knowledgable people and family atmosphere. Work/life balance is excellent and the benefits are unrivaled by anywhere I worked before. Pay is less than some offer for the industry, but yearly raises and bonuses make up for it. Flexible schedules make it worth any downfall a person could find, which I never did."
good,"Having a Bachelor's Degree, I at times felt that I should of moved up and been in management roles, but when I thought about the pros and cons, I could not be more grateful for the plethora of experience I have obtained. Being a Service Tech consists of being an emergency first responder, a person that initiaties and installs new gas services, performs collections like a repo man, meets with angry customers making you become an excellenet customer service conflict resolutionist specialist. Active with Safety and have gained knowledge about the distribution operations of our energy delivery company from various facets."
good,"Be prepared to be compensated fairly, but give up any kind of life outside of work.  Construction is brutal, weekends, early mornings and long days. Difficult to get a full time position here, you could be seasonal for 5 to 6 years before getting a break into year round. Not much pays as well as construction."
good,This was a nice place to work. I liked it. I didn't have any problems while I was there and the people seemed nice. I only stopped working there because I relocated to another state.

good,"A typical day at work involved providing support for clients utilizing fleet vehicles and equipment. I learned the in's and out's of a vehicle, from its purchase to its auction. Management was great, workplace culture could be good and bad, depending on who was assigned to what task. The hardest part was beginning a task, working on it to the full extent of your ability and giving it to someone else to complete. The most enjoyable was the family atmosphere before I went home at the end of the day, I'll miss the coworkers I had gotten close to."
good,Need advancement opportunities.  I would love to get into the right group and use my skills to advance the team.  It just seams too hard to get recognized.

My mangers have encouraged me to pursue a career that I am passionate about. I'm thankful that my current supervisor team understands that my current position my be limited but did not allow for it to be limiting."
good,Everyday was relaxed. Standard pace. I learned SAP and how to enter the mapping addresses for gas distribution in new constructed areas for homes. Co-workers were professional and supportive. I had relocated to work this job. Then I had to move back to Michigan due to family matters. I loved the working shift and the work I did there.
good,"250+ calls a day maybe more come in. This is a great job to have it teaches you have structure. The hardest part of the job is trying to explain the reason for a power outage, and turn around time for restoration.

good,"I have a heart for the customers. I strive to have balance between helping the customers and doing my job the Centerpoint Energy way! There is a fine line. Typical day is getting about 60-70 calls a day. Most of the call types are Move-ins, Move-outs, Transfers, and billing calls. Some are more unique than others. I've learned to really empathize with the public and to be delicate with bad news. The hardest part of the job is telling some customers no. They have to own up to their mistakes, situations and do their best. I enjoy the interactions I have with my co-workers when it is slow and we can hold conversations between calls."

good,I loved my job at Centerpoint Energy. Management needs some improvement but overall the company is headed in the right direction. Insurance benefits could be restructured.
good,"As with any utility company, you will sacrifice pay for stability and job security.  Nonetheless, the work environment is very nice, albeit the opportunity for growth is minimal.  Promotions are granted on tenture, rather than ability.  If you stay long enough, you will be a manager, director, or vice president.  Patience!"
good,Become a union member asap! The union employees are the best. Look to them for guidance. Read your union contract and work hard. Good benefits for you and your family.
good,Work outside off on holidays and weekends.  I worked for Baker Services for Center point Energ which is a Contractor for centerpoint.
good,I worked with an excellent team of people who have profound IT service delivery experience. My work life is improved due to the experience i gained from there
good,"Paper work, paper work, paper work..this is day in and day out. But it is filled with crunching numbers and learning why certain reports are needed to validate balancing areas of importance. Co-workers are just that, co-workers. The hardest part is having a boring environment with no viable stimulation to enhance enthusiasm. Most enjoyable part of the day is when they do have little social gatherings to commemorate achievements."
good,"While at CenterPoint Energy we had to respond to Hurricane IKE. We worked long hours and got plenty of overtime for working those longer hours. We would drive around from substation to substation trying to figure out how to get the electric grid back up to par. There were popped fuses, broken power lines, and broken poles. The entire city was in a state of Emergency. Luckily the company had an organized Emergency Operating Procedure and it wasn't long before the electricity was up in all of the neighborhoods."

Anything from cutting grass to building pipelines. Learned how to be and adult here. Getting in and getting dirty working on giant compressor engines. Riding the right-of-way looking for encroachments and leaks, repairing leaks, tearing down old infrastructures and replacing with new. The Men here have worked here for years and knew how to make it flow together as a team. The Men I worked with were all stand up guys couldn't ask for a better team to be on.

good,"Great Benefits! Fast paced enviroment, great management team."
good,"The people of CenterPoint are wonderful. I truly enjoy the job and it is a very family friendly company. The hardest part of the job is the fact that things are ever changing. Once you get a handle on something it changes and situations are never the same.

I am chosing not to relocate and therefore I am looking for a new employer."

good,Great safety and corporate culture! There was room to grow and the company offered numerous professional development opportunities. The most important part of the job was working with the hands-on employees to see what they see in the field and at customer locations.
good,My job at Centerpoint is appliance repair.  Most of my day is spent driving to customers home and fixing their appliance.  Technical knowledge is needed for this job.  The hardest part of the job is you are always working on different things you might have never worked on before but the support you get from other technicians is great.  The benefits are the best I have ever had including 6% 401 k match and a 5% pension after 3 years.

good,I could not work for a better company. Everyday is full of new and different situations that make it easy to gain a vast amount of knowledge from various people and personal research. The management team is not one that micromanages or is constantly over the employees to verify things are done. They treat everyone with respect and are more personable than most average workers in a typical setting.
good,"CenterPoint Energy's HR department is like no other.  Each function is separate, allowing employees to be masterful within an area instead of spread too thin over many areas.  The team environment is great, because everyone realizes they need the entire team to function as a productive unit.  Employees are treated as people inside and outside of the organization."
good,"My day starts early in the morning and is over when the work is done. It's a fun place to work and safety is the number one key at this job. The management team is always on top of answering questions and helping employees. We are broken down into teams and everyone works together. I can't say that there is part of this job that is hard, but the enjoyable part is when we have company lunch-ins."
good,CenterPoint was the best job honestly I ever had! I really miss the job: the thrill of making people lives safer and also repairing leaks that I would find! I enjoyed building meter sets and I also learned how to work Microsoft Outlook and other applications with my personal computer. The only reason on my exiting was because my wife graduated from college and had a job opportunity we couldn't refuse. I left on a good note though...
