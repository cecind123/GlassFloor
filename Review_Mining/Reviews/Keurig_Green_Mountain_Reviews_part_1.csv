rating,review
bad,"Keurig attempted to enter the soda market and failed to launch a successful product. Combined with other major missteps, the organization required layoffs and an angel investor."
bad,"This company is rampant with a cut throat mentality with an obvious buddy system. Don't expect to get any decent raises, or promotions unless your the managers buddy because it doesn't matter how well you do or work, you simply won't get it."
bad,"No room for advancement. Pay as a material handler is below average, pay is below average for position as a material handler"
bad,"I was part of the company that made it was, then power and money got in the way and we were taken in a direction that cost everyone a lot. They should stick with coffee and appliances and leave all other’s alone"
bad,"Management is the biggest issue, they don't know what's going on. They don't care about safety or fairness. Management is clueless to the work process and flow, they're to busy hiding in breakrooms that are unaccessible to employees"
bad,"do not recommend working here. I've seen people leaving within a the year they were hired. Benefits have been slowly taken away. Managers are all about the company, not about the employee. Don't expect help from anyone."
bad,"Very cutthroat and stressful  pay is not even equal to what the company expects of a person, they also like to make up rules as they go and expect people to confirm to their changes as need be,the only thing good their was benefits"
bad,"This place treats you very horribly. The HR department has done a huge turnover.  There is now one HR guy that has been there for less than a year, and all the others have quit because of poor treatment.  The Plant manager has barely been there a year, and the production manager was just hired.  The same goes for a safety manager.  When upper level management and HR staff don't even want to work there, that speaks volumes. "
bad,This used to be a wonderful place to work however with the new CEO doest care about the people or the culture this company has always been known for. The managers treat people as if they are their puppets.
bad,"Once the owner was forced out and corporate forces took over, you never knew if you were going to have a job by the end of the day. It was all about the money, thus the work/life balance was way off unless you fought against it. They installed very bad managers who far outnumbered the very good managers. Loved my team, but grew to dislike everything the company stood for. Keurig did not appreciate their greatest assets; the employees and the coffee culture. Hope for the sake of the people that are still there, that things are changing for them since the private buy-out."
bad,"I worked in the knoxville plant for 4 yrs,at first it was great until I started to figure out who the brown nose experts were,if you weren't spending your time with your nose up the bosses rear end you could forget it.They preach safety but that only applied when someone had an accident,they preached cleanliness but that only applied when they knew an audit was coming.The HR was a major joke and management was full of the buddy system.Go ahead and apply and pray you don't get hired!"
bad,This job sucked they worked you long hours they don’t care about your safety they only worry about producing cups they suck here big time don’t go plz
bad,"Poor Leadership and Not quality minded anymore. All the love and compassion for this  ""once great company"" has been replaced by the bottom line... Your Money!!"
bad,"Typical manufacturing plant/ push, push, push."
bad,Keurig Green Mountain is ran very poorly by upper management. Very nasty supervisors who like to pick on works and creates a hostile environment for workers to work in.
bad,"A typical day is fighting one fire with another and rearranging fires to make room for more.  With so many rounds of layoffs, it has created a very tense atmosphere for new and old employees alike.  There are a few members of Senior Management who have their own favorites and make it clear if you are one of them.  One in particular is a bully to many and HR has chosen to protect this individual for years,regarless of how many complaints they have received.  It's a shame what has become of this."
bad,"The changes over the last 5 years have been unbelievable.  Any position that could be outsourced has been or will be as soon as possible.  Very top heavy organization.  Good leadership at top level for most part, poor at mid and lower levels.  Due to high degree of outsourcing, little or no opportunity for advancement.  Most positions are filled from outside when there is an opening.  Moral for most is generally poor, with a fairly large exodus of employees.  "
bad,This is a company you work hard and management don't care about there employees.  They come on the floor don't speak.  They don't back you up when there is a problem.  They don't engage with employees.  It is hard for African Americans to advance in this company.  You have all the qualifications to do a job but they will tell you they are trying something different with the culture.  That's not telling me anything. The pay will okay.  The benefits are okay.  By the company not having a union the rules change as they see fit.
bad,"What used to be a great and supportive company culture is no longer.  Senior Management plays favorites and on Manager in particular is a flat out bully that HR has protected for years, even though countless employees have complained about his behavior."
bad,HR manger is not fit for his job or day to day tasks. HR manger is not on the same page as the plant and has no knowledge of whats happening on the floor.
bad,Senior leadership needs to do a better job or ensuring the company's priorities get escalated down through the entire organization. A lack of true focus and prioritization results in many people working too long of hours and working on projects that end up not having an impact. There are many highly intelligent and driven people who help make Keurig a better place to work. If only the company would utilize their employees more effectively.
bad,You're gonna need all that free coffee to make this one trick pony business continue to stay viable.  JAB needs to make money on its $14B investment and sales are slowing.  Sr and Executive management will cash out big while the rest get roasted.
bad,"They talk about fairness and equality,  but treat most employees like cogs in the Keurig money machine.  Pretend to listen to employees, then ignore or take credit for there ideas."
bad,"Nice place to work and great benefits. "
bad,"It pains me to write this because I had such hopes for this company. After all  from the surface it had all the qualities that I admired in a company. It was local, it was growing, it advertised the values of honesty and hard work. It also gave back to the community, was green. Well I guess I was the only thing green. "
bad,"Company has internal conflicts between offices that does not allow flexible work schedules and long hours."
bad,Keurig had difficulties when the businesses obscene growth curve flattened in a few month's time.  The free-wheeling entrepreneurial approach to the business yielded to micro-management and heavy control of all aspects of the business such that the best talent left.
bad,Typical day is 9 to 12 hours of non-stop driving and working The company's turnover rate is high and this makes it difficult to get days off because of how understaffed they are.
bad,"Job started out great. Then after the Dr Pepper merger last summer (which most employees now believe was a complete buyout) we have no benefits. We no longer got free coffee, discounts on brewers, and the bonus we got right before Christmas (which helped TREMENDOUSLY) was put off until after the first of the year when Dr Pepper employees received theirs. Dr Pepper employees were offered our ""half off"" beverage incentive, but we have yet to see any benefit from working with or 'alongside' them. The insurance was complete garbage. It's honestly cheaper to die than try to meet your deductible. You have a lot of work placed on you, with no reasonable amount of time to get things done. Changeovers are always a disaster. It was a wonderful job when I started, but Dr Pepper dragged us down quicker than expected."
bad,"I've worked at this job four three years, it all started out great in the beginning then things started to change rapidly. This job has very poor management, and they're racist and they discriminate TERRIBLE! Bad place to work as far as with the people/management but they pay very good money (Annual salary atleast 45,000/year) and have GREAT benefits. I hope something gets done soon about the management to make the job a better place again."
bad,"Over the years, the company grew into a corporate giant and the senior and mid level positions were filled with people that only thought about profits. This created an atmosphere in which different departments would blame other departments due to the pressure from above."
bad,My experience at Keurig was very short but started off great with a wonderful supervisor. I left within a month due to the amount of racism. I understand it's everywhere but morning meetings definitely isn't the place for it nor should it ever be tolerated. My experience was it being laughed at instead by others in higher positions than me. I chose to leave as that type of environment isn't good for anyone. I loved everything else about the job
good,Keurig had an ever changing management team and ever changing priorities which hampered growth.  They were not customer friendly. m poor record of innovation beyond initial Keurig.
good,"minimal interaction with other groups, manager left  company I was not aware until my weekly status meeting  that his office was cleaned out, strange company, nice facilities, would not go back as a contractor."
good,Over worked and held responsible for too many jobs with very little staff. Never consistent with anything from supervisors to work procedures. Constant change.
good,"When I started, the culture was significantly better. As the company lost its CEO to the Coca-Cola CEO, the workplace became uninspired, sobered with job cuts and pay reductions."
good,"Work at times from 3:30pm to whenever but now its been from 3:30pm to 9pm"
good,"okay place to work, upper management needs some improvement a lot of things that needs to be changed but they do not value"
good,"enjoyed working there,like the people,but my boyfriend is working in newport new and we would like to move to Hampton .So I would to find a job within 20 to 30 mins."
good,"...But wait for 3 months and the procedure that WAS implemented will be dumped and changed again."
good,"The changes over the past few years have caused a degradation of culture within Keurig. It is no longer a Vermont company with Vermont values. "
good,"This is a great company if your coming out of college and need a place to start.  Befits are good and you will get the standard amount of vacation time that will increase as you work for the company longer."
good,Depending if I was a machine operator or working as a material handler. I also worked in shipping an receiving. I was able to work in all these positions. The management I always got along with. The hardest part was dealing with people who did not care about there job.I enjoyed learning and getting the product out on time making sure it was done with quality and safely.
good,"Company in transition. Our future hinges on the success of Geyser, our new counter top soda machine which many believe is priced too high"
good,"I learned a great deal about the manufacturing industry while working at this company. There was a stark difference between managers and their methods. Unfortunately mine was a manager who felt threatened by incoming talent and led our team with fear, erratic behavior and passive aggression.  There is no means of reporting manager behavior apart from reporting directly to HR, which resulted in one person being let go immediately. I would have loved to have explored other areas in the company as they are hiring rapidly, but my manager made that very difficult."
good,"I love working for what this company used to believe in. I love the people and the perceived culture, but with all of the acquisitions over the past two years, the company has changed. The newest merger was with Dr.Pepper and this changed everything that this company stood for. We were a coffee company. Now we are a beverage company that doesn't care if they get rid of talent. Lay offs are indiscriminate. You could be working 60 hour weeks and traveling to customer sites one day, and gone the next. This lack of security means that many very talented people have left, leaving those of us that stay having to take on many additional tasks to pick up the slack."
good,"KGM is a high performance organization led by an outstanding CEO.   Company has a strong vision and clear strategy for both short term and long term growth.      Organization brings in best in class talent,  very much HP environment."
good,"Work hard,  must take breaks, some Dept's. Must work OT but you have a choice,  if your a friend or relative of management you will get hired, bonuses lean some years,  raises low per once a year,  one week training then your on your own,  watch out for the manager's smiles they are all about falling over each other to get that green star which is Keurig Green Mountain,     if you rock the boat to much you get a desk job with higher pay. watch out for your self as management does not have your back."
good,"Corporate culture was great, 99% of my co workers were knowledgeable, hard working and easy to work with. Great team effort."
good,Company is not organized as far as administrtaion. The shifts are to long. need to go back to 8 hour shifts. Promotions are not processed fairly. Management show favortism.
good,Too much nepotism and favortism.  Excellent pay and benefits but company is starting to lay off.  Everyone is looking elsewhere.  Management has totally destroyed what was once good.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Keurig Green Mountain has great benefits. There are good employees that work there but team work is not the case all the time. Their management team is horrible, as well as their HR manager. It's hit or miss."
good,"Organizing the flow of coffee to the packaging machines"
good,Decent company that has gone through significant change recently. Enjoyed my time there and co-workers were great to work with. Café time and time off was great plus.
good,The job in itself is good. Management is rough. Been through multiple supervisors. The operators have to sense of urgency and want to stop the line any chance they can. Zero teamwork.
good,workplace culture is ok  great pay  people are nice.  I would recommend it to most people to work at  right now the work load is very low  looking to see where the company be next year this time
good,"testing software"
good,This company had tons of potential. Management and corporate got in the way of a highly functioning team environment. Expectations where set too high with not enough resources. People below management really care about the job and co-workers.
good,I didn't have a lot of time at the company but for the time that I was there I had a lot of things that I learned and I was very satisfied with the overall of the company
good,"Keurig has undergone some major changes in the almost 3 years I have been there.  The mentality of the leadership is that they can easily replicate the disruptiveness of the K-Cup.  Unfortunately, the K-Cup was successful mostly because of luck, not with a great innovation process or business model.  The K-Cup got lucky."
good,"Running a machine and learning something different about it every day.I have learned to watch and take notes to everything that the engineers fixed or done to the machine. Trouble shooting takes alot of time, you have to be very quick and patient. the only thing i have to say about management is more communication and feed back on advancement for those who deserves it.I work well with everyone,  I just have a problem with lazy co-workers who doesn't pull their wait. the hardest part of my job is working nights on the 12 hr shift, when i am use to working days.Learning the machine in all areas is the most enjoyable part of the job for me, knowing what i am doing and being able to explain it means alot to me."
good,Work was fun until we received new management and they felt they had something to prove since they were new. The started to micromanage the operator and begin to enforce new rules that the operators weren't informed about.
good,"Willing and always ready to work no matter the day, situation or anything."
good,Good company to work for. the pay is good and the benefits are good as well.   Upper management can be a little hard to deal with.   lots of locations and positions.
good,A very difficult industry to get good at and very busy at all times.  Average week was 40 million cups per week with a peak week of 52 million cups.  Tough place to be a supervisor at because plant leadership team only seems to get involved when things are going wrong.  Not a lot of people there took the time to get to know the processes so a supervisor is pretty much on their own there.  Not a lot of topcover there for supervisors.
good,"1)Simply very superb project, and i relived because of my contract period of this project will ended soon, if you get chance means don't miss this company all employees are good in nature"
good,"It was a fun and rewarding experience but it was filled with tenseness an ever-changing plan that was at times ambiguous and far-flung.  If you are ok with not knowing the real plan, its a good place to put your time in."
good,It was a great job with good benifits recommend it for people trying to start a career! I was let go over a safety technicality. If you were out there follow all safety rules!
good,"The company treated me very well, daily travel from home was to long of me. It was changing management while it was growing. shifting focus with every change."
good,"Constant major re-organizational changes."
good,"The management for interns and coops was hit or miss.  Some interns were given very stimulating projects, whereas in my case the manager was difficult to reach and not responsive."
good,"Start work with team meeting (huddle). Complete pre run tests and checks. Ensure packaging and labels correspond with product being run. Preform all QC checks during packaging process and record results on line paperwork/QC data base. Work with other team members to complete our production quotas while maintaining company production and safety standards. "
good,"As a Maintenance Technician you are responsible for the upkeep of the machines. If an operator encounters an issue, we are called to troubleshoot and fix the issue as soon as possible and as safely as possible. We are also required to perform weekly, monthly and semi annual PM's on the machine to prevent any preventable downtime."
good,"New executive leadership is not cohesive, does not do what they say and does not foster growth and advancement.  Very poor morale over the last 2 years."
good,Management is sketchy. Always rumors circling around about closing. Some benefits are almost impossible to recieve even if you qualify. Ex education assistance
good,Big building and facility very open and high end in its manufacturing. Young and brilliant minds all around the building and alot of potential in the field.
good,"I've been working at Green Mountain for 3 years, this company has gone down since the change of management. The ONLY thing that matters at the VA plant is the kcups! I wouldn't not recommend this job to anyone. Yes the pay is decent the benefits ok, but you have no life, work/family balance doesn't exist! We work every weekend yes we get days off during the week but that's when your children are in school."
good,"Really great platform to sell. Meets the needs of so many different segments."
good,"When I started at Keurig I felt like I was part of A family that supported me and wanted to see me succeed.  There were many opportunities for moving up and learning new skills.  "
good,"Several ownership changes have turned it from a Employee/Family Friendly employer, to one that is finding new ways to reduce workforce through attrition.."
good,"Good place to work for hourly employees, not so much for salaried. Expected a lot from salaried workers. Very fast paced and stressful. Overtime was common."
good,"Employees get to work with a great consumer brand and they have an opportunity to make an impact in most roles. Currently, there is a focused and clear strategy. There is free coffee and beautiful office space."
good,"I am not a liberty to say as I was a contractor.      "
good,A typical day at work would be getting in at 7 a.m. and starting my day off with making sure the brewer that I have to test if functioning correctly. Then it's off to testing the life span of the brewer. The most enjoyable part of the job was entering the Data given to me from the brewers being tested.
good,"Great products and services many opportunities at the company sales, marketing, management. Very nice people with a nice office in Boston that has covered parking."
good,"Despite some drawbacks, this is still a good place to work in Vermont. It's a bit disorganized and sometimes lacks a focus. Plus, it's big business now."
good,"I initially thought that I would stay at Keurig Dr Pepper until I was ready to retire. Working 12.5 hours a day was something to get used to but the the amount of time off was good and it was easy for me to get things done in my personal life. Then the management changed and it became a tense place to work at where you walked around on eggshells. Favoritism became the culture and only people who were ""in good"" with supervisors and managers were able to move ahead. I was fortunate to have supervisors who were mostly fair. A few were definitely in favor of certain team members and not others. The head of HR was actually terminated for racism. That should give you an idea of the energy of the place. Once upper management was terminated, the culture really went downhill and I realized it was time to go ahead and leave, that and the inability to advance. "
good,I worked at Keurig for 12.  One of my favorite things about working there was the explicit focus the company had on it's employees and employee development.
good,"Working as a contractor for the company wasn't ideal. Human Resources was not clear about the parameters of the contract and it was extended several times with little to no notice. "
good,"Each day brings forth a new challenge that requires critical thinking and problem solving. Great challenges worked on together with a great team. Due to this - there is never a dull moment as one learns new skills, tips, tricks daily."
good,"I only interned for 3 months during the summer, but I had the opportunity to work in different parts of the finance department and get to know members of upper management. Overall, great company to work for."
good,"This company offers great benefits and the people you meet are amazing, intelligent, and very resourceful. The company has undergone many changes over the past few years, so change resilience is key!"
good,The management does not off adequate training and shift blame when mistakes are made. The job itself is wonderful the true friendships that are developed make working ads group very easy
good,Typical day loading and unloading trucks keeping warehouse clean by picking all orders to put on trucks and staging the others.very fast pace the job is easy just the 12 hrs
good,Fast paced busy days and good benefits. The hardest part of the job is the twelve hour shift on concrete floors. Always know theres going to be work to do.
good,"Good place to work, good people in all departments. "
good,"Provided a stepping stone for future career opportunities. Much to learn about the coffee industry, and with the new products on the horizon."
good,"It's a dynamic and challenging work environment, however it is a wonderful opportunity. Excellent benefits and a great staff to work with."
good,Excellent opportunities to partner for success within the community
good,Okay place to work the  only thing thats bad is working 12 hours a day. Don't get a lot of rest because of how the work schedule. Never enough time to spend with your family.
good,Keurig Green Mountain has gone through many changes over the years and has turned the corner in a positive way the last few years.  They are moving in a good direction and the organization has a bright future.
good,"Leader in single serve coffee.  Exciting innovation.  Rapidly changing marketplace.  New management JAB aggressively going after coffee market (Peets, Panera, Krispy, Keurig)"
good,"Fast paced, highly technical work environment, challenging work, high management turnover, great people, lacks global diversity, great community service"
good,"It's a good place to work if you are coming into the company as mid-career employee, engineer, or in finance. Company has rapidly changed since being acquired by JAB."
good,"Great place for veterans. Pleasant work crews. Relaxed work flow. I would recommend this job to anyone. I most enjoyed the availability of overtime. 12hr shifts were also a plus, it allowed me to have more days off and still remain 80hrs a paycheck."
good,"12h Schichten in der Lebensmittel Industrie, in der ständig Zeitdruck herrscht. Werkzeuge die ich nicht mal in der Garage haben will und eine Werkstatt die nur halb fertig ist... Andererseits gute Vergünstigungen und für die USA überdurchschnittliche Krankenversicherung und Urlaubstage. Nach der Übernahme durch JAB muss abgewartet werden wie es weitergeht."
good,"Company is going through growth and change.  It's moving in the right direction, employees must adapt quickly.  There are opportunities to move around in the company, and apply for new roles.  Hiring managers choose carefully, and therefore new hires are chosen who work well together with their teams."
good,"Large company in the Northeast that provides great benefits and a great culture, however office politics can be a roadblock for career advancement and potential job growth."
good,The atmosphere of this job was very good.  Most of the people were friendly and helpful and management was pretty good.  The benefits were amazing!!
good,"The company has interested, concerned, generally very happy people working for it. This makes it a most desirable place to work in my eyes. "
good,"Keurig Green Mountain is a fun place to work at; the culture, the employees, the management are caring. so far, they seem to mean everything they say. they provide great benefits, in addition to benefits, they also provide learning opportunities."
good,They have some young people that are in the supervisory position and not having the life experience. Some are not having the technical feeling and understanding of what they do. I understand what you are saying but i don't get it.
good,"continuous CPI, occasional reactive repairs, non stop projects. never a dull moment. on the job training was critical because the technologies used are still relatively new."
good,I learned that communication between you and your boss can be tricky.  I enjoyed my time at Keurig for what it was.  They pay very well and everyone is very nice.
good,Pay attention to detail. Work as a team. Be safe all the time. Never rush. Check labels check spec sheets always. If you don't no ask.  Know your givens. Strive to meet your production minimum.
good,"Great place to be and work . Team environment. Excellent pay, good work and life balance, safety oriented. Great place to work for beginners in manufacturing/ production."
good,"Fast paced company, with very good working conditions, good people, however management needs improvement."
good,"Not a bad place to work but truly do not have a clear path on day to day activities and priorities."
good,"wonderful people who don't take themselves too seriously. Excellent perks and facilities. Company couldn't keep up with the pace of its own growth, creating a lot of stress for employees."
good,"it's gone downhill as it has grown,  but i think it will improve over the next few years."
good,"A very friendly culture. A high level of teamwork. Lots of courses for personal growth. Paid community action events. Many safety plans in play. Although I believe safety should come first always, sometimes it gets in the way of efficiency. It is hard to change a policy once its in effect."
good,"i work at keurig monday thru friday 8:00 till 4:30 my most enjoyable part of my job is being the people their great to work with. friendly kind and understanding. my typical day at work is coming to work sit down at my desk check the brewers, see if there working properly and how long they show take in brewing the tempature. if theirs something wronge with them i make sure the manager knows about the problem. also make sure i write down the problem so it will be in the system."
good,"Honestly, I enjoyed and learned from techno-functional perspective in my six year stay at Keurig. My position has been eliminated due to outsourcing of jobs which I hate it."
good,"Positive, challenging and great work culture. Very supportive and excellent team managers and coaches. They believed in employee satisfaction, safety and training."
good,was treated fairly and paid well work was fair and understandable and well thought out processes I was given the tools to do my job correctly management was fair.
good,Keurig Green Mountain is a great place to work. I enjoyed my 11.5yrs very much. I left because my department was downsizing. Overall culture is great.
good,Hard to judge the company as I work here as a contractor. They do seem to have a good culture and the physical environment is very nice. They do not smile upon working from home which could reduce the companies expenses and carbon foot print. This seems to me to be a little out of the times.
good,"A typical day of work at Keurig, was organizing each coffee maker in its particular section in its cases. Non-stop moving and making sure that each coffee maker is specifically placed at its correct section. Management was fair, as long as we did the job, we had our own self-time at work.My co-workers and I were really great team players and were nice to one another. Their was not much of the hardest part of the job. Something enjoyable, was that their was water throughout the day at work for us."
good,Keurig Green Mountain is an ok place to work. I had fun while I worked there. the people there were pretty cool also. there are several safety issues there. they also don't train you very well. the biggest problem there is when something goes wrong its always the temps fault.
good,"this is a good job to work, you do not have anyone on top of you as long as you finish your work on time, they trust in your work that you do, the people are good and they do too many events."
good,"Robotic Production lines make for a very easy work day. Friendly people, and decent pay. Chances of advancement do not happen often. IF OFFERED A POSITION, DO NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED! This is a great company to work for."
good,Everyone is very nice  even management..... lol... i love coffee and working coffee production is awesome.  Its a pace your steps and keep focus on what you do.
good,Great place to work. completely happy with my job and where i work. I wanted to get a feel for other opportunities in the area. All and all Keurig Green Mountain is a great place to work.
good,Good job and great pay. Friendly staffs and work team. Benefits are awesome and open door policy is great. Everyone may have there own views but I can say overall it's a great place to work.
good,good days at work. things run pretty well when things don't everyone work together when problems arise. People are friendly and supervisior are on point.
good,"The new building is great, great work environment, great people and a great company.  Plus all the coffee you can drink.  I really enjoy working for this company."
good,"Very quiet, calm place to work, and also very good. "
good,Worthwhile experience testing new products for Keurig Inc.  Good work environment with coworkers and management.
good,"This is a company built on great brands and great products, even a great mission.  There is an excellent group of talented employees that are also highly collaborative.  It is a supportive environment for challenging yourself and learning.  It is an environment that is steeped in change and relatively fast-paced, but still offers decent balance overall, at least in the marketing function."
good,A typical day at work could consist on doing the exact same thing for weeks to working on a completely new task everyday. I learned how to work very well with a new team on any given day and also how to work on a solitary project all on my own. The management was always encouraging and helpful. They were always looking for new learning opportunities for employees to challenge us. The culture was friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was driving an hour one way to get there and another hour to get home. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with new people and the job always kept me busy!
good,Great work/life balance.  Opportunities exist for those willing to prepare theirselves and perform.  Exciting to have been a part of the tremendous growth witnessed over the last decade.
good,"I loved working at Keurig for the Quality Control Testing Department. I began the position before the Management changes began. Everyone I worked with, including my Managers, were professional, easy to work with & helpfuI. I worked through an agency and tried to become an employee but unfortunately it didn't work out. Because of working here, I would welcome a position in the QC field."
good,The job was a great idea just hate it didn't take off like they anticipated. It had a great core of people. Great pay and benifits.
good,"Comunicación y enfoque en seguridad , toman mucho encuentra la familia"
good,"Great Place to work "
good,12 hour shifts alternating from 3 and 4 days per week.  Management is very good. Almost everyone is willing to help out of you're having trouble. The hardest part of this job in my opinion was having to be on your feet for the 12 hours in the steel toe shoes. The most enjoyable part is the 3/4 day weekends
good,"Good environment great management ,ability to learn different skills,safe work place safety always first I would recommend anyone that looking for a job Keurig will be the best start"
good,"One the best company to work for, engaging all the workers for continues improvement program and thriving to the best!!"
good,I was there for 8 years and the work was great but the management changed way to often. the culture was good but competitive. The people that i worked with was great there.
good,My position was only temporary but I enjoyed my time here.  I was able to learn a lot and work with a collaborative group of very smart people. Highly recommend.
good,"Great group off people to work with, and the facility is amazing. Free coffee whenever you want. Management is very understanding and flexible."
good,The work load varies from day to day but it’s usually not overbearing. Each day is a continuous learning process. There’s something different to do each day so you won’t get stuck doing the same job
