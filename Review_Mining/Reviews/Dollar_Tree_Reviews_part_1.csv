rating,review
bad,"They have bad management and terrible customer service. The cashiers are not customer friendly unless they know you. There's alot of dishonesty and theifver, by Employees and managers, and customers."
bad,I felt I was treated unfairly by the managers of this company. I had less hours than everyone else and the managers were rude to me. The pay is ok and there is not really any benefits.
bad,"For a basic minimum wage job, I can't say much. You can expect to get out what you put into this store. Usually pleasant customers, definitely a big plus. Other than that, I would not return."
bad,Hours and pay is horrible. I would not recommend anyone to work for them. Managers are lazy and will throw you under the bus. Worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,"If you’re looking for a small job with good management, this isn’t the one for you  Management was horrible, the store was very unclean and the environment over all was not a positive one"
bad,"Everything about this store was just terrible. I had just found out I was pregnant and needed a job so I applied. I never had a chance to properly and professionally inform my manager about the pregnancy. They heard about it from other people and said ""I have my sources"", when I asked about how they knew. Needless to say I was treated like dirt due to my severe morning sickness and inability to work as hard as they wanted. Manager asked me once, who my father was, due to my looking familiar to them. Once they found out, they were always rude or cold to me. Most of the employees were racist and always accused the African-American and Latino communities of stealing every time they came in. The store was always a mess due to not scheduling enough people per shift to stock shelves and run registers."
bad,This company was the worst company I have ever worked for. I was a store manager and had absolutely no support from the DM..and actually he made problems at the store with my leadership. He worked against me in the worst ways with an assistant manager that was nothing but evil. And his boss only condoned what he did to prevent the company from looking bad as they are..Very very disrespectful and dishonest to their employees.
bad,Company runs you ragged.  Expect you not to have a life. No training No Management No place to work No respect work ovetime no pay management is self center jerks
bad,I worked at the dollar tree in steub oh it was the worst place a person could work for u only receive 2 days a week to work on the schedule only for 4 hrs a day the cashier's are very rude and always smell like marijuana plus the managers are not friendly and never help with nothing if u check out the bathroom it stay nasty and smell very bad I just pray it get shut down soon
bad,I worked there almost 3 years u cannot live on what u make. Employees need to work more than one job while working there! Management employees do not take pride in there work or jobs. They bring there kids to work with them -- that is not the way I was raised u go to work to do a job not to entertain your kids
bad,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, it was very very easy and stress relieving. It just  didn’t pay enough for me to drive back and forth everyday to and from work and home."
bad,If you are reading any of these comments and they are saying positive things about the company they are either apart of the management team or a fork lift driver. If you are anything else you will hate your life and wish you have never applied if you think the money is good you are sadly mistaken because you will have rather signed up to get hit by buses for free than work here
bad,"They are the most selfish company, they only care about numbers. They will be so kind to your face and then behind your back plot to have you fired. They make you work off the clock."
bad,Not a fair company at all. I don’t get treated fairly at all. It’s a bad environment and the company doesn’t give enough hours to anybody except the Manager.
bad,"All i will say is dont apply to the dollar tree on american legion highway in roslindale,ma. there was unfair treatment and other issues with that location."
bad,I did receiving for this company and only lasted a month until I had enough. They make you come in at 5am to stock shelves even if you only applied for receiving.
bad,"They are going to stick you on power line and you are gonna throw cases of gallons of water all day, you will be constantly disrespected over worker and under paid."
bad,"Absolutely no one makes money at this company besides the CEO. Store management position doesn't even make very much. Have 8 assistant managers but one person has to close 5 days a week? No benefits, no flexibility they're basically always hiring for nights because they try and put all the closing shifts on one manager (even though they have like 7 other assistant managers) so they're constantly hiring for it and will let just about anyone do it, which includes managing the store safe."
bad,Little pay little hours not worth it unless your desperate. Random days and work schedule. Cants make plans or have a life working different shifts. Not full time work or benefits
bad,"this is probably the biggest joke of a job a person could ever have. you don’t get paid enough for the things you have to deal with. management is a joke, they discuss your personal / medical matters with other employees without your permission, the list goes on."
bad,I did not like the culture of the store/company. Not a very good place to work. Low wages and hard work. The employees were disrespectful and many that were hired had ongoing drug addictions.
bad,Goals are not clear and change from day to day with no actual goals being achieved. Work keeps piling up and the stores are for the most part are extremely understaffed.
bad,I was contantly degraded by the manager and promised a job title to thw work i was already doing. I never got a promotion and it was held over my head to take advantage of my great work ethic.
bad,Would never go back to work at dollar tree in inc. worst company to work for. They promise promotion and recognition for work but don't. But have no problem using you as management with out paying you for that position as promised.
bad,Pay is trash  u get paid 7.25 and hour to deal with rude co-workers and disrespectful customers the hours are  unstable it's not worth the time at all 😑😡
bad,"As an overnight stocker our payrate is faud , because as an overnight stocker our rate of pay as a stocker should start at our clock in time not two hours later."
bad,"Working at Dollar Tree offered no chance of advancement, when I started was told there were no raises no matter how long you worked there, or how hard you worked. Flat rate! Never changed! The store was unorganized, management was tough to deal with and there was absolutely no flexibility!"
bad,"This job environment is terrible it have lack of hrs, They work you like crazy always complaining they over hrs they don't let you do your whole shift if you over hrs, they will just send u home a hr early. The male managers favortize  the female of his color, they take hrs and give them to them favorite people... Dollar Tree is and will always be a joke!!!"
bad,"I'm lucky if i get scheduled more than 2 days a week, i've only once brought in 200 on a check and i'm facing eviction because i never get any hours in an economy that just isn't hiring. When you bring this up to management and beg on your hands and knees for more hours they give you MAYBE a third day of work, if you're extremely lucky you get 4 days. Management doesn't care."
bad,"Do not even consider working here. Sales driven, period. The most negative, uneducated, stressed to the maximum Managers. No one smiles. Horrible! Tons of criticism and no through training from Manager."
bad,"Company only cares about making money, through whatever means it takes. Unfair to the management and it’s employees. Trucks are always late which causes everyone’s shifts to be re arranged, not a very good work life balance at all."
bad,"I felt like this place was not a safe place to work. Running the cash resister, cleaning and restocking when it was not busy. Some of management were not very helpful.The hardest part of the job would be working the truck. Some of the customers made the job enjoyable."
bad,"The two managers I ever had to work with that I know of who’s names I’m not going to mention on here. Are very nice, respectable, reliable, trustworthy, and go above and beyond to making sure of their employees feel very welcomed and trained in properly and to know what needs to be done by keeping it a safe, warm, welcomed company for family and friends in our community."
bad,"Not too much to say good, so I would really rather say nothing!  I would not recommend anyone to work there that has any ambition to advance or do anything positive!"
bad,"I was disrespected to upper management, As my supervisor used this to his advantage to gain more work from me to fit what he wanted. I was not given proper directions when moved to different departments."
bad,The manager is not very friendly to costumers or the employees..not a good store to work at and under paid for the work you have to do.never have enough hours weekly..every week the manager comes up with different things one week you might work 2 days and the following week you might not have any so for two weeks you only make 8 to 10 hours
bad,Awful company. Corporation is awful. They dont help you succeed at all. They put you down way to much. Over work you and under pay you for what you do for them.. Favoritism is really bad at dollar tree
bad,i hated half my time there honestly the managers didnt listen when problems occurred and if they did they didnt care enough to help us work through them
bad,"Terrible place to work "
bad,Dollar Tree doesn’t give no money hourly or weekly hours worst company I have ever worked for .. they don’t care about your well being if you have enough money to pay your bills eat drink etc . They expect you to work all day non stop while management sits around and talks all day barely even doing their job in the store . Store is always dirty hardly anything on the shelves etc . Not a very good environment.
bad,"When employees had health concerns, Management did not seem to care or think those concerns had any type of priority. One would think that if you are going into a job and if this employer has you think you can count on them and that they care about your concerns because you work so hard for them, that your employer would be concerned when their employees' health is at risk and only getting worse, but this was not the case when working at this company."
bad,I was hired for seasonal stocker. I was then told that I had to wait 2 weeks until I could even start. I waited the 2 weeks and no call. I called to speak to the GM and then was told to speak to the stocking manager since they had my schedule. They were never around. Finally stopped into the store and got ahold of the stocking manager. They said that I'll have to wait another 2 weeks for hours.
bad,"the owner expects you to do way to much, he doesnt care about customer input or struggles. i found he was more concerned on trying to save time and fill the shelves as much as possible, doesnt matter theres already 5 cases out and they are falling off the shelf"
bad,Your under paid for the work you do. Then you have people who dont know what there doing as store managers. District managers and HR will not respond if you have a problem. Honestly keep looking better just to work at McDonald's
bad,New manager is going to sink that store . She says she hates her customers and her job so it makes her employees miserable. She is lazy and never works her full shift. The old manager ran a number 1 store!
bad,"too many call outs/no shows"
bad,"manager did not communicate what he wanted done just said put out freight and service customers. no respect for what you accomplished. no help.. only you and another cashier in the store after the manager left, leaving you to clean and straighten the entire store.  manager did not help at all. just concerned with his truck"
bad,Great place to work if you don't have bills. Open availability a must because someone will call out daily.  Lack of communication between management. Friendly customers help make the job fun.
bad,This job was very unorganized. The manager would say one thing and do another. I would always show up on time and put in extra hours. They were always short on staff and expected others to make up for the loss.
bad,This place is a real mess !Pays sucks store never clean mangers petty n talk about their employees They give no hrs and back room is badly over stock!
bad,If you followed the 'company standards' the DM would tell you that you were doing things wrong.  It was confusing and difficult to get things done since you were made to do things over and over.  But if you did them the way they said they wanted they would tell you to follow company standards.  very frustrating.
bad,I broke my butt besides cashiering stocking and ALWAYS looking for the manager! It's a awful company to work for. Managers scream at you loudly throw things if things dont go their way! That's why I quit after 3 1/2 yrs!
bad,"Terrible place to work.  There was no work/life balance because the schedule was constantly being changed due to the numerous truck rescheduling,  sometimes 2/3 times a week. Impossible to plan your life that way. The DM for the Naples Market is a nold face liar and refused to pay me for the vacation I took, before I left the company.  Stay away from Slave Tree!"
bad,"When I worked there, the manager was always late or just never there. The staff was rude and wouldn't help me even though I worked there to! It was just a weird place altogether. Glad I left."
bad,"honestly they think more corporate than their own employees, managers get written off as replaceable after all their hard work during seasonal. retail is hard and unforgiving"
bad,I dislike dollar tree because of the work ethics and honest. Employees didn't come to work or did their job. Manger didn't understand my school schedule. He schedule me the way he wanted me to work I only had one car and he knew that. But I got a very bad experience at dollar tree.
bad,Company only cares about the Dollar. Poor customer service standards.  No support from corporate.  Harsh work environment. Unprofessional upper management.
bad,"great job for cashiers, be flexible and close to the job. Holiday hours are the absolute worse, management is a mess as no one can get it together. Do not become a manager."
bad,I didnt like the store manager we would always get into it from the beginning we was getting along up until the point where she would always write me up for every little thing
bad,I do not recommend work for this company well at least not the South Belt store in Saint Joseph Mo a day for me was get to work enjoy the time until the store manager came in  then listen to her belittle and put people down confront her she knows nothing about it it everyone elses fault for anything that goes wrong
bad,Poor upper management. Over work all employees and high turn over rates. Dont care about employee relations at all. District manager not open to ideas or communication
bad,"This job is by far the worst job I’ve ever worked at. There’s so much to do for the amount of pay per hour. It’s definitely not worth working for this company. I didn’t like working there. My biggest check was $274 for the 2 weeks I had to work. They want you to come to work, not call in, & bust your butt When you get to work but don’t wanna pay you for the labor. Yeah no they’re CANCELED !!"
bad,I was working here temporarily and it sucked. My schedule would get changed without notice causing me to be penalized for not showing up and doing more work above my pay grade.
bad,open stock start up and run register do recovery log damages nightly deposits bank for change. its a job part time if you want to make a little extra cash monthly
bad,"I am a former assistant manager at Dollar Tree. I would not work here again if it was the last place on earth. The store managers are horrible. The store I worked at made sure enough people was on day shift, but night shift I only had one cashier. I was pushed to the max with stuff to get done and not enough employees to see that the nightly stuff was done. Most of the store managers have their picks of who they like and who they want to keep. If you are not one of them you might as well find another job. Reaching out to cooperate with issues is a waste of time because they will not contact you back..."
bad,I have never worked so hard in my life for minimum-wage. There is a lot of drama at this job that is unnecessary. The management team does not work together as a team. The store manager does not handle stress very well and does not take accountability when the other managers decide not to show up to work for a week. No one ever gets written up there’s no accountability.
bad,"I’ve been working on and off for Dollar Tree for almost 12 years. The management at the one I’m currently working at is the worst I’ve ever seen. They are very unorganized, lack communication, treat employees unfairly and hire people half their age just to make friends with. They even go behind your back and change your schedule without telling you. One manager threatened my life in front of other people and after telling the managers, I’m still having to work with her"
bad,I worked for this company for almost 6 years. I started out as a seasonal cashier and worked my way up to merchandise manager and was eventually offered to be manager of my own store. I turned this opportunity down. This company mistreats it’s workers. It does not take care of its employees. There is a lot of favoritism and discrimination.
bad,I never new what I had to do everyone was out for themselves  it was weird  and the manager  scared me I felt very uncomfortable it was always dirty and gross no matter  how much you mopped  or tried to clean
bad,The worst company to work for. They treat u poorly . Talk down about you.  Not supportive at all . Need more people and they show favoritism all the time to they favorite person.
bad,"When a customer would return an item it would go over on the register so they would make you pay out of pocket, then they would fire you and make you pay back their company. My mother was a manager and I an employee I watched as they made her and another colored women pay over 500$ back to the company for returning items customers brought in. She just paid it off. Weird part it was only them."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend, It is a easy job , there go by time management, responsibility , and organization . My experience was good and short because I moved location"
bad,"Rude management, and they cut hours as much as they possibly could to benefit themselves, and if you asked for more hours they pretty well laughed in your face"
bad,"It’s just not worth even working here the vibe is so unbearable to work in , the store let people steal their products and everything just very unprofessional would love to work in a better environment then that bs"
bad,People did meth in the back. I hope that tells you all you need to know. I was constantly fearing for my well being and had to stop bringing valuables like my phone and wallet into work beacuse they took away my locker and I was scared someone I worked with would steal from me
bad,"Very low quality employer with a severe lack of trust for the employees."
bad,"There is no break room, you sit among boxes and live mice, lockers are constantly broken into, you have to wait until the exact second when logging in and it must be at a register (customers will berate you for not immediately working while you sign in with a 12 digit code and your social security number) and managers abuse the rules, stealing whenever possible."
bad,"the sm was best friends with the ops manager who always had an attitude was lazy and never did anything right... being that it was her bestfriend she was never held accountable for anything  then when you complain about her, you written up. all they do is gossip, the ones they don’t like, like me, they go above and beyond to get rid of. They don’t clean the restroom or actually look for things when I asked if it it’s in stock. They don’t follow policy. And it’s like a high school with gossip and drama about customers employees and their friends"
bad,Most of what I did there I already knew from working as a manager at Dollar General and a shift manager for CVS. Truck receiving was a little different but not hard to learn.
bad,Manager doesnt know how to mange its the worst experience i had to deal with working there didnt give me enough hours only one a week which is not enough
bad,"Easiest job in the world! But poor management messed everything up. No one follows the rules and they dont care what your problem is, whether its outside or inside your head. Multiple times Ive reaches out to coworkers and my manager warning them about my mental health. No one cares so I left then I get told Im not eligible for rehire!? Even contacting the company itself wont change my status  and the other managers nearby are clueless on how to fix thinfs. I wouldnt work here again"
bad,"They lie about pay, they cheat you out of your money, they are not willing to be flexible with schedualed and if they get mad at you they cut your hours."
bad,This job was horrible and doesn’t care about work life balance or how hard you work just get the job done and make us more money. Don’t work here if you can help it
bad,The job wasn't great .the girls I was hired by  were very secretive.drama starter .and for no reason.it was a horrible experience for me. And it sucked
bad,I was promised more hours and they were never delivered. They trained me and gave me the title of assistant manager but never the pay to match the title.
bad,"Poor management, disgusting work environment.  No pay raises for over a year, and then it was a measly .20 hr.  Only stayed on since at the time, I needed the job.  No benefits, no nothing."
bad,They need to train more their managers and stop certifying people within 1 week. And need to take care of real bussines and care about the quality. Because they dont care about quality at all.
bad,"Dollar tree is not a secure job they will use you, cycle employees constantly, and fire you without notice and management has no clue what's going on most of the time. I've worked off the clock several times for these people (I was ignorant of work laws at the time, first job) this also happend while the district manager was in the store and he did nothing about and he was the main reason why I worked off the clock for 30mins cleaning up my area I was never told that cashier's had to mop/clean the register area before leaving. They don't teach new employees what they need to do or how to do things properly management is inconsistent with their rules one managers says ""you can't void items"" another says ""you can void items items"" I didn't even know go backs were a thing 2 months into the job until they said ""oh you have to put those back before leaving"" and I ended up working off the clock again. Go backs were the main reason why I was always working off the clock even if I took a minute to put the away or 15mins to put them away I had to do it and be off the clock. There was always stupid drama amongst management and coworkers. No one a few workers acted like decent and responsible workees I would always have to hear managements personal issues when I simply wanted to just show up to work get my job done and leave. I've also covered for these people several times when employees ""got sick"" I would be the one to cover every time yet I call in sick and I had to show up. They refuse to work around any planned events that I had with a reasonable two week notice. This may have only"
bad,"After two years...I've had enough. I have gone above and beyond for this company with no recognition. Over worked, underpaid, and unappreciated. 39.5 hours a week with no benefits? Time to move on."
bad,Don't work here pay is horrible in VA . 7.25 yet dollar tree expects u to do so much more .. 1 cashier every shift so people yell and scream at u all day
bad,I recommend Dollar Tree for someone who lives in the area. Since they only pay minimum it wouldn't benefit for the gas. It's not a reliable place to work
bad,Did not like working there at all . Not organized to much drama. Management very unprofessional. Scheduling was not good would close one day and open the next
bad,They were unprofessional. Laid me off for no reason. How they went about the situation was horrible. They did pay me for the two weeks they had me out. Nobody should ever work there nobody.
bad,"Últimos meses es todo un caos, mucha exigencia, poco personal y a la hora de necesitar ropa de cama siempre están sucias, lavándose o no tienen disponibles pero aún así tienes q terminar tu trabajo a tiempo. Supervisora poco comprensivas, muy exigentes aunq no tengas todo lo q necesitas, ni hablar del equipo, los carritos viejos y varios en mal estado, da vergüenza ajena q los huéspedes tengan que ver el estado del equipo."
bad,"They over work there management. They don't hire help like they should, And they put profit over safety to save money, working there you are at risk of getting robbed or hurt"
bad,"I worked part time as an assistant manager for a lot less hourly than was told that I would receive at the initial interview with the Store manager.  Always stressed and very over worked  and underpaid.  Employees were not trained well and the work atmosphere there was always unprofessional  and extremely cut throat.  The district manager at the time was also one of the worst in management that I had ever worked under during my career in retail management.  If I need to reach either the store manager or the district manager at or after closing the store daily, I was never able to reach either, by phone etc., no matter the day or time.  This job was costing me more money to work, than to not work.  I would not refer my dog or worst enemy to this company as far as employment is concerned.  They will work you every day, 7 days a week with little compensation and no benefits and this is part time hours, with little to no training that is needed or required, then turn around and stab you in the back by having you train a new hire that will cut your throat and turn on anyone just to advance up to a management position.  very unprofessional and worst employer I have ever worked for in 35 Years."
bad,They push you till you have no energy anymore and cause mental break downs. No respect. They expect you to work long hours and not ask if you are ok. No benefits.
bad,I wish I could give this job a 0. After the store manager left the store went down hill. The current manager is horrible and the state of the store is too.
bad,"Very bad management they treat you poorly. Bad pay for all that you have to do here. I wouldn't reccomend, the paychecks aren't even worth it at all.."
bad,The manager who was suppose to train me was never there or was extremely rude and confrontational.  No type of professional behavior at all. Could not reach manager in emergency.
bad,i would prefer not to comment on this workplace i was not treated well they stopped calling me in to work didnt tell me i was let go and didnt bother to give me a reason.
bad,I have never worked for a company that talked behind your back. Or did not stand behind their employees to some degree. You are promised oppurtunity yet set up for failure if you are not liked by your superior. The hard workers are not reconized and soon fired because of the other associates who find them to be a threat make sure to sabatoge. You are told and watch in video plus quizzed to go by dollar tree policy
bad,Management sees everyone as disposable. The store I worked at the manager would scream and cuss in front of customers and if you complained you got fired
bad,"Dollar Tree pays minimize wage for managers and expects all employees to work off the clock.  If an employee is I'll and cannot work, they receive minimal hours the next two weeks ( because the called out sick (this is also illegal)."
bad,Fast pace and always want more never happy with the work you do the more you do the more they want but never happy and they get the bones and u don't you have to be there 1 year before any bones and if u move up your year starts all over and if they go over on hours they take your work hours away from you that's why I quit dollar tree
bad,This job was okay at the beging then it turend horrible was only gettin 4 hrs a day which once again not making enough money things changed bad so I left
bad,This is the worst company you can possibly work for. I worked 7 days a week mostly open to close for months on end. Tons of freight with no hours to work it out. I would have to work overnights in order to put out enough freight so I could get the next truck unloaded as I was almost always on a register during business hours due to absences by associates. OSHA violations galore. Dont walk away RUNviolations
bad,Management is extremly rude to employees. They only pay employess $9 and only schedule you 8 hours a week. You ask for more hours and get yelled at. And if your in management dont think you will have a day off cause you will constantly get called in. Workers talk bad about you and lie about you behind your back. Mangement takes unapproved breaks and get away with it.
bad,"Working at the Dollar Tree could’ve been better if they had proper management running the business. I met a lot of great people , however that didn’t compensate all that you deal with while working at there."
bad,"Little to no training. 16 hours a day 6 days a week easily. Do not try to ask for help, you won't get it. Make sure you know very old computer systems and figure out how to search for documentation to be able to do your job."
bad,"People make fun of Walmart shoppers, you have no idea. At the dollar tree I’ve witnessed junkies throwing up in a shopping bag while their partners shoplifted ,fights,assaults ect. Management is horrible they don’t care. You make just above minimum wage with no raises. In there every weekend and most holidays. Place sucks go to school make something of yourself."
bad,The manager at the dollar tree is extremely rude he will tell you what to do but not explain how to do it. If you are the only cashier working and there’s a line of 10 people he will sit in his office and just watch you struggle to make sure your customers are satisfied. I really wanted to stay because I love a lot of our regular customers and I got along with the other employees but the manager pushed away    with his attitude
bad,"Not enough hours to have a decent paycheck to be able to pay bills, no benefits unless your management, not even a 401k or a retirement fund. Promises are always made and then broken."
bad,Every aspect of this company is a facade. You're never congratulated for the good things but they make sure you get punished for the mistakes. If you think you're going to be promoted think again. They'll bring in an outsider first. Slap in the face
bad,"horrible place to work, no ploicies enforced, half the employees were drunk or high and there were complaints and nothing done. so many call outs, no consequences"
bad,This is a terrible company that under pays and over works their employees. It's a non stop physical job so expect to be in constant pain all day. I would not reccomend this place to anyone!
bad,Staff can be good but the managers lose all sense of respect the longer you work there because they are comfortable. They swear a lot and are fake nice when the district manager comes in for store checks
bad,Not a good place to work. No lunch breaks due to lack of coverage. Never more than two people in the store. Makes for cleaning messing and getting things done hard.
bad,"its not good working here, low salary, toxic people, and nothing really to expand youre career in look for another job please save yourself some time please."
bad,"I don't know why I got fired, but I heard that the manager was stealing from the store and pushed me under the bus. The whole store got fired. They said that I had a post void of 20 dollars and suspended me and never called me back"
bad,The pay is not worth the headache of working there. I was stuck far to long due to life issues at a job that paid poor wages. They would cut hours because if not hitting sales and expect the cashier to not only run register but stock the whole store with one manager because they could not get hours for the stock people to stock the store.
bad,Manager called and didn’t even leave a voicemail. They didn’t tell me when I worked and blamed me for not showing up. Some manager wouldn’t let me leave when I felt dizzy sick and nauseous. Don’t work here. They made you clock out for ten minute breaks.
bad,I felt I was treated very unfairly being I was the only one who kept the store clean and did not like how they thought I was a slow worker when I was the only one on the floor cleaning and kept the store looking presentable.
bad,Does not care about mental disorders of children. I needed 2 saturdays off a month to attend to my son asperger's program would not give it to me so when I relocated to Texas they took away my job.
bad,"This job was a joke "
bad,The dollar tree that i belonged too was literally the worst one ive ever been in. The management is just extremely poor and there was constant nitpicking and harassment and it was about time that i left because it was a complete waste of time for me.
bad,It was a place that required you to do everything and get compensated very little. It was a very fast paced working environment and had little time to rest.
bad,Dollar tree has took on more then is can stand buy family dollar was the biggest mistake they ever done the management not willing to change to the new company rules this company needs a over haul
bad,They are only interested in the bottom line. So that means they treat the employees like dirt. Definitely overworked and under paid. Was forced to worked 70-80 hours per week. Constantly under staffed was not allowed to hire anyone with experience. Always pushed to do more even though you do the work of 4-5 people. Pay SUCKS. For a salaried manager you end up making less than minimum wage. Upper Management is useless.
bad,Poor management they really need to get a new manager he doesn't care for the workers isn't fair with the schedule doesn't honor sick notes gives you the day but doesn't pay the day only puts one Cashier up in the front even though it gets really busy in the afternoon and cashier's get to deal with angry customers and long lines just overall worst job experience honestly
bad,If you get terminated they dont want to pay you for the work that you have done if you were a Manager all the bounces that you worked for they refuse to pay you they will tell you that you were not employed at the time which they did the payout. If you are a cashier all they want to start you at is minimum wage an not over 16hr
bad,Money is decent but you WILL work hard for it. Hopefull the next persons to get hired may have a better experience. All the HR and office personel is new and have no ideal what they are doing
bad,"The store is slow, only 1-2 cashiers, They Hours was no good, The Pay was Not Very Good, There Was A Day I Had Too Work There And There was A Dead Mice On a trap && A Live Snake On The floor"
bad,"Would never recommend working there.  Do not pay fair wages.  Worked off the clock all the time.  Extremely stressful situations.  Never extra help when its really busy, you have to handle all of the chaos by yourself."
bad,"I would never work for this company again.  They don't teach and train.  Stores are trashy,  infested with roaches.  Employees don't have a break room to eat lunch,  bathrooms are always disgusting.  Managers and DM's are horrible including HR & corporate.  corporate is no help. Employees have to find somewhere to take a break and lunch.  There is no Recognition for employees."
bad,okay job better than nothing but far from acceptable if consistent work is what your looking for this job isn't really for adults at the point in there life who have created a family and a dependency of more than one being.
bad,"No structure bad management and scheduling not consistent hard labor no benefits. "
bad,I love working with people but don’t get enough hours and the pay stinks I been there two years and never got a pay raise which isn’t fair and i wish they would give more money to work there.
bad,Worked there for months bent over backwards to do everything including coming in at 4:30am to help do truck plus stay whenever they asked me and not once got any form of acknowledgement not even a thank you had to call off one day cuz I got sick as ever and I had a doctors paper and I got in trouble for missing one day will never recommend working here!
bad,hardworking associates who have a demanding job and not enough staff to accomandate the amount of work thjat is required.constant and ongoing managememt changes show in customer service issues.
bad,"I really dont like dollar tree. I'm only there to pay my Bill's until I find something better. I have been there for over a year. I use to enjoy my Job, however im.no longer interested in the job. It's very stressful and management sucks."
bad,"Dollar Tree does not care about their employees. The manager doesn't know much about the job or how to do it. Employees have no voice and is was stressed out everyday I went to work. Higher level managers District Manager and Regional manager didn't care how employees were treated they allowes the store to do, say, and treat employees and customers unfairly."
bad,Worst job I’ve ever had. Do not work here unless it’s as a side hustle. Even then I wouldn’t recommend it. I got 4-6 hours per WEEK. The pay is terrible for the amount of work you do.
bad,if you're looking for a part-time job and your student is a great place to work or if you're a person who needs a second job it's a great place to work but if you plan on trying to advance or become manager or assistant manager or everything's bigger it just a cashier or a stocking associate don't lie they play about their bonuses and they don't care about you as an employee they don't care about their customers and they never have enough people on hand to handle the stores people and it is very hard to work there at some stores
bad,"Worst place I’ve ever worked. They don’t give you enough hours to stock the store with stockers. Then the district manager in 220 (Memphis) & Regional will blame you. When corporate comes to visit they make you lie saying you staff more then they allow. The stock rooms have many health code violations. They will tell you you work 45 hours for your salary but that’s not true! You will be made to work 55- to 80 hours. Policy is enforced to a few Managers not the favorites. District 220 is poorly ran and will not change. District manager will not help, he will lie to his regional because he stays in trouble. Stay away from dollartree district 220 MEMPHIS 2019"
bad,"Don’t even waste your time, it’s stressful, I don’t feel you gain anything besides experience... no benefits, no structure, they don’t really care about their employees. I feel they just need people to work, even for no pay if that was legal."
bad,"I got fired for not turning a note in??!!"
bad,Awful pay short staffed and overwork employees so managers can get bonuses for staying under hours ... poorly run. District managers are awful including store managers. The whole company just does what they want because they know poor  people will always shop there
bad,"It was okay , manager got upset all the time , I was in demestic violance situation, they didn't understand , they where rude and nasty tords me . I can't remember her name though"
bad,"Not professional at all manager will lie on u to loose your job if he doesn't like you personally."
bad,I would not let my dog work in that racist violent environment. The Absolutely worst experience I have ever had in my life at a job. With a manager so racist she could not stand to see me come through that door. I am filing a complaint with the EEOC.
bad,One of the worst jobs I have ever had. Completely unprofessional and disorganized. The pay was decent and my co-workers were cool but the whole environment was toxic.
bad,"The pay is minimum wage which us bonkers considering all the garbage you had to endure. You would be the only cashier at the register with a line of 20 customers. Reason being is due to the store not wanting to hire more people. Customers are horrible as way. Don't work here, I beg of you and your soul. Don't. Apply at Maximus."
bad,I recommend you not work here. They don't care about their employees. No set schedule! you get less than 20 hours a week if you're not management and if you are management they work you like a slave and don't pay you over $13 an hour
bad,Love being with my co-workers but they won't let you advance no matter how hard you work. I proved again and again how I wanted to grow and they held me back
bad,Overtime is optional if you help with behind work. Pay and store quality would be more stressful if one applied for a full-time position. Poor and last minute schedule changes without 24 prior notice.
bad,"I have been in retail for  long time. And I was only looking for a second job. I would never ever recommend this business for employment especially the one on 1st ave s lethbridge. Very unqualified Managers do not know a thing about HR or any kind of Labour standards. I am surprised they have not been reported to the Labour Board 10 times over. Not supportive of new hires. As per them having to put up a sign in the staff room. "" reminding them not to eat new staff alive""."
bad,"Poor poor management!! Its policy to let the cashiers count their drawer before their shift but she never let me. She constantly told me to rush all customers and not to make conversation while checking. She was super rude to the employees and the customers!! There's no way I could act like her, its simply bad for business and the customers keep us paid. I've never worked in such a poorly managed environment. I wouldn't recommend that job to anyone!!"
bad,"not enough hours, hardly got a break. My manager was great, it was not a good place to work. I would not ever work there again. Once was enough. would not reccomend"
bad,Pay for employees poor. Expect low turnover when they only pay minimum wage. Expect saleried Store Manager to fill in the gaps when hourly employees quit.
bad,"They treat you like you’re nothing but trash, they ask what days do you want off when you first start working with them so I gave my day and they approved it but after that day they said I was a no call no show and I was a waste of time."
bad,"It's a fun place to work depending on who your working with but it is not safe at all.  The company doesn't care about their employees.  No air in the summer, no heat in the winter and employees and customers have passed out and they did nothing to fix it."
bad,Don't ever work there manager does not care about how good of a worker you are her attitude is nasty to workers and customers. The pay is horrible u have to clock out for a 10 minute break.
bad,"store us always a mess, Hard to find anything because merchandise is just stuck any and every where."
bad,The work was fine it was the regional and district manager that made the job horrible. They were horrible at communicating also had no real care for its employees so I wouldn’t advise anyone to apply at the dollar tree’s in the southeast Houston districts
bad,"They under pay their employees,and ask too much of the employees and are gender bias. They don't pay overtime for hours you work over 40 hours. They don't give any benefits for working there"
bad,Poor management. Hours are not certain. Raise are rare. Lack of help. Only one cashier per shift. Stressful when cashier is the only one working and has to do everything while management is no where to be seen. Poor pay.
bad,Definitely aren’t professional would never work for that dollar tree again. They do not keep the store cleaned do not keep things organized. Embarrassing.
bad,This District Manager is the most sexist person on the planet. I wish I had never moved here. He thinks men make better managers than women. What gives him the right to say this? He doesn’t ALLOW his wife to work. Said that women belong in the home.
bad,"Very disorganized management. My schedule changed all the time and at times, not notified about change and it could be a write-up. The hours for each employee are very limited. Part-time (which are everyone except store and freight manager) can only work 5 hr shifts."
bad,"The work environment was horrible. The store was never clean, there was boxes everywhere, no manager was available to assist when need. The computers were usually down and they always had a problem with the internet "
bad,I work here at doller tree i need more hours at a job we unload the truck every friday the ware house is over stocked with merchandise at the moment due to seasonal shipment
bad,"Management is very poor, favoritism, bad pay , barley hours . If we had to use the rest room we had to do it on our break or lunch. Sometimes you are all alone on the register with countless customers who get mad if it's only one register open. Manager refused to help on register. You get treated very bad there."
bad,"Job will ruin you physically from standing on your feet all day, unloading trucks, and unloading the boxes to the store. With plenty of hours and not enough pay. No overtime money but overtime hours are always available. Job is secure if your content with the horrible management teams and having no room for advancement."
bad,Experience for retailWorking at dollar tree is a learning experience just to get into retail it helps you learn more and less of how retail is based off of it’s a good job for starters once you get to experience then you can move on to bigger jobs and more bigger retail
bad,"Bottom line upfront, this company doesn’t care about its people, they don’t care about the environment, everything in that store pretty much comes from China, you’re expected to push everything onto the shelves even if it’s completely unorganized, Shoppers for the most part trash the place no matter how hard you try to tidy it....It’s a greedy corporation that cares only for their sales"
bad,They don't give you enough hours to pay any bills. Management is not good there. there are more bosses than there are employees and the store is always a complete and utter mess.
bad,"Management is terrible, won’t consider to work around your other job schedule, the store manager lies all the time, customers steal all the time, the manager is rude"
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of breaking down boxes and stocking merchandise while conducting in customer service."
bad,I had no life worked all the time and rearranged my schedule over and over trucks changed and employees quit often due to low wages they need a better structure
bad,Very nasty with rodents they don’t care about you they have a big bully there that they let bully everyone no job security and it’s bad for your health
bad,The managers in charge wouldn't  have respect for customers or their needs. Always had one line open leaving people upset wanting to leave the store quick
bad,Don't waste your time. I believe the company will experience difficulties in the very near future due to extreme mismanagement at the corporate level. They refuse to increase hourly wages and provide enough hours of employment in order for an individual to survive in today's economy.
bad,"I worked for Dollar Tree for 6 months as 1st asst. Manager. Was promised 1 weekend off a month, never seen it. Was promised I would only be on nights a short period of time, maybe a month total on days due to new 2nd asst quiting after being treated unfairly. Always treated like a child. Always covering all shifts that needed feeler. Never called in always on time. When I started was supposed to get 9.75 an hour only got 9.25. and last but not the least my pay was  missing hours and refused to get it fixed. . I loved my job, but the upper management needs to be watched more closely."
bad,This is not a safe place to work. From unloading trucks one box at a time to having to deal wtih rodents on a daily basis. Always short staffed which the shoplifters knew.
bad,Working there was very tedious but it was a great workout! I loved my job and never thought I would loose it protecting the companies assets!! Gods speed
bad,"The management was horrible, store itself was highly unorganized, stock room was a dangerous mess. Hours were random and not guaranteed as promised. Took management forever to come up front when called because they were constantly out back smoking."
bad,Terrible manager is crazy never on time for work  literally will sit out her for 30-45 minutes before she shows up .then she talks all crazy to her workers
bad,The boss and the team members where slow and didn't care for their job they were slowpaced and didn't keep the store neat clean or organized.  Team members were rude and played around a lot
bad,"Bad management, no work hours but everytime someone called out they would try to let u come in & work only paid 7.25$ Not enough pay , I only had 2 days of work each work schedule"
bad,"The facility I worked for was disorganized, unkepmt, and a good portion of the management did not care at all. There was a chemical leak and their solution was to hang a sign that said 'chemicals' from the air vents, instead of solving the issue. The bathrooms are still unsanitary and there is a film of sludge across the floor. I have refused to step foot back in since quitting. They treat their employees more like slaves. Overall worse than working for Wal-Mart, and that's saying something."
bad,"The place that work in had no air conditioning,so as summer time came and as a cashier it was 90 degrees, until I left the company they haven't fix or replace their air conditioner. As well as not having enough hours to work per week,it left me to look for another job."
bad,"Everyday when I went to work at dollar tree It was super Busy. I learned to provide better customer service and have a smile on My face.The workplace was always clean because they told us to clean all the time. the hardest part of the job was when I was constantly being made fun of and went home crying. the most enjoyable part of that job was when It was pay day, when I went on My break or when I went home"
bad,"Hours cut even at "
bad,"They are aweful. I am thin because of past Cancer. Was told by regional manager to eat a diughnut. "
bad,"Constantly have to be fast at getting merchandise to the floor, never enough hours, very little pay per hour, too many breaks, very messy store, not enough employees, management always on register, always changing hours that are scheduled."
bad,"It was an awful experience to work there. Very poor store management. No professionalism at all from the STORE MANAGER (Appearance, Does not speak in professional manner at all, etc)."
bad,Horrible company to work for! Store level manager was fantastic but corporate could less about their associates! Severely overworked and underpaid! If you like unreasonable work demands then this is the place for you.
bad,There is absolutely no work life balance. Upper management is unlike anything I have ever seen in any retail environment. There is absolutely no training. I was sent to over 5 locations in 2 months and still unsure of my position in the company. Store managers are required to work 50 hours a week and are salaried so the money is not worth it.
bad,They make you do things that are not allow by law.Manager aren't good at all.They are unfair with their good employees.Is alot of work and not enough good pay for the good employees.
bad,I worked for Dollar Tree for 2 years as a store manager the company has very poor support for store managers I worked for nearly three months in the store as the only manager with no assistance from any other stores very little assistance from the district manager and getting help if any I spent more time on the job then I spent it home worked more 12-hour days then I did Regular 8-hour days for months if you want to leave your life as a Dollar Tree employee go ahead
bad,Dollar Tree starts at minimum wage and only get 5 cent raise nothing higher. If you have a family to provide for Dollar Tree not the job. They work u hard for 5 hrs a day and assistant manager starting pay is 8.00. Thats was in 2016 so hopefully they have change. They don't appreciate you. The company calls u to come to work next day after you had immediately death in family asking can you come in.
bad,"The store managers are HORRIBLE and run off great employees! "
bad,As assistant manager in the state of Montana I make a dollar more than cashiers and I get a dollar more when I work holiday. The upper management of dollar tree is absolutely worthless. Basically if your okay with 9 dollars and hour and 14 hours a week this job is for you.
bad,Worked there along time ago the pay was bad the job was hard . For lil pay and no hours 1 of my worst jobs .wouldn't recommend dollar tree to anyone .
bad,At first it was good and at the end I realised how management was. No one has ur back. It got stressful was doing the store managers work pretty much we didn't need a store manager we got everything done when she wasn't there we were good.
bad,The job was super easy. Rings things up and give correct change. Management on the other hand made the job not welcoming. They expect you to be the only cashier while you have this long line and be super quick all while they sit in the office or act like they don't see/hear customers complaining about the wait. Manager has a problem with not keeping things PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL so she will share thins with her friends who she employees.
bad,"They didn't care much about there employees or there time. They wanted you to show up even if you had the day off. But where I work the coworkers were nice and helpful, when I left they were all mean."
bad,"Worked there as an Assistant Manager for almost a year, recently was fired for reasons they have not told me. They didnt have my check ready within the 24 hours they were supposed to. They barely would have a schedule ready in time for the week and sometimes wouldn't even have it ready. Manager & Merch Manger would call me in early just so they could leave."
bad,I recommend not working for the Dollar Tree Corporation unless it's all that's available at the time and you are constantly looking for a better job while you work there.
bad,they don't work as a team. the line would be bagged up down the isle with customers cussing and complaining. some managers don't even come out to help
bad,Management really is rude and un-caring uncomfortable place to work.  No more to say just that you are under paid not respected as a woman employee and there is no team support
bad,"I have never been this disappointed with a place of work, terrible management, terrible hours, and terrible coworkers. Within the first month the hours were cut, the place was trashed all the time."
bad,They don’t give you hours at all the only good time to work there is during Christmas and any other holidays and of course if you are a person that only needs the little extra money then is perfect for you they don’t pay good $8
bad,When hired was told I would get 16 hours a week it lasted 2 weeks and then went to 8 hours a week knowing I have to take a bus and that is why I chose that location and told manager that at interview. Very - very disappointed!
bad,"Worked there last year for a total of 2 months before I was fired for not showing up for shifts I wasnt even told I was working. You only get one chance to look at your schedule for the week and it's up to you to write it down or forget it. I was paid less than minimum wage but I wouldnt have known it because the big sign in the ""break room"" (a chair with a plastic table and a broken board as a seat cushion) said minimum wage was still $8.75 an hour."
bad,"I was no lucky to be with a bad team of work especially the management. "
bad,Don't work at dollar tree in Elkton md. They got women to unload the truck when it's making the deliveries. The 1 manager all she does is stay in her office or she be on her cell phone all day or outside in front smoking every 20 minutes. She treats her employees like trash  yells at them in front of customers.  Believe me I know I use to work there.
bad,"And they don't provide raises, you get a 10 minute break. They schedule for 4 hrs a day. You only get like 15 hours a week. Poor training availability."
bad,Not a nice place to work. Associates are rude. Management is never around.  Floors are dirty . You work eighty hrs a week management and you get so little pay. Employees work so hard no benefits. They dont care about you
bad,Disappointed is store manager how he ran the store and how he treated employies .There was no team involvement in the whole store very negative and competitive co-workers.
bad,I believe the culture of Dollar tree can be rough to work with. My first year experience was very rough. There was a switch if management due to unfortunate circumstances. The new manager had several complaints filed against them in which dollar tree did nothing about.
bad,The store manager is horrible and the store is dirty. Some of the things you get wrote ups for is stupid.! The only thing that was good was to one of the managers and the cashiers.
bad,Working there was a nightmare in so many different ways. Here are a few of those ways the pay isn't fair for the amount of work that you have to do and you do the amount of work for somebody that is in a high  position when you are being paid for a lower position because the person in higher position doesn't want to do their job.
bad,The managers there dont help you. They leave you with twenty customers and your the only cashier. People want to cuss at you the manager allows it. They only let you work fours a day and its not enough to support a family. They dont try to let you advance there.
bad,Dollar Tree is by far one of the worst places I've worked. Our store was without a store manager for 6 months. The day my last store manager quit I was left alone in the store by myself until someone else came. I was told to keep up business as usual. Many times in the past I have had to operate the store by myself and I'm only a cashier and I only got paid 7.25 an hour. They expected a lot from me. I stood by the company when I shouldn't have and did way more than I should have done. Corporate doesn't care about the sacrifices that I made for them.
bad,"Never paid for vacation time taken. Made to work without days off for months,  open to close,  and abusive District Manager. I would not recommend to anyone to work for this area Dollar Tree."
bad,"This company dont care about the people that work there, it's all about how much they can get in there  Pocket. They tell u in the interview that u will have to work some  Saturday's but when u get there u will have to work every Saturday or at least 90% of them. I was bullied there and had a Threat ON MY LIFE, when I reported it a few days later I was fired. They will lie to your face and when u ask about it get an attitude...."
bad,"Boring."
bad,A new store manager started and was the rudest and fakest manager ever. The store was always such a mess. She was a mess. Always so loud. Always leaving messes and habi having others cleanup after her
bad,"I've been working for this company for 5 years. I loved my store dearly but the DM of my district he is the worst of the worst. He is a mean person with a Cold heart. He lied to us as a team of my store,saying that he was doing good bringing a new Store Manager that she has been only with the company for a year, her previous store manager only train her as a cashier on her second day of work gave her the keys of the store. She said this herself to us when we were starting to getting to know her. She is nice but she doesn't know what she was doing we had help her from day one and that its nothing wrong with that, but they are doing some tricky stuff on the whole district and that it's  not fair for the company at all. It's like everything but I was a Store Manager at this store and every employee loved me even customer's that I saw on the daily got attach to me and about leaving this company to me that was the saddest part. And Shaking the hand of an evil man, and that was my District Manager."
bad,i didn't like working here. its a poor place to work at. it needs discounts or other things to keep you going as an employee there with paid raises every 6 months
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for! Never again! Must be on call at all times. Hours are not guaranteed. Forced to remain in the building for unpaid lunch breaks.
bad,"If you want to feel degraded on a daily basis, work at Dollar Tree, You will not be treated with respect by the customers or the management, and you will be underpaid for even the most brutal working conditions. Unclean facility, non-functional equipment, and no Air-Conditioning in the building. Would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I worked here for several years, with false promises of advancement, you get no raises, or hours to work. The work is easy, but managers show favoritism and are the only ones who get hours to work, because they are set salary. This billion dollar company needs to do better, needs to stop under paying it's workers, allow room for growth, and stop hiring just part time workers to prevent allowing them from them from getting any type of benefits working for them."
bad,Was assistant manager and worked part time closing. I'd come in and all other managers would leave leaving me alone.  Had employee that didnt like me and she called me in and got me fired
bad,"Not somewhere you want to work especially if you are a single parent, when i was working there i was a single mom of 2 and only got 12 hours a week what in the world or who in the world is that supposed to support?"
bad,Worst job I ever had the only good thing about the company was my store manager and assistant manager otherwise I can not say one good thing they treat there employees horrible and the district manager was horrible I would not recommend this company to anyone they have no respect for there employees they don't care about there employees at all!
bad,Management sucked and there was no training. Manager was missing a majority of the time and we went through quite a few employees in the span of two months cause of how bad the job sucked. I recommend that no one apply. You make minimum wage AND you have so much to do.
bad,The place would be better if they had better management and if they weren’t so stingy with the hours and didn’t show a lot of favoritism and if they didn’t get a new manager every 6 months my god
bad,"When employed at dollar tree,  I had a disagreement with the overnight manager. The next morning, I came in to talk to the store manager. As soon as we walked in the office, she immediately told me I was lying and she believes the manager. At that point, I have not spoken a word. In short, she was not interested in listening to my side of the story at all.  She had no proof of any disrespect. She was best friends with the overnight manager., I'm guessing that had something to do with it"
bad,Would not recommend working for dollar tire the company does not car one little bit about it's employees or their safety and that don't care about anything but lining their pockets with money
bad,"Dollar tree under pay doe the work they want u to do.  They don't listen to what employees opinion. Not enough hours. Work environment something put your life in danger because only 2 employees works night,never once has go after customer that steal but blame on employees."
bad,"fast working pace , customer services , rotating shifts , good for part time work , enjoyable place to work ,  inmate friendly , help build up job experiences"
bad,"Was asked several times to work off the clock and ended up having to call HR, coworkers were extremely rude and was told I was scheduled for different times even when I had pictures of my schedule. Don’t work for Dollar Tree especially the one in Erwin NC. Corporate is semi nice though they don’t really seem to care about off the clock work though they just say they will talk to them"
bad,"Ive been in retail over 30 years and this job was physically the hardest. If you sell 1500.00 a day then you need to restock that much (at least if not more) to do business the next day. They understaff, over work  and under pay. I stayed for 4 years until I got sick, and not once did supervisors call and check up on me...Beware, this company ! I checked the other day and the pay is minimum wage $7.30 hr for regular employees"
bad,Tough working with not enough employees to help so many customers at register and get everything else done in short amount of time. Don't expect good compensation
bad,"Worked here for 8 years. Was constantly working off the clock due to being the only manager in the store. Managers are not allowed to leave the store. Constantly had to answer phone calls, customers questions, do returns, direct orders, get cashier change, and be a back up cashier while clocked out. Was always guilt tripped when I had to call in sick.  Never again! Underpaid and over-worked is an understatement!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,I loved my job until my store manager got killed then they gave it to someone that didnt know what she was doing  they didnt give me the opportunity to run the store when I was next in line
bad,"Even if you're in dire need of a job, it's literally best if you DON'T apply to this company. I was treated like garbage, the expectations are outrageous, you'll get written up for anything, the customers are ALWAYS right even if you're the one that's right (it was such a dumb situation where I knew that I was right), etc. STAY AWAY! I lasted two months and decided that I'd rather be unemployed for the time being."
bad,"4-5 hour shifts and 20 hours a week approx stand at a cash register and ring people out.  one is open and then you call for backup. They Didn’t like you  to take have bathroom breaks. Only 10 min break for 5 hr.getting product out is way more important than customer service and cleanliness of store. Very clique, very HIGH stressed especially when busy and $8hour. If your not fast enough there talking about you behind your back . Same on m freight, if your not fast enough there not satisfied and they criticize everything you do behind closed doors and in the back"
bad,Very poor management no real leadership skills of any kind rude not only to employees but to customers also just an all out sad place to work and be not good
bad,"First off you work for minimum wage. My first day I got we FEW mins of training. Then I was asked to stay over my shift. After that she took my cash drawer to the back office. She counted my drawer, not me. Then clamed that my drawer was $20 over not under. Then she proceeds to say if happens again I'm FIRED. I Quit!!!!!"
bad,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT VERY RUDE AND CONDESENDING TO MYSELF AND OTHER EMPLOYEES. It was laid back unless the main store manager was working. Managers and adsistant managers pretty much did nothing except the bare minimum of work spent the rest of their time in the office talking bad about myself and other employees that they did not like. Slow on getting money for the registers that we needed took their time even though we had a huge line of customers waiting. Manager loved to be condescending and rude towards myself and other employees and very much a bully. Some lazy coworkers who got away with doing nothing, work load not worth getting paid less than minimum wages."
bad,They work you like a dog and HARRASS you on the days you are off! They will openly mock you and make fun of you about your performance out in the open in front of customers and coworkers. Totally unprofessional. All at minimum wage.
bad,This company is worth way more than they pay their employees....my particular store was an absolute war zone with merchandise in the stock room piled to the ceiling & also just thrown into a section that it didn't belong...therefore it was extremely difficult to find things that maybe a customer wanted or needed....my manager was the most unprofessional man I have ever worked with as well.
bad,The management horrible the pay is not good hours r horrible store is never clean. When u ask for days off they don't provide it they mess up schedule always.
bad,It sucked won't work there again I will not go back not enough hours or not enough pay very unpleasant manger my co workers was very sweet. It was nasty to hot
bad,"Dollar Tree needs to be more attentive to it's management. My store manager was terrible at her job. Even though I had an opportunity to be promoted, I chose not take the opportunity to advance at work. My decision was due to the store manager that I'd have been assigned to work with. If corporate would do a better job at investigating the store's personnel (with a highlighted focus on Dollar Tree's store  manager and assistant manager positions)  it would create a better, safer, healthy working  environment for all of it's employees."
bad,I don't have much to say about this job. It was a part time job that was a bit rough on the scheduling as well as the pay and work conditions. Overall just another job.
bad,"I could say sooo much about working for this company. Here's just a few -  You never work the same shifts unless your a manager cashiers schedules always change, there is always TONS of call outs. You may work way past when you were suppose to get off and will always be asked to cover shifts asking for days off is sometimes impossible. And that's just a few."
bad,"at the location I was working at was the worst, it was unorganized and messy. the phone was always off the hook and the restrooms were just plan gross. they also weren't specific on when you were working."
bad,Slow paced. No recognition or opportunity's for advancement. Expected to work thru breaks and lunch or off the clock. Minimal training and very poor management.
bad,"Dollar tree hired me as a stocking clerk "
bad,"no support from above"
bad,"Poor management, co workers yell at you all the time, and they don't train you on jobs.. half the time I was on morning shift got to the store and no one been there to open so I had to wait an half hour to an hour for management to show up"
bad,"The store I was at was a wreck. Freight piled 10ft high in the back, but they pulled myself and my crew off overnight stocking, which we were hired for, for no good reason. The DM is a joke, the fill in store manager is a dictator. Her way or no way even if she's doing the opposite of what the regional managers have taught. She thinks talking down to people is ok. The store doesn't have a manager of it's own, and they won't get one at this rate."
bad,"I had to have a talk with the manager about changing the schedule without notifying anyone. I understand sometimes things happen, but I'm not putting up with coming in to work and the schedule has been changed 2-3 times. I started taking pictures of when the schedule would be posted to prevent any backlash. "
bad,It may be an ok job for a teen in their senior year or a freshman in college; but shouldn't be considered a long term job and definitely not a career.
bad,if you want to be used and un appreciated then this would be a job for.you but so far since I left no one stayed more than a year but sm roommate which is manager to.
bad,"Store manager isn’t helpful at all, store manager leaves you hanging and you have to do your job and theirs. The company isn’t fair doesn’t pay enough and expect you not to have a life outside of work."
bad,The expected you to do so much with no hours..and no approved overtime you have complaints on how the store look when they don't give stocking hours .
bad,They would offer you either four hours or three hours a day. I would work 12 hours A WEEK!!! Living in New York City you can’t survive with that !!! Never again
bad,Corporate gets all the money a district manager makes in bonuses 50000 a year that's not even what an assistant manager makes salary they bonus by not giving hours so you work like a dog
bad,They never have enough cashiers you’re always by yourself the management there has no coordination the back room Is a never ending stock there’s no place to walk in the back the one location I worked at there was no break room I had to sit on a ladder you don’t get any benefit from working there not even a discount.
bad,"Weak pay, horrible and inconsistent hours, no room to work with education for it's employees, zero benefits or bonuses except full time management. Not even holiday bonuses. Just cheap cookies."
bad,"Was unable to move up with in the store. They always hired outside help with no experience, to better positions. No drug or back ground checks. Went three a lot of store mangers,  they didn't have a clue about the store. Cashier had show them how to operate the reg.."
bad,When I became an ASM all the other managers would take every weekend off and refused to give me any weekends of. Even if it had something to do with my family
bad,"The work space is crowded and when I addressed the matter I was scolded like a child, I was constantly getting product that the store did not need nor have any room for.. We were constantly over stocked in every department and then when the store manager walked out I was left to run the store for months without help or trained knowledge on the store manager duty and what it consist of for that particular company, and then once a store manager was found for the store they began to cut my hours by half when I was suppose to be fortune hours a week full time employee"
bad,Out of almost 15 years of retail experience Dollar Tree was made out to be an oasis in the madness when my store was slated to be re-bannered from a Family Dollar. It turned out to be worse. The company has backwards policies that enforce a cut throat environment. Store level management is left to fend for themselves when it comes to their store. My DM in particular is pompous and incredibly rude. He demands productivity but minimal guidance. There's obscene amounts of productivity paperwork just to stock shelves. My store manager is fabulous and she navigates as best she can with how little training any of us managers received but is often berated and shot down and told that she doesn't do her job. I would reccomend meeting with your DM before committing to a job with this company. One of them has to be amazing or this company wouldn't thrive.
bad,Upper management doesn’t listen to suggestions and work you like a dog.  Too much overtime not enough recognition or a simple Thanks for working all the hours and all Holidays except Christmas
bad,I would never recommend anyone to this job . It was a awful place with even worst management. It was a mess at this location. The customers were very rude.
bad,Management is poor not just in store but higher up. They reward the lazy workers but if you work they hang your job over your head and say your replaceable not a great place to work it will bring you down
bad,"Pay is terrible,  hours cab go from 5-15 a week.  10 minute breaks,  no paid time off, no vacation time,  no discounts,  no thank you for even working past your time off because the other employee never showed.  Management is A JOKE"
bad,Horrible place to work! The pay is ridiculous. You get absolutely no benefits. I never got a raise & was there well over 6 months. The manager does not treat her employees fairly or equally. She needs to learn how to talk to & treat her employees.  The assistant managers were great to work for.
bad,"Waking up just to beginning dreading how the day will go, scared of the management if a mistake was made, and more likely than not getting asked personal question and being harassed after answering or not wanting to share.Trying to not to cry when working."
bad,"So management is horrible and HR is non existent since they don't take any concerns any higher they write them down amd pretty much throw them away. Melissa, Angela and Silvia are incompetent. I would strongly suggest that the CEO does some house cleaning. "
bad,Would not recommend if you have bills to pay. You do your job and others as well but do not get recognition for your hard work. It's a horrible place to work.
bad,Do not work here.....Run run fast keep going dont stop just totally miss this it ran by unprofessionals its not worth the money or the time. I will never return
bad,The only thing that is good about Dollar Tree is that it is very well stocked the bad part about it is that the workers there have a limited hours they work for hours a day and make it $7.35 an hour and you will only work two days out of one week and that is horrible management.
bad,"The management here is completely terrible. I had to wait an hour before putting in my info to work there, and it’s almost 4 weeks later with some of my info still not activated. I was told I’d receive 25 hours a week. But I only worked once a week for 3 weeks with only 4 hours a shift. Everytime my shift would end, the SAME manager would say, “I’ll let you know when you work again,” which would be the same day the next week following. My direct deposit is still not working even after I’ve been told that I was fired. I wasn’t told I was fired until I called about my direct deposit AGAIN THIS MORNING even though I came to the store YESTERDAY and spoke with the SAME manager about my direct deposit. Everytime I called and came up there to speak to the manager who hired me, she continued to state, “You’ll have to come here in the morning to do that,” when she was either sitting in office or walking around the store on her phone. I was informed on the reasoning I was fired was because I didn’t call and checked on the schedule where as the SAME manager would say, “I’ll let you know when you’ll work again.” I pray no one goes through this headache as I’ve done and I will talk with Dollar Tree’s corporate associates about this issue."
bad,the company is not a good place to work for its always alot of drama on the job management want to work you like a bull only give you 10 hours a week they only a 7.25 hr how can you survive
bad,They work you till your dead and they give you nothing for it.  The manager had me work off the clock for less than MIN wage cash she paid me.  They took away my cost of living raise after having it for 3 months.
bad,Nothing you do is ever enough for dollar tree! Any time there’s a problem they always like to point fingers. Not enough hours and not enough people most of the time theirs only 2 people working at a time.
bad,The location i worked at was very unorganized and did not provide enough work hours. They also gave me hours i did not apply for and that they where not available for.
bad,"While working here, there were many times when schedules were not made properly and the employees would be penalized for it. Also, there was a lack of communication between management and the employees. I didn't feel safe because of some the outrageous incidents that took place in the store!"
bad,"At store level all was good including management.The company and upper management however is another story.They do not support ,encourage or respect their staff.The hours given are simply not enough for anyone to get much done, especially when given minimal shifts and staff.The pay is not worth all of the headaches you have to deal with."
bad,"They have poor management , poor hours, poor rate of pay.and do not have any benits.not enough employees for the work that you do there I would not refer anyone to work there.at least the one on 52 nd st.on 80 th st maybe they have better management.and hours."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone not enough money hrs always stressed always moving from the cash register to stock shelves people always calling off
bad,"I could write a long list of reasons I didn't like working here. It was due to the poor pay, not having enough staff, most of the staff were elderly, close-minded/needs discrimination and ethnic training, bad at communication."
bad,"Ok to sharpen up your customer service skills but bad pay so don't make it a career path. I liked it because I like meeting new people, I was fairly new to jobs around this time so it was an OK gig for me."
bad,"Spent 18 years with the company.It was always high expectations,and very little support in all areas.Back rooms were packed,and you had no control over what came in,how much came.The hours or payroll you were given were insufficient to adequately do the job.The starting pay for new employees was 7.25 per hour so it was difficult to attract talent since you could go anywhere else and make more.Would not recommend."
bad,It was a good work please let income was not that great I was on able to live off of the income only making $400 Every two weeks was not able to pay my bills and would never recommend this job for anybody
bad,Ur expected to do work of 3 people. They dont pay there employees enough money for the jobs they expect out of them. There focus is making money but not helping the store improve to do so. Most stores are understaffed.
bad,It's like a high school drama club. Management talking  about employees to other employees. Huge about of immaturity from the management. They treat their employees unfairly. And if you smoke it means you get more breaks
bad,"As I worked for this establishment for a few months, I came to find out that this place is nothing but money stealing back stabbers. I will never work there EVER in my life time. I recommend that I would not waste my time or money there period!"
bad,Absolute disaster. People bring their kids there to play while they shop. So much staff goes on in that store it’s on believable. Shipment is twice the week 3000 packages and not enough people to put them out stores are usually dirty nasty I’m full of germs. I would not suggest anyone working here. But hey someone has to
bad,Lack of consistent hours immature management obsolete equipment unsafe environment no opportunity to advance or transfer to better location lack of proper training
bad,It’s very slow paced and i don’t like that. It needs to have better people running the store. You have people that don’t know what they are doing. A typical day at work would be very slow in the mornings maybe thru out the day it would pick up a little bit.
bad,i good day at dollar tree without all the unnecessary things happening i would say business is great but when things get weird things stay weird and nothing changes
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone the don’t cAre about there employees very unprofessional they don’t appreciate how hard people work they use people to there advantages and then if they feel some type of way about a person the kick you to the curve
bad,"Staff was not really up to par, their was always lack of security within the workplace! Everyone was very laid back and just did their job. Help was hard to find when it came to containing a long line of customers at the register and the break times were ridiculous for the amount of hours we worked!"
bad,"It was good at first, but then they just started playing favorites, and didn't want to work with me on my schedule. Very short breaks and at times never got a break, Stay away."
bad,"I did freight 4-8am. Very sparatic schedule, they would change it in a moment's notice and not tell you. Manager got a bonus if we got a lot of freight out so was always pushing you. I never had help in my department but my hours varied from 12-25. They only want you to work 4 hour shifts. If manager worked all her 40 hrs then my schedule would change. They would take away my days to give to new hires for training. Or if they ran out of hours they take away your so it's best to be scheduled sun, mon, Tues wed to ensure you wouldn't get cut.  Never had a set schedule it was always about how many hours they were given in a week so if they didn't have a lot of hours you worked your tail off and that was horrible working the register because it caused long lines & abrupt customers."
bad,"While I was working at this company I had to get a second job, the company does not allow for overtime and only works you 15 to 20 hours a week unless your a manager then you get 25."
bad,"I managed the office duties. Phone calls, paperwork, taking care of shift changes, taking money to bank. I made sure store was clean and safe for customers. I put freight away. I unloaded truck. I accepted vendors items and did the paperwork.I ran the store by myself at times. I opened and closed the store. I trained employees on merchandise and cash register. I worked with the general public (customers) and took care of their needs."
bad,If you are single or living with you mom this place would be perfect the pay is low and when you get promoted you dont make much and the hours are short and pay is next to none. They treat employees real bad and talk behind you back. Then wi write you up if you talk to another employee about it. I got terminated because I didnt answer my phone on my day off dont work here
bad,Company cannot follow there own guidelines when manager doing the right way. They only support no results and cut corners leaders and poor results from managers who are upper management favorite.
bad,"A very unprofessional environment, a lot of favoritism on the management side. It was a unsafe workplace.The worst set of Leadership I have ever had to work with. There were no bonuses, no incentives, no employee appreciation of any sort. Security was terrible as well."
bad,Worst place to work. Customers feel entitled to do whatever they want and to treat the employees horribly and management just stands there and lets them. Management was horrible but then became a little better. There was nothing enjoyable about working here.
bad,Horrible place to work. I will never want to work for a place like this ever again. Horrible District Managers. Way too stressful and basically a slave to the title.
bad,They don’t pay you enough or give you enough hours  customers  Complain If you forget to say hello to them at the door when it’s busy then tell your manager And you get fired there is a zero Tolerance customer complaint if they complain you get fired
bad,Poor upper management.  The use u and throw u away. They expect u to work off the clock. Expectations are way too high . Rude upper management. No compassion. Horrible company to work for.
bad,"Very unprofessional company.  Most employees hired with no job skills, work ethics, or any other positive contribution to the position except a warm body to stand at a register.  Ten percent of the employees doing the work 90% percent there just to receive a paycheck for standing around.  The company does not stand behind their employee handbook, there is no reward for being an honest hard working employee.  As it is clear I have nothing good to say about this employer.  I quit on my own terms and would never return to their employment.  All of the good managers I worked with are no longer with the company."
bad,"Very poor place to work! Inconsistent in the hours given weekly, poor management, you can not ever do enough work for management, no vacation, no sick time & never any raises!"
bad,I loved working with the customers but that was it.  The management at the dollar tree is not what it should be.  People there not knowing what was going on from one moment to the next and the schedule was never confirmed you just worked whenever they thouht they needed you.
bad,Dollar tree sucks donkey balls They don't pay squat and management is a joke. The store is disgusting. The employees are slobs and ignorant and don't do any work. They expect you to break your back for minimum wage pay while all the other employees sit back and watch.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at dollar tree, I only received 15 hours per week and the head manager was stealing money from my drawer, she actually got caught stealing $10,000 from the store in the period of 2 years."
bad,"They only have part time positions unless you're a manager. You make about 15 hours a week. the store is a mess there isn't enough hours to stock or clean. Managers barely receive breaks due to the stressful work environment. The hardest part of the job is trying to help customers find items due to the fact that the store is empty/trashed. There are not enough cameras so when people steal (which is often) they get away free. There is normally only one line open unless customers start complaining in which case a second line will open. since there is typically only one cashier they must help customers locate items, fill balloons,clean the aisles and operate the cash register all at once."
bad,"First and foremost, the pay is way below competitive.  The daily job requirements as an operations manager or supervisor can be overwhelming. This is due to the low # of labor hours that corporate provides to staff the store. Everyday you will be tested, understaffed, underpaid, unappreciated, and trying your best to keep the store stocked, cleaned, while servicing customers. Please, I beg you, do not work for this company. I have worked as an operations manager for numerous companies and this is by far the worst. Nothing come close to how bad this company is."
bad,Worked here for a little  while as a unloader. Management here is terrible you will be overworked because this place is always behind and people are always quitting. Be prepared to unload TWO TO THREE TRAILERS AT A TIME DAILY. The management does not care about the workers only thing that matters in this place is production. Management will write you up so you can not transfer anywhere their pay is tied to production. Human Resources here is a joke. The is not a professional environment be expected to be treated like a slave and work like a dog. DO NOT WORK HERE.
bad,Don’t ever work for this company. They are money hungry and it’s slave labor. You will have No life. And managers don’t care for you and forget talking to HR... they are never there
bad,I will never ever recommend anybody to work at the Dollar Tree in Lemoyne. Should be called Dollar Slaves. That store sucks and their management suck too. That store needs whole new management.
bad,"I worked at my local store for about a year and a half, that didn't matter to Dollar Tree. My pay was stuck at minimum wage no matter how much I worked, how well I worked even if our store achieved 'Top Gun' for the Quarter our pay wouldn't get bumped. Store managers can and always will be a pain in your side. The only chances at getting better pay is by joining management, but even then you're over scheduled hours depending on the store situations. "
bad,"Modern day slavery, Company doesn't care about employees, nor do they care about their customers. Heavy workload without proper hours and staff to fulfill business needs."
bad,"the manger only cares about making her bonus.. treat her empoleeys  badly, never help with costmers, is always out side smoking and talking about how bad her staff is and how she hate the company"
bad,I wouldn't reccomend working for dollar tree. I've worked for them for three years straight and was never offered any career advancement. I only received a 10 cent raise annually. The managers stole hours from us. I only worked 2 to 3 days a week. You can not survive from a dollar tree check. Save yourself the stress. Did not work here.
bad,If you're a cashier you stay in that one spot forever because the line never ends. You get two short breaks at most. You're overworked and no one cares. Management is terrible.
bad,This is definitely a company that is not for the people who work for them. This is a very selfish & manipulating company & I wouldn't encourage a dog to work for them.
bad,"It's a dollar store. The company itself makes money, but that doesn't trickle down to the store level. Stores are understaffed, yet hours are still limited. Usually only one associate and a manager per shift, meaning crazy rush hours and a dirty store. Management expects you to maintain the cash register, stock, clean, front-face, do damages, protect against shrink AND work out ""go backs"" all while making sure the line doesn't get backed up. You're lucky if you've got another associate with you. That being said, a job is a job, but Dollar Tree should not be a lasting career."
bad,"I work at dollar tree  for a bout 2 yrs and I didn't get no training  from day one ,I learn by asking others coworkers, and management was not there to help when needed, and human resources was Nothing to help you .also we work about a year doing 12.and 10 hrs.all 6 days and working holly days  to. A lot of times  I would request a day off was denied, a lot of fevertisim. Between management and driver. And there was a bout 4 stolen cars from the parking lot and a few bandlelice. They say is open door policy but they ignore our calls human resources, and management, always short of drivers,do to that extra work is added to a daily duties..many management, and co worker leave dollar tree cuz all the unfair and overworked  hrs."
bad,I will never work at the terrible  hole of a place ever again management was a and doesn’t are about employees would never recommend anyone to work there
bad,"horrible pay , mean customers, jumk equipment, working the truck was ridiculous most of the time 2 people 3500 pieces . hardest part was showing up to that dump"
bad,"Working day by day was different .We had to change on work regally. We did different jobs. It was a hassle sometimes, trying to do as much as possible. There wasn't enough time."
bad,"Nothing to say, not a good place to work at all, plus they shorted me around 400.00 on my last check. Very much over worked and underpaid. Anyone they put in as management doesn't care about the team, not good team players, only care about themselves. Would NEVER point someone in the Dollar Tree direction, they did nothing but lie and give blank promises....."
bad,"I’m not even kidding. Working here is hectic and it will drain your mental health. All my coworkers say they hate working there and as soon as you walked in, you would see huge lines with only one cashier everyday. It was just not a healthy place to work in. I was working there for 3 years and was never promoted to assistant manager when someone who knows nothing about management and only been like a year was promoted. Also customers were not very nice. No respect came from customers. Management was okay but as soon as I got another job, management did want to work with my schedule and just took me off the schedule completely. I just would not recommend working at the dollar tree on Bristol Plaza."
bad,u do not want o work ever in dollar tree it not something anyone would want u to do cause it how they handle thing the proper way then it always having a problem
bad,Nothing had been the same there since a new manager came about . Its not really a good job at all theres always someone new working there because the manager is just the worst !!
bad,Dollar Tree is unorganized poor management poor pay salary for stockers and cashier 735 an hour is the lowest in my area.To many truck a week no crew to shock.  It's an hazed in the stock room boxes top in top of box's. Can't get no help due to low minimum wage
bad,"No benefits, nor little time for a lunch break, hours are ridiculous, no healthcare no help from other management no self-motivation, zero character building."
bad,"This is not a job for career minded individuals. This is only suitable for school kids or college students on spring break. The hours are horrible was full time but could never get 40 hours was only getting 30 hours or less until Xmas then hours unlimited for 1 month. Hours are cut the rest of the year. Management was not good-very poor management skills- was always off and never at the store to get things done. Management would talk about workers behind their back, put all the work on the employees,and did not know how to manage the store or schedules. Overworked, stressful, no appreciation with little pay and raises for a whole year is 10 cents. Did not care if you had kids would rather you leave kids at home unattended and be at work, did not care about employees or their families.  This was the absolute worst job ever. I would not recommend working here unless its just extra cash for Xmas or during spring break for school kids."
bad,"My first day I saw the stockroom, it was one big mountain of boxes, literally piled from floor almost to ceiling. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. The aisles had boxes of merchadise sittng on the floor and the shelves were empty. There was no store manager, only a district manager."
bad,"I worked at Dollar Tree for three months before I quit. I was only getting paid $7.35 an hour and each shift only lasted for four hours. The scheduling was so terrible that some weeks, I was lucky if I worked one day a week."
bad,"They started me off as stocker ,as I applied, a month later I was put on a register without any experience. Small store with not enough associates there though out the day to  keep lines down at register. Rude customers for no reason when everything is a dollar. Complaints about products, but you honestly get what you paid for. This place is the definition of quantity over quality. The pay is so low you'll only make about $100-$150 working for two weeks. Highly recommend avoiding this place unless you need a place to start."
bad,At first i really enjoyed my job but the hours really sucked and even if you move up in the company you still never really get full time even if you are listed as full time and just really poor management
bad,"Terrible place to work, absolutely no loyalty and tons of favoritism. No security either, after being robbed on more than one occasion, nothing was done to improve the safety of employees. The district managers believe all the employees are committing theft on a daily basis as well."
bad,It is about the number of cartons you can push to the floor; unrealistic requirements for the poor pay.  Only management will see any of the fruits of your labor in their paycheck
bad,They will use you till they are done with you. Told them I could not work Sunday because I go to church but was available any other time or day. Kept putting me on Sunday morning and got fed up with it. They also kept changing my schedule constantly. Would walk in they would tell me to come back in two hours with no notice.
bad,"Every time I’d come to work on the days we had to unload the truck and it was running late, the manager would make me leave halfway through my shift and called me whenever it arrived so I could come back and unload it."
bad,Customers are rude and the manager is cheap with the hours only gave them to favorite people . And you don’t get overtime. Place is always busy and it stinks and it’s only 10$ an hour .
bad,workers were mean I didn't really get any hours management is bad there are no benefits at all no paid vacations off dollar tree is a bad place to work
bad,They dont appreciate u at all!! They are write up happy about everything!! Its very hard to balance family nd work especially when u are a manager nd u have to fill in for everyone who quits. They are ALWAYS losing help its like a swinging door here!!
bad,Great environment to work could of been of better by giving more hours specially if I was available more overall great place to work I liked it there even though I was there for a short while.
bad,Dollar Tree does not treat their managers or employees well. There is inefficient management.When I had a nervous breakdown they fired me. It is not a good place to work.
bad,But management was terrible she took hours away from the ones that was decided but she didn’t like that person and was put on the schedule one day a week or nothing for a few weeks
bad,The work is pretty simple. Hours are available. Somewhat. I was with the company for many years. Build relationships with regular customers. I thought I was doing well. When asked for a pay raise or job advancement you will receive the runaround. AT the end of my time there. I felt as though a carrot was dangled in front of my face like a mule. Asking me to keep moving forward with little to no reward.
bad,"I was an assistant Manager and ever other Assistant Managers would get payed 2 dollar more than me and i was just getting payed 50cents more than a cashier, when mentioned to the DM she just stood completely quiet. Shes a joke hours are horrible and they expect you to go above and beyond for nothing."
bad,Dollar tree only care about the money they do not care for there employees nor the safety of them it was very horrible place to work with out proper training
bad,They do not give their worker enough money  nor hour to meet the requirements of their work household unless they live with someone or their parents.  It is a nice job to work but the pay and management very poor
bad,Dollar tree is a horrible racist company. They pay cashiers minimum wage giving them only 15 hour work weeks.  They only provide 10 minute breaks. They dont want anyone scheduled over 5 hours at a time. The training is horrible. The customers trash the store and the company expects the store to fix it with no hours. They want the store manager to work nonstop. Its just a ridiculous company.
bad,"only give one or two shifts a week, people are always calling off managers tend to be poorly trained and the stores are messy.Company needs to hire people who actually care about their job"
bad,"When there's problems-the managers rather sit and do nothing. You have to fix the problems, or it doesn't get fixed. They expect you to come in on your day off to work if they call you. They expect you to stay late with them while they work."
bad,Been working here 6 years and I don’t know why I’m still here this is a horrible company to work for I don’t get paid enough to be doing the job that I do ! If you want to get treated like trash this is the company to work for
bad,You bust your butt for little pay no room for advancement. There are reason that the store can't keep help and why they are on their 4th manager in a 1 an a half year span. That place is a joke and it was embarrassing to work there. It is by far the WORST job in Retail that I have ever had.. They just don't care and the management and the store appearance shows it..
bad,"Managment never is secure. Always lacking a store manager. Gossip is very high, and your information is not confidential as it should be. I was threatened by past manager, corporate manager didn't do anything, and acted as if I was the issue. That manager ended up quitting on the spot the next day, I never got an apology."
bad,Dollar tree is a fast paced environment for its employees. You are on your feet your entire shift and constantly doing different things. I believe it is the right job for people who like that.
bad,"If you kiss a $$, you MIGHT get advanced. When having issues with staffing, managers do not want to hear about it. Neither do the district managers. Overall, this is the worst company i have EVER worked for in retail. To them,you really are just a number."
bad,working at the dollar tree was an head ache. they work you to death pay you little to nothing. write you up for simple minor things. does not train much just throw you on the floor.
bad,I worked at the cuba dollar tree and got hours when I started they slowly stay cutting hours and u will work 3 days a week 4 hours a day the manager is rude and the employees are hateful I would not recommend anyone to work there
bad,Its just plain not a good job for making a career and its not even a good job for making money to make it by to make ends meet. And you'll have to call them to know if you can come into work. And also...start off with 7.50 an hour.
bad,Manager will schedule people for a shift but no one is covered for the shift and it will cause problems and have others to work more hours and harder for very less pay
bad,"Lack of  communication between  managers, don't follow companies  policy and procedures  policies. Lack of firm responsibility for cashiers. Leave everything for night shift to do"
bad,"Interviewed for merchandise manager position that was supposed to pay $14/hr. That position wasn’t open so they just used me as cheap labor to do a store reset. Worked two stores in one day in order to be a full time employee. First store the manger wouldn’t give me a written schedule and claimed she told me on a Tuesday that I had to work the following Friday at 6am. No such conversation occurred but when I got a phone call at 8am Friday I went to work. I told the manager I didn’t hear her say come in at 6 she said “I’m not going to play this game with you” - I am 61 and have a college degree I don’t play games. Manger at second store did have a written schedule which stated I was to work 1-5. She demanded I work until the next cashier came in at 5:30. I reminded her the schedule said until 5. She said “you’re working until 5:30 until the next cashier comes in!”  Also when a customer wanted a helium balloon blown up (I had never been trained on the helium tank) she said it wasn’t her job (to blow up the balloon or apparently to show me how to do it). I’ve never worked at a job where someone especially a manager said it wasn’t their job."
bad,Everything i did at the Dollar Tree was very Repetitive and had no challenge. i am looking for a job that is going to challenge me and teach me something new daily
bad,working here sucked. customers were rude the manager was underqualified. the pay sucked and the other employees had no personality whatsoever. i do not recommend working here.
bad,"It was a temporary job. I came in after school to provide support.  A day at The Dollar Tree was assisting customers, stocking the shelves and providing cashier skills."
bad,The job was very demanding for little pay. The stock room they had us working in was a wreck u couldnt find anything and they would just put the stuff on the floor in boxes
bad,The job becomes super stressful and demanding. I felt like I didn't matter and that I was just another employee that will come and go. I won't recommend working here unless you have zero options to
bad,"I unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, did visual merchandising, set up for All Holidays and special sales or events. Cleaned up at night, I cashiers if they needed extra cashiers, helped customers."
bad,"The typical day at work would be a flood of people coming in and asking the price of everything and asking for applications or steeling. Management was terrible bringing they're emotions to work or just not caring about they're employees, on phones all the time them themselves stealing sometimes accusing you of stealing this was a first job I was here for  years things would only get worse and they pay is so little and for what."
bad,"The most unorganized workplace ever. "
bad,No job security. Will over work you and pay does not equal workload. No overtime ad compensation are not worth what they have you do there. Would not recommend this job to anyone!
bad,Loved the job until the first manager left. So we had one and he took over till they could find another and he was just way to lazy. I always had to do truck sometimes by myself. Gets busy at times. Not enough employees to be on floor or at registers..
bad,"typical day started with finding out who was scheduled, who called out, who can do what other jobs each one can accomplish. I have learned that you as a manager need to pick up jobs that others can not complete. work place culture was diversified. Hardest part of the job was being called in on your day off, usually to cover others who did not show. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers."
bad,"Started as a temp that assisted with putting the store together when the location of it was decided. I was kept on for a bit, but was told I would be kept as a cashier. I was for a few, but then the position was terminated without reason other than they did not have the hours to give."
bad,"The managers are very rude , the HR staff is very inconsiderate and very unprofessional. The warehouse over all is disgusting . They don’t care about they’re associates at all. A doctors note won’t mean anything , they’ll still give you points ."
bad,Fun job i noticed that i should have been offered a part time job but managers said i was not working any more after the season something was not right
bad,I.hate to be so negative but I really can't say anything good about working here! They pay minimum wage and expect an awful lot for that. You are treated very poorly.
bad,I really don't have anything to say good bout dollar Tree the paid is horrible they expect you to do to much for that little pay. The Ceo I never meet him .The DM is very understanding and will listen to anything you have to say.
bad,Was told I was working towards a promotion that was never intended for me. I would get a new manager one that would make the store thrive in the community.
bad,"Dollar Tree is not meant for ran well. They have no overtime, Barely any full time. I did not enjoy working there. I wouldn't do it again.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Typical day included being over-worked, constantly belittled, and disrespected by management while also trying to maintain a good attitude toward customers despite the workplace being so toxic for its workers. "
bad,"It was a mess, the worst place I have ever worked for. They taught me nothing I learned nothing the management was terrible. And no hours no days to work ."
bad,Manger's get all the overtime. if you have no respect for your talents this is the place for you. you could be there for years and pay will not go up one of my coworkers was there for 2 years and only got a 15 cents raise
bad,worst paid job ever.. management was terrible I wouldn't recommend ever working there. its just a place that you know isn't friendly and the manager isn't nice at all
bad,"not enough benefits, and required too much of the employees especially based off how much they get paid, not understanding of of sick days. calling off for any reason can lead to termination."
bad,"Loved working there, loved all the people i met,  Would work hard with no recognition of job well done.  Passed up for promotion, and told i wasnt reliable.  I called in sick 2 days due t pink eye.  She only would hire friends."
bad,Worked there 7 years no raises they only care about $ and don't give a  **  about their hard working employees new manager and h r fired me for being disibabled  and discriminated against me they don't like disabled people I'm trying to sue them now but their so cheap they only offered 500$  they think firing disabled people is a funny joke and think they have the right to break the law so if u love to never get raisess for all your hard work  and then get fired this is the job for you!
bad,"The management was horrible when I say HORRIBLE, I mean horrible!!! We had a different manager literally every 2 or 3 weeks tops!  Always In the office talking leaving one employee  at register and stocking and doing go backs all at once. The maintenance was so bad was rated most dirty unprofessional store in ventura county. Just my honest experience & opinion!"
bad,Dont work here at all. Its messy and disrespectful and disgusting. This is literally the worst job ever and I hope no one will ever work there again please dont.
bad,"I worked here for less than 2 weeks! I was working 2 jobs and my manager wanted me to go after i worked at my other job and she thought nothing of that i might have a life! She was rude to customers, always seemed frustrated when i had a question, she didn't train me enough or right at all, she left me at the store all by myself with me being new with nobody else there!!! So no i wouldn't recommend anyone even going there."
bad,Was told by a manager or supervisor idk what he was!! More like implied that i worked hard before a man than on my own! Which I thought was disrespectful
bad,The store manager didn't understand that when I requested a day off a month ahead was a important doctors appointment or a special ceremory I couldn't miss they still wanted me to work. They never have enough people working even though they have so many people on the schedule board.
bad,Dollar tree is a mess and will fire you for no reason. New employees are always being hired because of this. Management does nothing but sit in the office. They expect cashiers to clean store and stock all while taking care of customers. It is impossible to get everything done and when you do not you get written up for it.They give you no hours and pay minimum wage whether you have experience or not.
bad,A typical day is very busy at the register with  sometimes aggressive customers. The stores were unkempt. Long lines. I mastered patience and respect for management. Employees did not trust each other and often criticized management.  The hardest part is being respectful to disrespectful co-workers.  I enjoy retail.
bad,"pay sucked"
bad,"terrible wages, terrible benefits, no room for growth, and sexist management. No employee discount, or bonus'. understaffed and no employee acknowledgement"
bad,"This place is not a job to live on by any means. Low pay ,no hours, upper management has no respect for their employees..  high turnover..  its more of a in between job or second job.."
bad,I worked on the one in Saint Lucie West. Horrible hours. You only got hours of the boss liked you. If you didn’t come in when he wanted you to on your days off he sometimes wouldn’t give you hours. Everyone talks about you behind your back. Not enough pay. And there’s favorites cuz people have family working there. And they’ll lie and promise you advancement but in reality they won’t.
bad,"Management was poor and unfriendly, hours where inconsistent, store manager was always on her phone, talked down to employees, was promised consistent and fair hours, but got cut to 4 hours a week"
bad,"They don't pay well & the management is overworked & the cashier don't get very many hours. Managmemt is told to ""figure things out on our own"" but give us no authority."
bad,if you are trying to pay rent and feed your kids you are gonna need a second job. full time  because your 9 hours a week can be cut the night before if that days sales doesn't meet their quota.
bad,"A typical day here as a cashier usually just involves cleaning and recovering the front end of the store. It's not a very rewarding job, as it typically involves dealing with terrible customers from time-to-time; however, some customers are very nice. "
bad,"Not the job for adults with families and bills. You will remain broke and struggling, paycheck to paycheck. I would not recommend working anywhere for less than 9 an hour in this economy."
bad,The management was all over the place & the hours did not work for me. The only thing that I really enjoyed about the job was the customers.  For me it was not a good place for employment.
bad,"they treat there staff really horrible no chance for movement in the company the lower staff is worked way to hard for minim wage and no raises d.m.,s come and go regularly"
bad,"Intelligent people need not apply.  If the co-workers don't pick you apart, management will set you up for dismissal.  If I were warned about this place, I would have never worked there."
bad,I was working at dollar tree as an seasonal employer. I was asked if I wanted to stay after seasonal as part time and I said yes. I was not working part time . I was only 3 hrs  2x a week . I was not getting any hours at all . I did what was best for me and quit
bad,i would rather not give you my opinion because its not very professional. i have nothing good to say about dollar tree. dollar tree is not a place i would reccommend anyone to work there. they do not know how to talk to their employees. they also do know how to properly train people
bad,Dollar Tree has a lot of drama between employees and managers and everyone is in everyone's business. Everyone talk about everyone and it's never nothing positive. Its always negative
bad,Do not ever work for Dollar Tree...it is like Roses....they do not Value their employees at all. You will be better off working fast food like McDonald's honestly!
bad,Dollar Tree doesn't pay enough to keep good people therefore the turnover is very high and you never can get anyone in to work. You're constantly on the phone trying to call people in because it seems most people call in on their shift. Most of the management team doesn't do what's required of them and it falls on the couple of managers that actually do care.
bad,I was an assistant  store manager for  the store and  was one of  two  people  that was suposed to be in the full time  spot  and get benifits  I worked  there  for  7 years    like  this  and  when  the  new  DIST  mgr  tok  over  promised  and  promised  that  id  get the ful time  slot  and  benifits  and  that went on for  at  least  six  months  and After  7 years of employent  with DOllar tree  i was only making  $9.80  an  hour   REALLY  FLIPPING    HORRIBLE   !!!!!   not a way to make  ends  meet  and  to bust  your  back  end  to do it  too  now  that  i have  not  been there  since  the beginging of  october   they  cant  get any one  to  work that  position  because  of the  suck  pay  that they  give you for the  job they want you to  do    WOuldnt  suggest  any one  working  OR  Shopping there
bad,"The management was the worst I've ever seen. The store was dirty and never followed any of the policies that were put in place to keep it clean and safe for the staff. The hours were unpredictable, one week I worked 4 hours and the next I'd work nearly 30 as a part-time employee. The building had no air conditioning even though it was brand new, and it would get so hot that the managers brought in a cooler filled with ice water just so the employees didn't faint from the heat. Managers would talk poorly about other employees. Management was so rude to customers that I had them complain to me multiple times. This store was a disaster and I will never recommend working there to anyone."
bad,No advancement unless you had friends in high places. This was a terrible place to work and the pay was just as bad no raises were given and when they were they were to adjust the minimum wage.
bad,"Poor working environment for employees, poor  management, poor stock management, are all a cause of stress among employers along with irregular work time hours. All causes for my leaving the company."
bad,I had a very hard time in the work place at Dollar Tree. The staff were difficult to work with and refused to meet my needs as well. One of the manger had me worker over an hour after my shift ended because they didnt want to end their break to help me sign out out of my shift. My parent had been waiting in the parking lot for a long time and it added more stress for me. It was always crowed and cashiers were short staffed.
bad,"I worked at the Dollar tree on Orange Ave. NW store number 7626. It was awful the whole time I worked there it was stressful. they were on organized under staff the pay rate was awful they start you off at 7.25 the lowest pay ever, that's with experience they were understaffed just now getting a manager the month of December. I askedanother manager from a different store if I can relocate to a store closer to me to where I could get more hours they were they wouldn't allow me to move due to a percentage of what items which they didn't even took the time to explain to us about void items so glad I got a other job. Good lucky to whoever decide to work for this company"
bad,"Cashiers were nice to work with, management needs considerable improvement especially at this particular store. Working hours given are all over the place and inconsistent through out the week for some employees, and regular for others. Would have preferred a consistent daily schedule to work with rather than random depending on who needs what days off. Concerns about needed days off addressed in a very pleasing manner and worked out pleasantly. Truck day is unpredictable and needs better execution where the use of pallets and organization of unloading occurs where the unloader doesn't have to risk getting hit in the head by boxes falling all over the place, or those helping the unloader or management have to run around and end up placing boxes in just any place due to overwhelming space limitations and being rushed so that the truck gets on time to its next destination - very dangerous, stressful, and at times overwhelming - and truck arrival times were ridiculous - 5am is unheard of for a normal unloading time. More training of employees and staff needs to be looked into. More cashiers need to be on more busy days especially during the holidays, so the customers don't take out their anger on the cashiers. Overall, I was very dissatisfied with the job. I am grateful for learning the skills that I did, but it could have been a way better experience if certain things were looked into and managed more efficiently and properly."
bad,Working at dollar tree was very hectic on a daily basis.There was never enough payroll to staff the floor efficiently.Upper management never had a legitimate excuse why things weren’t running correctly.
bad,would not want anyone I know work for these people. they don't concern themselves with employees and their availability. just how fast the product can get to the shelves and hire others for same pay as someone who is been there for a year or more and pay a new employee the same.
bad,"it was always a problem. There were never enough workers, and there were boxes stacked taller than I am! Anybody hired typically receives training. managers rarely work with you, and even when you try to get time off with ample time, there is a decent chance you wont get it. Everybody there, with few exceptions, is still stuck in high school.  There is always a rumor going around about someone. the only good part about the job was getting to go home"
bad,"a typical day at dollar tree its not as you think it is. a lot of drama with the employees and costumers, management can be rude and mean. it didn't go as well as I thought."
bad,My day at work start with getting all my products together in order to stock the shelf's learned where everything need to be on a daily basis the hardest part of the job is unloading the truck but I enjoy a honest day of work
bad,What a way to screw yourself. Poor upper and cooperate managment. To much dog eat dog stuff going on district 602 region 30. Applied all tools for a good success in the business and was slandered by my employees who disgusted me so bad with their lies I had to leave. I cannot help support a store that insist to be ran this way.
bad,I was fairly new on the job and they would get on me for making mistakes instead of just telling me the right way. I just started working their for only 2 days.
bad,"Dollar Tree has unrealistic expectations on their employees and expect them to work miracles with no hours. They are strict on everything and pay the bare minimum. It is not worth the pay, the drama, or anyone's time. I have personally witnessed 2 district managers mistreat employees and talk down to them like they are less than everyone else. There is a lot of good, hard working employees at Dollar Tree and they get treated as useless trash. Never expect a thank you."
bad,"The scheduling for hours at this s. Broadway location is unfair. To get any hours at dollar tree is 4hrs some times 8 or 12 hours a week . You would have to keep asking for hours, or go to another store for more hours. The store needs help bad. Due to the backroom over packed from shipment."
bad,"Dollar tree is very slow paced, I was underpaid for the amount of work that I had to do and the manager was very mean. The schedule was not a set schedule because I would get called in the middle of week while I am at school to come to work when that is not what my scheduled said."
bad,Worst place ive ever worked in my life. Anywhere is better than here. Always busy during peak holiday seasons. the management is corrupt and dont care and will make you feel bad about any callouts reguadless of what it is.
bad,"Terrible experience working at Dollar Tree - Management was horrible & mistreated staff, didn’t show up for shifts so the store was left closed until someone else went in to open it. Schedule was never complete we would only get a text the day of saying when it was complete. Never seen such terrible management, seemed like a good place to work until you see how unorganized it is. A month after minimum wage changed as of oct 1/2018 & I was still being paid less than minimum wage. Not recommended for a place of employment."
bad,"Not enough hours, expected to be available 24 hours a day"
bad,"I would never recommend Dollar Tree to anyone looking for employment. Not only is the pay not competative, but Management is a joke and they have no customer service skills."
bad,"ok.ok.ok.ok.ok. fast pace,clean,friendly,divers, headache,unfair at times,good scheduling,team work,easy to grow within the comany,easy training,good pay"
bad,"I worked at Dollar Tree for 10 years. I started as assistant manager and moved up to store manager. The job is very demanding and frustrating. Stores stay dirty due to lack of hours  and customers running around playing trashing the store with no care at all. I have worked many months with 0 to 1 day off per week. I have never been in trouble in my life. Never had a write up or verbal warning for anything in my 10 years. Recently I was fired for a fairly minor policy violation. Anybody else would get a write up first, but for me a suspension wasn't even an option. For a company that preaches how they value their employees, you can't even get a response from any higher ups to have your case heard by an arbitrator. Never work for this company!!!"
bad,Upper management are more concerned about getting their bonus than anything. they overwork the store level management while they keep consistently cutting hours so they make more.
bad,I was set up for failure. On my first night my cart was so overloaded that it took three people to get the items to the floor. They had so many things on my cart that there was ABSOLUTELY no where to put items. Built end cap on first four hour shift.
bad,"The manager was very inconsistent with who had to follow the rules.  The assistant manager didn't know how to do her job.  And just because the assistant manager told the manager everything that was said, asked or done by other workers she could get away with what ever she wanted.  Very clicky.  Made me feel like an outsider"
bad,Dollar tree is not a great place to be employed at..The store manager is horrible and they don't get paid enough money the company expects you to do two jobs in one..
bad,"When they say they are looking for part time workers they mean it. Some people only get 9 hours a week. You do the job of two people and don't get paid very well. The store manager I had was very unstable. She liked to yell at the employees and accused them of not doing their job, when in fact she wasn't doing hers. You also live your life one week at a time. You never get more then one schedule at a time so you can't make any plans."
bad,"They expect  to  much  out  of  the  employees  . Work  hours  for management  is required  to  work  to many  days  and hours  for the holidays .  I   learned  that  this  type  of  work  is not for me.  "
bad,"It felt like management was against me from day one."
bad,I feel like they don't appreciate their workers let me rephrase that their good workers and its like you workubg hard for a little pay 266.00 every two weeks is not enough for a single mother with kids.
bad,i learned a lot within my 5 years working there but i would never recommend any one to go work there. Cause there is a lot of favoritism there. Plus when got sick and had to call off a couple times they frown upon that.
bad,I did not like the manager at this place because he was a micromanager and always wanted things to go exactly his way. He gave me no room to work autonomously
bad,"dont work at dollar tree .... management isn't good , they say that they will be flexible with the schedule and they don't at all and you have another job"
bad,My experience was bad but management was moving around and everything sucked no hours no steady schedule the managers had favorites and would give them all of the  hours
bad,"lack of enthusiasm,  managers are underpaid and treat their subordinates poorly, stores are often unkept and dirty, shelves disorganized, workers do not seem to enjoy working there"
bad,"I worked at a dollar tree in columbia, south carolina and the place was just awful. Older workers bullied the newer ones. The manager would make fun of customers with other customers while they were in the store. Absolutely awful place to work i dont know how that store is still around."
bad,"the dollar tree manager in Albemarle nc is by far the worst manager to work for ,I was hired on for days like we discussed.worked one day everything was good  on my second day she called me and said you no longer work here I need someone that can work nights.then I went to apply at another dollar tree and guess what it wasn't my fault at all and she put me on the do not rehire list for any dollar tree.    very unpolite and very unprofessional on her end."
bad,"It wasn't the best job... not too many hours. it was too cut throat, expectations were too high for very low pay. I wouldn't recommend it to my worse enemy."
bad,Love the job but not the pay it would be better if they will have overnight and more hours but love stocking and making the store nice and clean for opening
bad,"This place is a zoo. Company doesn’t know who you are. They only care about your production numbers. Other than that, they could care less who you are. This is why the turn around of new employees for this company is very high. Employees come and go and so does management."
bad,This place was horrible the manager rollen is horrible he talks down to you and you dont receive any hours and to make 300 dollars you have to take anyshift and never have a day off
bad,I would not recommend  this  place to work to my worst enemy. Maybe for the entire week you'll  work 10-15  hours. The pay scale is one percent above minimum  wage.  One person do the work of merchandiser/casheir/ janitor. Managers are often frustrated from unloading delivery trucks and doing inventories
bad,"It has no real upper management.  they treated their employees badly. "
bad,Would not ever recommend. Management was terrible and selected favorites out of the employees. No real benefits to working for them whatsoever. 1/10 for a job.
bad,It was awful working there. When I worked there I had never worked as a cashier before and I was not trained properly and my mistakes were treated severely with no help afterwards to teach me properly.
bad,This company is a last resort job if you seriously can’t find one. The management is horrible and lack respect. The shifts all hate each other. People fight over jacks if your in the stupid rotations. They expect you to hit a high numbered goal within 5 weeks or you get written up and fired immediately. They never give constructive criticism they just talk down to the employees. Besides the friends you may make on your shift this place is filled with drama and arrogant people.
bad,"This job was a part time job during college so I did not care about the quality of the work. I just needed a job, and this was good for the moment and I appreciate the opportunity to gain experience."
bad,Horrible company to work for.  You are expected to work 70-80 hour work weeks. Not family oriented company at all.  Always understaffed due to no hours allowed.
bad,"I would not recommend dollar tree because it has lack of team work, not enough hard workers, also they are limited on hours. The management was horrible and they didnt work on meeting the main goal of the day."
bad,"Handled standard duties for a retail store, stocked shelves as merchandise came , cashiered, helped customers when necessary, They were more interested in speed on registers than on greeting customers and paying attention to cash drawers."
bad,had to put the entire store together with the help of other indiviuals you obviouslly didnt siqn up for that. the ad said nothing about store assembly or lack of hours.smfh
bad,"I gave them one star because I cannot give them zero (what they deserve).  Poor management, poor training, low pay (low than the minimum wage), unorganized workplace, unprofessional.  From five hours of work they just give you 10 minutes break.  Give yourself a favor and apply for a job somewhere else!"
bad,I worked at the Dollar Tree in Princeton and they wouldn’t give me any more work days. I got maybe three work days. And then wouldn’t have any money for phone bill.
bad,"not enough hour to know a typical day at work"
bad,there was a lot of thing to do in there but I didn't  like the pay  and the hours they give me .  and they didn't want to give me more hours because the pay they gave it didn't work at all ....
bad,"My job at Dollar Tree had it's ups and downs. I enjoyed learning everything I could while I worked my way up from freight supervisor to Store Manager."
bad,poor hours and management. unorganized and completely unsafe environment. hours were horrible and when i was scheduled it was always when i had to be at school. little to no help from management with training. they just stick you on a computer and let you lose.
bad,no incentives or school advancement no raises for hard. Little hours. no incentives. Store appearance was terrible and got treated poorly my management and other employees
bad,I would never recommend this work place to anyone. You do all the work while the rest of the staff socializes or is on there phones. The bayville store is dirty they dont keep it clean. and the shelves are always a mess. nothing is in the right place.
bad,"Typical day"
bad,"Poor management. The managers are not understanding when it comes to sick days, even when you have pneumonia and have no way of receiving a doctors note due to no healthcare."
bad,The pay isn't enough for how stressful the job is. The company doesn't care about it's workers. The company barely cares about it's products. Anything bought has to have a receipt taped to it. I am constantly being accused of stealing.
bad,did not like working because management and workers did not ever come to a agreement  the hours was short and every morning when I come to work I would have to wait for someone to open the store we would always open late
bad,"the work conditions suck, the pay sucks, and usually the management suck as well. It is not a good place to work, consider a different job before you apply here."
bad,"I gave dollartree my all and they screwed me over I got injured on the job and I had to pay myself with my vacation time and sick time . I thought workers comp was going to rake care of that but they didn’t , I called and left messages and never got a response back !"
bad,I liked the people but the job had issues they don't work you full time so they can avoid giving you any benefits. The pay was very low and the management wasn't professional
bad,This was the worst job that I've ever had the chance of me ever going back to this company is slim to none and I don't have any plans of going back  yet some of my other jobs were also as bad just that the management was very unfair and disrespectful
bad,The employees have no respect or males what so ever and the managers are backstabbing and don't value their jobs they are lazy it was the worst place i have ever worked
bad,"They are a disrespectful company that does not treat their workers with any increment of value. HR is hands-off with almost all things, and no one ever recognizes achievements -- not in Albany, at least. They rarely promote from within, especially at the Store Manager level. I believe Dollar Tree to be a particularly criminal organization. I was exposed to various dangerous situations consistently; sometimes daily. I worked for them for a year and a half, much longer than 90% of my coworkers. If you can find another job, you should. If you can't, well... at least it's something."
bad,"Very poor management of:"
bad,I started as a cashier and work my way up to frieght manager at first I loved my job I had two store managers that were the best till one day we got this devil  as a new store manager she started treating me like a dog she threatening me and another employee and verbally abused us almost everyday we went threw the chain of command but nothing was done about it
bad,"it was nothing hard about the job, only had to was stand by the cash register. That was a typical day at the job was to just work the cash register till the end of my shift."
bad,"The store is never cleaned, everyone slacks off, the manager just wants to go out and smoke and not do any work and they yell at employees whenever a customer is rude towards them."
bad,"Pay was bad , they give no hours , they only offer part time and have the audacity to have biweekly pay and the managers are rude and inconsiderate .."
bad,"I'm an ex employee and quite a few of my assistant managers were horrible to both the employees and the customers. I had so many complaints about one specific assistant manager.  I brought it up to the ""Big Manager"" and he just brushed it off.  "
bad,"i am currently a merch manager here. "
bad,everyone in management are shady characters. People like to back stab you to get ahead . Management talks down to there associates and expect them to be available anytime in they want them to work.
bad,"sales associates perform basic customer service duties. Primary responsibilities include meeting and greeting customers, assisting in sales, and answering questions about products, services, and merchandise. Dollar Tree sales associate may also double as cashiers at some locations."
bad,"its dirty"
bad,The management isn't wonderful they over work there employees for 8.25 hr unloading 4000 piece trucks stocking. AC is always broke store is always dirty specially the bathrooms never properly cleaned. Deposit system is dangerous management want to be nasty m mean to you there suppose to be nice . Then you have the bad customers come in it's the worst Dollar tree to work at even in management you never move up you just get stuck there .
bad,"Long lines, no help from management, high turn over, tiring work, extremely rude and demanding customers, long hours for part time work, slightly better pay than most low end jobs"
bad,Store manager expected me to lift heavy boxes too heavy for a pregnant women. When cashiering store manager would say something to humiliate me in front of customers. Manager was sarcastic when you asked where something was at that no one has ever informed you about. Training is done by other cashiers who are not trained to train. Store manager shares confidential information of other employees without you even asking.
bad,"I would say it’s a great place to start as a first job, but not as a steady working job. Very poor management, they got mad at me for having stuff to do so they fired me without me knowing until the next week. They’re still refusing to give me my last check. When i asked about it, they told me get over it."
bad,All the workers  are working for 7.25 and that is under pay and i need another job so i can make a living/ they cut hours and we one work 2 or 3 days out of a week and we get payed every 2 weeks and i need another job
bad,They are very unorganized. The manager she is very rude she does not attend to the customers or employees like she should she cusses to the employees she's not reasonable at all that's the reason I left there and I didn't want to be no part of that store with her being there
bad,I liked the job but the pay was not to my standards the employees and customers were great just the pay i did not agree with but if they increase the pay it would be ok
bad,"When I first started working there, it was a great job. Then, the more I worked, the more stressful it got. I didn't get my break until 30 minutes before it was time for me to clock out. And one time before that, I didn't get a break until 10 minutes before I had to clock out. I wouldn't recommend working there unless you can handle it."
bad,When I first started back in 2015 the job was awesome I actually woke up and was ready to go to work but now I really don’t care for the Dollar Tree any more if it had more pay and more hours I will love to stay
bad,"When your manager comes in with a attitude everyday you go in to work it can get tiring, then on top of that they cut your hours in half almost every other week."
bad,"There is just 10 minutes for break every 4 hours."
bad,The managers were rude referring to other coworkers as explicit words intended to describe a female dog. The customers are rude and disrespectful just as the managers are. All the female employees sit around and gossip about one another.
bad,"Not enough hours. A typical day includes running the register, stocking shelves, helping customers find merchandise. Management  is  adequate.  The hardest part of my job is trying to restock shelves while  running the register and attempting to  extend best customer service possible. The part of my job at Dollar Tree I enjoy most is the interaction with customers. Unfortunately they do not offer enough hours."
bad,Assistant managers are  expected to do a lot more for little pay. They are also not appreciated for all the hard work that they do at this pay. They should be compensated more for everything that is expected of them.
bad,"Not a place for a beneficial career. Staff members as well management are completely over worked . Not enough hours to cover very demanding shift . "
bad,"no life work balance, no hours no payroll, upper management do not care for anything that happens at store level. manager based business meaning management must do it all especially store manager."
bad,this company sucks I hate it and I would let my dog work for them they wont give full time unless you a manager and they expect like too much out of one person
bad,"Dollar tree was my first job experience and I really didn't  like the environment, we did a lot to do but the salary was not worth it. I was a cashier but I did stocking, cleaning bathrooms etc."
bad,it is very hard to move up in the company.  they give bonuses to the 2 full time managers but to no one else.  They do not hire enough people to take care of the store and customers
bad,"It all depends on the customer and satisfying them "
bad,they make you work in extreme temps without the proper hydration to make sure that you are safe. they are all about meeting a 125% quota each day you work.
bad,"Dollar tree made employees work with the heater on all year long, even is summer to which I have gotten I'll many times. Dollar tree says employees are important  but do not exactly follow that statement.  When an employee  is harassed the DM brushes it off and tells you to get over it or give them another chance, putting all the blame on yourself. Some store managers bully their employees and get away with it. Some store managers used and abused their job titles. Cashiers stood around when no one was in line for hours even asked by an asm to do something  they would just stand around. The shelves are filthy."
bad,I really liked working for dollar tree and management was great and team members worked well together with getting the job done and making sure all freight was put out for customers
bad,Very very very poor management. I got low pay and that’s that I had experience and everything. Plus I had to always do other areas that I wasn’t even supposed to do. I get you help people out yes but you shouldn’t have to do it constantly plus your own work.
bad,"Working at dollar tree is alright, but, if you plan on moving up the latter there; don't hold your breath. As far as management, forget about learning your role in the position you applied for from the managers. They will feed you to the wolves & then criticize your work"
bad,The management treats employees woth no respect and you are not treated fairly and when the mangers make a mistake they nlame the employees ..not getting payed good enough for how they treat you while working for them
bad,By far the worst place to work for the company doesn't know what they're doing they cut hours and send more product so nothing gets out and nothing gets done and favoritism is a big problem with this company
bad,"Management was never really friendly, always complained when asked for help. Got left alone in the store, with no pins or passwords if anything was to happen."
bad,The management was so unorganized. they made me do everything thing but didn’t want to give me a raise. Treated me unfairly and were inconsistent with my hours ..
bad,"The Dollar Tree ONLY pays minimum wage, and you work VERY hard for nothing. They DO NOT care about you at all. You do not get out on time, and they want you to work extra only to cut your hours later, and you work off the clock all the time. The store itself is awesome just don't work for them."
bad,"They will bring you down, accuse you of doing things and use you until they are done with you and then they will get rid of you one way or another. Never had time or holidays with my family. Was the only one who worked all holidays and weekends. They suck the life out of you. It is very hard work when you are the only one doing it all. Store manager got all the time in the world to do things and because of salary base pay, they never actually came to work for their scheduled time, but they still got paid. You will work your butt off for nothing in return."
bad,"I worked for Dollar Tree for almost a year. I came in on my days off, stayed late all of the time, came in early. I also did things that other people would not ever consider doing."
bad,Working at dollar tree can be very stressful and very demanding. Each day you are expected to accomplish tasks set by your supervisor. It is very fast paced.
bad,"Currently it seems disorganized. You can't finish one thing before being told to do something else and management can belittle you over small mistakes (I have this as a current first job with no previous experience.) it makes you feel really uncomfortable. There's pretty much no A/C (unless I just couldn't feel it from moving so much or because of how warm it gets outside) so you feel gross at the end of the day towards the end of your shift. Customers can sometimes be really nice and it can run smooth, but others can demand high amounts of purchases being split up in certain ways (ex. if someone buys 100 dollars worth of stuff and wants it split up 4 times) or they buy one item with two twenty dollar bills, which causes lines to get long due to counting the necessary change due back to them. Back up to handle those lines can be hard to recieve because sometimes you get so understaffed due to breaks and people calling in, so you can get stressed and fatigued real fast trying to handle it, which causes more problems and issues with management and the drawer at the end of your shift, which if you are under or over in some way, you can get written up depending on the amount. I've left home upset more than 4 times and it sucks. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I feel bad for only lasting less than a week."
bad,I took the job here because I was desperate after needing to get a job and not finding one. The pay is very low compared to the retail industry. Corporate management doesn’t know what everyday work is like in the stores.
bad,The managers were really bad at their jobs. The store manager did not care about her workers and often fired people for things out of their control and or abilities.
bad,"Don't recommend working for them, no set schedules, constant call outs, changeover of employees is insane. Managers like to sit in office and put off hard work,or the messy jobs to new employees"
bad,"They hired anyone, no body enjoyed their job, they got in and wanted to get out. stealing, drug use , worked a lot of hours as management with out gratitude."
bad,"Pay is not conducive to the amount of work that is required. As an Assistant Manager the pay should be minimum &40,000. The standards are low, its a dollar tree and they treat the employees as if their worth is a dollar."
bad,"Under staffed and lack of strong management.. cannot complain to corporate because they don't listen to their employees. only if you're in management."
bad,My most enjoyable part of my job is saying hello welcome to dollar tree friendly co worker and hard workers management is nice in my words thats it for working at dollar tree
bad,the hardest part about this job lack of  work how rude the customer are. in this site was very hard to work there and how demanding they was for lack of work
bad,"Working here offers no advancement, no raises, and no flexibility. Management will not work with you if and when personal matters may come about. Lots of tedious work with no pay."
bad,just terrible. don't do it. there is nothing enjoyable about the job; perhaps a starter job but even then it's always something negative.  blah blah blah have to fill in a certain amount of characters apparently..
bad,"For a high school kid it is a good starting job, low hours low pay. As far as being an adult and trying to make ends meet the job sorely lacks. Poor management."
bad,Dollar Tree pays minimum wage and only hires part time. They work you hard with very little pay. This is not the job if you are trying to raise a family.
bad,Store Manager was late on a regular basis. He and the other female assistant manager  take the same days off. I was not tought from the binder  that has teaching process. Notes would be left  instead I was not shown the proper way I had to investigate the proper procedues.
bad,"I do not like this job, the hours are really bad, you won't have the opportunity to get full time. I do not like Dollar Tree. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone that has bills."
bad,"This job is just best for high school kids. Never firing for full time. Just like any other big corporation, employees are less than human... we are all expendable"
bad,"I took a job as ast manager because I was told I would get my own store in a cpl of months.  After working in a filthy store for months just unloading trucks, being a stock girl and cashier I walked out and never went back.  DM's are horrible and have no answers and all are passive aggressive.  I'm back to being a real manager, coaching and developing associates and building my business. Don't take a job here."
bad,Four 4 hours shifts per week at $13 per hour on a biweekly pay check is so pointless. I dont know how they think thats livable pay. Even as a second job its not doing much. They are perfect for teenagers yet they hire 18 and over. Shoplifting is a huge problem in the store n they rather the employees act as lost prevention and security instead of hire ppl for that position. No benefits 10 minutes breaks are mandatory so u dont even get ur whole 4 hours.
bad,it's a stressful place for everyone co workers were ok. That somes it up not much more to say minimum wage pay top dollar work expected. obviously the two don't go together.
bad,"Job was supposed to be management. Turned into cashier, stocking, cleaning and chasing the next change of policy."
bad,"I work for the Dollar Tree for over a year-and-a-half. And I felt like I was back in high school. Every time I made a solid complaint about peoples work ethics, I was shut down. I was doing other people's work while they stood around and twirl their hair. I was unsatisfied with the management that works there, they took more cigarette breaks than actually worked. Can't say all experiences while working there  we're bad, just management was horrible."
bad,"trash place to work. nobody cares about anything, management shows favoritism and they don't care about if anything is wrong with you or if anything personal is going on in your life. they talk about they business out loud in front of everyone."
bad,"Too much work placed on the management. Starts employees out at $7.25 With a dime raise ever year, which places a lot of turn over on the stores. Payroll hours are too low for the amount of work and customers that are present. This is why everytime someone enters a dollar tree, they are usually a disaster."
bad,"unrealistic goal culture, terrible management skills, I'm a great worker and don't dilly dally, but when the quota is unrealistic and management is more concerned about a quota rather than looking at how hard a person is working, then there is something really wrong with a company like that, I don't mind hard work, which is why I too a position there, I wanted hard work to lose weight, which I did, but for $8.25 per hour, this company thinks you are a slave, they are completely out of touch with reality. I feel sorry for people that have to work there, they would so like to tell off dollar tree corporate and management, but some people are so afraid of losing there jobs, they won't really tell the truth, but how poor working conditions are. so sad."
bad,ever since dollar tree merged with family dollar things just got worse and worse we were expected to do alot more with a lot less hours and if it wasnt done it was up to the manager to complete
bad,Poor Management. no communication or team orientated company. Management doesn't acknowledge the associates complain or concerns of how they are being talk to or treated.
bad,I need a good job to take care of my kids and all. Love to drive and stock. Need a full time job.i have to pay rent and all. I like cleaning up and fixing things
bad,The management is unreliable and scheduling doesn't make sense.  They would post schedules but never put the dates on them so best guess what day you were suppose to work.
bad,Typical Day at work at first was great. They told you what to do and left you alone to do it. Then when district managers came in they started pushing for more work to be done. Management verbally abused workers and all of a sudden was not satisfied with work done. Never said anything about work before.
bad,"My experience at the Dollar Tree was a unique one. It was enjoyable but extremely stressful at the same time.  Management needs to be more organized and professional, and the hiring of individuals really needs to be done by someone who is looking to hire individuals that are smart and willing to work, not by someone who is just trying to get people into the store just to keep it afloat. The profanity that is constantly used in the store whether open or closed by the head manager, and the manner in which people are talked to needs to cease, it really becomes bothersome."
bad,"staff is friendly, close to home, easy to use cash register, meeting new people is fun, in a huge shopping center with many other stores, Eastlake is a nice city to work in"
bad,I was a cashier and stock person.  The hours varied and during holidays and back to school the lines were very long with adequate staff.  I would never to back there.
bad,"Manager was very rude "
bad,A good starter job but not for a career. You can't advance and are stuck where you are. No benefits unless you are a mgr. Very unorganized company to work for.
bad,"I worked over time. I closed the store many nights by myself. I also worked for 3 months with not 1 day off, I worked as 3 people but the upper management wrote me up bc I was over on my hours. But yet I had cashier after cashier call into work and I would be the only one left."
bad,This was an ok job it payed the bills but the people that worked here had nasty attitudes but i tries to make the best out of it i still came to work with a smile on my face ready to start my day .
bad,I didn’t like it was a way back to into the work force for me. I’ve moved on to way bigger and better job advancements. I will never go back unless I was a boss.
bad,Management was very rude. Fired myself when I informed management that I was pregnant and also called me stupid to my face when I informed them of my pregnancy. Would not recommend
bad,I would not ever work there again no organization there manager suck no benefits. I really would never recommend anyone to work there unless desperate they don't take care of their employees
bad,The work was for barely above min wage and in the 8 years I worked there only made 20 CENTS over min wage. The company cares very little for its employees
bad,"Bad company ,no money ,They want you to work a lot but rate of paid low and to grow in the company they prefer to hired from outside in miami at least"
bad,"The new manager was so unprofessional,rude, lazy and disrespectful to his staff memebers. Never gave consideration with lifes problems. Didnt care long as you came in, regardless of the situation was. Very disrespectful."
bad,"Not all, but most stores are poorly managed and employee's are over worked. Upper managment does nothing about employee complaints, and there is a high turn over because of it. Would not recommend this company to my enemies. On a side note, due to their lack of drug and criminal history checks ANYONE including predictors can work there."
bad,"Im going to keep this short and sweet. If you want a job where they are illegally distributing the working hours , and not paying fairly and working under older woman who are drug addicts then work here"
bad,"Management was very un-loyal, untruest worthy, very forward and uncomfortable to work with.I don't like to be talk to sideways and with no respect. I fell the wait of Racism and discrimination"
bad,"Hours are never the same, pay is not worth the time and effort you put in. I feel they don't appreciate there employees. However they work with there employee's if they have an emergency and need time off."
bad,"Good starter job, you can progress if you want but its hard work for little money with no benefits unless you are full time. I enjoyed the job when I had good crews to work with and that was the most enjoyable part having fun people to work with. It could be enjoyable at times. Hardest part was unloading freight from trucks. The job is easy for the most part if you are a cashier. I stocked which was a lot more work because you are expected to stock at least 2 to 3 uboats a shift and then as an assistant manager of course a lot more duties are involved along with stocking."
bad,"Everything was pretty much quiet most of the time. Except around the holidays like 4th of July, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Christmas, Easter, etc. Those are the main holidays that are crazy."
bad,"You can expect a high stress, physically demanding workplace. I was hired on seasonal then moved to regular associate but when I mentioned I wanted to move into management I was laughed at and was given all the duties of the manager but was never given enough hours, help, or pay to compensate the time and effort put into the work."
bad,So stressed out I had to leave. Worked an average of 50 hrs. and expected to do more. No appreciation for anything you did. Just wanted more. I would cry going to work. Then I would get there and throw up.
bad,its dumb. not alot of hours. not paid enough to do what they want done. i got tired of them. they suck. it was annoying. didnt  learn nearly enough. too much drama
bad,"It was a two week renovation of the job, the management did not make it clear what position i was hired for and were very inconsiderate. The pay was low for the type of work we were doing and the amount of hours given was not enough"
bad,The Dollar Tree corporate mentality is we don't care about you there will always be someone who wants a job. They manage by fear and intimidation. It's a sad State when you walk into work and you don't know if you're going to make it through the shift without being fired. All of the managers I had were under the age of 30 with no real management experience. It seems they made the rules up as they went along.
bad,have to deal with employees laying out and find a replacement for them.had to keep store stocked all day and everyday.made schedule for the week to keep staying ahead. brought the store I managed from low sales to high sales was was never appreciated.
bad,it was horrible the store was poorly managed by people who didn't know what they were doing I hated the time I worked there I wouldn't recommend to anyone
bad,I would not reference a friend or no one to dollar tree to work it a good store to shop in but not to work in the pay is way to low for the labor you have to do
bad,"Poor environment for management and associates. Never ending freight and no payroll hours to stock shelves, check out customers, merchandise, or clean."
bad,"the management ran the place awful.  She was rude and degrading, the work itself was not bad but I left becuase of the money and the manager.  She was extremely demanding and made me not want to come into work."
bad,Store manager would rather be outside smoking and talking on the phone to her friends and husband then be inside to help cashier or customers. I had heard it had a high turn over rate and I now see why people only stay a month or so at a time. One assistant manager would come to work drunk or hung over almost daily and treated employees and customers horribly.
bad,I was hired as assistant manager at dollar tree. The first week went fine however it quickly became obvious the manager had no experience and relied on me to pick up everything she was unable to do. I was hired as part time but worked 8 to 13 hour days and later found the manager was altering my timecard taking hours away.
bad,Nothing but stress and having to work 6 days a week 12-15 hour days for the same pay. District manager could careless about you or your family needs. Makes his own rules and HR doesn't do anything when you report behavior issues. Not worth anybody going and killing themselves for this company they only care about money in the store not your well being health or life.
bad,I would go in at night and stock the shelves with merchandise. Merchandise was nice meeting organized where it was supposed to be in the store I would unload the truck on the truck today and organize everything in the stock room where it went and there was no stopping to do I learn how to be a cashier so I can get more hours and I ran the register today customer service
bad,The company lacks training. Sent me to a store that was already in trouble and gave no training to get it organized. Made promises and never followed through with anything.
bad,"The store was always a mess, the assistant manager of the time didn't coordinate with anyone most of the time, half of the staff were unfriendly, and the manager was rarely there."
bad,If items were not put away by the end of the night shift and you were busy the entire shift with customer service you would have to clock out and work until everything was stocked and faced on the shelves or you'd be wrote up.  This is the Dollar Tree in Chico CA on East Ave.
bad,This was the worst work environment I have ever been in no AC for working in the store.  Employees that were lazy and just didn't care where allowed to work and get the same pay as those who work three times as hard as them employees would call in sick one or two minutes before their shift began and employee that was already there even though they were scheduled to work only tell a certain time where made to stay or made you feel guilty about not staying the manager was doing the best she could but she could not do it all did not have the proper support system from corporate I feel that this is the worst company to ever for anyone to ever work at  unless you just don't want to make any money don't want to have any time to do anything for yourself or don't want to know what your schedules ever going to be because it would change on a daily.  And God forbid you had anything planned because you are so made to feel guilty so badly that you would have no choice but to go to work or they would take you and only give you five or six hours a week instead of the 25 to 30 that every store employee gets because they do not allow anything but part-time employees
bad,"Management has no clue as to what they are doing and refuse to give you your two days off. "
bad,Management poorly trained attendance policy poorly managed cut-throat type of enviroment not i great place for  males or females with kids do to the cut thoat enviroment
bad,"The job was ok physically, but when it came down to training for assistant manager, things seemed to take a downfall with disrespectful people and non knowledgable . Just a very poor place to work..dollar tree is  awesome.. but the boss and head bosses were realy horrible."
bad,"Bad work experience,  never got paid my last check , nobody has an idea of what there doing . Store is never stocked,  nobody works together.  Dollar tree corporate has no idea of what's going on"
bad,"I read the reviews, but was willing to give the job a shot.  However, on the first day I knew that this wasn't going to be a long term thing.  I was willing to give it a few months, but after only working here for a few weeks, I probably won't last much longer.  Never enough employees to work with and expect way more out of assistant managers compared to other retailers.  Crowded stockrooms with no place to throw away trash creates a hazardous environment and work space.  A good start to anyone needing a few job or temp job, but do not make long term plans with this company.  I worked for several retailers and this is the first time I feel overwhelmed and overworked with the compensation not reflecting the amount of work expected."
bad,poorly staffed no training conflict constantly with staff and management assistance are poorly trained. i actually had one make comments on my life style more than once  no room for advancement very poor pay state minimum
bad,Very stressful job as a manager you do 90 percent of the work turnover rate is high because no one wants to  work there the pay is low. Wonderful place to shop horrible place to work.
bad,"This was grate job at first. I would get 18-24 hours a week then (holiday hours) the hours slowly went from 18-14 hours then from 8-14 hours a week. Two four hour shifts a week but they still continue to hire more people. They have a horrible management staff. They go behind your back with write ups never confronting you about your ""misconduct at work"" but instead leaves the wright ups for general manager to see while supervising manager leaves for vacation for two weeks. Truly a horrible and unsupported work environment."
bad,Poor pay scale and poor upper Management working conditions were not the best working enviroment. The building and heating and air conditioning for the building were not up to par
bad,not a good place  to work in its hard and stressful lack of management don't  know how to take care of ur employee very low wage for a experienced worker
bad,There is constantly a long line in the store. There are not enough employees on staff. Unorganized low pay rate and not enough hours. Management is terrible as well.
bad,"I couldn't get enough hours. They weren't willing to hire full time staff members, The pay was very low. The manager was very nice tho .. it wasn't the worse job I had .."
bad,This company is a horible place to work. They pay their employees poorly and ask for more work then intended from one person. They promote people into management that a creating a hostile work place while leaving good employees stagnet.
bad,No drinking or eating while you working in the job it sucks .we only have one ten mins. Break time. When you work for 5 hours. But the boss and managers. Can go every ten minutes.
bad,Although I shop here regularly the culture and way the company is run is appaling to say the least. Not necessarily at the store level but the corporate level is very very unfair to its employees.
bad,It was an ok place people were not to honest and never came to work on time. It was stressful and the customer was always right. I would work there again
bad,they treat you like you are disposable. they don't respect the hours you have asked for. they have favorites and treat them with the most favoritism .
bad,"Very disorganized, I told them upfront the exact times I could work but constantly was scheduled different times when I didn't have childcare. I was promised far more hours than I ever got scheduled, drama filled work place. Worst job ever."
bad,The management is terrible. The hours are worse. I get less than 4 hours a week. Scheduling is very inconsistent. I can have Two weeks off in a row and then get one 4 hour shift the following week.
bad,"dollar tree was the worst company i ever worked for in my 22 years in retail, Then hired me and trained in store were everythings was so clean and then u get your store"
bad,This was the worst company I have worked for. I was hired as an assistant manager then promoted to a store manager. The district manager was more about being friends with the store team vs a manager. I couldn't discipline my assistants or associates because of his favoritism towards them so in turn I was blocked at what I could store as a store manager. I wouldn't recommend this company to work for especially in my area with my former district manager.
bad,Absolutely horrible! Your hours of work change randomly. Upper management is lazy. Store is always dirty. Warm bodies looking for a paycheck. wouldn't recommend
bad,Its an ok job but the hours suck and the money sucks I recomend if ur aplyomg for a job here ur a high school kid looking to earn extra money other then that I don't recomend u work there
bad,The Dollar Tree I work at is in a prime location. But our manager has not taken the time to get to know the clientele he expects them to get to know him. He changes stuff around here for no reason. If he needed to run a register for a little bit he disappears and sometimes during the weekend he leaves the safe short changed. I have been there for 3 yrs and I only have $7.70 a hour to show for it. That is not the way you treat a loyal employee.
bad,"It doesn't matter how good you do your job if you are not in the clique you are nothing. The managers generally give hours to people who they like and not who do the best work. The pay is low, the stress is high, and there is no sense of loyalty or team work. The managers are generally not professional. Hours are cut and given to others, depending on the favorite of the moment, there is no job security. People complain constantly but Toledo has zero jobs so people stay even if they hate it. Practically anyone can be in management and it shows. Upper management couldn't care less about anyone as long as they get their precious bonuses. Minimum wage for associates and management starts at 9 dollars an hour. It's a toilet."
bad,Just a very messy environment to work in and that is why Dollar Tree isn't in my view a place of business but rather a place of children play and etc.
bad,I only  worked there because I could find a better job and a peace  of job is better  than no job..I worked  there until I was able to do better..it got the bills paid..
bad,All managers at the Crescent St location in Brockton are unprofessional. They all lack in all areas of their job description. No respect towards their employees and no role model image.
bad,"they are not a good company to work for they do not treat people fair management is awful and they show favoritism which should not be allowed, they allow managers to hire friends and family at the same loction"
bad,I was able to be promoted after a year and some months of working there. The reason I wasn't promoted sooner was because of  management that would constantly lie to us just to get what they wanted. They have no work/life balance if you're a manager and It really isn't worth the time to work here.
bad,Management was terrible. They tend to talk to you like youre stupid. Not impressed with my position there. Made you come in if you called in sick. Dont answer the phone.
bad,stressful the management was very poor didn't get hours like i was suppose to the customers were always nice that was the best part. pay sucked for being an assistant manager
bad,The company made maybe 1000 dollars a day so that can tell you all you needed to know about how much you made when you got paid. The job was slow and the manager wa a rude.
bad,Management was very unprofessional and staff is highly underpaid. I do not recommend anyone working there unless you are in high school or college or if you are looking for extra pay.
bad,Dollar tree has Poor management and Mistreat there Workers. They are an good company to work for if you would like to have some extra money on the side.
bad,Job was a waist I did every job there and could make enuf to provide for me let alone me family management was a joke very unprofessional and unorganized
bad,"Not the greatest job. The people are cool but that's about it. The customers were rude and the managers were rude as well. The pay was awful. But if it's your first job, go for it."
bad,DON’T DO IT! The store manager was horrible to all the employees. The job was only 8.50$ for an  assistant manager. Witch is  nowhere near enough  for all the  nonsense  you had to put up with.
bad,A typical work day involves being yelled at for no reason. I didnt learn any new skills at this job. The management Store leader is a joke. the other people are okay to work with. the hardest part of my job was not catching a charge for hitting my gm for her comments about me. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the customers that i did.
bad,Its just a bad company to work for. They expect you to come to work work harder then people who get paid more. I just had a bad experience with dollar tree and i would never go back
bad,There's not much to say about this specific job. I would never work for this job again and I would not refer someone I know to work in this establishment. The management was horrible and the store was so beyond dirty and unorganized.
bad,I hated it no one got along the manager was in help ful always sitting dwn not helping anyone always on the fone and  never around to assist in customers or staff
bad,Its a sad thing that they dont take care of the employees better because they have a steady flow of customers and the cashiers keep a long line because they will only have one most of the time.
bad,"It is extremely fast paced and under staffed. The stores may be small, but there is a lot of merchandise required to go out. District managers were overly cruel to their subordinates and liked to yell at their store managers. It seemed they manager via intimidation. I tried standing up for some of my staff once when a district manager yelled at her in front of customers and  was threatened with termination."
bad,Agreed upon wage was not approved. Store manager had already quit before i received my first pay check. Corporate stated wage should never have been offered to me in the first place. Customers treat you like filth and workplace is extremely hostile.
bad,If your not looking for a lot of hours this is the place to work and you get minimum wage. You have to clock out for even your breaks and only get a ten minute one if that.
bad,"Would never recommend this job for no  one management was poor. Customer were horrible hours was horrible.  No benefits. No discount. Hours limited."
bad,"Unless you’re willing to break your body down, run!!! This is a place that is all about the product! They don’t care about you or your family. No real room for growth!"
bad,"No structure what's so ever."
bad,Upper mangers expect store managers to beat down hourly associates instead of coaching and training associates. Horrible regional trainer and horrible  Regional Loss Prevention. Always had upset employees when they came in because they made them feel stupid.
bad,"My experience at this company was not the best. the management was absolutely horrible, and they did not know how to schedule their workers. The managers were almost always late."
bad,Management was terrible. They expect the assistant managers to do everything. They give deadlines that are really hard to make when they want no staff to work because they do not like the numbers. I remember working and it only being my store manager and myself. We had to do a whole seasonal flip and take care of customers at the same time because we could not afford to have stockers or cashiers on the clock.
bad,The management staff wasn’t friendly. The older cashiers were very rude. The district manager rarley every spoked to us. I felt discriminated against the whole nine
bad,worst place to work noreal organization or employees management is expected to do majority of work in each store no real future just lots of work and no raises
bad,For Dollar Tree i wasn't a big fan. Work area was hectic. Daily you'll get a rude customer. Managers did not recognize the worker's. There was a lot of favoritism (mostly the girls would get recognize regardless of their work ethics.
bad,a typical day a dollar tree. restacking the back room to make it organized for truck day. customer service to provide a wonderful shopping experience. and stalking shelves.
bad,"very fast paste, but extremely unorganized organization. very long hours with minumin payroll personnel to provide good customer service. Wouldnt  recommend my worse enemy to seek employment there."
bad,"I worked at Dollar tree for over a year, no raise, no advancement, no more hours, terrible, unprofessional boss and a lot of drama! I was constantly in between my manager and a customer preventing fights! I stayed late, came early and was always on call and have been slowly losing more and more hours because I called out once, once ever with the flu, now I have been slowly dropped off of the schedule for no reason! I hate Dollar tree!"
bad,"Hours were horrible, management is horrible, the way they treat their employees is horrible. They don't give you very many hours and they want you to break your back for minimum wage and turn around and treat you like dirt. You are never appreciated and they never recognize a good employee, not at the store I worked at anyways. And as a company they are just horrible because they will not give any regular employee decent hours. They told me there was no hours and took me off of the schedule, they never put me back on it."
bad,Its an underpaid job across the board. Corp is more worried about gossip. They tell you not to work off the clock but you end up working thru your unpaid lunches
bad,"Unless I was with a certain manager i basically worked alone in a 500square foot store, promised a promotion for over 2 years without actually getting the job"
bad,"favoritism big time at this place also they act as if they do not have work hours for the employees who really want to work , tye managers talk about everybody including other managers"
bad,Poor management. Managers make you do their work. Shedule is rarely ready.  Managers don't like to do truck or stock freezer so they make stickers do it. Not enough people unloading truck. Mininmum is not enough pay for stockers. Wondering what stickers job really entails because they make you do their work like freezer.
bad,"Dollar tree is a terrible place to work. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Managers are very rude, and unprofessional. No pay raises and don't pay you nearly enough to help make a living."
bad,Dollar tree would be a better company if it wasn't parttime only management gets the full time hours and I have been on both sides I worked as a cashier and as management
bad,"The management was a perfect combination of lazy, rude, and incompetent. Often would be threatened with reduced hours for not being able to come in outside of my availability. Management had zero trust for cashiers but found no issue with leaving the store grounds and forcing the cashiers to attempt to run the store on their own for long lengths of time."
bad,"Purposely keep stores understaffed, impossible job expectations for all employees, lack of empathy from upper management. The company's organization makes it impossible to provide good customer service, so have fun dealing with that. All employees must have their bags searched every time they leave, in the front of the store where customers can see you. Working at Dollar Tree is humiliating on a personal level, and leaves you feeling discouraged on a daily basis, and the manager's salary pays less than a cashier at similar businesses. Notice how unhappy the employees are next time you visit one of the stores."
bad,"horrible experience. always busy, managers don't care or help. customers are impatient. lines go around the corner, no help from other cashier's. store is not very clean."
bad,"i enjoyed the customers and meeting new people and hearing their storys, helping others find what their looking for or helping them with projects. the management and other employees were very unprofessional and rude. they would demand for things that were not our jobs and be very hateful towards customers and other employees."
bad,"most dollar tree locations are unsafe, and the environment/conditions are unsafe as well.  All of their deadlines are unfair and unrealistic at best, and corporate management has absolutely no problem throwing its people (all levels) under the bus in order to get what they want.  they are also always shortening staff alotted vacation days and sick days little by little every year.  It is a horrible place to work."
bad,Low pay. Want A LOT from their employees. Good job for college students if your manager understands that you are in school. Relocated to different city and that manager did not respect my schedule.
bad,"management was horrible, hired me part-time and gave me 0 hours the last two weeks, poor work ethics, not a good team to work with and too much gossip.."
bad,"When I worked there the manager only cared about the look of the store. Nothing else. And she only worked in the daytime. She also would only schedule one cashier with one manager, and expect the store to be pristine."
bad,this is a terrible place to work. the management is horrible very cut throat company unless you are willing to be treated like you are stupid useless and want to be ????? don't work their its horrible
bad,"Management thought it was best to manage by intimidation and threats. I made numerous suggestions regarding quality control, better training and consistent schedules. There was a lack of communication which made it difficult to be productive without a lot of rework. I believe in doing it right the first time."
bad,"On call during nights and weekends and had to handle emergencies at any time of the day and night. Low salaries, stressful environment, not pleasant place"
bad,Just wasnt for me. The manager was really rude to all the staff and did not work in a team effort The store was understaffed so the worked wouldn't get done in a timely manner.
bad,Would not recommend not enough pay for the hours that you work no body can financially make it by with 7.25 a hour manager was rude and did not care about employees just a all around horrible place to work
bad,While I was still training the manager on duty took twenty minutes to have a personal conversation and make jokes while there was only one other employee working.
bad,"They play with your time and play favoritism, no advancement, and not enough hours to make a real living, and management covers there self dont come to work but fix there hours. Not right"
bad,Very poorly managed. Employees were not treated well. Often placed in dangerous situations with customers. Required to make bank drop offs with no security.
bad,"Worst job I ever had! I was a store manager. Even though they kept saying I was DM material (like they tell everyone to get them to stay) I won't work for a company that puts so little thought into its associates and customer base! Stores are gross and understaffed. Mice running around in most stores and expired food in all the stores and my DM didnt care! I was always called to save other stores problems but those managers got away with not caring about their stores! We were told, to be successful we needed to work at 4am to throw freight but couldn't leave until 5:30 pm. We were always called in on our days off! Which turned into 80 hr, or more, work weeks! Absolutely rediculous job!!!!"
bad,"I was always the only cashier , having too restock shelves and run the cash register. I didn’t feel like it was a team work effort I felt like it was only me"
bad,"My boss was awful, and is still awful. The pay was terrible, and the hours were awful, never got more then 15 hours a week, when i was promised at least 30 upon hire."
bad,"The management was not supportive, Pay was low for what they expect from you, very high turn over on staff, productivity is extreme for the time frame they give you to do the tasks."
bad,"working at the dollar tree was a horrible expeirence. nobody cared about their work, and the pay was horrible. very unorganized. i would not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"this job was the worse job i have ever had only because the manager was horrible to employees and customers, i couldnt stand the way she treat other human and shortly after i quick she was fired"
bad,Poor oversight! Lack of corporate understanding of everyday situations. Twenty percent do eighty percent of the work. High turn over rate. Environment was beyond dirty at many locations.
bad,"Very poor management, the store was always in chaos. Very little pay and the benefits they do offer to full time management is outrageously over priced."
bad,"poor management, no structure, lack of respect for others would never work for dollar tree again. management is rude to the employees and just sit in the back room and do nothing"
bad,"Dollar tree was a stressful place to work. Your hours were cut for no reason and given to other people. If you asked for a sick day, they would cancel your shifts for the next two weeks"
bad,"Managers were immature, rude and disrespectful. It was the worst job of my life. No benefits, no incentive to stay at the job and not enough money per hour to deal with all of the stress."
bad,"the job doesn't give enough hours.....no room for advancement...cant call in because no one answers the phone,no answering machine to pick up if uyou do call in"
bad,I didn't like the job. Mainly doing everybody else work. I would of stayed if I was offered full time. I needed more money than just part time. I wouldn't work there again.
bad,It was a fun workplace the benefits wasn’t good like if u do more than one truck u didn’t get paid for production or we didn’t have any badges but all the doors had locks on th even the doors to enter the building
bad,They have bad management and the worst system i have ever done at a job and they have the worst working environment ever it feels like a sauna inside the store
bad,The company only wants to pay medium wages. They want you to work no help. As a store manager the District manager had me pull a 20 hour work week for a whole week. They believe their pay is good for the job.
bad,I hated this job sooooo much!! It was always super busy and we had to try to upsale a certain item of the month or week. It was just bad! I would never work here again!
bad,Management was poor. Lots of favoritism and unfairness. Hopefully it is better now than it was a few years ago. I felt I was treated unfairly. The store manager did some really sketchy things and blamed the shift managers for it.
bad,"no pay, no hours for hourly employees and the salary employees like managers they work 80 to 100 hours a week with no overtime or any kind of compensation at all. if you get hurt they get rid of you quickly. and the district manage here in panama city florida lies about you to protect her job."
bad,"Ask you to do more than the salary. Only want to pay minimum wage but want you to cashier, through freight, mop, clean bathroom, recover the store and keep the front area clean while your the only cashier there"
bad,The store always gets robbed. This is on a daily basis and you will most likely be in the store alone because they only put two people on a shift at a time.
bad,this business was very unorganized and not a very good place to work for minimum wage. Very unreliable workers with no consequences for last minute call offs. Made it very stressful to work because I always had to do multiple people's jobs including store manager....
bad,Not a good place to work if you're looking to grow and build a career. They are constantly asking for much more than a person could do for a very low pay.
bad,this job was absolutely awful. most days i was scheduled i was the only cashier on and the customers were very rude. The management was awful and the schedules just weren't worth waiting the 2 week paycheck for maybe 30 hours in 2 weeks.
bad,"Depending on the ""District"" you want to apply for, it could either be a fun environment with a great District Manager or a very stressful, pull your hair out environment. Only thing I received was a 401K that I never knew about when I was an Assistant Manager until I got something in the mail saying I had one. There is a decent chance of advancement, depending on the Store Manager."
bad,"Long Hours, Dirty work environment, not enough help. Exhausting petty work. Customers are rude, You never get to leave on time. Half hour lunch break and you get it almost at the end of your shift because of under staffing."
bad,"nice people, very bad hours and management, inconsistent truck delivery times, horrible management "
bad,This company has poor standards and horrible upper management. Not a good recommendation for anyone looking for a management position. They mistreat and over work there employees. Force you to work when you're not scheduled.
bad,Would not recomed ever working there they dont give you any hours dont accumulate any bills because you wont be able to pay them also the managers P.S. Never
bad,The management was very poor. The store was very poorly ran. The equipment worked poorly. Management is more concerned rude service than customer service friendly.
bad,"horrible management poor attitude and lack of self responsibility"
bad,"Dollar tree is an okay job . Not a lot of benefits buts it's A great job for a minor , a lot of standing and stocking. And really fast paced environment."
bad,"They do not pay you anything but work you like a dog,they pay you 7.25 an hour and expect you to be a happy employee and they never ever give you a raise."
bad,Worse job ever. You get 2 employees at best per shift. Yea the pay is great but you work 55hrs for 50k maybe as a Store manager. You get time off but cant us it. I urge you not to work here especially if you are black.
bad,Poor place to work poor supervisors no help they don't care about anything but the bottom line so I wouldn't recommend working there u will hate it extremely unemployment safe place to work
bad,"Not a good place to work for. Overworked during your shift, hours constantly being cut back, management is not supportive and staff is under paid. The line will be down the aisle with only one cashier. Not good for business."
bad,"the district manager is an idiot . He smells like after next day budweiser . it is not worth your time working at any location, but try it and youll see."
bad,Need to balance a schedule with better workers. Not steady days. Too much stress. Need to be a drug tested on employee. Over work and over payed. Not a steamed team
bad,I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for and also stocking shelves by putting out new stock.  I learned patience and consideration for others in a fine trait to have when dealing with the public.
bad,Management were jokes. They didn't have what it took to run the store. They felt their fellow employees were beneath them. Training was not something the focused on. Overall worst place I have worked.
bad,The manager was very disrespectful and not many hours were available. I would never work for a company that does not appreciate their employees. I believe the management needs more training
bad,"I was under paid, over worked, used and abused!!! i hate it ther they were terrible to me! worst work experience of my LIFE!!!! they were rude, disrespectful, invaded my personal life! i just hate it here so unprofessional!"
bad,"The management wasn't good at all. I was only working two days out of the week or only on Mondays when they needed someone to unload the truck. The hardest part of the job was probably unloading the truck, but I did it anyways because  I needed a job at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I met some amazing people while I was working there."
bad,"If you are really desperate and need to make a living, this is the job for you.  I did not have a good work experience working here, but it might be great for the next person"
bad,The place is a health hazard. People are constantly being placed on medical care due to astronomical injury reports. The hours are 10 a day six days a week and you get one break. If the numbers aren't right you have that held until the numbers are right. The management will lie to you about issues with pay and your pay checks are rounded down. It is not a place I'd ever work for again.worst place I've ever worked at.
bad,all of the managers are really great and some situations are out of there control but somethings is just an understatement but the positive thing about it was i enjoyed the customers and i also gained experience in other areas
bad,"By far, the worst job I've ever had. Employees getting mad at customers, some employees were stealing. The store had no proper coordination. Best part of the job was unloading the truck because we'd be outside."
bad,"No matter what job you are given to do, you will never do it well enough. Even if you do it well enough today, tomorrow they want more. If you are a loyal employee that sticks around for a while once you have outlived your usefulness, they throw you aside like any other useless object."
bad,"being an assistant manager consist of doing a lot of peoples jobs. Instead of managing, your doing the employees job. It was not a nice neighborhood and when I worked night shifts, sometimes security wasn't there and I didn't feel safe."
bad,management is joke at store and corporate levels. treats employees like garbage. expects 4 people to do the work of 15 for less then half the pay. forces you to collect pay check on debit card that charges you to access your funds
bad,"I worked temporary . I had  applied they said they needed people graveyard for restocking shelfs i applied and was hired . i knew it was temporary and stayed ony for a week , while i worked there evryone was polite and there just to get the job done"
bad,Ok place to pick up some holiday hours but other than that not a great company to work for.  I had a great manager who was driven out by the regional manager who had no business holding that position. The assistant managers were terrible at this location and they are all gone too. High turnover. The job itself is fairly easy but woefully understaffed and the place always looked a mess because there was never enough staff to clean facility up.
bad,"The location I worked at was a bad location. Rude customers and rude managers. "
bad,"Working for one of these stores is Part-Time ONLY.  They do not offer more than $8.00 an hour for ANY position including their managers.  No paid vacation, No benefits."
bad,dollar tree expects to much from one person and does not hold others accountable for their part. The freight manager has all responsibility and the store manager just sits in the office and dictates.  Never interacts or works with employees
bad,The management curses and rolls eyes to everyone including customers. She slams items in the bags and just plain out rude. No one asked you to work here.
bad,"Once the manager left, the new management didn't follow schedules of the employees. Quality of the store was extremely low, there was no break room for the employees. the one cashier was expected to vacuum the entire stoe, clean the registers, do overstock, clean and organize every aisle, clean the restrooms, stock shelves, as well as do normal cashier duties."
bad,From the top to the bottom Dollar Tree employees are not trained correctly at all. I recently lost my job due to this fact. Please do not work for this company in the end it's not worth it. You are over worked and never appreciated past your store manager.
bad,It was a busy place. Waited on customers and put things up. Cleaned my area. Blew up balloons and helped manager at end of night and followed to bank to drop off deposit.
bad,"A typical day does not happen here. it is a storm of chaos from the time I get to work ill I leave work at the end of close. The customers are not nice people, many steal and mess up he environment. There is no respect in this day and age. I fear for the next generations forward."
bad,I'm pregnant and they still put me on freight lifting boxes and sometimes they were heavy. I guess it's a okay place cause they hire anyone but I wish they could teach their employees more skills
bad,HORRIBLE job low paying and never a set schedule or time. only work here if you need a little money coming in but do not let this be your main job! Horrible job!
bad,"they didn't care about their employees enough to keep them. a typical day at dollar tree was restocking, regstering, and keeping the policy in effect which was poor to do because the policies didnt meet fair quality."
bad,Was offered a job and gave my employer my notice! HR and the managers ( district and store) gave me the run around!! No one makea calls to handle any situation just go through emails so impersonal.  So lost my current job for a job opportunity they offered but couldn't or wouldn't straighten out!!
bad,worst place I have ever worked. nothing was organized they fail to train their employees properly the worst work environment ever.there is nothing good to say about my time there. They treat their employees terrible.
bad,"Terrible, I did not like the culture at that place. Customers will come at you non-stop because everything is a dollar so they'll fill up an entire buggy and then you have to do the stock as well in between customers."
bad,you never move in the company and management is very poor with no lack for caring for your workers who work hard for them. hours are not pay right. and dont want to give you any hours if you want to work over time to make the store right. love to stock for the company but not enough help to put stock up.
bad,"these is absolutely nothing good about working for dollar tree it was a job with pay, i didnt like the people i didnt like the job and i used it to move on"
bad,This company is awful to work for if you are not management. I was a store manager for 7 years here and I fought upper management for the proper hours to run the store. My stores sales were among the top in the company but they would give my hours earned to other stores as we were forced to cut back hours in my store. Dollar Tree needs to learn that you can't keep good employees if you only allow them to work 8 - 12 hours a week.
bad,good place to work and very friendly environment to work. managment was awesome and the co workers wereamazingand always ready to help with any questions
bad,"I worked at dollar tree for 3 years and was still making minimum wage when I left. You'll never get more than 20 hours a week, usually around 10-15. No vacation, no sick pay, no benefits whatsoever. Management is overworked and stressed out and takes it out on their employees who are also overworked and stressed out. It's just a toxic environment all around."
bad,"a typical work day , the job was easy but  working with alot of lazy people makes it harder for someone who has repsonsibili , manangement did not have the store organized at all , and most of the workers did whatever they wanted to do ."
bad,"a depressing atmospher, I learned to be quick, Managers don't follow rules, hard to get along with other in stores, not a clean store, loved customers"
bad,I worked for this company for 3 years. In 3 years I recievied .25 In raise. Hours were limited cause they only hire part time. There was never anyone to cover your shift even in emergency situations. Off days for holidays were never rotated. The same person got all the holidays off.  Would not recommend working here..
bad,"easy working there "
bad,I needed a job and this was the first one that called and therefore I had no choice and took the job.  But it was one of the worse jobs that I have worked in my life.  It was like a prison they didn't give you but a 30 min lunch and at this time it was hotter on the inside than the outside.  It was colder on the inside than on the outside.  I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy.
bad,The one I worked at was a very awe full place the main manager treated me and a few other workers not so great. She would Fuss at me because I had to call for back up when it was needed. I'll just put it this way I will never work for dollar tree company again as long as the bosses are gonna treat you that way!
bad,Not a good job always looking over your shoulders. I hated this job. Going to this job is a risk to your health. Good luck if you are one of the brace ones
bad,I learned a lot working for Dollar Tree. They just lack communication skills. Without communication its hard to know what's going on. Overall I loved my customers and my co workers
bad,"They truly do not care about their employees and are very wishy washy when they speak to you, meaning they will say one thing and do another. They are also very quick to throw you under the bus for something you weren't even involved in to make them selves look better."
bad,It was a short term job. there was no communication the manger was not nice so it made it hard. To do my job.lack of hours and it had no benefit. and the store had to many calls offs
bad,The manager was a horrid human being. Employees were selling and buying drugs. Not enough hours because they refuse to give you full time. This is singlehandedly the worst place I've ever worked.
bad,Ive been at dollar tree since September of 2016. And im ired of working here and not getting as many hours as i should. I am over dollar tree and i would not tell anyone to get a job here.
bad,Low hours and poor management. Manager doesnt keep up with her employees very well. She never answers questions that you have. She is rude and very pushy
bad,"No leadership just dictatorship .. they don't honor job applications meaning , on app you are asked what days and time you can work, time off is a joke , never in my life have I seen unethical work standards"
bad,I worked at dollar tree for a little while and all I have to say is management is dodgy and they do not care about their employees and they will talk behind your back whenever they get the chance.  I was talked about for situations I could not help and it just wasn't worth the hassle any longer. so I quit.
bad,The management was horrible. I usually had a good day at work. Some of the people I worked with made it worth it. As far as day to day I sat at the register and took care of customers. I enjoyed my job. I did not enjoy the drama of the work place though.
bad,didn't enjoy working here management was pretty bad. I left after my hrs were cut to 10 a week and getting paid minimum wage it wasn't worth it to me.
bad,My first week was ok. Then employees started to quit but I told myself as long as I do my job I'm going to be here for a long time. I was wrong. Turns out they were quitting because of poor management and the more I worked there I realized it. I absolutely couldn't  take it anymore clearly the managers didn't care
bad,a work day of 4 hours was more like a 10 hour day. you learn the ins and outs of the entire business and not for the value of the poor pay. it is a part time type of work but overtime results.
bad,"hard to work when pressured constantly "
bad,Don't get out enough hours then hire full-time people and say they can't give no hours to nobody change schedule without knowing horrible job I ever worked at
bad,They should close the store at 9 o'clock also it should be 3 people working at all times instead of two.Also the management should have more respect for the workers and the customers .
bad,"dollar tree was the worst job i have ever worked in my life. the management was rude and did not care about their employees, and there were never enough hours for the employees because they always had 4-5 managers working and taking up all the stores hours"
bad,"The pay is unfair, the DM and upper management don't care at all about retail management or hourly associates. Being a manager here i never had enough payroll to schedule the people i needed even when we meet the sales goal."
bad,I worked there for a little under a year but people were always calling in and the hours weren't good. On an average week i would get 15-20 hours a week and the pay was not good at all. Management was always changing but the ones that have been there for a long time actually do care about there employees.
bad,"HIGH TURNOVER RATE NOT SURPRISING! No benefits. Hard, fast pace that is NEVER good enough. Minimum wage. Been there a year a no raise. Lied to about scheduling from when I got hired. Not even made $900. for TWO months of work. Keep scheduling me more times & days I cannot work though I was told at the beginning when I was completely upfront about what I could & couldn't work. No hours provided. The company is more concerned with their own employees stealing from them than they are the public. Stores are a disaster. Management seems to have favorites & they get more hours. Don't bother applying & wasteing your time. I have wasted a year with this company. Completely unsatisfied & disappointed. Sad thing is the customers are great as well as the merchandise. Dollartree needs to wise up & value their ""good, reliable & hard workers"" with better wages. Only 10 minute break for entire part time 4-5.5hrs shift to use restroom & to buy snack &/or drink plus consume it."
bad,The pay for starting cashiers is minimum wage. Assistant managers is only a dollar or so more. Store managers get barely a dollar more than that. Only the store manager gets full-time. The expectations for the managers is ridiculously high for the pay they receive.
bad,"I hated working for them and more than likely will never work for them again... The manager at the time was really unprofessional and rude... no benefits what so ever, thank god it was a seasonal job"
bad,"I did not work there for long at all. Management was a hot mess. They were very unprofessional. My manager was a man that was very shady and petty. Talked about people and laughed at individuals. Then there's this section where you go pick called the Slam or something and it's nothing but the heavy items mostly. Like boxes of washing powder and boxes of pops and stuff. If your are a order selector then you have to put labels on the boxes. So they had you a thing of labels with like 2300 stickers that you have to put of these boxes and through them on the line. And if you was a female weighing like 120lbs they don't care, still have to work fast. It was horrible. Hated that job."
bad,"I worked here for a while and gained lots of experience in stocking, cash handling, and management. It's a very busy fast paced work environment, however, it is a great job for anyone looking for some part-time work."
bad,I would never recommend working there to anyone! It's sad to say! I do not know how she even has a manager position honestly. She has a very bad demeanor. I'm sure if u ask any customers they would say same thing
bad,"Managers say one thing do another, change schedule without calling or asking. Managers try and give all work to associates while they sit in safe room. No one seemed to care."
bad,"The management  who we work for does not give ample time for the work they want done "
bad,"This was a terrible place to work. Everyone was treated terribly. They refused to hire any one full time, so people had 2 jobs, which made scheduling a nightmare. Which they never figured out. I was called in 2 or 3 times a week for people who were no shows."
bad,The job is very hard to enjoy. The customers are entitled and very rude. The staff is incompetent. The hours fluctuate way too much. The idea of team work is non existent.  Customers trash the store and then complain about the mess. Most of the employees are very lazy.
bad,"Its a cooperation, which means they fall under the stereo type of being awful. Only offering part time, so they won't have to offer you any benefits. You need to have and open schedule because they want you to work all shifts thru out the week."
bad,I was barely working and it was not enough to provide for my family and wasn't really the best job maybe if I had more hours I would've liked it better
bad,"All part time work between 5 to 10 hours a week, you will go through a lot of managers, turn over rate is high, Managers are fired every six months. Managers are responsible for customer theft and if it exceeds the company goals you get a letter from the CEO. no cameras to assist in the situations."
bad,"this whole store is disgusting. I normally worked early morning before store opened or overnight and the store was never cleaned, always had all merchandise on the floor and there is only ever one c cashier when the line wraps around the store. Managers cut hours for no reason until you are no longer on schedule"
bad,"If you like fast pace jobs, with a lot to do this is the place for you. However if you don't like being taken advantage of, over worked and under paid, and just not cared about as a ""valued employee"" I wouldn't suggest this employee. Its not rated one of the worst companies to work for, for no reason."
bad,I dont think that its  fair to work 10 hours a week or less. Took me off the schedule for one whole week just wasnt getting enough hours as i deserved and the manager speaks badly about me to the other employees
bad,This was my first ever real retail job and at first I loved it. The location I worked at was a horrible spot. Instead of giving me hours on the schedule it was always like I was on call
bad,"The job started out great but then with the smaller dollar tree in Groton closing we received all of their staff at our store which caused us to all get bumped down to 10 hours a week so it was ""fair"" to everyone. After 3 years of working there that's how everyone got treated."
bad,"My typical day at work is very stressful, i have learned about the store, such as where things are and how to make a customer happy. I am very disappointed in the management because they are not on the same page. The store is filthy and i dont really have anything that is hard about the job and the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers!"
bad,"Such a terrible place to work. No advancements or hours, Upper corporate managers are only in it for their own bonuses. Cruel and unfair treatment. Terrible place"
bad,When I worked there our boss was hitting on the other associates.  I did not feel very comfortable in that work environment. a typical day at work is ringing people up and stocking and cleaning up the store by yourself.  Sometimes the manager may help you like the one I had before the new manager came in and he just set in the office the whole entire time.  So the cashier had to check people out and clean up the store by theirself!
bad,"the Fernley store is the worst place I have ever worked. The  management lacks peoples skills, leadership, customer service and management skills. He spends more time talking on the phone gossiping with other store managers then doing his job."
bad,I took on a store manager position for only a few months.I couldn't keep a full time assistant manager because of the pay and hours so that put me in the store most of the time 7days aweek two or three of those working open to close.Then when someone called out my associates wouldn't come in so I had to drop everything with my family and go to work.And my lunch time that was a joke you have to eat on the run.
bad,They are working part time workers full time hours but not giving them benefits which is fraud. Also the company only cares about any store when a corporate visit is coming. Also.mangers don't get real breaks due to how they schedule only two people at night.
bad,"The place is very poor company to work for .I work hard for 2 years. And got used instead for all my great experience. Most store are in very poor condition and it, needs a lot of help in all area, starting with upper management/ managers. Then maybe they wouldn't have such a big turn over on employees.no employee communications."
bad,"A total waste of my time and effort to change the culture or work ethics. Too many lazy employees whom refused to show up to work, and a Store Manager who was worthless and lazy!!!"
bad,A typical day at work for me would be coming into a store that looks like its going out of business because only certain aisles are stocked and having to pick up the store and make sure the aisles look clean. I have to make sure all of go-backs are put away even if that means clocking out on time and staying longer to finish.
bad,"Dollar Tree was one of the worst decisions I've ever made in my young life! we were always under staffed and it was very unorganized, one minute you are a cashier next you are doing stock or cleaning bathrooms. the managers showed up late to work every now and then and they were extremely cranky and lazy. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy."
bad,"This was the worse job i ever had. They expected an awful lot for minimum wage. I did learn alot about taking stock and keeping track of inventory. But in general the managers were not helpful. the hours were extremely unflexible, especialy as i was working anonther job at the time. Again it was a learning experience if nothing else"
bad,"its a dump,management is all inept..dirty rat infested stores,do not pply thre ,filthy environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dump dump dump they are unfair"
bad,"You weren't allowed to have an opinion about anything and the store was extremely disgusting, bathrooms were rarely cleaned and when they were it wasn't done very well."
bad,"Manager picks those who wear tight yoga pants to get more hours, lies about working with you, promises hours and gives them employees mentioned above. Takes hours from employees after they are already scheduled with no notice. Not good at conflict resolution and very lazy!"
bad,wasn't my favorite job but it was a job. Very small and not fast paced at all. I moved on because I needed something more then what was offered. its good for part time work or a summer job.
bad,manager did not give me the proper training and they didn't have a good team to work with. They fired me for not knowing certain things to do on the register knowing that I didn't have the proper training.
bad,Dollar Tree is a  ok place to work if you are looking for some extra money. Its pretty easy to  put out the merchandise. you have to follow the flow o
bad,"I would highly recommend anyone to NOT work there, The environment seems like a good place , but behind the scenes its one of the most unstructured places i have ever been."
bad,I did not like.the fa tbi was trained for management and woke up everyday opened and closed the store stayed there while I was throwing up al.to get transfered to another store
bad,My first day I was not trained I had to learn on my own how to work the cash register while at the same time stocking the store. No teamwork no dedication no integrity
bad,"The store manager is a complete rude disrespectful  human being that has the goal to go into their workplace and pick on their employees and does so in front of customers and has no intentions on apologizing what so ever. If you as me, it's pathetic"
bad,"Management is the worse and it makes you not want to come to work or be hired by them, I keep my composure for several reasons  but I need to leave badly."
bad,I hated this place. Very unprofessional and low paying. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. you only get paid 7.25 an hour it's f'd up . I hated this job.
bad,messy beyond beleif. Stupid kids run around and tear everything up. parents did nothing. Ghetto style store. poor customers. to much junk and trash. don't work here
bad,they don't work with you. Addicts work there. they don't give you no hours work 8 hours a week with 4 hours shifts 2 times a day with minimum wage who can survive off that smh worst place to work at.
bad,"Horrible training from the DM and lack of follow through, most stores fail due to lack of accoutability of the district nanagers. They claim to give you lots of hours, they don't,  to many members of management that want to do nothing. Freight execution is vital for a store to profit, they don't care if your store is filthy, unstocked, or non profitable,  as long as you don't go over payroll. They portray the SM as a leader, and not a worker, well wrong. Dirty Dollar Trees with products that expire from 2011 on the shelf for sale!!!! Have pride in yourself and don't bother. "
bad,It's okay for a part time job or if you are retired. Definitely geared for cheap labor.- You work a different schedule every week. You can never plan balanced life after work.
bad,not enough hours to properly provide and the pay  isnt worth the hard work requested of you. it was a ok environment but it takes to much time with the economy rising $400 every two weeks isnt enough to provide for my family.
bad,"They look the other way when bad things are going on. You ask for certain days off or request them in advanced, you get denied. When you report of harassment it gets swept under the rug. The management team is a poor excuse of people for that store. The have no clus what they are doing there"
bad,"the managers let the sales associates run the store"
bad,The work I provided for the dollar tree was not appreciated. The management had favorite workers they gave hrs to the emokiyees they like an you were lucky to get hrs to get a decent paycheck which never happened it was a negative experience.
bad,The place need to be cleaned up. Need some good management in the place. There no lead ship or guilds in Dollar Tree at all. Also they just let and do whatever they feel or okay.
bad,The hardest part of my job was working with employees who always have attitudes and disrespectful. I was either on register or putting go backs back. Never let people control how you are going to be though out the day or let they change your attitude into a negative one. Most enjoyable part of my day other than me leaving that place was being able to talk to the customers and laugh. Management was different because there was some that did thing one way and their was others who did it another. Well for my experience it was a lesson and a work environment sometimes.
bad,"Dollar Tree is a lot of work for few rewards.  You are constantly ringing people up on cashier while trying to stock out box after box after box of products.  They will schedule you however they want, regardless of your availability.  They will also fire you and not tell you why."
bad,"Not the place to work. This company expects you to perform miracles with putting out the product by yourself and stockers working maybe 2 days out the week.  The ASM is basically the only full-time stocker everyday, by themselves. Oh, not to mention you have to run register, make change for cashier,  respond to emails,  get carts out parking lot and so forth. Not a great place to work for."
bad,"problems with upper management, not even from human resources.They did not support workers when there was no management. after i quit, they had to have an investigation from some one that had nothing to do with HR."
bad,I never received an opportunity for advancement within the company and the pay grade was 10 cent above minimum wage for the work that is required of the employee
bad,They hire three times the people that they need and then give everyone twenty hours or less a week. It's the kind of job for retired people or students.
bad,The marysville store is horrible. You get treated like children. And if you try to go to management about anything they act like you are 5 years old. Plus when you file a complaint and then get told the HR lady is on vacation so they can't talk to her till she gets back. I am sorry but their is more then one HR person for a company as big as dollar tree. hassrasment is aloud by management as well.
bad,"didnt likeworking there although I was grateful for the opportunity, it is a very cut throat environment and all the people are dog-eat-dog.  I no longer like retail."
bad,A typical day at work was ringing up customers and when we didnt have customers we worked on making sure the store was clean. The manager wasnt that great he was disorganized and didnt want very much socialization going on between customers and cashiers which in my opinion was bad customer service
bad,"Dollar Tree was not what I thought it would be, it sucked being the only register opened long lines and the mangers didn't really help with specifying with what was needed to be done."
bad,"This place is the worst place to work"
bad,The job was part-time. I got enough hours to help me through college. I got a lot of customer relations experience. This boosted me to want to work with people more.
bad,Cashiers work like slaves for minimum salary. It is very busy on the weekends. On feet all day. CA passes a law that all cashiers must be provided with a stool or chair. In FL they do not care about this law. I have been there for 2 weeks. On Sunday I was told to do go backs all by myself. At the same time I had to ring all the customers at the cash register. I could not find fast where to put all the returned merchandise and was let go. Crazy!
bad,"Well a typical day there was doing ""Go Backs"".  Basically that's all the merchandise that was thrown in the aisles or under the registers.  Also be a cashier.  Doing mid day deposits.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the day I quit."
bad,Only okay to work for as a second job. You can get ahead working as a sales associate at dollar tree . They don't offer any incentives.  I have nothing more to say.
bad,"Everything else about this job, they do not care about your work/life balance. It's only all about what you can do for them.  Not for people who have a entrepreneurial mindset to grow sales and think outside the box.  There is only one way, the Dollar Tree Way.a"
bad,"overworked, not fairly paid, managers under presure to put presure on associates, closing team is always overworked and not appreciated as they should."
bad,"Nothing but a place of gossip , never give good hours they get mad if you pick up another job and the management was very disrespectful I never went back to the location I worked at manager or not !"
bad,Working for dollar tree provides me with no sense of job security. There is no consistency in scheduling. I am unable to plan things with my family due to this bogus scheduling ideas. Management is unreliable due to the fact that they are late sometimes and i spend my early mornings waitiing in the parking lot.
bad,they like to make their workers do more than their share of the work. They do not believe in team work and if you do not do they job right the will sabotage you.
bad,The workplace culture  was non existent. I learned never to work here again. There was a high management turnover. A typical day at work was not rewarding.
bad,"Manager is rude, ignorant and a big bully. She takes all your creative ideas and makes them her own. Manipulates other associates as well as District Manager. Once you're in her bad graces, there's no turning back. She forces you to quit."
bad,I would say dollar tree needs better managers. The managers not professional. Hours are only 4 and 15hrs a week. Employees arent treated equal. I am glad to be out of there
bad,They pay minimum and the only raise you get is a rare cost of living wage. the manger at the one I worked at was great but the company as a whole really dose not care about their employees
bad,"A waist of time working for, They'll work you off the clock and then write you up because you forget to clock back in. The worse company I ever worked for!"
bad,"minimum wage  , working was OK i guess other than no hours "
bad,"been there 10 years and it is by the worst company to ever work for thtas why after so many years leaving"
bad,Not very many hours and no structure at all. Management had favorites and on gave full time hours to a select few. Work was pretty fun and customers are nice but it need a new system.
bad,"A typical day was slaving non-stop for little pay,  unsafe work place,  you basically learn management is uncaring and poor and the store only cares about them."
bad,"My boss was horrible, my schedule sucked! I stood on my feet for 6-8 hours a day and had ask to leave my register to do anything!  This place is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!"
bad,"this is not a place for any functioning adult with a brain to work. there is no organization constant policy and management changes without notice, you wont get more than 20 hrs a week at minimum wage no matter how much you beg for them....dont expect to actually pay your bills, good for play money though"
bad,"•Perform bookkeeping work, including posting data or keeping other records concerning costs, services and the shipment of merchandise"
bad,typical day at work is waiting on customers I learned how to do the different things on the register the management was good work place culture was very interesting there was nothing hard about the job the most enjoyable part of the job was the people
bad,The company does NOT care about its employees. Everyone is made to feel as if they are replaceable no matter how much work is done nor how loyal they are.
bad,Management and store cleanliness is really bad. Cusroner complaints have been manly on those two issues. This company also does not offer full tine positions unless you are management.
bad,Management was terrible. There was no consistent schedule. Management sat around talking about others and in front of customers. They didn't keep the store very clean either.
bad,"Basic store to store operations over multi stores, (8). No work life balance they want you there all the time 65 plus hours weekly and salaried. Forced to cut employees hours to make the budget which was never close to what was needed."
bad,It ain't what it made out to be and they don't explain there rules good enough or anything else to you like they should when you first start . Or try to
bad,Customers were always rude and no support from staff. The employee's under my management were always lazy and made things difficult to get done.
bad,The other sales associates are nice and one or two of the managers. Very unrealistic polices. It's a good job if your in school with no home responsibilities because if you have any home responsibilities hope those come with a 2 week notice. It's a easy to learn job and good for experience.
bad,Lazy people hardly working overnight shift start at 10pm and end at 3am. Barely making 25 hrs a week. Loading and restocking the sheeves and cashier counting money
bad,"They paid me to do a job and I came in on time everyday. I was denied 24 hours of of vacation pay, earned hours that i will not be paid for. I have decided to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,I was always on time but people that were never on time were never spoken to. I liked being a stocker but low hours usually prevented that. Dollar tree has really bad hours.
bad,"I didnt receive a schedule and everything was not orderly. Low pay, and a lazy environment. I did not feel comfortable and people would come in the store and steal"
bad,Wouldn't recommend this place as a assistant manager I only get 5 hours more than cashiers and have to deal with a lot of extra hassle and barely make more per hour.
bad,"go in log in or clock in at the register, get my drawer, count it, get change, then listen to the management cuss and discuss the morning or night before, blame everyone but not themselves. then go to work...The hardest part was the lack or organization and lazyness in the management, like they did not care the store was a mess, empty shelves, stock room totally unorganized, and no pallets under merchandise."
bad,The manager was so rude and deceiving. The costumers were rude and the co workers were rude. They did not respect each other or costumers. They barely worked with my school schedule. Was not a good environment to be in
bad,Unprofessional from management to customer service. No benefits. Unfair treatment and very few hours.  A lot of people who work here are desperate for work and settle here temporarily.
bad,"Very unprofessional "
bad,"I would be a lead cashier or I would be in the sales floor, helping customers and maintaining a clean and safe environment."
bad,They do not pay their employees enough and do not know when they have a good candidate for a job. Very cliquey and unprofessional environment. I would never work here again.
bad,I'm an assistant store manager with over 5years of experience and only getting paid 10.00 .. and working part time which is 15 hours a week the store manager is inconsiderate not a good place to work currently looking for a better job
bad,"I didn't get enough hours. Could not offer more hours to me. I was not happy with this I needed to make a living and survive "
bad,The pay was undesirable. I worked extra shifts constantly and it was hard because other co-workers would continuously call off and expect everyone else to do their job for them. I did like my managers but the other sales associates were not ideal.
bad,"This job is terrible.  The expectation is for your store to be 'grand opening' clean and organized on a daily basis with payroll provided for only bare bones coverage.  Corporate truck sheets will recommend 50-60 hours of stockers but payroll will only allow for 20 hours a week of stocking.  ""The gap will be made up by the managers.""  Right.  The managers who are ringing register, cleaning and recovering the sales floor and assisting customers.  How does the back room get emptied?  The store manager of course!  "
bad,The dollar tree was a very good experience for me. The Dollar tree was a very unorganized work environment. The store Manager was very unprofessional.
bad,They pay men more than they pay women they also talked to the general managers like nothing they treat the staff like nobody's they give us less time to work pallets and more concerned about overtime and the pay is bad for women
bad,It was wack if you ask me idk what else to say about it the pay is low for stockers I wouldn't want to work there again. Everyday felt like a drag
bad,"Only work here if you absolutely need a job. Management is horrible, uneducationed and unable to really handle what they expect their workers to do. They just made a pay raise to compensate those who work there but it is not worth it when it comes to hours. They have messed up on my paycheck multiple times, scammed me out of vacation and PTO. They won't inform you of anything that could possible benefit you or your family. They only are strict about rules if you bring up the fact that they are breaking rules with Department of Labor. They are always under evaluation by Department of Labor and OHSA because of their working conditions and the way employees are treated. If anything work for their competitor warehouses were you will get treated properly and get paid the just amount without having to analyze your paycheck every two weeks for any errors."
bad,"Bust that U-Boat in an hour homie, smile and speedily ring that person up, because goodness knows you only have about four hours to your shift. So go go gooooo! If you want low key hours or you know a high schooler need spare change, this is the job. It's not paying any kind of bill really, definitely not a rent paying job."
bad,this was the worst job that I ever worked. I will never apply for this company again. the manager there was awful and rude.
bad,i worked here for a year i would not refer anyone to this company the pay is lousy for the amount of work that is required of you they are always cutting hours
bad,"Probably thw worst place iv'e ever worked,I only get 4 hours a week.Management is disorganized,I gust wish it was ran differently,more communication,better management"
bad,"conflicts of interest, discrimination, management needs fixed, no real team work, not enough hours to eat each week, management is treated better than staff. Hourly paid associates should all get equal hours for each week."
bad,"Horrible managers, employees, & district managers. I rather cut off my limbs & burn them back on before working or shopping here again. I was wrongfully mistreated & I hope this business doesn't last for others sake."
bad,"I watched so much stuff happen at dollar tree that was not supposed to aloud and as long as the right person likes you, you can keep your job. They want you to work like crazy for not so good  pay."
bad,Working for Dollar Tree was a nice experience with the co workers. The Management was very poor in guiding and teaching. They called you in on your days off to cover hours. Instead of teaching employees how to do their jobs they just put all on one employee.
bad,"Great people came in and out, employees and managers doing their job, keeping our area clean, keeping the store clean so people can find what they are looking for."
bad,It's the same way like bojangles always want their employees to come into work while they are sick so i quit from there and I know my rights as an employee and they was not organize
bad,It was a really dirty company that didnt treat their customers how they deserved to be treated.besides that everything else was fine i got along well with the staff and i also had a good reputation for costomer assistance
bad,"I worked there for a year and in that year, our store went through 5 store managers. Customers are very rude and disrespectful to the store. They made a huge mess everyday because our store was never up to par. So, they figured if we didn't care, they didn't care. I didn't learn much. Going to work made me sick sometimes. Stock room was so congested you couldn't walk back there. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and getting off."
bad,The company itself does not care about the employees. I received low pay and under the line hours. I dont understand how they expect someone to live off the compensation.
bad,"This company does nothing but suck the soul out of every employee they hire. Discrimination, mental abuse, are just a few things wrong with this company. The DM of the Marshall store did nothing but tell the employees they were lazy, useless and stupid. The company did not care, when taken to a hire up, was met with nothing but silence so they wouldn't have to deal with it. Just a pathetic place to work for in general. If you value your life, do not work here."
bad,Dollar Tree takes a lot of patience. Management always created stressful situations for the employees and didn't seem to care much about anything. This is a gig for teens.
bad,"I worked at the Dollar Tree in Mountain Home, Arkansas as a stocker/cashier - there were days when I would show up for work and NO ONE would be there because the schedule had been changed without my knowledge - it was especially irritating to show up at 5 in the morning not knowing the schedule had been changed - especially since I live 45 minutes away - also, I found it weird how people would come to work late (sometimes as much as 25 minutes late) and the manager would never say anything about it - I quit last Wednesday because my manager jumped all over another lady and me in front of everyone for being too slow and she said we should be able to do a whole U-boat in 25 minutes. The next day the manager told me we were going to do something different and she had the assistant manager give us a paper to keep up with how much we could stock every hour - I thought she was being hateful so I left - I talked to another manager at a different Dollar Tree and she told me you can't do a full U-boat in 25 minutes and she said they have always filled out that paper at her store."
bad,"The management is despicable. You barely get any hours. They always expected you to be able to stock shelves, clean up, and run a register. You had five minutes to clean things because the management wanted to leave early. They would try to guilt me into coming in on my days off. They had expectations that nobody could meet. An extremely high turnover. The main manager has no idea what they're doing. Everybody is basically guessing. If you get it wrong, somebody starts yelling. For such little money? Definitely wasn't worth it."
bad,Horrible management. 15 hours a week. No extra hours. I hated this place and I will never work here or for any dollar tree. I would never allow a close friend or relative work there.
bad,"Worse place I have ever worked in my life!!! The company has so many rules that the only thing they can't control is employees going to the bathroom!!!!!!"
bad,I worked as a cashier got promised a full time position as assistant manager after working 17 days straight with some days double shift to getting just assistant manager part time no benefits and was with the company for 3 years prior to this
bad,This company is the worse they only care about the bottom line they don't care how they get there. They don't care about the customers the stores are trash management is expected to work for free
bad,Unload trucks and do freight all day every day. After doing the math of the hours I worked amd my salary. I made about $8 per hour.
bad,No hours the lazy cashiers get all the hours manager doesnt care if they do work they wanted you to stay overtime without paying it Dollar tree doesnt care if your sick u have to go in to work
bad,Managers are very unprofessional. Work does not equal the pay. Should be paid more for all the manual work you have to do. Hours are not given out appropriately.
bad,I work here and store manager is not professional. She would let people steal and is rude to kids. Other managers were ok. Coworkers get away with so much there. Managers do whatever they wanted too. Rude people!! I only keep this job becouse of my kids. I will be leaving so like everybody else has. This job is a JOKE!! These people need to be watched!
bad,"They would make the schedule and I would read it and then they would change the schedule and not call me at all. I have missed days of work because they change the schedule. I got a long with some of the other workers there. The store manager would get mad at me when I didn't do something, but the thing is though she never told me what she wanted me to do. "
bad,its not to much to say about working at dollar tree i didn't enjoy it. co-workers and managers were rude. what i did learn was to give people respect even if there wasn't none giving back.
bad,"Its like amateurs run the company. No organization, nothing to really learn from a job like this. Its basically slave work."
bad,"a typical day for me was getting there, clocking in, counting my till and told not to stand around if there arent any customers. you're scheduled about three or four days a week, but you have to keep your schedule open because they,ll call you at whatever time if they need a person. If they had a negative review on your work they would tell you in front of the customers a instead of puling you aside,  At times they wont schedule you for an entire week. Worst first job experience."
bad,"I enjoyed my co workers, because surprisingly they were awesome. As for management, they sat on a horse assuming everyone was incompetent and replaceable. And for a company making good money everyday, the corporation side had the same mind set. The people actually going to work everyday making the company there money were completely underappreciated overall"
bad,"It was really fun at the beginning but the Manager started setting people up to fail. I started to dread coming into work, I didn't want to work when the general manager was there because of the way he ran the store."
bad,I worked their for most of the summer and its a difficult job and the managers all have their ups and downs. The managers can be very not understanding and they dont give you many chances
bad,This was by far the worst job I ever had. I was responsible for cleaning the store at night and it was a  wreck. Mind you I only had four and a half hours to make sure everything was done correctly plus do all my other responsibilities. The store manager was messy and was always talking about people behind their backs. I was there for maybe six months and I had to leave. Maybe the store would be better if they got a different Store Manager. Oh I forgot to mention that you get wrote up for the most dumb things such as not selling any of the drive items. I mean we can't force a customer to make a donation. Worst job ever. I think I'll stick with nursing because if retail stores are like Dollar Tree than they suck. Did I mention that I was never allowed a weekend off? It sucks
bad,Learned a lot from this job but not from training. Worked there 6 months before getting promoted to ASM but only because they were short handed on managers. No training was given before I was managing my own shifts which only included 2 employees due to low payroll. Horrible district and store managers who do not know how to talk to people. High turnover rate because it is not a supportive team. There is no dedication to the job.
bad,it payd descent the hours sucked seasonal sucked the gm was trash i wouldent recomend anyone to work there unless management was better
bad,No typical day and I learned how to unload things and put where they go. The management was well trained and organized as well as the co-workers. There was no hardest part and the enjoyable part is the same thing as the other jobs.
bad,"Had us clock out for 30 min lunch but still work as the only manager on duty."
bad,Dollar Tree does not provide enough hours. There is no security so there is always stealing. The pay rate is also bad. The managers need to care more about the employees
bad,"Don't recommend you don't get paid much or get many hours."
bad,"no order what so ever. i was suppose to be trained for management and was tossed around as if i was a bad employee and i opened the store played as l.p stock,overnight,cashier,front door guest."
bad,"I worked at Dollar Tree for over five years and it ruined my life. I was a full-time assistant manager doing not only my job, but the store manager and cashiers job as well. I took the abuse for years, thinking eventually hard work would pay off, but it never did. Once I finally started breaking under all the pressure, my manager started constantly writing me up for ""not fulfilling my job duties"" aka, holding the store on my own so the store manager could work 9-12pm everyday. She had micromanaged me and beat me down for so long, it effected my home life as well. I lost 60lbs because of stress, and not being able to take my lunches (because someone has to run the store/register), but I had to punch for them, or I got wrote up for that as well. When I finally started branching out to get help from the District Manager, my Store Manager made it her #1 priority to ruin my credibility. Instead of coming to me with an issue or concern, she immediately ran to the DM to tell her how I was the reason the store was behind, and from what the DM could see, my manager was ""working her hours"" and then some because they are not required to clock in and out- so there is really no way of calculating how much they actually work. So my manager would work 9-12pm, but she would put herself down as working ""7-7pm"". Me, on the other hand, would HAVE to punch in and out, and be required to work...off the clock..unpaid. Needless to say, Dollar Tree lets their lazy Store Managers abuse the hard working Assistant Managers until they quit. No wonder they have such a high turn over. Dollar Tree would not"
bad,One cashier handling more than 300 customers in a 4-5 hour work shift.  Management criticize employee in front of customers.  Management unwilling to help assist customers and help cashier get customers out of the lines quickly.  Cashier are not allowed to leave the register to go to the bathroom in a 4 hour work shift.
bad,i hate dollar tree they as so un organized i hated working there it was horrible i would not recommed that job to any of my friend
bad,"This is an okay place to work while attending school, etc but not a place to be at forever! The management never got along with each other and even had an incident with the assistant manager who tried to get me to clock out on time and then help her with the deposit because she didn't want to get in trouble for having me work over time."
bad,they are a great job but the management is not great everything they do is wrong  not right they building is going down because they show to much favoritism
bad,unloaded trucks and stocked shelves the mgr just left notes for stuff to be done the mgr just stayed to her self and friends you would not learn anything at that store sorry thats just the truth
bad,"I have worked for Dollar Tree for a year and a half. At first I really liked it. However, I have found that it is not a company I want to work for anymore."
bad,the store never has coo air just one little fan in the front of the store and the manager is always just walking around the store while i had to unload the truck stock the truck and ring out customers and the other employees have horibble toxic attitudes
bad,too much work for minimum wae and then theres no hours given to the employees. I would not reccomend no one to work there uneless they alredy have a main job
bad,I only worked there while i was in school it helped out with bus fair .. and helping myself and others that need help.. i had cool managers they were very understanding
bad,it is not so bad it keeps u going and it helps a lot with the bills also u get a lot of exp on the job cause u get to do things that are very new to u
bad,"its very bad and stressful. the co workers is awesome but so if you like retail then dollar tree a place to be, but if you want to further your career i dont think its a good  place to be"
bad,"typical day for me was stocking shelves and running cash register"
bad,"There is a lot of conflict between workers who keep to themselves and the management group, if you are not out talking about other workers behind their backs then you will be set up for termination. If you happen to know more about the management role then the head manager then you will be set up for termination and also if there is a conflict in the workplace and you go to the DM, once again you will be set up for termination. There is no way to win in the poor environment of this particular Dollar Tree"
bad,my position was Assistant Manager .... HORRIBLE don't ever work here. Pay is terrible !!!!!!! Management is terrible . the hardest part is going there everyday
bad,This was a terribly mismanaged place to work. You are constantly being short staffed and micromanaged at the same time causing friction between you and the store manager. And any friction would be considered insubordination and make it difficult to keep your job.
bad,"Daily duties for this job was customer service, cashier, stocking. Learned how to do inventory. "
bad,this job was temporary but they failed to mention that at the hiring process.  it was only to get ready for inventory. I stocked shelves and unloaded the semi trucks by myself.
bad,they tell you to come in at a serten time and that times rong they don't let you now wean you work or don't work they all was change it on you
bad,I've worked here for 2 years. The pay is horrible for assistant managers compared the expected work output. Disorganized and unhelpful upper management. No room to move up. Hours constantly fluctuate and are only decent just before xmas. No paid time off no vacation no benefits .
bad,"Hours were treated like a doctor, trucks were never on time and would show up at work only to be turned away had many complaints against this company which turned me away from them."
bad,No benefits management never stays more than 6 months store stays nasty and rat infested horrible pay for what you really have to do in the store
bad,"I worked at the Dollar Tree in Lake Zurich, IL, for 4 1/2 months, and it was a very stressful 4 1/2 months. I don't even know where to begin with this. "
bad,typical day at work just unloading the truck and throwing the freight....management was ok...co workers were ok...nothin hard bout the job at all
bad,The stores do not follow OSHA guidlines. They pay the employees minnimum wage and only give 10 to 15 hours. It is not a safe work environment.
bad,Horrible management and employees very unorganized nobody came to work did what the wanted. Some employees were stealing and others not coming in  to work for weeks basically working when they want to
bad,"Suggest trying to find another place to work. Not a lot of ours given"
bad,"Needs a new store and hiring manager. Store needs major improvement. Dirty bathrooms, rude employees, training is horrible if any at all. Not an equal opportunity at all. I hated this job. Never again."
bad,"I would die before I went back here. Horrible management, no support, no loyalty. Just like prison. Will fire you just because they over staffed."
bad,"fun coworkers, i made alot of good friends and a lot of nice customers they made each day a new adventure , ok for holiday work only,"
bad,"Schedules where often incomplete or incorrect. You would have to call in Saturday just to find out if you work the next day which would ruin all chances of weekend plans. The assistant manager would often be in the office whilst other employees would slave away only to kept longer due to lack of assistance from higher ups. The main boss manager was okay and kind buy rarely saw them as they were often away or on vacation. Management would often converse among  each other or customers for excessive amounts of time, yet be quick to judge and tell you to get back to work while all you are merely assisting a customer locate and item or answering a question. working here was horrible."
bad,"I was paid 6.30 an hour and not allowed to work more than three days a week. I learned how to use an outdated cash register and handle rude people, that is it. My co-workers were sometimes helpful. The management did a poor job managing the store and other employees."
bad,its not a very nice  company  dollar tree will over work you and store .manager  gets all the praise. but I did meet a lot of great people
bad,"Dollar Tree is a nice place to shop if you want cheap things, but as soon as you start working there its a different story. They only schedule you 1-3 days per week and once you get your paycheck its nothing like you thought you would see. they take way too much out of your taxes and youll only get $12.00 in your bank account"
bad,I go to work cashier and stock I deal with customer service  all day the job deals with a lot but its a job and I do like it but I need more money and hours
bad,"By far the worst company ive worked for. When i come to work i bust my BUTT for these people. Im the best cashier they have me stock, recover, do go backs, an im also back up cashier. There so upset that im leaving but hey maybe they should hire people that actually wanna work or pay me better to do everybody elsea work!!! Because thats literally what i do. While these managers sit back an do damages. Im never recognized i dont get paid well DOLLAR TREE hours are not good enough! How do they expect people to live off 15hours a week. This lady comes in mind you a drunk at that. Hasnt work in over 3 years shes there for a month!!!!! Gets promoted to management!!!! Are you serious???!!!! This has been the last straw for me ive been with this company twice an been putting nothing but sweat an pure work into this company for what???? 200 every two weeks? Not worth it, and they deff dont care about there employees at all!!! I put my two weeks notice in dollar tree is deff not a career choice its a JOB not a CAREER! Go to school people and do something productive with your life! This is not a place to work!!!"
bad,"Poor management, no room for growth, very disorganized, all scheduled hours are based on sales--hours were never consistent. Hardly ever took a real break-I got burnt out."
bad,"Manager position and you do everything. Employees are disrespectful and even if you write them up a 1000x, you can't fire them."
bad,I hated it there management sucks and they don't give much hours. The Management and coworkers was always late and left early. We were always under staff.
bad,"The only redeemable part about this job was the fact that my co-workers were pretty cool. Other than that, it's pretty terrible. The place that I worked at was so cheap they cut the music that played in the building, so it was dead quiet all the time, and it was always hot and sweaty no matter what. All-in-all, the conditions were pretty terrible for the employees, and they didn't make enough money to pay the employees a decent wage, or even give them enough hours to be able to survive adequately. It was a shame to see the people I work with have legitimately no other options but to work there, and not even get paid enough to do so."
bad,dollar tree let general manger take advantage of people and don't like to pay for their wrongs. from telling one thing doing another hiring people who don't want to work. and don't get breaks when manger.
bad,Management and upper management is rude and has no respect. Once you are an assistant manager you get no lunches or breaks in peace unless for some rare chance you have another manager there. (Which is like never.)
bad,My hours were cut down to nothing while hiring new younger employees. They told me that was company policy. It was unfair to me when I need to work and worked very hard and did a very good job.
bad,Just a stepping stone until I return to the corporate environment. I did learn management skills and merchandising while employed.
bad,"Go backs."
bad,"Dollar Tree has the potential to be just about as crooked as they come.My tenure there worsened my mental disability severley. I asked for a small ""reasonable accomodation"" that over time just hurt my career with them. I complained to corporate about two peoples poor treatment of me and that also ended up backfiring majorly. The man I turned in sent his friends into the store as stockers to bother me. A neighbor of mine is also a friend of his, and this neighbor would play mind games with me at our apartment complex until I figured it out and put a stop to it. My tenure with Dollar Tree ended with them firing me over an incident that in reality never occured. They had me on a conference call w/ corporate and the district manager where pleaded my case. They(the crooked managers) are lying I said, I did not put my finger in any ones face I told the corporate rep on the phone.She rebutted me with ""oh yes you did"". So that sums it up. The only decent thing management did was pay for the rest of my final day even though I did not work my last shift."
bad,It was the worse job ever they only use the people to build the store in the inside then a week before opening they fired most of the employees .
bad,"The manager where I worked would only see things her way. Always over co works shoulders. never letting co workers do their job, telling co works to do things how the manager wanted, but co workers would follow Dollar Tree guide lines everyday. Manager abused power"
bad,"You are paid as a store manager a salary based on a 45 hour work week. I regularly was forced to work between 70 and 80 hours a week do too short staffing and a lack of support from corporate management.  You are continually being given less hours to accomplish more tasks, the only way this is attainable is by the store manager working more and more hours due to the fact that they are salary."
bad,"I wouldnt work here again, First and foremost because of no employee loyalty, Definatley a revolving door. Beware of missing hours, poor sanitation,"
bad,Terrible company top work for. They have no regards to their employees. They are greedy and do not support their employees. They cry like babies and all they do is complain about everything. They are never satisfied and the turnover ratio is unbelievable.
bad,"Customer service, stocking, inventory, cashier, sales. the hardest part of the job was the high customer check out line value with very little help. the most enjoyable part of the job was that it was very fast paced so I always stayed busy."
bad,"There is so many problems with some stores due to management being micro-ed, there is no team ethic everyone is out for thereself"
bad,I hate it your work day will be hardc so many obligations and impossible deadlines for them to under pay you run while you can .
bad,Dollar Tree does not have competitive wages and managers are required to work very long hours without being compensated fairly.
bad,"greet customers, ring customer out, put items customers don't want back, recover the store, count till, mostly fast pace but sometimes slow"
bad,"typical day is cleaning and customer service, most of this job is what a typical custodian would do and on occasion cash handling."
bad,I would only work 4 hour days two days a week. My checks were no more than 100.00 every two weeks. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"fast work place, understaffed, rude customers and management, coworkers are not polite, the best part was getting paid and going home the worst part was closing"
bad,"exceed way too much for what they pay, didn't get paid on time, worked full time hours with no benefits and was treated very poorly when complained about it"
bad,"Close to minimum wage for Assistant Manager, PART TIME hours, 24-30 per week. A good job to take to get your first few years of experience as an Assistant Manager but once you have that almost ALL other employers will offer full time and around $5 more per hour, give or take. I had to work 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet while there."
bad,"worked for a private doctor, he was very helpful, very  nice and supportive and outgoing,  his staff was great to work with and very nice"
bad,The manager at the Round Rock location is one that will train you a certain way and then raise nine kinds of cane because you do as you are told and them she gets after you for not doing the same task another way that you were never informed of to begin with. Nothing you do seems to be good enough for this manager.
bad,The Pay is Horrible Its Minimum wage.Theres not a lot of hours to go around.Its such a Catty environment theres a lot of females that works there and there is one in charge
bad,"Typical day was routine, cashiering, stocking shelves, recovery and go backs. Co-workers were okay and supervisors were not managing the work schedule very efficiently.  Was always being called as back up.  Did not complain because I wanted more hours."
bad,"This job started off great but then the new management they brought in didn't communicate well, she was to busy trying to get a bonus for hours saving that she didn't care about the lives of her employees."
bad,"the typical day consists of dealing with different types of customers, and packed lines. I learned that working for a dollar store chain s the worst place to earn income, management did not properly teach me how to use a register, my co workers were good, hardest part was trying to function the register with many customers, nothing for enjoyable part"
bad,long work day 12 hour shift I learned how to operate just about all the equipment im trying  to leave to better myself co work are great to work with safety is number 1 management is ok the most enjoyable part of the job is being off cause your always there all day for 12 hours
bad,"We are constantly over worked for little pay, we have to work while others do not do their jobs and  nobody says anything to them. management allows dram between co-workers without intervention so that everyone can be happy to go to work. co-workers are back stabbing eachother and trying to hurt other jobs so they can advance in the work place."
bad,"I worked for a very short time. Management was never available in the store, they were always outside smoking cigarettes. They wouldn't even come back in to open a register when the lines were long. When I became pregnant I was not allowed water at my register, so I walked back and forth to the water fountain then I was threatened with being written up for not being at my register. I asked if I could do re-stock because it didn't require me to be at the register as often, they denied. When I had morning sickness I asked if I could have more night hours. I never worked another night. I was scheduled morning hours every day after that."
bad,"Excellent Place of Work, not good benefits. I have been employed with Dollar Tree for a year now, for a actual first time part time job, it has been a pretty good experience."
bad,"good work, I work as manager on duty when managers are on days off."
bad,not a fun environment to work in . the first of the month its very crazy and gets very tough
bad,"Working for Dollar Tree, as the assistant manager seemed like a wonderful opportunity until I began to see how rude and disrespectful the store manager was to employees and to customers.  At the end of my career there, I dreaded going to work because of this."
bad,not the company for advancement they have you work thru breaks while clocked out for break the policies always change without notice when you are seen doing work using the previous policies is when you get a write up & told there are new policies in effect employee safety is very poor
bad,fun but the manager sits around and makes the cashiers do all the work and I mean everything.
bad,"The customers were all so very friendly and caring. However, the staff were somewhat judgmental and criticizing. Favoritism is a huge thing with all of the managers there and unfortunately I was not one of their favorites. Very few hours are given to employees because the company does not believe in any assistance with medical benefits."
bad,"Horrible job, Managers took money out of my till, sitting around talking on their phones not doing their job at all. Very bossy, it was a horrible job and I would not recommend anyone working at Dollar tree.."
bad,this company pays min wage and you will be lucky to get any hours the manager expects you to do the job of ten ppl and 40 hrs worth of work and they never stop yelling
bad,"very hard work, very little pay, not flexible. not efficient for its employees."
bad,"Bad management"
bad,"Store Inventory"
bad,only gave employees 5-15 hrs a week and managers would just sit in office or outside smoking.
bad,Atypical day at dollar tree was fun  because I got to meet new people and customer.I learned how to be accurate on my cash register.Managemement was not fair.The hardest part of the job was holding in what I wanted to say to management when things wasnt right..
bad,I would work no more than 20 hours on a great week. Typically work hours ranged anywhere from 8-15 hours but always on the lower end. Some co-workers was great to be around but mainly management looked at you as if you were a disposable wipe. No respect or care for the way people provided for their family. I had a manager openly brag about her raise after I had just ; no longer than 5 minutes explained to them the hours I was currently receiving in a month was not enough to cover half my rent for a month worth of work. I was highly disappointed in the way I was treated.
bad,Dollar Tree was understaffed with management.  It was not out of the ordinary for a manager to work open to close.  The management turnover rate was high.
bad,The people are nice but the job is very bad the managers don't do anything but talk bad about you and the environment is just bad I regret applying there.
bad,I was making 2.15 at Mayflowers and the management was bad they pick who they like out there and let the other people go And I was one of the ones they let go
bad,no one I know liked working here. at all.  bad experience. inconsiderate of home life. low pay no benefits.
bad,"A typical day at work: sign into the cash register, and clean the entire store while waiting for customers. If there is a line because you cannot see the cash register from the back of the store, they yell at you. If you forget to get on the intercom every 10-20 minutes because you are helping the customers and doing everything else in the store, they yell at you. Usually there are two people running the entire store. "
bad,A horribly ran company. Corrupted associates were the bad things they are do that should get them in trouble become the norm.
bad,"This bastardized institution ruined my life. It was pure torture. I'm crying as I type this. My manager was bloody awful and a douche. He had different moods everyday. It was like jekyll and hyde status. For real though. No joke. My co-worker had a line full of customers one time, and she needed change. He barbarically told her, ""I'm going to make you wait like you make this customers wait."" He even groped me one time. I would put his name up for shame, but I'm not that kind of person. I hope the ceo sees this and lays him out. I hope someone feels my agony within these capital letters."
bad,"show up work ehh the baisics it what you make it"
bad,"The job itself was wonderful, but wish the Management and Hours could have been more profitable to the workers. Really underpaid and overworked. Not enough hours at all!"
bad,worked here very hard for over a year and a half. I only received one raise because of state laws not the company itself. New hires were receiving advancement opportunities before current employees. The store manager was very unorganized and unprofessional as well as irrational and racist. She would take coffee and other bribes by employees so they could advance or receive more hours. by the time i decided to resign i went from 30+ a week to 8 hrs a week . that is something no one can live off of. I contacted corporate to address these issues many times. however nothing was ever done. So i made the choice to resign and seek new employment. I wold not recommend working here to anyone. It was the worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,"- dollar tree works with your school schedule"
bad,"Horrible store to work at not enough hours, store cant be controlled, no a/c, customers always complaining about the a/c."
bad,"Dollar Tree is a great store but is not very good to it's employees.  You are allowed only a 10 minute break in a 5 hour shift.  You only get a 4.5 hour shift per week.  Since it is a small store, the employees are quite mean to each other."
bad,"The manager was very rude and always threatened her staff with the word ""fire"", she was never around when you needed her, she picked favourites, she never gives people shifts, if she did, they'll either be 4 hour shifts a week or 30 hour shifts a week, it just depends on whether she liked you or not. Her staff barely last a month because she either fires them for the smallest reasons or they just quit because they cannot handle her management anymore. Working there has been the worst experience of my life!"
bad,"Management did not know how to keep organized, they also were very rude and unfair."
bad,I would prefer not to work with/for management present at that time.
bad,"I loved my customers--- that was the only thing that kept me coming back to my job every single day for nearly 3 years... I missed only 2 days when my brother had a heart attack! They get as much work out of a person in the shortest amount of time and when it came time for raises I received a ONE percent raise! It was an absolute slap in my face. Please do not waste your hard efforts for this company, there is no appreciation for the employee at all!"
bad,"The only thing that can be said about Dollar Tree is that the management was not only rude to their employees they were also rude to their customers. "
bad,"due to unsatisfactory working environments, lack of applicable hours, and poor management i rate doller tree at a minimum score."
bad,We had to clean and re-stock every night. Which was hard due to me still being in school. The managers also did not want to give me off for my graduation so I had to leave.
bad,"I would come in during the rush, lines to the back of the store. That wasn't the hard part because I enjoyed the challenge. Crushed it in a timely manor. I learned that all management isn't the best, they rather stand around talking for hours to customer about personal things. When you called them for a pick up or had a problem they would have an attitude, but your following protocol. My co-workers wouldn't do the best work cell phones out, not picking up the slack and not helping to the best of there ability at the end of the day for clean up. The hardest part was keeping my mouth shut, I did because I have respect for people. I didn't enjoy this job not at all."
bad,"such a demanding job and no reward, they got rid of the bonus program from pt managers and at the time i was working ft helping the store make bonus but wasnt the one seeing it"
bad,Used to love working for Dollar Tree until the management started making changes. I used to get lots of encouragement and learned a lot. Grew with the company then hit a dead end. No one gets proper training and everyone is expected to know what to do due to the negative changes management is making. No one wants to work anymore cause there are no incentives or encouragement from management anymore.
bad,Nothing good about working there. Bad pay. They lie when they say full at first its 40hr a week then they drop you down to 35. You would have to call people and tell them they cant come to work when sales were down.
bad,the pay is not enough and the management there sucks. they don't have enough employees in the store
bad,i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. the work isn't hard the co-workers are easy to get along with but will turn on you at any point. the Management is horrible i think they should all be replaced. the breaks arn't long enough and if your a temp good luck trying to get a day off for something important family related.
bad,I feel like as a company dollar tree needs some improvments. The managers are over worked
bad,"I was terminated for ""failure to follow company procedure"", was never completely informed of company procedure, and not one other individual in management followed procedure."
bad,Past management was terrific hard working. Now I had to just leave un organized no routines plans never followed.
bad,"its sucked, my supervisor was angry all the time I still don't know why...."
bad,not enough hours and management was awful customers were awesome had a few issues with co workers
bad,"A typical day at work for me is a 4 hour shift, just cleaning up the store and making sure everything is in it's rightful place. There's really nothing to learn from this job, very basic the only care on management's mind is the store, plus there's not enough hours. My co-workers are all great people who do their job to the best of their abilities and do not get paid nearly enough money for the events they have to withstand. The hardest part of the job, Truthfully, you would want to quit this job but what can you do without any income these days. I can say the most enjoyable part of this job is just the different kinds of people you are able to meet and interact with."
bad,Dollar Tree is a terrible work place. They are to cheap to fix the AC so it is overwhelmingly hot in the summer. I passed out at work because of the heat and they told me that it was my fault for not sitting down. The store manager had to do everything sitting down. She would drag a chair around the store with her so she could do something as simple as airing up a balloon. The pay was terrible and you work no more then 20 hours a week. I would not recommend working here.
bad,No set schedule. My management were kids. My store manager refused to stay after 1. He did not know how to make the schedule. Management curses out customers and just walks out. Just horrible.
bad,"Horrible management low pay & only gives you hours when its convenient for them, co workers was ok the hardest part about the job is dealing with all the drama and being treated like garbage."
bad,WORST JOB EVER Customer Service Sale. KNOW MANGAEMENT TRAINNING
bad,"The only thing I like about working for this company is the customers that I come in contact with. Management plays the favoritism game. They pick who they want to work based on if they like them or not, not based on work performance. I keep getting my hours cut because they said that we aren't making th sales that we should be but they keep hiring people. Most every person on the management team is rude to workers and customers."
bad,It was a good job but i wanted more money and hours and they couldnt do that so i had to leave.
bad,there was always drama.i learned how to work in a stressful place.management was horrible.my co-workers didn't last long and were never nice.the hardest part was trying to get my co-workers to work.the most enjoyable part was my costomers.
bad,"the manager of the store was not a good person to work for he was a mental abuser."
bad,"When I worked there, I worked 5 days a week and only getting 20 hours a week ...They would want you to work 4 hour shifts but be productive as if you had 8 hour shift, very impossible..."
bad,"Upper management has no respect for there assistant managers and we are like slaves, not a good company to work for the long term."
bad,Unrealistic holes even managers that have been with company don't believe in it but stay becouse they have to so sad
bad,"The boss was always changing the schedule and not telling anyone what we worked, and they were rude all the time."
bad,I can't really say nothing good or bad about the company but they didn't hire me in after the store was set up. I was just used as company man power for cheap to open the location on 8 mile. Its closed now.
bad,it was a nice environment to work the employees I worked with were nice
bad,not many hours some of managers were not well trained and there was no respect among management
bad,"All I can say is run far run fast if you are thinking of working here!  They break the law time and again, they don't care about their employees unless you kiss butt.  They don't follow their own policies, it is a horrible place to work!"
bad,The corporate office does not let us work more than nine hours a week . It costs more in gas than we make at minimum wage.
bad,Your the only cashier there typically being over worked then your hours get cut when there were only 20 to begin with 
bad,"No hours 5 to 10 hrs wk"
bad,"Worst place to work in. No full time position, bad management, under paying employees. Males cant use cashiers.Co workers a pain to deal with. Bad place overall to work; especially for males(Unless you're a manager)."
bad,"go to work on time, unload trucks, stock the store, clean, and zone the store. also running the cash register. "
bad,Satisfactory.  Co -workers and management easy to work with.
bad,"Initially I loved my job, but after being passed over for store manager for a woman that customers consider a personality less fool with delusions of grandeur, and became sick with myself and quit the company."
bad,"you work hard with no respect."
bad,"maintenance,stock, carts and helping customers.When I started .It just opened up  so it was slow."
bad,unpresentable managment is disfunctional paychecks are not pleaseing as well as hours not a good work place
bad,"this job was stessful and the store manager is a jerk he always mace you fear loosing your job."
bad,Dollar tree is not a good company to work for they dnt appreciate your work they think your a slave they dont give you a raise  ive been their for 5 1/2 yrs and its the worst place to work for .i had to rate them but if it were up to me I wouldnt give then no stars
bad,"hire anyone and fire for no reasons, pretty easy job, easy to spend your pay check there, they do give you the chance to be in managment if wanted and if there is opening"
bad,"This job requires way too much for the amount they pay. they hire most employees at part time so that they don't have to give benefits.  there are no raises . You will only get okay pay of you area full time manager , and at that you still only make 10 an hr"
bad,"A typical day would be setting ads, stocking shelves, pogs, customer service. I manage 15 sales associates and 3 managers. The hardest part of my job is trying to make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have the great team I do."
bad,"job security? they dont fire slaves, they sell them"
bad,the manager in this store is unfair towards her employess and shows favertisim.
bad,"Hard work and Long hours for 8 bucks an hour with prior experience, sucked. Very hateful Overnight Manager."
bad,I did not enjoy working for Dollar Tree Canada. During my training I was very excited to be working there. As I opened 2 stores I noticed the lack of support and communication I received from my upper Management.
bad,Worked for this place for 6 years and still made minimum wage. Used to be a friendly environment until the manager was fired for apparently being too much of a friend to everyone. Eventually all new management took over and it just turned into a horrible place. All the new management is rude and disrespectful and I wouldn't refer them to anyone.
bad,"No stability, way to much asked of you in a 4 hour shift, you average 12-16 hours a week, management is atrocious and I don't have enough time to further elaborate."
bad,"This place is the WORST place to work. After holidays, they will cut your hours to 0 and make you as a ""call in"" option. The management only gets the hours and the store manager accuses everyone of theft so shes the only manager there."
bad,"my opinion is that this corporation mostly cares about the company , not the workers. hard work is not appreciated and only criticized. morals were very low and manager favoritism is high. positive feedback from customers was prevalent , but rarely from management. a poor store manager meant no quarterly bonuses."
bad,"Fast pace, retail establishment; filling store merchandise, announcing featured items of the week ever 15 minutes. Assisting customer to locate items selections. Also finalizing their purchase at cash register for quick and accurate transactions."
bad,corporate cares NOTHING for their associates or their customers
bad,"Not a place I would recommend applying at. One manager is ok the other is someone you could live without knowing. I learned nothing from there, there was no enjoyable part of the job, the worst part is everything."
bad,"Put stock out for sale, getting the end caps ready for up coming seasons.How to sit up displays"
bad,"Just all the way around horrible. The pay is CHEAP and they expect you to work while on break, and its UNPAID."
bad,"Awful place to work. They don't care about employees and try to get out of paying you any cent that they can. Work/Life balance? There is no LIFE when you WORK there. People are constantly calling in and instead of the store manager covering for them, like is in their job description, they count on the assistant managers to do so. If a store manager is out for any length of time, the assistant is expected to take up the position with no compensation."
bad,he conditions are really bad and you are under paid as you work hard for nothing
bad,The work was ok but they had to let me go cause they didnt have the hours to keep me on. Co-workers are friendly. I wish I still was there.
bad,This job is not real. They just laid off a bunch of people. I went to the store and asked about this so called job they are advertising for and they told me upper management keeps this out there all the time. As well as the NOW HIRING signs in the window.
bad,"A typical day at Dollar Tree would be working on the register, blowing up balloons, cleaning the store, and taking care of the customers. The short amount of time that I worked there I learnt that when you're not trained properly for the position you make a lot of errors. The management here was okay; A couple of my co-workers were fun to work with and they helped me (if needed). The hardest part of the job was trying to remember what I was supposed to do on the register with very little training, and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and blowing up balloons."
bad,"typical day is 12 hrs, with no break"
bad,They over work you and will try and write you up in a heart beat
bad,"A typical day at the dollartree was right when you walk in, the boss yells, ""why didnt you get this done in time yesterday?"" I learned more about how certain stores operate their freight crew, and this is definatly not a good first time job for first timers... The management staff was awful. They never knew really what they were doing in their jobs. The employees i worked with were great. We all got along just fine. The hardest part of the job was having enough time to get things done. There was no enjoyable parts about that job."
bad,the dollar tree was the worst place I had ever worked at
bad,"Its a good place for someone that has no retail experience. The training methods and its on the job training needs a lot of work and more on hands approach from the management team. Each store has it community and its environment to adapt to. Overall, I would not recommend it to only those that have no retail experience but if those that do have beware. Its not a competitive and its salary is sub par for those that have the experience."
bad,"I've been with dollar tree 3 years and started off as a sales associate and am now an assistant manager. The pay is virtually the same between these two positions, although as a manager, your list of duties is a heck of a lot longer. Recently the company did away with annual raises (AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT). If it means the company saves money, then they will do almost anything. I can honestly say that every single one of my co-workers (about 15-20 or so) is very unhappy with dollar tree and the way they are managed (DM) i recommend staying away from Dollar Tree and anything affiliated with DT. It is not worth the headaches and not worth the time!!!!"
bad,The work schedule is often difficult to recover because no one ever answers the phone. the animosity among the supervisors often affects the work ethic and environment.
bad,"Enjoyed the atmosphere and my co-workers, but I didn't get a lot of hours and the pay low"
bad,"To sum it up. Dollar Tree is a new age store that treats you like a number. All they care about is store sales at the end of the week. If sales are not where the company wants them then it's the manager of the stores fault.They go through managers and employees like McDonald's goes through a case of frozon burgers at lunch time at their busiest restaurant... I stocked shelves there and worked my a-s off with never a compliment or chance of advancement. It was never enough and I was always reminded of how little I did. Although I was stocking more than anyone else on the job. Profit is all they care about. I did not see a happy person there with their job at anytime. When I was hired there the manager told me that if I had a friend there, or if I knew anyone that worked there I would not be hired. I think that says it all. One more thing, it took them 2 months to bring me up to Vermont's states minimum wage after the new year.. 2012"
bad,This company does not believe in promoting a diverse population.
bad,"Not the job to have when trying to keep your family afloat, although provided me to learn how to work under a lot of pressure."
bad,You go to work clock in and go straight to work.
bad,"I work at the dollar tree store for five years now as a part-time cashier. I get to talk to customers all the time, prepare for inventory and doing go backs at night. There's time I enjoy working there, but other times the workload is a lot although I did it part-time. I have a great manager who understands and help us a lot. We worked as a team at my store and we help each other. At this time of my life, I needed to find something better, this is why I decided to apply with indeed. com."
bad,Overall an ok job. I learned cashier and stocking experience. As learned that some co-workers slack on the job. When that happens that leaves the other workers to fill in. But overall enjoyed working and interacting with the customers.
bad,"I was placed on suspension at the end of the holiday season, and 2 days later terminated with-out any explanation.Dollar Tree was found to have wrongfully terminated me and I did at least recieve unemployment."
bad,Helping customer check out items at the end of their shopping experience. Co-workers was pleasent to work with. The hardest part of the job was not enough help. I liked helping the customers each day.
bad,I can't describe the level of dislike I had for DollarTree.
bad,"bad management, no sense of direction and dirty store. no one seem to know what was going. no one would be their some nights to open the doors for up to an hour to start your shift."
bad,"I was employed for by this company for 18 months. As a part-time assistant manager I was only making minimum wage. By 'part-time' they mean 40 hours a week, but if you got overtime you got in trouble. When the store manager and district manager positions were readjusted the company got a management overhaul and I was one of the unlucky ones who got let go. They refused my unemployment saying that I was let go due insubordination. I was a model employee and have the awards to prove it."
bad,"Place is horrible, manager does not work with people on times, you get written up if you call in sick. They are a company that doesn't care about family"
bad,Unprofessional establishment. Store manager was very rude and allowed employees to challenge assistant managers. Over worked and under paid! Assistant managers would never show up for their shifts forcing other managers to work more that 12 hour shifts and still was able to keep their jobs.
bad,Employees need more training and better pay . The job overall was not hard but the employees weren’t organized and it made for a stressful environment
bad,"I care and value the Dollar Tree as much as they do us.Which is not at all. Dollar Tree's motto ""anybody can be replaced."" As mangers you're constantly forced to work through your UNPAID meal breaks, if you don't take the break they deduct it from your time clock anyways. It's the most poorly managed Corp. I've even seen"
bad,"Smartest thing I ever did was escape this BS company! Great for the customers but a soul-sucking, body-destroying work experience!!!! This job made me want to kill myself rather than go to work."
bad,"Ever since dollar tree has taken over family dollar, the company lacks in every aspect. Corporate management has no idea how a store is physically run, they only know what looks good on paper. The company absolutely does not care about a balanced work/home life. The company will only hold certain employees accountable for certain policies and procedures. Good employees are always pushed away while terrible employees a e given any opportunity to thrive"
bad,Worked 4 years every single person there talked bad on everyone else.  So much drama it was like going back to high school again horrible place to work full of back stabbing women !
bad,Unprofessional. Always clutter in the aisles. Management was rude. You never could find what you were looking for because they were always out of stock.
bad,I got hired on site threw a green shirt on started my day for 5 hours as a stocker learning my way around the store and helping customers it was painful.
bad,There was no store manager. Need I say more... Very unorganized all around. Anyone could get hired at this place. They just like a breathing body to be present and that's about it.
bad,"Management is horrible. Didn't like minorities or male workers. Gives little hrs and will suddenly change the schedule on you, so your a 'no call no show', and then say you as quit."
bad,"The store is high deman, underpaid, and extremely high turnover. In one year I saw 50 employees come and go. Enough said. Only get 10min breaks also. Management was never on the same page."
bad,I was a store manager for over 10 yrs. When I went to work for the Dollar Tree the location I was hired at needed a store manager. I was told that you have to be an employee of Dollar Tree to be considered. All I can say is they really need to work on doing better business. DollarTree
bad,I worked long hours and worked full weeks doing my job and other managers jobs trying to keep the store together and finally left because management was not treating me properly for the amount of work and time I was putting in.
bad,"I was a assistant manager and Stocked manger. They dont pay well with the things I did as we closed managers and open manager. One employee and yourself. Receiving merchandise, payroll, filing, order merchandise for store and frozen etc."
bad,You get no appreciation even when you work your butt off.. customers are rude and everyone you work with has no care at all towards their work I'm currently looking for something new
bad,"They treat their employees terrible, they cut their hours, they make people put in breaks that they dont take or else they'll fire them, they are the worst company I have ever worked for and I even called osha on them for risking the safety of their employees"
bad,"Horrible pay, horrible management and overall terrible place to work...no matter how many times you organize r clean up that store, its never finished.. its nothing but stress"
bad,"I care and value the Dollar Tree as much as they do us.Which is not at all. Dollar Tree's motto ""anybody can be replaced."" As mangers you're constantly forced to work through your UNPAID meal breaks, if you don't take the break they deduct it from your time clock anyways. It's the most poorly managed Corp. I've even seen"
bad,Very poor company they work you like a dog and even if you move up the pay is still bad only 10.75 for Assistant manager. The store manager does nothing. And they very unprofessional the Manager and the DM will talk about you like a dog they have no respect for there employees.
bad,The job itself is a good the store is very hot in summer. I love working with people and meeting new people. The pay is very low 7.40 the store is not so clean I do as much as I can to help.
bad,"Management is horrible, workers bash customers and co workers. There is no chance to move up in the company. Management is horrid. Disrespects employees and customers."
bad,"This company does not respect or appreciate its employees. Managers, District Managers are very unprofessional and biased. They play favorites and give more money to the men doing less than the women."
bad,The manager was so rude and would talk down to me and all the employees. Disrespectful. Never same hours. Couldn't pay bills ever on time. Waste of time
bad,It is a fly by night company that only gives part time hours no way to make a living at all very high turnover rates and it's a good starter job for someone in high school or need to gain a little experience in retail and stocking
bad,Poor pay to begin with. You get paid minimum wage and no overtime pay for pulling extra hours. Covering shifts is something I got put on schedule to do a lot. I remember only having 5 of my days off cause they called me in every other time and favertism was done.  They didn't have any lines of punishment for abuse on the job and the work environment changed day to day.
bad,"The turnover is unbelievable. The low hourly wages ensure that no one wants to stick around. Meaning as the salaried store manager, you end up doing a huge amount of work. Non-stop call outs, no call no shows."
bad,Dollar need to increase their hourly wage.. company makes a enough to pay weekly... Dollar should offer more than .05 cents annual raise... there should be reviews every 90 days... needs more opportunities to advance only the managers and upper management get incentives when the cashier's and stockers are the reason why the store makes sales
bad,Incompetent on a high-level. The longer the employees have been there the lazier they are there’s no joy no happiness no peace I recommend this for somebody fresh out of high school just looking for something to keep cash in their pocket this place is the devil
bad,"Dollar Tree did not offer benefits for part-time assistant managers nor pay wages for all the work entailed for that position. This company lacked focus on the value of their employees and showing such to their employees. Customers come first, yes, however, employees build and support the company by building customer service for repeat business."
bad,I got hired as seasonal and became permeant for 4 years I loved working here went back recently and the store was a complete disaster. They should be embracced
bad,Great products and customer just bad management. Not enough hours and work. It’s like a big competition going on there would not recommend anyone to work there unless you like disrespectful people.
bad,The people running this company has absolutely no care for their employees. It is a typical corporation. You are a dime a dozen and easily replaced. My  own personal upper management was shady af! They played dirty. They wanted someone who would just be obedient. Nevermind the unrealistic expectations placed. The cons weighed more than the pros!
bad,"you do it all.  no.payroll.    hiring ppl that are only given 10 hrs a week!!  youre not a manager--- you're doing it all yourself!!"
bad,Large turnover rate since minimum wage is 7.25 for regular employee and 8.25 for assistant. Too much instore bickering between assistants about who works more when they dont get paid wnough for it.Extremely high expectations from corprate when they arent willing to help.
bad,"My time here at Dollar Tree was one of the most unprofessional, overbearing, Unfair & unreasonable places that i have ever had to work at.  I don't believe that I will ever work for another Dollar Tree ever again."
bad,"Terrible hours! Hardly gave me hours. Probably only worked two to three days out of the work. Too much drama. Mostly women worked there, very territorial."
bad,"Shrink is off the charts for a dollar store! No safe guards for Management employees!  No cameras! They can blame you for anything if your name is on safe log, but 5 people in & out of the safe!"
bad,If you are not a manager..you will only get 20 hours per.week..you only work 3 days out of the week.. sometimes 2 days & they only get you 4 hours any day that you are schedule to work..a truck with almost 2000 boxes and they expect you to finish unloading that truck in 4 hours.cant make enough money to pay bills and survive.. wouldn't give a recommendation for Dollar tree
bad,They over work you and under pay you. During my time at the Dollar Tree I can say that I have been treated unfairly numerous times from being overlooked for a better position to working under extreme stressful conditions like working 7 days a week.
bad,"No room for advancement! They absolutely don’t like to promote from within! They rather hire someone off the street! They already say they will fire you for working off the clock but when it is just one cashier and one member of management, you can’t leave that cashier hanging with an extremely long line of people so you end up helping on your breaks or lunches! Dollar tree does not do anything about shoplifters except “Ban” them from the store! At least half of the stores don’t have cameras or limited ones nor do they have panic buttons! Not a safe place to work!"
bad,"I've never seen a more mismanaged job in my entire life. No break room even after 6 HR calls actually soeaking with someone."
bad,Over all the job is very easy. It can get really busy and really crazy in there at times but if you have a good team to work with your shift will fly by very smoothly!
bad,"I believe that if a company looks after their  employees, the employees will look after their customers . "
bad,I work 90 hours a week... Salary isn't as high as I would like.  You don't get a salary based on your performance. It's based on what store does yearly.  High turnover with employees.  Just stressful and you get no support from upper regional or district management
bad,I would recommend any against working here. They do not care about their employees. Pay is horrible. No overtime what so ever. Poor management across most stores. Corporate is a joke.
bad,No training for anything really and I make 7.35 a hour the shirt I had to buy to work there cost me 3 hours of work lol thank good I had the pants already
bad,"My time there was brief, but I can honestly say the pay is horrible and the management I worked with was horrible. If you only need something for a few extra dollars, they're the place to work."
bad,"The one I worked at was infested with mice and roaches. The stock room freezer was broke and management refused to get it fixed. The stock room was so overstocked that it made it hazardous for employees and for shoppers because any overstock that could not be stocked in the backroom was placed in the aisles in the shopping section of the store."
bad,"Not all stores are the same but this particular dollar tree in great Barrington Massachusetts has poor management. If you're desperate then yes, consider this store as a last result!"
bad,"Store manager has NO clue on how to run a store! Doesn't care about employee nor customer needs at all, only his! Does NOTHING all day and take credit for other people's work lying to DM about everything! Doesn't train at all just expect you to train on your own.  The company if self only care about a dollar not even safety!"
bad,It’s what you’d expect working at the bottom of the retail barrel. Managers are expected to stock and make up the difference for the forever minimum wage associates. Dollar Tree does not hire full time associates so hiring a loyal team is impossible. Turnover rate is high for managers and associates so you will be constantly short handed to go on top of your limited hours. This should be your last option
bad,Love working there but poor managers so I look for a better job. That get a new people and trying get rid of the one already you do not want to work that
bad,They didn't come when I needed them there has been many complaints on managment. They were rude they always went outside for a smoke break they always got mad when you asked for help
bad,"I would only suggest working for this company if you have nowhere else to go. The nice thing is I was promoted twice because of my work experience in such a short time but I was eventually sent to a raggedy store that needed extreme help. Boxes that were supposed to be unloaded were left in walkways, floors were dirty, items left all over the store that customers had ""used"" without paying for them, and I could go on and on. I came in and was not depressed like the ""acting GM"" was. I was optimistic that things could get turned around with the right staff and attitude from management. I was wrong. When I corrected customers for being rude to staff or tried to stop them from stealing I was reprimanded by the acting GM, whom acted as if she was scared of everyone including staff which is why I was also reprimanded when I was trying to discipline my staff. She really had no business being in the retail business since she had less experience then I did and didn't seem to know what to do most of the time. When issues were brought to the district manager's attention he didn't care at all and told us to take it to the acting GM who didn't know what to do. After a while I became discouraged and just didn't care anymore so I was just there for the paycheck. After a while they labeled me the one that was angry because I was the only one to hold staff accountable. This company is a joke and bass ackwards."
bad,"A typical day at DT was watching the managers and (some) fellow coworkers smoke outside for more than 20 minutes multiple times a day. When outside they couldn't hear anything going on so there would be no support for the cashiers inside. Usually, there were only one or two registers open. Other employees were nowhere to be found to assist with long lines. If policy was broken everyone would be penalized except for the managers favorite employees.   "
bad,"Management never seemed organized or very helpful. They did not address many of the issues that came up during my employment there, or even seem like they were trying to resolve them. The other coworkers made the environment a bit toxic and as a female I was slightly uncomfortable in that environment."
bad,"experience working there was good the head of the stores in general just don’t care , Unfortunately it shows in the work they do and the store it self"
bad,"I work at the biggest one it understaffed, no carts, no store manager, low pay, always hot, can't fixed their door and then the district manager have the nerves to tell I can't wear short, my beanie and it funny cause he just temporary and doesn't  evening belong to our store I been wearing my beanie since I started working at my location October 2017 and our permanent district  manager that currently taking about break cause she getting ready to have her baby never told me I couldn't wear my hat I feel comfortable with it on and I wear my beanie because I got scars that are cause by other people I do my job very well how could you be strict if you really don't care about your store appearances. They literally have to get manager and other employees from other dollar tree locations  to help stock cause it too much and the paid is little and they take away other employees hours it a whole mess. This location in Katy Tx and I'm desperately looking for something better than this"
bad,"If you are not in management or a complete tattle tail you will never ammout to anything @ the tree. I went above and beyond my duties for the tree for almost 3 years and tree fired me for things that wasnt even in the handbook , some made up rule they make on the fly. And then denied my unemployment benifits, after this took me three seperate trips to fianally talk to someone in HR. This place need to have all new management from the GM first to the so called managers and my immediate manager would leave the primiss and go drinking and come back in like nothing happened ,  you would walk into the office and he would have inappropriate on his phone acting very scared and quickly try and click off of the windpw he was watching . this place is a complete joke . oh uea we have told hr many times people would be sleeping on the job as well as leave premise,and Absolutely Nothing would be done to the person's .......smh.....this place doesnt deserve a single 🌟"
bad,This company has the ability to do well on paper but it employs and promotes based on politics not potential.  This company bends the rules at their convenience and it only hurts the hard workers while the lazy people take extended breaks and hang out with the manager on duty. This is a place to get a pay check or who you know situation but it is designed for the honest worker to climb the ladder.
bad,"This place is general hospital,ryans hope  the people there are messy as long as you are to yourself you are ok try not to get involved with them speak and go on about your life"
bad,"A typical day is putting out fires because there is NEVER enough help scheduled. That is why everything is still a dollar. Stores are messy, employees are bottom of the barrel because they only pay minimum wage. Upper management demands you stay around the clock to get all the work done. No support from field management."
bad,about working here. Awful toxic work environment. The District managers are money hungry creeps who micro manage everything. Never had a chance. No work life balance. They take advantage of all store level employees.
bad,Alot of favoritism. Was promised a pay raise when hired.... Still have yet to get one cent. Hours and promotions are only given to the pets of managers...  There is no structure at all
bad,"This company doesn’t care about their employees from the store manger on down. As far as they are concerned, Dollar Tree comes first and your life comes last. There is no sense in having a store manager when the district manager has to approve everything they do from the schedule on down to what to put on an end cap.  You never know what day the truck is going to come in from week to week and when it is changed, then you have to change everyone’s schedule (who cares if they already had plans!)."
bad,The wages/hours are insulting. Profit is the first and only concern. Communication from management is nonexsistent. Policies are only followed when it benefits the company. Training is lacking for every position.
bad,"A healthy work-life balance is preached from management, but lacks the life balance portion in the actual direction.  Career advancement is subjective and gender biased.  Unhealthy workplace culture."
bad,Was working there as Seasonal while attending college. When I turned in my notice to go visit family for a week the manager approved it and reassured me I would still have a job when I got back. When I did come back to work I didnt get any hours and 3 weeks later I got a call from the assistant manager and she said I was let go so I should go look elsewhere for work and hung up.
bad,"No security features in the location i worked. Very agressive managers. Rude crew twards customers, even more problems twards other staff. No effort in changing."
bad,"you work very hard my experience was very bad, store was horrible backroom was a safety hazard.  Associates had a lot of issues drug related, stealing and alcohol related. People quit often was under pay especially management.  I work fright everyday ignorer to keep my sales up and balances my work. Call out a lot sometimes you are stuck their from opening to closing , i had no one to stay be a manager for 3 months I open the store and close it everyday, never have no days off.  As for the district manager he didn't care never send no help."
bad,"I worked at Dollar tree for two years, yes I was able to advance to management status quickly but the pay raise was not worth what I had to do there. Management is very poor they are egotistical and care about looking good for their boss even if it was their assistants that did the work, they take credit. "
bad,"Had workers pay for there own uniform but gave very little hours . "
bad,"this company when i worked there was all about the numbers, they could have paid better and kept changing medical providers as well as company presidents."
bad,"DO NOT work here, the management is terrible. You don't get paid enough to do the amount of work you are asked to do. The store is in terrible condition and there is NO security."
bad,I was a Store Manager the freight flow was very unstructured and out of hand. The trucks would be 2700-3200 cases per week. No hours allocated for stockers. Cashier hours were scheduled automatically by the company an average stocker schedule was 5 hours per week. Management ran the register all day and was expected to stock and do all other management functions.  I worked 110 hour work weeks and only got paid for 48 hours. The regional manager would walk in the store and talk to management like they were pieces of trash.
bad,Dollar tree corporate does not show that they value any of their employees. Offers little to no benefits very little pay for amount of work needed done. Extreme disrespect shown from corporate to lower employees. Unsafe working conditions in some stores because of frieght problems in back room. Would NOT reccomend.
bad,Very poor workplace. You get treated like you’re nothing. Pay isn’t fair at all especially for managers. Store is always a mess. Very unorganized workplace but as long as they see numbers they d
bad,"No one cares about the company on any level. They expect you to show up to work but aren't ready for you to work and won't pay you for your time spent and expect you to wait for the truck. The upper management cares nothing for the employees. We opened a new store and I was transferred to help open said store. Because of mismanagement I, along with several other employees are made to be without a store and without hours until they decide to open the store late. They don't care about their employees or anything outside of their profit. Ask anyone who works there. They will pay you minimum wage regardless  of experience. Completely illegal and unfair practices."
bad,"Store05534/district135/region06 only does well because customers do not see the unfortunate mistreatment and poor business atmosphere behind the filter. The STR Manager is abrasive and rude to employees and turnover is largely because of this one individual. The welcoming treatment changes once hired in. Dollar Tree has strange policies that hinder rather than help. This company lacks basic tools and  necessities for a retail cashier/sales associate. Managers make one dollar more than cashier's so that they can get a deeper look at the poor infrastructure of Dollar Tree, and receive further mistreatment from the STR Manager at Store05534/district135/region06. What do Dollar Tree managers and store products have in common? ........They are all $1"
bad,idk they where slow they don't have that many staff members they move at there own paste I was the fastest working person there their store dosed not stay clean most of the time there
bad,"really bad management and staff, people don't show up for shifts but they are so desperate for staff that they don't even fire them. "
bad,The job is very stressful because of customers' attitudes and the poor leadership from the management team. If I didn't need a job this would not be the place that I would choose to work for.
bad,Sexual Harassment was a major problem. Managers constantly yelling at all employees.Would not recommend specific location to anyone. Very hostile work environment
bad,"not a very fun place to work, the management keeps changing to worse management,managers abuse their power and mistreat their employees, managers encourage workers to confront a thief's. its an unsafe work environment, the staff and the emotional abuse that goes there is astonishing."
bad,"If you enjoy never being able to enjoy the feeling of accomplishment, and are completely fine with constant battles of full stockrooms and trying to fill shelves all day, then this is right up your alley."
bad,"This was your typical minimum wage job that wouldn't give you enough hours to pay any bills. Management was horrible. Most managers would sit in the office chatting on the phone not doing much. At one point an assistant manager threatened to write me up if I called her to bring my register change one more time that day. Standards were wildly different if you weren't friends with whoever the manager on duty was. "
bad,No hours expect alot from workers and are very rude with customers. No vacation for workers. No sick time. Pay is low I've been there 4 years and only still make 8 dollars an hour
bad,Not balanced and fair to much turn over and not enough support .U work long hours and they pay and raise are low for what they require a person to do.
bad,"Where can I begin? Working at Dollar Tree was a horrible experience for me. I started working there due to needing a job quickly, and I knew pretty quickly that I would not want to stay there long. Management was very poor, treating employees like they don't deserve to have a life outside of the store. Requesting a day off was met with a very bad attitude, with the manager implying that you have no right to ask for a day to enjoy yourself. ""Rules"" are either not enforced consistently, or not enforced at all. Work hours are very poor, with a maximum of 25 hours a week (more often less). Scheduling was horrible, making you close work one night and then open the next morning. You aren't allowed to have set days off unless you are in school or have another job (time with family is not important enough, I suppose). And don't even get me started on how you are treated by the customers. All in all, I would not recommend working here to my worst enemy."
bad,"Maybe it's the store and district I'm in, but the store manager is like a dictator, the corporate office dont care about the employees, keep cutting hours, and raising company expectations. Don't care about their employees personal life. And honestly if you want to advance in the company, you better be a stocking robot, or be a dictator type manager. And don't expect overtime. You cant even do 1 minute of overtime."
bad,It was a good plce to work for the people are great just that the manager is unfair an very disrepectful with her dirty mouthan the higher ups don't do anything for she talks to them very disrepectful as well.
bad,"I did a lot for this company for 3 years and they never gave a raise or chance for advancement. The hours were horrible as well. They promised me assist management position and after 2 years, i was done with the lies"
bad,"This job is not the job u want to have. They barely give u hours, u only work 2 days out of the week. This job has no benefits and u also dont get raises."
bad,"When working at Dollar Tree, you are busy from the time you clock in until the time you clock out. It is entirely to much work for so little pay. Manager pay is also not enough for all the work the is expected."
bad,"The management has zero care for their employees, and will insult them after completing tasks. Would not recommend to anyone, part or full time. Terrible flexibility, and the promise of a pay grade increase is a blatant lie (8 months experience and zero cents increase)."
bad,"My interpersonal skills with both my co-workers and managers were great, they were a great bunch!  Contrary to this, the work environment can be labelled as nothing but sub-par. The treatment of employees by the company policies reflect no concern for life outside of work, the employees' well-being (physical/mental), nor the working environment. The company policies reflect concern for nothing but revenue, and it's status among other businesses. The employees are treated as mere puppets and worse. I would NEVER recommend anyone work here."
bad,Does not treat people with a disability properly. Management on second shift at corporate  location in Chesapeake are a joke. Dont work at that location
bad,"This company is the WORST company I have ever had the misfortune of working for. They don't care about their employees, they pay poorly and expect way too much. They'll use you up until your burnt out and then find a way to let you go or push you out."
bad,A great way to start a entry job to learn basic life but not to live off of.  Its a good job and awesome to work for but not great respext from our costumers
bad,Dollar Tree makes a decent temporary part time job. Management could be better. The management doesn't handle complaints from employees well at all. The software and technology of their registers could be more advanced.
bad,"I worked here for 9 years. Couldnt get promoted as its all about management liking who they like. Horrible hours and pay and never in 9 years got above $9 an hour. Most of the Management is a joke, with the exception of a few good ones who get run over. Would go without a job before going back there to work."
bad,"A typical work day at Dollar Tree is you come in at 8:30 in the morning to get ready to open at 9. Now with opening the store you and your cashier at the time must both clock in then go to the office your cashier counts his/her drew then i as the manager on duty i must count the other 3 draws put those in the registers. Then go back into the office fill out all the clip boards,count the safe, start back office on the computer, fill out paper for myself and everybody that's coming in for that day. Once all the office work is done you head to the floor to begin to stoke at 9 we unlock the doors and let everyone in which is always about 10-15 people waiting and from there you just keep doing what your doing till your done then you move on to the next project and if an costumer or your cashier needs help you must stop everything your doing right then an there. Don't let me forget to mention it's only 2 people per shift unless its a Monday which is truck day."
bad,"One of those places you've to keep following up, but finally get to you. The hardest part of the job was doing 20 things for $7.25 per hour and had to wait .25 for a raise."
bad,"Bad. I was sexually harassed by manager smacking employees on the butt ."
bad,"I was a cashier/stock.  It was always very busy never enough cashiers on staff.  Always kept busy. "
bad,They will openly yell at each other during business hours and not at least try to keep it too themselves. Customers would complain and they would leave trash and boxes and u-bouts with boxes against racks of products so you couldn't get to them and it was very hard for shopping carts to even move to another isle. Plus they keep littering their cigarette butts all out front and other trash out there is left untouched.
bad,"I was just a ""filler"" at Dollar Tree, so I didn't learn a lot about the company.  The job was very disappointing in many areas.  The management of the store was disorganized and many of the policies just didn't make sense.  The scheduling of the employees and shifts had no consistency and the training and communications was pretty much non-existent. I actually felt sorry for the employees who had to work there, full time.  I would not recommend working for Dollar Tree."
bad,"the manager was bad at organizing, talked about employees in front of customers. doesn't know the first aid procedures. i quit after i passed out at work after slicing my finger open with a box cutter, another employee helped me, manager had no clue what to do. he made jokes about me passing out to other employees infront of customers in the store."
bad,"Stocking the store"
bad,"It sucks the life out of you then you get fired. I was more qualified than the district manager. I was a threat"
bad,"during the course spent at dollar tree I had 4 managers, each time I tried to be promoted I was told yes and then passed over for absolutely no reason other then the simple fact that they knew someone or had the employee before. would not recommend working here for long periods of time."
bad,"Company has become a ""checklist"" organization, which puts zero consideration from store personnel input.  Stores at never consulted over operational changes or ways to help minimize changes for smooth transitions.  "
bad,"Only the store manager and select assistants are full time. No other position is full time. 24 hours for assistant managers and  8-16 hours for cashiers and stock personnel is what you can hope for until the Christmas season. Minimum wage is all you will receive. I was a full-time assistant manager making less than a fast food server does now. Because of the low pay and unfavorable hours, cashier and stock positions have an extremely high turnover rate. Stock people are expected to unload trucks every week, and meet a varied case per hour stock rate based on department. If you can't make and sustain the rates, you won't have your minimum wage job."
bad,Management doesn't know how to treat people which makes it stressful to work there. Attitude always reflects leadership and to talk down to someone over a simple mistake is ridiculous.
bad,"First of all, it's a job with five-hour shifts. Second of all, it's a retail job. What more is there? The one I worked at was on Dutch Broadway in Elmont. Sure, most people you encounter are nice, and you get your fair share of nasty ones, but there is nothing fulfilling about having this kind of job. ""What about the money?"" you may ask. The base rate is $10/hour, but in a five-hour shift, that amounts to about $200-$300 per week depending on how many hours you're willing to slave in this job. Your back will hurt, so make sure you're wearing good sneakers."
bad,"Poor management, DM does not care how employees feel about her employees, Human Resources never answers or returns phone call. Worst job I’ve ever had"
bad,Dollar Tree does not pay there employees a decent wage! And as a cashier or stocker you may work 10 to 15 hours a week! There are never enough people in the store to handle the amount of coustomer s needing help or trying to check out!
bad,"The employees are friendly and have great customer service, but they are over worked and under paid. The company overloads the stores with so much freight in their back rooms that they are rarely ever in OSHA compliance. Yet Dollar Tree does not give the stores enough hours every week to maintain a low stock room. The employees always feel overwhelmed and underappreciated by the company and the customers."
bad,"Working at dollar tree, it was some what worth it. Because they will call you in when they only need you, they call you in everyday or have a set schedule for you. They don't know how to keep things stack up in the store."
bad,"Look, if you want to work with minimum hours, minimum staff and tons of boxes of freight that comes every single week, then this is the place for you... and you get to work from open to close multiple times a week and most times 7 days a week for months."
bad,"I worked here from July 31st until August 22nd of this year. I got laid off for no reason. Everything was terrible (the manager, assistant managers and everything else)."
bad,I am not interested in providing written feedback for this company and believe the overall feedback provided so far in the survey should be sufficient.
bad,"It's was okay because was my first job . Was working for my own money, management was kind of poor dollar tree of Annapolis Riva festival I came to work every day it was a seasonal job."
bad,i worked at dollar tree for three years. after about a year i was promoted to assistant manager. it is a fast paced busy store where there was never enough employees and had to work extra hard to make up for things that other employees did not do.
bad,working at dollar tree was so horrible the staff was rude and the customers was worst i had no help when the lines got too long and the management team was not helpful at all
bad,A typical day at work is being told that I will be the only cashier until the end of my shift when the next customer comes in. I learned from this job that you get treated very poorly from customers whatever it is you're doing. Management is a joke they don't work around school schedule even though they say they do. The most enjoyable part of the job is a very short 10 minute break that isn't even enough time to eat a sandwich and a drink.
bad,Corporate doesn't care about their store staff. They continue to cut hours and still expect same work done in less hours and don't care how stressed the employees get.  They would rather you quit than care.
bad,"very few hours to work, constant problems with scheduling, rules change with the mood, some of the management team make the shift more stressful than is needed, minimum wage."
bad,"I was treated poorly, the company pulled loopholes to avoid paying for health insurance, and I wasn't even paid more than the bare minimum.  The management was lazy and cynical. I was miserable there."
bad,"It was a bad place to work"
bad,The labor is easy and the people I worked with were nice but its nothing more than a side job. Nobody that works here makes enough to live even managers.
bad,"This is honestly one of the most miserable places I have ever worked. People are hired because they can't find better work, most of the staff are convicted felons with zero jobs skills. The management is worked to the bone (60 hours weekly and more). There is no corporate communication, no real incentives, hours fluctuate, expectations for keeping the store clean and stocked are often unrealistic with staffing."
bad,"This is not a company you can advance quickly with. Its a very poorly planned out and ran company from the top. This is a company whos olicy is to only give the max 15 hours a week per associate, people cannot depend on that. And yearly raises are horrible 15 cents and thats all"
bad,"not enough pay for all the work you have to do "
bad,I don't really have much to say other than this is the worst paying job I've had I don't know how it is now I've heard theirs new management so it's probably much better
bad,"The company overall is great. BUT at the store level it was not. "
bad,"poor upper management, detrimental lack of training for advancement, no respect from management, employees or customers, poor management of hours, shelves barely stocked due to lack of hours available"
bad,Will fire you for no apparent reason and then not let you know why you got fired Joliet DC. Very dirty place to work we treat you like you're in jail I would have never left my previous job to go there if I don't know it was like this do not recommend it for anybody always watching them walk people out the door because they're fired you don't even follow the rules
bad,Highly disappointed in this work place the need for respect and more sustainable hours and wages would make it a better place to work . The company itself needs to step into our shoes and realize we cannot work minimal hours and produce well balanced stores with his small time
bad,you do not receive decent hours and i would not recommend this jo to a family parent. there was really nothing to do when it was really slow and it is not full of challenges that i was looking for.
bad,"Worked as a cashier then promoted to closing manager , they want you to bust your ball sack for 10$ hr. Being a manager is just a glorified cashier with tasks to do at the end of the night the lazy employees during the day couldn't or wouldn't  do. Good first job. Advancement not worth it. They also never follow osha regulations"
bad,"This place is horrible to work for. There is no benefits for employees, or even managers unless you're the store manager. Theft is very prevalent, especially is poorer neighborhoods, so management tends to get bashed and it's not even their fault."
bad,"People don't do they job never show up for they shift ,Manager would get mad at the  hard workers because things Are not done  and  I only get 8h a week . That's 2 days and i am lucky to get 3 days ."
bad,"This company seeks only their benefit and cares not for its managers or its employees."
bad,"Management was very poor. When assigning employees tasks , tasks are not fully explained. Workers were lazy and give no assistance. No managerial assistance given when unloading stock trucks"
bad,"I have been an employee for 3 years, I have grown a lot as a worker I started working in the freezer which  liked and unloading the truck on delivery days. I Focus on the Food area so I usually Stock the food and drink, I was able to move up to cashier. I really enjoy my job, I enjoy people and the environment. I hope one day you'll give me the opportunity to step up higher in my position ,manager or if possible I can work at another store so I can work part time at both stores."
bad,"This is an awful place to work. they dont give very many hours per week and i had to find another job. very dirty place, rude customers. managers arent cooperative."
bad,"Manger would regularly cut hours,loved to call you on your off day. Work environment was usually chaotic and unorganized. Zero fun."
bad,"Store manager only hires people she knows. She is flexible with who she wants and when she wants."
bad,The only thing I love about this company is that the customers after friendly.Its a great store that carries alot of different items and they are all a dollar. I meet different people everyday and I like the fact that I can help some one put a smile on their face and mine.
bad,Dollar tree is the worst company I have ever worked for.The manager cuts hours all the time. There is no way a person can make a living working there unless they are full time. Everything in our store is an issue.
bad,"I have never worked for a more confused and mindless company in my life. Things are never finished or taken care of. Its a pass the buck place to work.  When you put in 100 % , the pay is not worth the headache you will acquire working for this place. I gave 1 stars cause I had to."
bad,"There was a lot of back stabbing. Also there was/is descrimimatiom.  Got asst. manager training."
bad,they put me on cashier and i told them i wasnt good with money but they put me on it anyways im only good at sorting and putting things up in a place where they belong
bad,"I've worked at Dollar Tree as an overnight stock clerk for only 2 months and I have to say that this company is terrible to work for. Unrealistic expectations like packing out 30 boxes an hour, managers that create toxic work environments for co-workers, and a disorganized back room where it's very hard to find what you're looking for. To summarize it all, I had a bad experience with this company, especially with the overnight manager, who bickers and whines about almost everything, which is one of the reasons why I left."
bad,Leadership only looks to see how much they can drain for you and others. Bigger problems with company only focusing on larger stores and not over all districts.
bad,"No job security or advancement opportunites.  Due to lack of payroll, they do not properly staff their stores to run the business.  They are always making payroll cuts and the store managers have to pick up the slack of an understaffed store.  Customers are always complaining about long lines at the registers and no one to help them on the sales floor.  There corporate procedures are extremely flawed and in return, each store suffers from over packed stockrooms and sparce sales floors.  Stores are dirty, pay is low, and associates are not committed due to the high stress level of being over worked and pay rates.  Associate and manager turnover is high."
bad,"too much work for little pay, the hours were terrible, they switched your hours without saying anything. I did customer service along with cashiering.  I would do inventory and stock."
bad,Dollar tree is a poor work environment as well as a poor shopping experience for it's customers. Unprofessional staff and managers thet are nowhere to be found at most times.
bad,The company does not make their employees feel valued. Managers are overworked and underpaid with significant turnover with the staff.
bad,"Poor management, manager was not organized and did not keep consistent schedules. I did not know from one day to the next when I was working again..."
bad,Company has over 35 employees with only 5-7 of them getting any hour per week. Management shows extreme favoritism to certain employees for hours.
bad,"A Typical day would have been cleaning and stocking, every now and then I would get customer's asking for help and I would assist them. I would also be on my guard for theft and report what I had saw to the manager's and cashier's. I learned while working for Dollar Tree is that I can be quick on my feet and I can work fast and get stuff done far before I had to leave the work place. Something I had to say about management was that I would have appreciated more training then just half a day considering it was my first job and I had at the time never operated a cash register before. My co-workers and I got along but we didn't work together to get the store objectives done. There were no difficulties in my job, so there was no hard part of it other then getting the management to properly train me and give me the time to learn something I never operated before. The most enjoyable part of working 4-12 hours a week was the customers that brought a smile to my face each and every day."
bad,Having never having a job before its a good place to start. The bad part is almost everything. Works times are put up at the last possible moment and they almost never look at requested days off or days available.
bad,"turn registers on, go to office, clock in, then count safe, then assign individual people that are scheduled for the day a till. ensure that deposit numbers match paperwork and the amount is correct. sign off for all moneys and then take the deposit to bank. Am given 30 minutes to complete and have store open. Have to check e-mails, do store walk for planning what to do. Write each cashier a daily action plan for their shift as well as them checking at the register. learned that no matter how someone works there is always more to do and the reality is that things happen and not everything can get done in the amount of time given. Also checked and rotated dated product. Loaded and offloaded freight everyday, including assigning freight to be processed by other associates.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all different personality types and getting along with the respectable associates. The hardest part was working with someone that had authority issues. This place just was not the right fit for me."
bad,"I really hate my job and Ive hated it for a long time."
bad,"very slow work day, not given enough hours, no advancement, today it rained all day, literally from around seven this morning and still raining now"
bad,"I enjoyed the employees that i had working at the store.Over all I did not have room to grow with the company, Hardest part of the job well there wasnt anything really besides not growing with them."
bad,"Managers are very rude to employees and customers. There is no since of organization or protocol. Its a very stressful environment, because you'll probably be doing 30 things at once due to poor management."
bad,"All shifts are only 4.5 hours. Enjoyed the customers, and co-workers."
bad,"Ridiculous production quota that sacrifices quality and safety for the sake of profit. This results in employees acting dishonestly in order to meet their quota-such as scanning pallets of merchandise from one location to another and back again without ever having moved it. This adds to your daily move total, which is how we're graded. Since we're constantly rushed, pallets often fall off the racks and spill on the floor. A few times a week an employee is tasked with ""fixing"" pallets that are haphazardly put away. This company pays someone to go back and work on the same pallet twice, as opposed to slowing down and having it done right the first time. "
bad,"The main reason Dollar Tree wasn't the greatest place I've worked is because she could only pay me $10.25. which compared to minimum wage in Alberta right now is decent, but to be living on your own its not such a great salary to be getting."
bad,"Dollar Tree is the worst store I have ever worked for in my life!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Working at Dollar Tree Stores for the most part is great for the young and collage age, however the quality of life and advancement is difficult. Working as a cashier is fun , you get to meet all sorts of people ,learn how to handle money in a better fashion. "
bad,"I worked at the Dollar Tree when I began college.  It was a very easy job, not a whole lot of hours. I did get along with my co-workers. I did not have a fun boss. Very uptight guy...and rude. He changed the schedule more than once so you would have to almost call everyday just to get your schedule. I wasn't there that long..maybe 2-3 months. If you need extra pocket cash...I'd recommend it."
bad,"Does not care about it's associates...only their profits. Overwork and expect way too much out of their store managers. Not a good company to work for at all. Will tell you you can make bonuses, but then changes the criteria to get them paid out to you. A very GREEDY company!"
bad,"The management at Dollar Tree in Deridder, La was unorganized at the least. They played favorites with employees and did what they could to make the job hard."
bad,Cashiering  was what I did for a few weeks. I was trying to learn the register. Management was to quit to leave me on my own. Didn't really know my co-workers yet. I was left without all my training done by myself. Working to make our customers happy.
bad,not enough compensation and work expectations are way to high..some mgrs are way to young and havent had enough experience.
bad,"Once I clock in, I go straight to work because I know I have a hand full of things to do in just a little time. My Co worker or helpful sometimes. The hardest part of the job is working 20 things at once and trying to complete everything in 4hrs, but never able to get to the 6th thing on the list because I'm interrupted by employees, customer, other projects. The most enjoyable part of working is team work."
bad,"A typical day starts with opening the store making sure the store is clean, stocked, and cashiers are ready to give excellent customer service."
bad,long hours with little pay. no full time work available. good deeds go unnoticed. feel very much like a number in a computer
bad,Low pay and no hours. If your on management you have to work on your lunch and break. But yet they do not give you 40 hrs. Even if your full-time.
bad,"Used to be an awesome store manager job BUT they changed upper management"
bad,I've worked hard and was never praised for anything good. Worked in the summer with no a.c. while I was pregnant. Management is very two faced.
bad,The District managers don't do their job.. They don't hire enough management staff and are always pulling from staffed stores causing those stores to fail.The Dm's also team together to cover each other so they don't get caught  not doing their job.
bad,"No bonus, compensations, no real idea of how to hire nor promote. enjoyable paycheck while it last. Hardest part of the job is keeping your job. Corporate screws you every chance they get. Management sucks: Assistant Managers make close to minimum wage. Have to perform your job as if you were 4 people."
bad,"I didn't like working there, the managers controlled everything and if you screwed up at all they would file a report against you."
bad,"The management of this particular store, was horrendous. I had to write a letter to the corporate office after being hired on Oct 22nd, 2012, due to the manager not giving me any hours...I finally was able to begin actual work, on November 5, only after writing to the corporate office. Then was let go, before others, which were hired after me, due to him telling others that he did not like me, because I had written to his superiors."
bad,"Dollar Tree is a part time job. the company has a lot of turn overs, cashiers don't get over 20 or 25 hours for a working shift. I do appreciate my job and work it with great consideration but advancement is not an option."
bad,it was a dollar store for sakes there wasn't really anything special about working there.
bad,Worked for Dollar Tree for 9 years. Did a excellent job. Terminated because someone else wanted my job.
bad,wouldnt ever do a temp job for tht company people who workec hard didnt get hired on lazy people who did nothing got hired on
bad,"The District Management team ( with maybe one exception) is completely unethical and do what ever it takes to destroy peoples lives and careers. They do not care about getting rid of bad associates or people who are stealing, they only care about their own agenda. Almost all the dm's in this area have never managed a dollar tree, so they really haven't a clue to what it really takes and you will almost never see any of them pick up a finger to help."
bad,"This Company discriminated against me on the basis of medical accomodation. I did not quit they FORCED ME OUT, by not scheduling me for any hours. I will NEVER shop there again. I would rather pay a higher price at Walgreens or Walmart."
bad,"Was not that great of a company to work out. Very unorganized and sloppy,poor management,and I was working there on an internship."
bad,"For an professional in retail is definitely the last choice,the company make you work 7 days a week most of the time and 12 to 14 hours a day."
bad,Management are completly rude not understanding at all. Checks didnt come in twice in a row didnt get paid for about a month. Overall not bad work but the management made it un bareable
bad,there are not enough hours in the company to give out to people some people have 8 hours some people have 10 some people have 25 it's never the same management bullies other people. Not team players if you're not in the circle with management then you get treated different
bad,I was paid minimum wage and they were understaffed so I did twice the work. It is really only good as a first job or something temporary until something better comes along.
bad,"You do not want to work at dollar tree it does not pay well, it only pays 7.25 hr and hours get cut after the holidays you never work a eight hour shift"
bad,Management and workers were rude and gossipy. I was never properly trained and was constantly being criticized for things they didn't teach me. Worst place I ever worked!
bad,"Prepare to work long hours to try and keep your store operating. They give you no hours to complete day to day operations so those must come from the salary Manager. No work to life balance, your family is not a concern. Poor store support from the regional level. The DM’s are supportive but stretched thin to put out the fires that happen everyday. High turnover!"
bad,Just don’t pay enough or give enough hours then got upset when I went and found another job like I could survive on 12 hours a week like that’s wrong you want people stay give them hours and more pay
bad,As an ASM there were alot of other task that were not apart of the job such as driving across town to multiple dollar tree to furnish the store with bags or come out of my own pocket to do so as well. Also was told to carry a taser due the bad neighborhood and then asked upper management for security  or L.P & were told no. Background check are not performed on cashier which = short staff
bad,"pay is too low, high expectations, manager is rude, unsafe area, no security, arent enough hours, training is poor, no communication, employees work hard,"
bad,Gender bias and poor management. The rules made it impossible for anyone to keep out of trouble. You can get written up for customers not knowing what they want and deciding to take off one item on a 50 dollar transaction. Coworkers were fine though but there was definitely favoritism.
bad,Doesn't run the store correctly. Tests people with hate and harsh words. Uses profanity and curse employees out. If I don't leave this job I would stress myself out
bad,Nasty they have rats thats really big the mods make u sick in there they make u send out old food out of date its just not no clean place they hold your breaks the supervisors stay high and dont kno how to run anything you work all the over time but your check be short its just a nasty place dont come there clean because when u leave u be dirty its very unsanitary get bit by anything they just nasty there they need to shut it down
bad,"The pay rate is terrible. Fast food pays more and offers better benefits. The bathroom at my store is DISGUSTING, so much so that I hold it for hours until I get off. Management passes their jobs off to the employees. The ""break room"" which is actually a table, is always so cluttered with miscellaneous junk you cant even sit to eat. Not that we can eat in the 10 minute break we get. The garbage can that is right next to the table to eat at is so nasty flies are everywhere. It's often overflowing with trash."
bad,This job wasnt really worth the pay. You get paid $7.25 an hour and you only can work up to 30 hours a week. You work your butt of for no pay. It's not worth the stress. Management on get $8.50 an hour and not aloud to work over 40 hours. This job is stressful and unfair
bad,Dollar tree  doesn't care about its employees and the management there think they are better than the actual associates when the associates know more than management.
bad,"I wouldn’t pick this job as place to settle down and work here long term, management and cashiers were very unorganized and has no teamwork. this one cashier thing needs to be fixed because it’s stressful to have poor Assistant mangers that don’t even wanna help you with the customers."
bad,"Advancing at Dollar tree is truly ""who you know "" and who they like, but beware, they will pretend to like you to use you. Be prepared to be lied to. Above all, GET IT IN WRITING. Write down WHAT was said, when it was said and who said it. Always be on the lookout for a knife in your back. Don't trust a district manager or even a regional manager. And NEVER go to HR. They are company"
bad,This was not a fullfilling position . There was not upper management structure or support. Long hours and very little home and family time. Minimum  budgeted hours to hire and cover shifts. Retaining  staff was difficult  with limited hours and low pay rate
bad,The managers are mean and the job is very stressful. It is very hot and the work is very stressful on the body. I would not recommend this place for employment. A 1 out of 5 in my book.
bad,"It was a great learning exprience, but not much security in the workplace with it being in and bad neighborhood! However I  loved that I had regular customers that would ask for me by name just to have a conversation or to say hello!"
bad,"The store is filthy. The manager mocks staff and continuously makes snide comments about customers, (sometimes within earshot) and has no place working in customer service. He is unkempt, needs grooming skills, and has no business managing employees."
bad,"Poor management and not enough hours to survive on. However, did recieve good discounts. And, I did enjoy helping the customers, even though management was terrible."
bad,"DONT work here , was wrongfully terminated because of their switching of schedules , lies and lack of communication. I was told not to come in on days , scheduled to work 5 hours but worked 12 hours , told to work off the clock and even called a liar ! I would not recommend this job to anyone stay clear ."
bad,"The job there was not at all like a company that I have every worked at. The manager was never on time and quit without having a replacement. The district manager was rude, not friendly, intimidating, and did not respect the people that he had working for him."
bad,"Its hard to explain everything this company does to their employees to cut costs. down to every detail. Possibly even skimming payroll. Limited to 20 hrs, all employees are part-time."
bad,"So stressful,confusing,need hours,it's just poorly, Dont know When I'm Working unleast they call me and what if I'm doing something..On my feet all day, Ww dont have many workers it's like 2 of us at a store, it's dangerous no security."
bad,They over work and under pay. With the salary position you are expected to do everything yourself except during busy season. The higher management didn’t really help with issues they brush you off and the district manager will tell you to figure it out. The worst work experience ever
bad,Was very happy to have left Dollar Tree. I was assisting with assistant manager work and just overall doing a lot of work there for only $8. Environment was hostile and very unenjoyable.
bad,horrible and you know it’s true the manager is rude nobody helps when you call lol then the manager is taking her sweet time while you have four customers waiting which the minimum is (4) but okay. also didn’t get paid enough. Customers are nicer than the manager.
bad,"This place was very unsafe to work in. I was always scared for my life because no one follow any of the safety guidelines. I would always see forklift drivers come out of corners at a really high speed. There was an accident where an employee lost his foot, he was driving too fast and saw another forklift coming and he tried to get off his stand up forklift and his foot got caught between the racks."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend this environment to anyone. Toxic and no values at the organization other that driving the bottom line at all cost. Just ask about the turnover!
bad,Absolutely worst. Upper management (Dm) was completely awful and extremely rude. no praise when you work your *** off. No benefits for full time employees. work 47 hrs a week and paid for 43. If cover a shift Dm tells you to clock out and work off the clock so they don’t pay you over time hours.
bad,"n/a. was not a joyful place to work."
bad,Young untrained management. They insult and humiliate the employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn to ignore retaliation. The best part of the job was knowing the next day you are off.
bad,"Dollar Tree is the worst company anyone could work for. As a Store Manager, you have to cut everyone's hours and then pick those hours up yourself. It is probably the closest thing to slave labor that anyone could imagine."
bad,Terrible place to work. Terrible pay and terrible hours. Highly reccomend you dont apply there. Waste of time and energy. Company is totally and completely corrupt.
bad,Upper management is a joke..district manager and above have no understanding about the use of payroll and separating them from front end and stock crew
bad,"I did order selection, and during training you cut you some slack. Though the keep harping for you to work faster and faster not giving any regards that you are a person not a machine. The place is not climate/temperature controlled and some items stored there definitely should be in a temperature controlled environment because it gets pretty hot in there."
bad,The Manager lied about everything wouldn't give no hours and kept hiring people and giving less hours. She pretended that she was gone give raises after the truck was done no one never got raises also she wasn't going to choose asst  Manager till after the truck and that was a lied she hired Manager and they never had nothing to do with the truck
bad,"I have never worked for any other company that treated a new employee so horribly. On my 1st night my manager left me to run and close the store without any training. I was responsible for closing the registers, balancing the safe, preparing deposit on my 1st night without training or supervision. My manager told me his general mngr called him to another store. UNBELIEVABLE"
bad,Dollar Tree was an okay job but the management always brought their personal problems to the work place instead of leaving it at home causing conflicts.
bad,"There is no AC at this location, the cashiers literally had to share one little fan ( in the entire store ) that was passed around every register like clockwork. We literally had to take turns using it."
bad,For one thing no one gets 40 hours a week generally get 34 to 37 hours per week. Constant schedule changes makes it hard to get freight out on time.people constantly calling off for work .its a poorly run company.
bad,"Such a bad place to work when you want to be recognized and appreciated for your hard work. Nothing you do is good enough, management will always find a way to discourage you. You always work with another person(manager), but you are the only one doing actual work while they sit in an office. Typical day is going in, and stock, stock, stock the already overflowing shelves. If you give a suggestion on how to make something easier, you are laughed at. Dont think you will be able to have a paycheck they schedule you 3 days a week when youre told you will be close to full time and you receive a lousy 12 hours a week! At less than minimum wage! Horrible. I dont reccommend dollar tree at all and its sad because you can get alot of great things there and now I wont even shop there because i was treated so bad and embarrassed. What a shame."
bad,"Dollar Tree lowers you in with the “good” pay and insurance they offer. They also fail to mention that you will constantly be harassed by management and talked down to like you’re worthless while there’s nothing you can do about it. Not all of management but the important part of management. They pay, is okay.. but for the work they slay you to do on Mods, Receiving and shipping... is all a huge joke. Who knows maybe it was just my location..."
bad,Dollar tree does NOT follow its own policies. Upper management only listens to the GM even when the gm has no integrity. They dont care about the employees. The people you are supposed to be able to go to for help dont care and there is no confidentiality. Corporate lets the gm and dm know before talking to employee about employees complaint or concerns about gm or dm.
bad,"The Manager quit, next in line took over. It was a mess with employees talking and cussing in the ailes on there phones. Schedules were not made out in a timely fashion, sometimes was ask me before you leave today. Broken product in backroom and no one claim responsibly for the mess."
bad,"Terrible, make it your LAST RESORT. great start for the younger generation, it will definitely teach them what they DON’T want to work for. Although I must admit it depends on the head manager, my current one sucks the life out of the store."
bad,"The shelves were so gross and filthy,  noone ever cleaned them. Customers would leave trash everywhere. Alot of theft and they take products out of the box and leave empty boxes on shelves.  Just a very gross place to work"
bad,"I worked as a cashier and I loved it. However, you’re given a list to complete during your shift; Some examples include cleaning windows, stocking your station, putting back items and speaking on the telecom. The manager was nice at first but as I came to the end of my first week on the job, She Gave me something I never did before and I asked her how to do it and her response was “It needs to be finished before the end of your shift” Also if you work cashier  and went over your voids (you’re allowed 10) you get wrote up. If you take a break less than 10 minutes, you get wrote up. The pay is not worth being put through poor management and rude customers. Your hours are very low too.  I wouldn’t recommend this dollar tree location at ALL."
bad,"As a cashier/stocker I was amazed at how disorganized these people are. The associates that had been there for a while seemed to think everything was normal. At $7.35 an hour I at least expected a pleasant place to work, This was not. I will never return and I suspect Family Dollar is the same way."
bad,Not enough hours and needs a better work environment. Would like to see a more family friendly culture at Dollar Tree.  Also Lunch breaks should be longer .
bad,"Manager often asked the employees to work off the clock. 👍 Corporate expected way too much   from us to be doing but wouldn't give us enough hours in which to do it. And when we'd explain that we were too busy with customers to be able to do all the other things, we were told that wasn't an excuse. I hated working there but I did for nearly a year and a half and got a 15¢ raise to show for it."
bad,"I'm disliked working for this company, because they don't treat their employees well and the pay sucks. In NYC the below management turnover rate of store associates is constant, The company don't retain many hardworking  employees on purpose.They have plenty of work and earns billions of dollar per year but rather limit employees abilities to succeed at their jobs.. Corporate management expects highly of store managers and associates but won't afford them enough payroll to meet their cost of living. "
bad,"Store managers are paid for 40 hrs, but work 47.5 + hrs weekly. It is no surprise to work 100 hours per week and have payroll hours cut for store team to bare minimum. Impossible to make sales goals when not allocated enough help to stock store product, and have enough employees to run the from registers. Managers are running registers instead of managing the store. No support from higher management, and company to address problems."
bad,You work hard everyday for very little pay.  This is a second job for me and I still am barely making my bills on time.  For as much as hard as you work the pay should be more.  I am constantly sweating at that job.  They do work with my schedule for my other job.  If I could find another place that will I will leave dollar tree.  To me if they are paying that little then they don't respect the employees they have when minimum wage has gone up in so many companies.  The turnover there is quick.  Working so hard for little money people find other jobs and quit dollar tree.  However if you are a felon or drug user or for any reason don't want a background check or drug test you will get hired and I assume will stay for such little pay. It really isn't fair.
bad,I currently work here and the job is terrible the manager treat you like slaves and the lunch hours are terrible and so off just don’t understand how I last 5 weeks working here
bad,"I love working here and I worked here for 3 years but the new manager there lies a lot and you don't get a lot of hours and only advancement you get is if you're friends with the manager. I took a week off to go into the hospital and came back and they had to put me back into the system and she did it wrong and I didn't get paid for 2 months and was denied to make any Christmas money until they got it fixed. I ended up finding the trouble , they put my birthday in wrong. I had to call the labor board to get my money and then they offered me my job back and I decided to go back because I liked working there overall only to get told they can't rehire me. They have no overall concern on how to treat good people which leads them to have a revolving door of bad employees."
bad,This is not the right place to work if you have responsibilities. Dollar Tree does not Recognize employees who have work for them for years. Every manager and employee gets paid the same raise in October. With working at this company it is production work and which every is paid unfairly. The company rather pay a person coming into the company more money then they would promoting a person. Some money is better then none put this is just a little extra gas money job.
bad,Dollar tree pays very bad and they do not take care of their employees or offer any kind of benefits .. this company is more about having fun then doing a job right . They do not clean ever so they have rats and will not call an exterminator.. they shelves are never stocked because they play around and laugh and don't do their work or they are out smoking.. or you just can't find them.. and a pay raise after a year you get $0.07 .. not cool... Bad bus.
bad,I quit this job because they didn’t give any hours and when they did they would give your hours to someone else when I first started I was getting really good hours then we had got a new manager and it went all down hill from there
bad,Where I worked at is was dirty and not because of us because we all would take the entire shift to clean just one aisle and in 5 minutes somebody would come and mess it up.  There built another one closer to me and it’s cleaner it’s depends on the location but there is never enough people to get everything done and people called out and clocked in whenever they felt like it
bad,Horrible place to work at.. the only nice thing about my experience was that the people I worked with were very nice. Management was poor and the pay and hours are a complete disaster. There's no room for growth as management picks favorites. Minimum wage.
bad,"Pay your hardest working employees , insert your authority make others accountable for not doing the work they are signed to do ,, learn to value good employees like me otherwise your company will surely suffer"
bad,The lack of knowledge the GM and the AGM has is sad. You have an over worked staff working with a merge that is falling apart its just duct taped together the equipment is dangerous and not well taken care of. Management doesnt care its just about the cartons push it out no matter what.
bad,"The pay along with very little hours was absolutely unlivable. The management was poor and never held employees responsible. Stressful environment because many customers were very mean. Too little employees led to me being overworked, trying to run back and forth from the cash register and down the aisles to clean was very unprofessional."
bad,Management is horrible they accused you of everything even if u didn't do nothing they let the store get destroyed and let people steal Don't treat they customers  with respect always yelling or getting attitude's
bad,"Dollar Tree do not care about the employees, I got fired after 2 years, after helping to build the store (inside, literally). Because a customer with a nasty attitude (trust me I've had to deal with a lot of that) decided to lie on me, and I said to the manager that it wasn't true. Apparently I was just supposed to let her lie on me right in front me and not say anything. Working for $8.35, short staffed because they don't want to give anybody full time pay and benefits. And they want you to work your butt off. If I had a choice at the time I would have left way before 2 years. Every one of the original employees had quit or got fired because they were fed up, way before I left."
bad,you work hard low pay and low hours and no one works together and have joy in the work place they have policy that they don;t follow and you cant work ther and that job only you will be homeless
bad,This job was mindless and the pay was terrible. You have got to be kidding me.   I worked here YEARS ago I don't know what its like now!!!!! Then it was a nowhere job.
bad,"I learned a lot of valuable lessons, mostly about how to deal with coworkers and not take things to personally. I really care about my job but to keep it you have to know when to speak up and when to be quiet and just do the job with a smile and let things go. The pay was minimum wage with no raises, and the responsibilities required were unrealistic the way it was implemented.  I have worked at other stores and it was much better.  I unfortunately did not have good managers at that store.  They were actually related which is against company policy, but it just goes to show the lack of concern that management had for the store.  The hardest part was dealing with some members of management when they weren't outside smoking cigarettes or talking on the phone on the clock.  The most enjoyable part was getting to know the customers and build relationships with people and other employers in the area."
bad,"Always busy , costumers mean attitude for no reaosn no patience from people . Always rushing you , if it’s busy the managers don’t give you breaks unless you speak up ... , some managers are lazy and forgetfull"
bad,"Manager was great but higher ups and some employees were inconsiderate, rude, lazy, and pushed their entire workload off on the very few that worked hard. The ones that did the most work and gave their best were denied advancement opportunities yet expected to still do more than others. My manager did try to help in the advancement area but was ignored about what was felt would work best for this store."
bad,Dollar Tree only hires for part time and minimum wage. The work is easy but will never pay well enough to get by. This would be a great part time job for a teen.
bad,"I dislike that I was rushed and written off as not understanding the job when I just needed more practice as well as focus when that wasn't a luxury, also disliked being called into work on off days."
bad,"Understaffed, stressful environment, it is very easy to advance because the turn over rate is so high. Replenishment system is horrible so trucks that come every week are often things you dont need that have to sit in the back room until there is room on the sales floor. The pay for part time employees is laughable for the things that have to be done. Unloading trucks for minimum wage when a row of boxes could come tumbling onto your head is not okay and also leads to high turnover. Dollar tree is more focused on making a dollar than the health, safety, and sanity of its employees...especially store managers"
bad,Working with Dollar Tree was stressful because management expects employees to run the store with 2-3 persons in the store per shift.  Stores are very busy at times and it makes it difficult to stock the store as well as run the store. Put in many hours but one is not allowed to do overtime which makes the store lacking merchandise on the floor. There is no room for advancement even after your doing the job for months temporary without the pay.
bad,No one wants to show up when scheduled. The managers never make sure there's enough employees to cover all shifts for the day. The store is completely unorganized. I would not go back nor would I recommend it to anyone. The pay doesnt even cover my electric bill.
bad,not a good place to work at all... too much heavy lifting for women.. no room for growth..Pay is not good for all the work you have to do.its so hot and humid in there. and you don't get treated fair.
bad,Overall atmosphere of this company is playing the blame game when it comes to being responsible for certain things. Job is entirely too demanding for the pay that they provide.
bad,"If you are looking for a 10 hour a week job at minimum wage, with a high workload, this is the place for you. Otherwise, keep looking."
bad,"The management was a joke. Easy job for minimum wage pay. No hours available to work unless your best friends or in the clique with management. I was 20+ years older than my manager and I'm only 39! They gossip like school children, drama, and cry babies. Go back to school and get an education! HORRIBLE JOB FOR AN ADULT, would make a great 1st job for high schooler, because as a cashier, thats all you get to do. Stand there, ring up sales, and talk to customers. For me, thr customers were the best part of the job."
bad,"Manager did not care about the store over all, out dated food items she didn’t care about. Extremely lazy and unproductive. She showed favoritism towards those she liked and talked about those she didn’t. And the district manager allows it."
bad,"Long time employee of 8 consecutive years. Worked my way up from a cashier to a store manager. In the first few years the company was run well. Shortly after my promotions, upper management for our region was changed and the company underwent a drastic loss of multiple management positions due to the employees leaving their positions. With less managers, remaining managers were spread thin, being forced to operate other locations while their actual home location suffered lacking their presence. Salary position, be ready to be used and abused. Any extra hours are not paid for, no overtime. Poor communication between upper management and warehouse company resulting in months of delivery date changes at the last minute. Very restrictive of payroll, even in times of need. DO NOT work here for management. I suggest this job if you are seeking perhaps just a cashiering or stocking job. Even then you will witness the tumultuousness that is this company."
bad,"It was crazy when I first started working there. Management was non-existent. When management was stabilized and fixed, there was a great deal of miscommunication between the higher up and the store.  There were a lot of unrealistic expectations set for the store and the employees. Rarely was there any ""rewards"" for exceeding and rarely was there any promotion within the store (it always came from outside stores and even states). There was very little training given to employees. It was the bare minimum."
bad,"I was a store manager, in my opinion they do not pay enough to work as many hours as I did. I was salary paid and on average I worked more than 60+ hours a week. They do not compensate for hours worked over 40 hours. I did not have a work/life balance. I did not spend enough time at home with my family due to me always being stuck at work. They do not have enough help when it comes to working in the store. I was a store manager and pretty much HAD TO unload trucks, due to no help. That was not part of my job description. Also, they only have ONE manager and ONE employee working 90% of the time unless it is holiday time. They do not allow enough hours to work/run a store so we were always short handed. I could not take my paid vacation days when I wanted to because everything always had to change in scheduling due to lack of employees and help. They also do not pay for holidays. The only paid holiday they allow is Christmas Eve and New Years eve. I also do not agree that they are open on ALL holidays except for Christmas Day. They deliver too much freight to the stores and expect  the freight to be out on the shelves and stocked without allowing the stores enough hours to properly do the job. So it resulted in always being stressed and not being able to complete jobs within a timely manner."
bad,Your taught by other new cashiers that can very easliy lead you down the wrong path. Management is too busy to get to know the employees and with the turnover rates they don't even try.
bad,"District Manager was exceptionally aggressive and drove away all but two managers within her district. These were accomplished managers who left over frustration from no clear direction. This DM is no longer with the company so, perhaps, the culture has changed in this region."
bad,The job I do they do not give u room to grow you are their robot. U cant leave before a certain time u dont make your own schedules they are like hawks
bad,"I enjoyed the busy, quick pace of Dollar Tree. The fun of merchandising new items every week. There was no support from the upper management and many time they  pulled hourly managers from the store to work other places with no warning, causing the salaried GM to pick up the extra hours. Expectations were different from one store to the other, as were management schedules. "
bad,"The location I worked at was terrible. It's great for someone temporarily, the store itself is amazing but the management, hours and pay is/was trash."
bad,I have nothing positive to say about dollar tree. I was over worked and underpaid. Never got a raise. And I could never afford the cost of living working for this establishment.
bad,i would have to say that this is the worst place i have worked at. not only was the management horrible they all had mice or rats all infested in the stores
bad,The management is horrible. They are more concerned with the bonus going in their pockets than their employees! Very unreasonable when it comes to working times and schedules. Don't work here!!
bad,A typical day was a headache everybody complaining being rude in front of the customers store never really stocked everybody want hours but not wanting to put the work in never working as a team management sucked the only thing i enjoyed was the fact the customers was always nice to me and the fact that everything was dollar.
bad,"I'm not going to lie, working here was miserable. As a manager of the company, I was working very hard every day to try to get my store clean and stocked. The customers at my location were very rude, and very messy. "
bad,"Its really hard for me to give this job a great review. I personally didn't have a good experience work with this company, but that doesn't mean its not different for some else."
bad,Not a good place to work.Low wages.  Undesirable shift.  Management is overworked. Parking lot is dark and needs additional lighting.  Not enough cashiers.
bad,"I have had a very poor experience working at Dollar Tree. After an initial training period of 2 weeks at a store close to my home they moved me to a much busier store 5 miles further away. This store's store manager had recently left for medical reasons. That left the other 3 assistant store managers and myself now trying to run the store with shoestrings. The expectations on us from the district and regional managers are quite frankly unrealistic. They allocate us barely enough hours to keep the store running at all but not nearly enough to run it well. This is one of the busiest Dollar Trees in the country and there are some days where we can have only 3 cashiers total spread throughout the day. How then can we assistant managers get the load of boxes that we are expected to get stocked each shift done when we are serving as a backup cashier all day? We never have enough hours for the night crew to get all of their stocking done so customers are constantly complaining and blaming us for the shelves being empty. We were never trained in many basic procedures which frequently gets our store in trouble. Now after 5 months of not having a store manager ours has returned (though not fully recovered from her medical issues) and things have become even worse. Now that she is making the schedule again she frequently ignores the schedule constraints that many of us have, causing all kinds of arguments and hostility. Almost half the store is looking for other work. I could go on but overall this is a cheap, uncaring company. Don't work here if you can help it."
bad,I would never refer anyone here. They are the worst to work for. I have had no success with having any formal complaint resolved. The hierarchy is all screwed up.
bad,"The atmosphere is good customers are good. store is clean....Don't need as many people as we have, which makes it hard for people that have bills to pay to get the hours needed..."
bad,"Typical work day at least were I was placed. Sign in and attempt to stock shelves as customers need to be rung out, same with unloading trucks. Very few times the correct amount of staff on duty."
bad,Management makes up any role they want to expects dissociative abide by The pay is horrible and they expect more out of you for less payThey hire managers that have no idea what they’re doing
bad,"Cash out customers, put up stock. Learned to be patient with  the "
bad,"If you want no life, no vacations, then this is the job for you. They promote those that do not work rather than those that actually sacrifice. The ASM has better benefits and more time off than the store manager, and yet the store manager has to do all the work"
bad,"Not much to say except this has been the lowest paying job I had ever taken since but I had no other choice. The people are great to work with but the stores condition within is terrible. Manager is cool but needs extra help. I was hired under the impression I was going to be a night crew manager but I would need to go thru training. Since day 1 the only thing I had done was unload truck , stock , and wash the restrooms. Now my hours reduced from 16 hours a week to 5 hours a week. No benefits or better pay until you become a full time employee."
bad,"Make sure you tell them your availability, because they will schedule what they want you to work. The managers play favorites on the job, they give more hours to people who they like, and the ones basically that really don't work as hard as they should. Give students more hours than the ones that have families to take care of, which I think is unfair.  And its bi- weekly pay with no benefits."
bad,Culture needs improvement; Management needs overhaul;Staff needs better treatment;Facility needs cleaning;Better pay for staff; More qualified upper management
bad,It depends it’s a hit or miss it’s every man for themselves at dollar tree  unfortunately but fortunately it is run by a good GM  it could be definitely a more pleasant experience.  Management is usually fired from embezzling and theft which is very disappointing and sad that management would stoop that low.
bad,"Nice starter job for students, elderly, or someone just started out in the city. Only time the job gets busy will be around major holidays especially Christmas."
bad,"Back rooms are packed full, dangerous to work in, company has past fines with osha for multiple violations. Not worth the stress.  So much micro managing going on and it prevents you from doing your job!"
bad,"I was extremely excited to join the Company at first, but now I clearly see how important it is to read the reviews for the jobs posted. Dollar Tree is a stressful job with little to no life balance."
bad,This a job for teenagers or someone desperate enough to accept mandatory P/T of 25 hrs or less on minimum wages. The excruciating pain from standing on the concrete scanning one dollar item at a time. Their corporate office could care less about the safety of it's employees. This was one of the worst places to be employed. Everything I learned came by way of the customers.
bad,"When I started this job, the store wasn't open yet, we put the shelves hooks and everything else that was needed to ge the store up an running. I stocked the shelves when they needed it"
bad,"For me personally I'm greatful for having a job , but this is not the type of work I see myself doing as a career. In looking for a company I am able to grow with and eventually call home and Dollar Tree isn t that for me."
bad,Not my favorite employment. I would only suggest this place as a last resort or as a second job. Management did the best they could but the job itself still was not worth it.
bad,When i worked at the dollar tree everyone only got 10 hours unless you got called in. Everytime i got a call i came in and never got any appriciation for it. Now that i no longer work there people are rude to me and wont even speak to me. Wouln't recommend working there. And also you dont make that much.
bad,"A typical 5 hour shift consists of standing in the same spot all day, ringing customers and being yelled at by both customers and management. I have learned how to deal with customer service and stressful jobs and situations. The hardest part of the day is the low pay and minimal appreciation. The most enjoyable is being able to work with great people and being able to serve the appreciative customers and socialize with customers throughout the day."
bad,I loved to work there at first then came the empty promises and lack of hours all the while hiring new people weekly. For the most part if they did what they said they would do they would have had an awesome asset to there company.
bad,Found out how they value their employees the hard way....left feeling very unappreciated and cared for....they do not treat management or other employees with respect and aren't very caring either. They ask a lot of their employees and give little reward or recognition for their hard work. Over worked and undercompensated... not a good place to make a career!
bad,I worked there as a seasonal temporary cashier. It wasnt  a bad place to work but they did not treat the employees the same. They did not care if you were sick. Breaks were short if we even received one.
bad,They're hired fast because no body stays 2 month or may be less.  The payment is cheap for all you have to do. When they promote for assistance manager they give you a dollar that's 9 dollars per hour.  In any a lot of store you start at 9 being cashier or cleaning.   They always short of employees cause this.  The only benefits is when you're a full time manager your get a monthly bonus for the sales but if the sales not don't pass you don't get it.
bad,"Its a Cut Throat place to work. The rules there make it so you can't have a sense of humor or any kind of an easy personality."
bad,"a typical day of work was driving to a dollar store at 2am to work til 8. "
bad,I wouldn't recommend no one to work there my boss was very disrespectful that place was very stressful they didn't respect no of there employees very disrespectful
bad,"Dollar Tree was not a great place to work. The managers got all of the hours and did not give the other employees a chance to work more often. There was a lack of communication between the management and the rest of the employees. There was no sort of expectation when working so there was not any structure provided. However, it was a good experience to understand what not to do at a job. It helped me realize how much more potential I have."
bad,"Dollar Tree is always busy, itsl the dollar store. Maybe if i were in another part of the city, it would have been a better experience. But it's alot stealing."
bad,"This is by far the worst place I've ever worked. Maybe, if the store had different managers, I'd have had a better experience, but the manager that was there awful. She didn't seem to care for anyone but herself, and didn't act like she knew what to do."
bad,"Dollar Tree is understaffed and could use better upper management, district mangers, and a safer cash policy. The stores are unorganized, bathrooms are nasty, and floors need mopped."
bad,Management was very disrespectful and had no regard for associates. Very unprofessional staff. No team work as management couldn't get along without bringing personal life to work.
bad,Worse Work Experience Anyone Ever Can Indure. It Was So Unprofessional And UnOrganized. Never Had A Real Manager/Supervisor. Was Always Left Alone And Always Need Help
bad,"not enough help, not enough hours, not a safe work environment , people stealing all day everyday, no appreciation for all the hard work that is done and the hours that are put in."
bad,"They do not show fairness to employees. Way too much favoritism inside the company. Company doesn't give raises or advancement opportunity's to employees, only to management. Doesn't provide any form of job security."
bad,"Antiquated systems and communications...For a company who wants to grow so quickly, administratively they are in infancy and management tends to have ""old school"" views and opinions."
bad,They are always cutting your hours. Then they call you expecting you to jump threw hoops for them. I started adult sitting when I left there. The district manager had a very bad attitude toward her employees.
bad,If you like greeting and helping customers.  Stocking and cashiering then Dollar tree is your place. They do have possible opportunities to move up in company.
bad,"Low pay, rude management, no incentives to do the job well. Some friendly/fun coworkers. Very little organization. Very high turnover rates.No one ever orders shipments correctly; always have too much of what we don't need on the shelves and too little of items that sell out fast, which makes for frustrated costumers. Would rather have you take a way longer break than you were supposed to, than have you clock in a couple minutes to get back to work so they can pinch every dollar."
bad,"Dollar Tree Inc is a great company to work for if you are looking for a starter job, but they give their employees no fair opportunities to advance further up the company ladder."
bad,"Everyone was amazing. The hours just sucked, and there's not much room to grow. Customers are beyond rude and try to argue prices,  when everything is a dollar."
bad,"This is a company that has very loose ethics, and the management at store level is very poor, and also short breaks 10 minutes, which I'm not sure how legally in the state of Massachusetts they get away with it."
bad,Managers are very childish and inconsedrate at the north las vegas location on simmons and lake mead. I got my hours cut because I decided not to go in on my day off because my family was in town who I haven't seen in 4 years. So I quit. Went back to my last job making more doing less and at least 35 hrs a week.
bad,"I liked this job starting out but then it got ridiculous, hours got cut and its a constant struggle to provide for a family. a typical day at work includes coming in clocking in then either doing recovery or being a cashier wherever they put you. Ive learned how to better deal with people. Some of the management is alright and some could do a better job."
bad,"A very dirty, disorganized store. "
bad,"Need more people at dollar tree with more people skills,also need to work as a team witch they are lacking,should look forward to go into work not looking forward to going to work,"
bad,"I did not like working here. The environment was always dirty, management wasn't friendly, rude customers. Alot of the time I was doing alot of nothing and the work attire was uncomfortable."
bad,stockingy shelves and checking out customers. I learned that putting the customer first always makes them happier. I learned all the regular customers that would come into the store.
bad,The most enjoyable part og the job interacting with customers. Coworkers are friendly and easy to work with. A typical work day is fast pace for hours at a time .
bad,They will have you work as much as possible and more if you accept. They will push you to take more hours. Too many tasks to handle in amount of time.
bad,The customers are disrespectful & the managers want you to do so much in so little time & it was very unorganized! & Management was terrible!
bad,"Warrenton Oregon store has a terrible woman working late.  She is out of her mind.  Critical of hard working employees.  Three people quit because of her AND the manager supports her.  And don't pay me on a debit card, weak!"
bad,Not to much to say horrible job i would go back hours horrible which means your check is horrible not worth the gas
bad,Was with company 6 1/2 years..worked my way to store manager from cashier. No guidence or support. Felt like was set up to fail. Felt as if nothing that was done was ever good enough. A healthy manager that had been with company for over10 years died of heart attack from all of stress... No training system in place.
bad,This job was not worth it. You had to fight for hours and you would still only get about 19hrs a week. The work was easy but they wanted you to do to much for not enough of a good pay
bad,"Worked as a sales associate, took care of customers, Worked with merchandise displays, kept a clean work environment. Greeted all customers with a warm hello and smile. Help with all aspect of a store, including merchandising, customer service, cashiering."
bad,"Working at ""Dollar Tree"" was not really for me, it did not benefit me in anyway. they wanted me to put work before school. The co-workers were pretty decent people. The hardest part of the job was constantly having to train new people and it seemed like there was someone new each week."
bad,"This place is very bad the associates will not show up for work. We are always understaffed, most times you can't fulfill manager duties because you are too busy being an associate. I understand that store managers have earned their keep in the company but going as far as not working weekends and not closing, that's just wrong. I could go on all day but as I said I'm just here until I find something else"
bad,Working for Dollar Treeisn't that bad. I enjoyed the associates that I managed and the work that we did together daily allso.You worked with less people and you were able to take charge of projects on your own. I always made it a mission to create the best wow table in our area with our seasonal products. Stocking products were easy while managing a register at the same time. The management gave your more responsibility which made you feel important.
bad,"Company needs a lots of improvement:"
bad,For the pay the work is very demanding. Each shift has different sets of things to get done during your shift. You are always expected to have them completed regardless of the high volume of sales. The management is not helpful in getting to the front in a timely manner. Most customers are at least 5 deep and even though the cashier requested help it still is not there. One of the manager's is very cold and rude to the customers when she does come to help. Hard to believe this is acceptable or allowed. Something needs done for the cleanliness as well. The dust in the gym and candy bars at the register is appalling. Upper management needs to step in and watch there manager's at this store.
bad,"counting the register drawer, keeping my area clean, greeting customers, customer service, light stocking, light cleaning. management wasn't very helpful. got along well with all my co-workers. hardest part of the job was working 15-20 hours a week, asked management of possibility for extra hours. my response was being scheduled 1 day a week, for 4 hours."
bad,"I worked there fairly briefly.  I learned my job well mostly on my own .  "
bad,"needs to be cross trained in all ares as far as buffin, stripping, waxing, and polishing floors. Ties in with housekeeping as far as laundry"
bad,Here is the thing about retail well ... a dollar store all items are $1 so unless you are truly making money at the $1 store you're not getting hours so guess who has to work the hours the management team well not exactly the store manager welcome back to slavery ... wait no indenture servitude because well let's face it we are getting paid you work 60  plus hours a week on a good week 6 days a week and you get paid 45 hours ... if you love spending time with your family or recently started one this is not the place for you
bad,I was always hounded by the district manager about cash that my assistant mgr.'s were stealing.  My co-workers were great.  Hardest thing about my job would be having to work for a company that did not want you in the store by yourself but would not give you the hours to cover other employess.
bad,"Work/life balance? Yeah ok! "
bad,"A typical day would be helping customers finding what they want to purchase, ringing up their items, exchange funds and invite them all back to shop again. I learned how to handle certain customer's who are rude. The management was alright to work for, and my co-workers was very nice and fun to work with. There wasn't really anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people that comes into the store, and laugh and talk to some of them."
bad,"Your paid minimuw ages and not given enough hours to survive, thast why tehy have hioght tunr over.No one can survive on minimum wage for under ten hours a week,."
bad,"Not treated fairly by management. Hours when they are given are not distributed based on how long you have been there but by how much you suck up to the boss. Want to work you to death for low pay.You get yelled at for work that was done wrong by other people.Corporate policies are not followed. Co-workers are alright but it's hard to tell because you hardly get to talk to them. Management only care about themselves and if your not management your an outsider. Part-time managers are treated badly and do not stay in the job for very long.Associate reviews are not done and discussed with associates so they can improve their performance. They are more like a top secret that are never seen Overall, this a horrible place to work. I think under cover boss needs to check into the way their stores are being run!"
bad,"They lied about hours, and told me it would be a full time job. Was later laid off and they said it was temporary"
bad,"long hours, no help short staff. management dont work with employees"
bad,"there was barely any hours, the store was a mess, the manager expected you to clean up after her and would complain nonstop. The hours were short, and the pay was minimum wage which is expected from this envirnement. I had a feeling the manager was taking money while counting out drawers but never had an issure with mine so i didnt bring it up. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my best friends."
bad,"Worked 60 hours a week, management made up rules on the fly.  If you got hurt you might as well kiss your job goodbye, everyone I knew who got put on light duty was fired right after they got off light duty.  No job security at all!!!  You are so afraid to talk to the managers because you will more than likely get in trouble. I got mocked by managers and ignored. They don't take any responsibility, everything that goes wrong is always your fault.  Co-workers were rude and not helpful at all.  People got cussed out when there pallets fell, even if it was not your fault.  Hard work for very little pay."
bad,"A typical day of work at dollar tree is not fun. I enjoyed the customers, and a couple of co-workers. One of the managers i worked with was always on her own personal cell phone and ignoring customers. She took many breaks while clocked in, spent a lot of time out side talking with friends and smoking. I had several customers complain and asked if i was the manager. The most enjoyable part of having this job was working with a specific male manager in the evenings. He was awesome with all the customers, and stayed in the store and off of his phone. He was willing to help me if there was a question or concern I had or a customer. The main management was never there while i was on shift but fired me over a small burn on one of the bills i accepted. After speaking with corporate I found out that she lied about speaking to corporate and them telling her she had to fire me. Corporate said that it wasnt fair that i was fired and was willing to allow me back to work, but after working there I realized I wanted no part of a bad buisness.."
bad,"For the most part, it gave me some work experience. I learned a little about stock working."
bad,This would be the least of my favorite jobs.... it really wasn't the most organized type of environment I like working in.
bad,Good for a starter job to gain knowledge and experience of retail
bad,"A day at Dollar Tree is short, but busy. You generally get 5 hrs. a day, two to three times out of a week. You are constantly cleaning the store, stocking shelves, ringing up items, assisting customers with merchandise as well as providing team work."
bad,Longest week worked was 93 hours.  High expectations without resources.  Morale issues company wide.  High turnover.
bad,"a typical work day includes working the cashier working the floor and or cleaning. I learned a lot with using cash and working on the computer at a fast pace.My co workers are good. I don't find my job hard at all , I learn very fast everything comes easy.The most enjoyable part is working with the customers"
bad,This is the WORST company to work for! Stupid rules! 1 short break! And barley gives any hours!!! I got between 4-10 a week! That's not gonna pay bills! They were easy to work with my school schedule considering they never gave anyone hours! HATED working there. And to top it off I haven't received my last check! I will be calling them tomorrow! 
bad,"I have been with the Dollar Tree company for 7+ years. It used to be a great place to work, until we moved stores and got all new management."
bad,"This company was the worst to work for becasue they don't care about you or what you think. They are only out to work you hard, work you agaisnt people. You didnt make money either."
bad,They do not give hours as promised they will just stop given you work.
bad,Typical work day was short and very repetitive majority of customers were rude or had a bad attitude. I did not learn anything except I was there to earn the company money with no rewards. The assistant management did not take there position seriously although the lead manager did and was very friendly. My co-workers where friendly and enjoyable to work with but share my opinions about the job. There was nothing difficult about the job except some of the customer interaction and there was really nothing enjoyable about the job.
bad,the pay was horrible and they just went out of business without warning.
bad,"The leadership at DollarTree simply isnt there. We hold monthly meetings in an effort of transparency, but get scolded if you ask questions or bring up a topic. Safety is at a minimum. Work Life balance doesnt exist when working 4 11 hour days and 2 12 hour days of hard physical labor in a building qith no climate control."
bad,"You Get Over Work And Underpaid For You Work Not To Mention Your Shifts Are Only 4/5 Hours Long.. Management Is RUDE And Only Think About Their self, Not To Mention If They Don't Like You They’ll Set You Up To Lose Your Job.. If i Could Give This Whole Job 0 Stars i Would!!!!"
bad,"This was my first time ever operating a real cash register , and working face to face with customers for long periods of time. It became very stressful for me and led to me making mistakes. It wasn't the job for me, but it might be for someone else."
bad,"The store manager is very lazy and doesn't exceed her work performance. "
bad,"Corporate run company that prioritizes profits, policy and sales numbers above employee benefits and welfare as well as customer service. The managers are constrained by corporate to not give employees many hours in order to avoid giving them benefits, which lead to them not wanting to work there very long, which puts more of the workload on the managers, which leads to them wanting to quit."
bad,It was a job. At one point I was only given 10 hrs. a week. The pays is horrible. Your so called trading was nothing at all. Manager always yelling and belittling everyone. That job was a total nightmare.
bad,"The company hired a new general manager and lets just say he was not that great of a boss. He did not want to complete standards on the job, and would instead just talk to customers till it was time for him to go."
bad,"This would have been a great opportunity for me as a team member but the people are dominantive on what you can do even if they are not managers, and the managers do not care about their own dominance of how they push their own employees thatarethearebeen there"
bad,Working tgier is stressful and over whelming. They expect too much out if a single person. I would not want to work at any given dollar tree company based on the experience I had working thier.
bad,The pay was great and so were the benefits but that was about all that was great at this job. The managers were horrible and didn't do anything to help. They didn't care about the employees at all.
bad,"If you’re ready to work harder than you ever have this is the job for you. Overflowing amount of freight, no freight hours to get the amount of work done, no cashier hours, and the customers get angry at you when there is only one cashier... The company promotes you without your pay increase for months, they say you’ll get a promotional raise, and you’ll never receive it. Thieves come in and steal bags full of stuff! The company as a whole is a SCAM!!!!!!"
bad,"It's hard to keep good employees when every other company around pays more. The only employee that you can keep are the lazy workers who don't care."
bad,Worked there for over 10 years. Would work endless hours open to closes and never even got a pat on the back for taking a store in the red and making it go to black within less thrn 6mos. They treat there employees worse then dirt
bad,They treat their employees with disrespect. They do not follow rules and procedures according to company policies. The management team has to deal with irrate customers and employees on a daily basis.
bad,Horrible place to work no training lack of support and help. They slam you with stuff to do and no employee to do the work just you half the time you don't even have a cashier.
bad,Poor quality District manager. Frequent mis-communications. Under staffed. Generally poor working conditions with little support from corporate management. This company is not recommended.
bad,"The last year was a living nightmare. I was constantly harassed, intimidated, and discriminated against because of my race. Management did nothing to help.  When I reported the situation to corporate headquarters  intimidating acts started by store managers."
bad,my time at DT for 6 years and never made over $ 8.00 an hour bad pay raises I stayed because Manager worked with me when I needed time off to take Husband to appt. other wise I would have left faster we just received a new manager and its the worse I've ever saw she can't think for herself doesn't help if you need help just a bad situation they try to push you to do more so they can get their bonus
bad,"No room for advancement and it's who you know, not what you know. Coming in early, and staying late, is not appreciated at all. I would not reccomend this employer to anyone that I liked."
bad,Dollar tree has a high turnover with management. Part time asst is 11.50 and full time asst is 12.50. No benefits if you are part time. No breaks or lunches due to being the only manager on duty. Hard to advance. Hard to get decent raise. Your ambushed with ton of freight.
bad,"One of the worst work expiernces of my life .No teamwork,constant changes in schedule and the rules.toxic work envioment.cant really say anything nice about my exierence.i never received the hours or schedule I was protest when I took the job."
bad,"this job gives you 5 hours a day and you dont get paid much an hour i honestly hate it , the management is poor . hardest part of the job is being the only cashier up on the register ."
bad,"terrible. air conditioning broke in stock room and restrooms, district manager will not approve to have it fixed. need new district manger who cares. applied for management position and never heard back. hours not consistent. poor communication and low pay. very hot in store and no breaks. 1o minute breaks you must clock out for and are paid minimum wage."
bad,"My personal experience: I do the work of 3 people and get paid for 1 a bad salary... slavery still exists in this company, if you are an assistant manager be prepared to receive calls relating to work at any time including your day off ( 3 a.m. not a problem for them ) to take care of the business without pay, you are not allowed to do any type of overtime, no extra pay on holidays if you work, and they will overwork you until you literally get sick from stress."
bad,"The upper manager was very rude. She yelled at me in front of a customer for being too slow when I was trying to ring her up as quickly as possible. It was embarrassing. "
bad,"During my time employed here I earned respect for my future jobs. Management was a disaster. New manager every month. Scheduling was a mess. The 'manager' wrote the schedule of a piece of paper and posted it in their office. The shift I worked was night as a stocker which entailed 1-2 nights weekly. With every new management they changed the days working and would not inform the employee. Therefore, when you would show up on the wrong day they would blame you. Absolutely terrible."
bad,"Dollar Tree underpays and has poor air quality, I don't recall any sort of wage increase in sight. They overwork their employees and the breaks are not long enough."
bad,Worst place I've ever worked. Very poor and lazy manager. A buddy buddy system and unfair treatment of all employees. Nasty store that was cluttered and poorly stocked. Low hours and pay for the workload and responsibilities.
bad,"I worked at Union, MO for a year as the Store Manager hired externally. The training program is unorganized and the trainer was unprofessional and just used me as her stocker. "
bad,I would not recommend working there. What started as a nice part time job turned into a nightmare when the current Store Manager left. Employees were threatened because I have good work ethic!
bad,It was an easy enough job. I think if the management was changed a bit it would've been a great place to work.  However just because an assistant manager makes 25 cents more then me does not give them a right to be rude and condescending.
bad,"Filed harrassment claim on merchandise mgr twice to corporate nothing was done. She would use profane language towards me wen in presence of customers and employees. Store manager would approve of it bcuz she was her best bed friend. Store manager was too much of a gossiper. She would spread whatever business she was informed for take off reasons, like it was everybodies business. I felt sorry for the employees I left behind bcuz they were treated unfairly as well. Houston where is the justice?"
bad,Be prepared to work minimum of 51 hours a week you’ll get one Saturday off a month and must work 1 closing shift a week. Your expectations to keep the store according to policy at times is extremely difficult based on your staff not to mention getting delivery of your truck on a weekly basis of usually 1200 cases that you have to unload with one of your employees. So the entire week it’s always the feeling of never getting to feel as if your getting anywhere cause your stockroom is overflowing with merchandise that your constantly having to stock freight just to keep up and make room for the next truck. So yeah I’m always feeling I have to hit the floor running just to keep up and that’s just the stocking side to the job. High turnover is going to be the funniest part to the job...if your cashier doesn’t show or an ASM happens to get sick guess who has to cover even after working all day or all week it’s up to you.
bad,"I enjoyed my job however mangerment was very poor and it was run more like a friend business. You only work 4 hours at a time, you didn't get insurance or earn vacation time"
bad,"The two managers we have take all their breaks together leaving the cashiers alone so if you need backup you have to go outside and fetch them. "
bad,I didn't like working at dollar tree. Not enough hours. Pay was 7.25 for less than 15 hours a week that I worked. No health insurance. Management sucked!
bad,Depends on management and employees. The store I worked for was harsh and unforgiving to anyone. The latest manager was rude and did not follow the law. Plus nobody really did their job to the full extent unless their job was on review. Toxic work place.
bad,Managers care about themselves more than anything else. Selfish rude and childish. Hours all wack and out of place. Nothing is set in stone or they are always late.
bad,It was a bad place to work just some time no body wanted to work. It was hard to find good workers. Some of the women didn’t like me as a manager cause I won’t let them get away with anything.
bad,"Dollar Tree should only be considered for something temporary until you are able to find a better job. "
bad,Relaxed environment not a bad place to work if you like working 8 hours a week on minimum wage. Everyone talks about each other and they don’t value employees who have worked there for years management gives hours to who they’re friends with.
bad,if you thinking of working at dollar tree run. the lie what the job is about. as a store manager you work 60 to 72 hours a week and get paid for 45. The cut payroll so you how to do everything yourself. to much bs
bad,"Very unorganized work place. Never in order, the place is filthy. The manager smokes with employees, and is always playing music throughout the store. He spends most of his time on his cell phone."
bad,The managers are over worked. so they try to over work you because they are tired. The typical day would be to grab you your boat and stock the shelves.
bad,"Past three years every employee has got a 2 dollar raise in order to get to 15 per hour. Management didn’t get anything until the third year. The pay difference from the lowest employee to manager use to be 6 dollars (9 per hour for lowest associate to 15 for the lowest manager). With their increase and the managers increase the pay difference is now 1.25. I was already only making 15.50 before the pay increase for the employees. Due to the raises given to the employees of 6 dollars over 3 years to 15 per hour, they only gave managers a .75 raise in the same amount of time. To make 15 per hour biweekly is already not conducive to the living cost in New York. To wait it out and only receive 1.25 and still not have the pay rate to match the cost of living in New York is disheartening! Not to mention a company that entrust so much to the managers but not compensate them correctly is the reason for my decision."
bad,A typical day at work is very stressful. There are a lot of employees that do not do their job. Management sweeps it under the rug and lean on the employees that are doing their job. Management is untrustworthy. Hardest part of the day is clocking in. The most enjoyable part of the day is clocking.
bad,I would arrive at work and either return products to correct isles. Return merchandise and/or shipped materials to appropriate isles or work check out as the cash register. The hardest part of my job was on shipping day when we had to organize the backroom with all of the new boxes that just arrived. The best part of the job was the employees that I worked with.
bad,"Dollar Tree mostly offers part time to employees, no benefits.  Management positions are given full time with more responsibility and very minimal pay increase."
bad,The manager I had was horrible . I was on the cashier by myself and the line was really long and no other cashier wanted to help . When you call another cashier for help on another register they will have a bad attitude ! And I was only working ONE DAY A WEEK! I quit ..
bad,I would rather work at Walmart as a janitor cleaning bathrooms than her work the night shift at the Dollar Tree. It's not for people with a family or a life
bad,Lowlife pay!!!! If your breathing your hired!!! They don't care about anything!!! Will never shop there or work there again!!! Terrible!!!! Hire anybody untrust worthy!! They cut your hours constantly!!! You never get raises!!!!
bad,"got verbally harassed daily by customers and manager was a hard ball an refused to change anything, break times where soo short.some days breaks are even impossible to take"
bad,"Okay place to work but not great for a lifetime career. Not paid well, no benefits as a part-time manager, usually worked more than supposed to be as a part-time manager."
bad,"dollar tree i would not want to go back here if i had many other options because they don't like to work around your schedule if you have kids, they are very inconstant"
bad,"Most of the shift was spent stocking, cleaning or putting things back where they belong on the shelves, called ""doing put-backs"". On average the work-week consisted of 10-15 hours split up into 5-hour shifts."
bad,"really don't care to review them they weren't one of my best jobs they gave bad hours, it was hard to commute there and their management was extremely Poor But I stated I really don't wanna give them a bad review"
bad,"No work life balance. Hard to schedule staff for truck deliveries and stocking of product because you never knew what day or time trucks were coming. Whole business dependant on the inventory you have to sell."
bad,"-Typical day involved dealing with cranky customers because there was never enough staff to work on the registers"
bad,"On a typical work day I would have to restock the shelves most during the hours the store was open not allowing space for customers to get through the store, because I had large boxes in their way. I would need a restroom break at times and was unable to go to the restroom. "
bad,Here in Amite Louisiana we get paid 7.50 barely have hours and I’m a main Stocker n cashier they underpaid and don’t never have hours management is real good it’s just the pay
bad,Corporate is cheap. Little fifteen cent pay raises once a year. Doesnt matter how hard you work. Customers tear up the store. Managers dont want to work.
bad,"I feel that Dollar tree should treat the workers better and give them more benefits because the benefits are terrible beyond terrible for full time and part time workers , the register need to be updated its now 2018 , and workers deserve more hours then you give cause it is terrible"
bad,"I like doing cashier and dealing with customers, bringing smiles to their facei would have loved to keep working their but I was part times and they were going to cut everyones hours and I was already at  minimal hours a week"
bad,"When I first started working at Dollar Tree it was great. It was steady, clean, hours were given, no mess, and the manager we had was about her business but she was strong and meant was she said. The district manager had her picks and chooses about employees and it made the shifts and work hard to manage. She was more of certain employees than their boss which is why after she got rid of the manager that hired me we never had a steady manager since then. Every other month we had a difference manager and the store was falling apart. As of now the store is still falling apart because now the manager that they have tries to fire people without proper protocol."
bad,"Typical workday expectations are unattainable with time constraints, and other job responibilities.  Co managers are not cognizant of any other employee ability to achieve expected work within time given to complete task."
bad,"The cost of doing business for $1 is cheap labor. Employees are given minimum hours, minimum wage and driven like work horses. No labor support from district/regional managers, when numbers aren't looking good they require you to cut labor. Not a professional environment and has no ""resume appeal"" to other potential employers. For a single adult with no children or recent empty nester willing to work 50-70 hrs a week this is a perfect opportunity....if you have family or wish to work a normal 40-45hr week without being contacted outside of work, do not apply with Dollar Tree."
bad,Not a good place to work. Minimim pay and always a mess. Very stressful and terrible customers. Constant stealing and product boxes or wrappers around store.
bad,"DO NOT WORK AT DOLLAR TREE. It is a terrible place, incredibly unprofessional at every angle. Managers, employees, customers everyone hates to be there. Wild amounts of off the clock work. INCREDIBLY understaffed. The worst experience."
bad,They cut hours down to only 4 a week sometimes we lose managers faster then we can learn there names the stores a mess never keep any one so don't get used to the people you work with the pay is 7.22 some people have been there 4 years plus and still make less then 8$ a hour
bad,"Brand new store with 20 employees, female manager hired 19 females and myself. Product was force shipped and under my control and I was the only one that could put away heavy stuff.  Performance was tied to amount of product put away each shift and there was no way to meet expectations while also keeping back room stacked enough to move around."
bad,no support from upper management you are sent to training and all you do is throw freight then you are put in a damaged store with no support system in place
bad,I really had to work hard with little to no pay. They really didn't have time off for any holidays except Christmas. Hard as you work you didn't get any discount or benefits.
bad,"Most employees are expected to be a jack of all trades from cashiering to stocking and everything in between, but no matter how well the job was done employees couldn't get more than 20 hours a week and never saw a raise beyond when the minimum wage went up."
bad,"The benefits are great, the process is easily understood, but sadly injuries, and hurdles within the company are often ignored. Injuries are blamed on employees- when we are stressed to make production some how. ""Keep the shareholders happy"" I was told."
bad,"The job is ok. Advancement is random (seems like favoritism for some, but hard working associates get overlooked easily if the district manager doesn't care to know you). Hours are limited. Be lucky to get an ok store manager. Unless you're a cashier, be ready to have ridiculous tasks. Customers are the absolute worst but that may be because of the day shifts and their attitudes. I worked overnight, but when I was there in the day, customers complain a lot about lack of employees working."
bad,Learn a lot from some of the management but other than that it's like a slave ship were you break your back for the company but the company doesn't care or compensate your for your hard work
bad,this company doesn't have what it takes to back up there employees they say that they do but when something doesn't go the way they wanted they point fingers at everyone they are not fair to their  employees but they sure do expect a hole lot from them
bad,"A typical day at Dollar Tree meant being on your toes and patients to make it through the day.  Being my first job I've learned alot from cashiering, recovering, restocking, working the back room, filling balloons, etc.  Management was decent.  The workplace was diverse and mildly lively.  Worst part about the job was when it got super packed and customers stretched down the allies roaring for  more cashiers to open up when there were only one accessible.  Other than that with only 3 ppl at most working a day ( not including holidays) put alot of work on your, hope you have the slow hours.  Working there was a great first job to teach me how real and crazy retail was so it wasnt all bad. Best part was interacting with some of the customers"
bad,"Dollar tree in cowpens is awful . Racist , don't pay enough for all the work they want you to do . They are greedy and very selfish . Management is awful and rude . Everyone is for them self instead of being team players . !!!!"
bad,"It was ok, the company did not give enough hours for healthcare, the management good. The typical work day consists of cleaning up after customers, checking the customers out, after the store closes more cleaning."
bad,"The job is not good at all. Bad general manager she plays favoritism with most of the co-workers. She dont like me hardly gave me any hours to work , sometimes I only worked 1 day out of a whole week."
bad,"easy, fun work place. friendly coworkers, managers are nice and some customers can be rude but other than that you meet some friendly one. typical day would be on the register and out go backs away."
bad,"dollar tree management in Texas is way better than amnagement in Florida"
bad,As a manager I myself made very little and was never getting to spend time with my family. Worked all holidays. They changed the rules on bonus for management as they pleased.
bad,I enjoy being a employee at Dollar Tree because it is a great place to meet others. It gets tough sometime when customers come into the store with personal problems and take it out on the employee but you as the employee has to ensure the customer that everything kis going to be okay and be sure to show empathy and no sympathy. Never mix business with personal problems.
bad,"Non competitive minimum wage, part time employees, unrealistic expectations on management, poor ordering system, executive management is out of touch with the reality of the business. Outdated business practices. Overworked management staff."
bad,"The company is great in general but this particular Slidell store (#4926) is extremely poorly managed. There's favoritism when it comes to scheduling,policy is disregarded for some and not others according to the preferences of certain members of management and the district manager."
bad,"Not flexible hours, poor pay, awful management, not enough male worker to unload products. Located near Walmart and other good convenient stores."
bad,"Always had fun with my coworkers,always a good environment to work in.Never had any problems with anyone, and my supervisor always made sure everyone was comfortable.."
bad,"the assistant managers were great, I cant say the same for the Manager though, he was extremely disrespectful and has a short temper. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the managers unrealistic expectations, along with never being able to move up on the food chain."
bad,"Dollar Tree was the worst place I've ever worked in my life. Everything from culture, compensation,  to communication was terrible you say the least"
bad,It use to be fun working with dollar tree but wr have more people leaving job they pay is not grate 7.25 a hour that not good to the work. They want you to do
bad,"The staff was too unprofessional and disrespectful, the job lacked the ability to provide the hours that was negotiated prior to the beginning of working."
bad,did not provide breaks in a timely fashion not enough people on the schedule did not allow you to clock out when you were schedule to get off and had somewhere else to be. If you ask to use the restroom while on the clocked got yelled at.
bad,"Management was unstable and turnover was ridiculous.  Horrible work/life balance!  Absolutely no support from RD only ""micro management"". Be ready to work yourself to death!!"
bad,"Ask as many questions as you can. Don't hesitate to let someone know if you need help understanding something. You may have to do extensive research on your own, but make it known that you need help."
bad,Quite possibly the worst run company I've worked for in 30 years. You will be running your store by yourself. You can't pay people more than minimum wage. They are expected to work 4 hour shifts and only a maximum of 15 hours! My store in Weatherford TX was visited by the Fire Marshall 5 times. Dollar tree forces you to stack boxes on top of each other. No shelving allowed. You will get 1800 piece trucks and manually unload each and every piece individually by hand down the archaic set rollers. Turn over is extremely high with people dropping off sometimes in days because of the extremely difficult work. The general public is allowed to use the bathrooms in the stockroom while you are trying to stack boxes and organize. There is no employee lunch area... You'll be eating and homeless people are wandering around the stockroom asking you What's for lunch? I ended up working 37 straight days with no days off. One week I did 82 hours. Being a Store Manager means that was all free work. It is a common problem that this company expects it's cashiers and stock people to work off the clock. Just google Osha and Labor violations for this company. A total joke. Don't expect any support from the District Manager they can care less and will readily terminate you if you fail to run the business by yourself.
bad,"working at dollar tree my people skills became stronger ,I learned more bout different products , my coworkers there was very nice an respectful , I think the hardest part of the day is leaving to go on break because when I start on something I have the intensions to get the job done without stopping. the most enjoyable part of the day is when a I get to help someone an when I am done they tell me thanks a lot ."
bad,"Work you until you are sore the next day, promise you a job, then even after you have shown how hard of a worker you are for 2 weeks, management decides who to keep based on a person's opinion who has not been there to see you work, but listens to another's personal history with you from 30 years ago.  Its a place to work if you like to hustle and lift heavy boxes, go out in the cold for 10 minutes twice a day and get paid minimum wage."
bad,"I'm a manager that believes in coaching first and using write-ups only when absolutely necessary. This company wants you to write people up for every last little mistake."
bad,dollar tree does not care about there employees all they are worried about is the bottom line. the customers that shopped at dollar tree were great. you might get on or two that are not so good. the manager that i had until march of 2015 was great then the one that was put in her place not so good he was lazy and stayed in the office would not come out to help.
bad,"Leadership was not that great, hopefully its different now. They were very petty and it was a ""Good Ole Boy"" environment."
bad,The company doesn't give enough hours to the employees. The company doesn't give any type of befits for part time employees.
bad,"Checked out customers at register. My first time as a cashier, I learned how to take payments and make change. Had good interaction with customers. The manager I thought was immature. Some employees tried to assume a position of authority. Hardest part was when computers went down and we were very busy during holidays. Most enjoyable was customer relations."
bad,"Store was always a mess, Management wasn't very helpful and co-works weren't helpful also"
bad,"Went in, started register, stocked while i wasn't busy. If I worked the night shift I recorded sales and counted income from the day. Helped set up displays if manager needed help. A store is run with one manager and one cashier/stocker, maybe two sometimes. The hardest part of working there was dealing with how under staffed the store was. the most enjoyable part of working there was the people I helped."
bad,"I absolutely love working with my ""Pod Team"" we are enthusiastic and out of the box thinkers to drive sales, margin, and turn. My position is the only one in the company and is a ""trial"" position if you will. My job combines both Allocation and Replenishment; therefore, providing a general knowledge of all aspects of the department. I have learned a lot from my Category Director as he has mentored me and takes the time to explain his thought process and also he enjoys and is passionate when others new learn new ways to analyze the business. The hardest part of the job is the lack of job work/life balance and the overall job culture."
bad,Manager is messing up on everyone hours which I'm working one day a week. He also doesn't help none of the employees but he sit in his offices most of the times. Their was 4 to 5 employee who left that was excellent workers who couldn't work underneath this new manager
bad,"Dollar was one of the worst places i had worked i had enjoyed working there at first while i was a cashier,But when I became assistant manager I had learned your absolutely nothing to them, They are known for breaking the managers physically and mentally!"
bad,"Too much overturn within stores and management, Very shady dealing within managment and stores money, very uncomfortable place to work."
bad,very limited hours and no room for growth or aquiring personal responsibilty
bad,"The first thing you need to know before considering employment at Dollar Tree is that your experience at first will vary greatly depending on your store manager, but will eventually degrade into a nightmare. This is because, one way or another, good managers who actually care about their employees are sooner or later shown the door. Either they are fired for arbitrary reasons, or harassed by the District Manager until they quit. Such is the case with #4498 which is currently on it's third store manager despite only having been open for a little over 2 years. The only store managers who have any staying power are the ones that are willing to beat down their employees and do anything, whether unethical or outright illegal under labor law, to make themselves look better in the eyes of the DM."
bad,"A typical day consist of providing customer serice and performing basic tasks. Our primary duties include; gretting customers, ringing up purchases, handling returns, and answering question about products, policy, and services. I learnd how to mange my time better and how to deal with more than objectives. It was really hard to tell who was the manger at the, due to we had like four or five mangers at a time. Co-works were okay, most of us got along, while others not so well. The hardest part was being the only cashier open and dealing with impatient cusomters. The most enjoyable part was getting to train an new employee."
bad,the management from store manager to corprate management has really bad ideas as well as horrible people skills and inorder to boost productivity is to constintly threaten you with fireing NO POSSITIVE feed back or reinforcement whats so ever
bad,"The company Does care about anybody not even the Employees I'm lucky if i get scheduled more than 2 days a week, I've only once brought in 200 on a check and i'm facing eviction because i never get any hours in an economy that just isn't hiring. When you bring this up to management and beg on your hands and knees for more hours they give you MAYBE a third day of work, if you're extremely lucky you get 4 days. Management doesn't care."
bad,"Overall the Dollar Tree company is fine to work with.  The Fox Lake, Illinois store was a nightmare.  With poor management, poor preparation, lack of communication, and lack of store safety, it was a nightmare working here."
bad,They'll use you up then get rid of you rather by lying or undermining.  Management threatens by dangling your job over your head. Orders are thrown around at random.
bad,"Dollar Tree is their own worst enemy! Fiscally irresponsible run company. Inundate stores with freight, nonstop, with NO hours or manpower to get it out. Their answer is to get a pod to unload trucks in to. This freight will NEVER get worked and will literally just ROT and will have to be 'damaged"" out. Store Manager is a JOKE and District Manager is even WORSE. Tired of being LIED to all of the time and doing all of the work of the Store and Freight Manager and not getting the pay. Tired of the Store Manager's, past and present, being allowed to HIRE FAMILY MEMBERS!"
bad,It's not dollar tree  its drama tree so much drama from store manager to asms no care leave their personal life at home and takes things out on there employees and if you dont do the things that they want like get someone fired when they dont deserve to and they take it out on employees one more than other
bad,As a PSC working at Dollar Tree headquarters you would expect it to be more secure and safe unfortunately their main concern was there dollar product not the quality of life or well-being of their employees
bad,Good for a starting job. Would not reccomend working there as a career. Store and certain managers are very unorganized. Environment is unclean and unsafe.
bad,The pay is awful. Great job low pay. The pay is only minimum wage and u get 15 cent raise once a year.......I would stay there but cant live off the income
bad,It’s very slow . Not many hours . Management is okay . A lot of good stuff there customers are friendly . Employees are childish & not very clean . But very easy job
bad,"I have worked for dollar tree for over a year, at first you don't see the B's at Dollar tree. Well I will say this if you like drama, Co workers not working and manager then this job is for you. If you have poor work ethics lie steal this is the place to be. You can get away with everything. Good people that actually work and are honest this job is not for you STAY AWAY!You can make complaints about the managers and what there doing but HR and corporate will not do anything."
bad,"you are encouraged to not report injuries. when an injury is reported you are at fault for the injury regardless of the cause. be prepared to give your all and be told that it is not enough. I averaged 130% on my production rating, but am constantly being scolded for being too slow."
bad,"Bad experience in the Hamilton NJ store in independence mall. I wouldn't recommend working there, its an excellent place to shop but not to be involved in,. i cannot speak for every store since I have only been to this specific one."
bad,"I accepted a position with this company back in 2017, when I accepted the position i was advised that the rate of pay for assistant manager would change on Jan 1 2017, I was told it would be $15.50/hour and benefits after 3 months. The starting salary previously was $13.40/hour for "
bad,"Once again,  I am completely in awe at the level of incompetence afforded by a company. Their middle Management (at least in my District and Region, specifically my DM) has about as much intelligence and common sense as a common houseplant. It's truly magnificent to watch. I'd have been better off working for a monkey helping him throw shirt (minus the R) against a wall to see if we could paint a perfect replica of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa... Only thing I can say to prospective employees looking for work is: Run. The other way. As quickly as possible. Garden hole (minus Garden and L)yourself, be a mule for the cartel, be a test subject for military biological weapons... even a crash test dummy has a better chance of living the dream and living their job than you will working for the shirt (you get the picture)show that is Dollar Tree."
bad,Unless you are desperate for a job like me. I couldn't find any work. This job is last resort in my opinion. Its a low paying job for the amount of work you have to do. Not worth it. Walmart pay more than that.
bad,"The pay is absurdly low. Cashiers who have been there for years still make minimum wage and assistant managers aren't paid much better. Hire new cashiers in at slightly higher pay than those who have been there years and proved themselves. Company does not allow enough hours to adequately stock the store, attend to customers, or cover breaks and lunches. Unqualified management. No acknowledgement for hard work or improving sales. Customers trash the store."
bad,Management is rude for no reason even to customers . a/c took forever to be repaired so me and other workers worked in the heat for months . no benefits . they always revise schedule ( make changes ) and then when youre late for work or dont show up they say its your fault . management does not care for employees they care for drama. They dont train you and then say you dont know what youre doing .
bad,"During breaks you were required to stay in the back room that was piled to the ceiling with unused stock, to get to a chair you often needed to climb over boxes. Employer took advantage of my close living situation by refusing to give me a structured schedule like every other employee and instead calling me in to work 30 minutes before any shift I needed to work, which I made very clear was difficult to do with insomnia. If I had any issues with making the shift I was chastised and threatened with cut hours which were never scheduled to begin with. I would never work for this establishment or company again."
bad,I worked for dollar tree and they was always under staffed . Most of the employees would sit around when the store manager wasnt around including the shift managers.
bad,"I think so Dollar Trees should have a security up front. I've been doing retail for more than 20+ years and I know some employees at this company don't do their job right but the ones that do take pride in their blo job should get compensated by giving some type of incentive. Like employee of the month, gift cards, bonuses. raise."
bad,I personally don't reccomend the store I worked at but any other dollar tree seems appealing to work at. They never gave me hours and only called me an hour before shifts so I wouldn't be able to make it to shifts which eventually got me fired sadly.
bad,"This corporation pretends to care about employees, but has no regard for their well-being at all.  They do not even answer the phone when you try to contact headquarters.  They put you into a looped HOLD cycle until you get frustrated and hang up.  They do not acknowledge or compensate you for your years of service, your skills and abilities, etc.  They refuse to fix items such as the AC/Heating system, broken registers, bathrooms are filthy, stockrooms are overflowing and dangerous, etc.  Appeals to management regarding these issues are ignored.  They then scratch their heads wondering why their turnover is so high!"
bad,"I started out as a part time assistant manager and worked my way, eventually, into a store manager position. I had an excellent store manager, who became a wonderful mentor, but any management above store level was a joke. My district manager was THE WORST boss I have EVER had, in 30+ years in retail! He threw me into an ailing store, for my first store manager position, then basically abandoned me. He wouldn't answer my texts/calls/emails and then threatened my job, because I still had no clue what I was doing, because I never received ANY of the training I was supposed to receive. He leads with bullying and intimidation and the greatest thing he taught me was TO NOT TREAT MY EMPLOYEES THAT WAY! I, seriously, model MY management style on everything that man did NOT give to me...I try to be sure my employees get those things from me. I did go above his head and was assured I would get the help I needed, but then I was abandoned by both HR and my regional manager, as well. I put in my two weeks notice, ended up working three weeks, then still got put in as non-re-hire-able, because they say I abandoned my job. "
bad,"my opinion family dollar side of the company is better, but is slowly switching over to dollar trees customs."
bad,Their interpersonal relationships and non beneficial. Dont become acquainted or friendly with managment at first chance they'll burn you for no reason.
bad,The hiring manager told me during the interview process that the chance advancement within the company takes a long time. By the way he didn't even look that old nor did any of the hiring managers in that hot facility. They just want you to work hard and it takes forever to basically move up within the establishment. People dont want to always stay at the bottom.
bad,AWFUL comopany that does not care at all about its employees. Schedules change at the drop of a hat and they will come looking for you if they need you to work. Borderline harassment
bad,Dollar Tree is far to caught up in the chain of comand and their bureaucracy. They care little for employees and their demands far exceed their pay grades or even what is possible for the available personnel to do. Never enough staff working for what is expected.
bad,Hot sweaty busy day the whole time you're there.  The store I worked at didn't have any air and it felt just as hot in the store as it did outside. The store stayed busy which was a plus because it made the hours go by quickly.  You have to be ready for that 1 customer whose having a bad day to want to come and take all their frustration out on you.
bad,"Stinks, poor management. No benefits, low pay. Low hours. Bugs in store. No good raises. Management doesn't care about employee opinions and all the work they put in"
bad,Never can seem to get anything done. Company keeps filling up the stock room. The store manager is the foundation of this company but yet we are treated lik slaves or robots
bad,if you need to get a start in life dollar tree is the place to but dollar tree is one of the job before the career jobs if you hunger for to make a living look for dollar tree to be that stepping stone
bad,"This job was awful, the only reason I stayed was because they were flexible with my college schedule and because I loved my coworkers. If you’re just out of high school or someone in college looking for a little pocket change, this is for you."
bad,I loved my job but other management did not take care of some things that needed to b addressed . I needed a set schedule n daily plans or job tasks was never assigned to certain areas
bad,"typical day at work was clock in, either work the registers with long lines or clean the never ending mess and stocking never ending aisles wit very short staff most of the times i was there. not so friendly and basically just a regular day doing mundane things. nothing new to learn, everybody out for self"
bad,"Unload products from the truck every Friday afternoon, or Saturday if the work was backtrack from the previous stop, via conveyor belt. Come in and stock the shelves, either overnight or during the work day, until every item is stocked. Mop up any spills or dirt marks on the salesfloor. Empty all the cardboard boxes and trash within the store before leaving at the end of the shift. Peak season gets busy around Christmas season and will consist of you coming in twice a day. Stay on alert if the district manager comes into the store for a surprise inspection to see if you are doing your job correctly."
bad,I worked at dollar tree because it is easy to get hired there and I needed a job. The pay is not good at all. There is no holiday pay or anything. You will never get off at when you are scheduled to get off. I have no problem getting off a little bit later but every time a person works is horrible.
bad,"Horrible pay. They expect the labor of two-three people from one employee. Hot, miserable.  Filthy, filthy store. Management does not allow you enough time as a stocker or a person who recovers to clean the floor or wipe the shelves. "
bad,It may have been the specific location I worked by my experience with Dollar Tree was poor. Few hours and even less pay. Difficult management with no advancement. Possibly good enough for entry level position but don't expect much more.
bad,My boss was the worst ever. She always had an attitude everyday. Was very rude and treated me as I was a thief. I was only paid $7.35 an hour and I was a stocker. Hard working at that! Never was appreciated either.
bad,"I found Dollar Tree too stressful of working environment and the company’s time management is terrible. Low pay and very low hours so do your self a favor avoid this place st all costs. When they scheduled me 0 hours for one week, I decided not to return. I am glade I did because I actually dreaded working my shifts."
bad,The manager at dollar tree was a male and showed favortism toward females. It made working there stressful and very uncomfortable. The workplace shouldnt be used for dating.
bad,The hours given were inconsistent and were far less than what I applied for. The staff was extremely unprofessional and dismissive when presented with valid questions and needs regarding their associates. The store was heavily understaffed and we were still being micromanaged then reprimanded when all tasks assigned weren't completed.
bad,"It was OK. Breaks were only 10 min"
bad,Dollar tree is a good place to work if you're in school and want to make a little money but not to live off of they pay mim wage unless you're in managment pays a little better I worked for them in 2007 left and came back last year they started me back at the same pay I made in 2007 you  work long hours and have to clock out for breaks that you can't even take because your the only manager on duty after I got robbed leaving work one nite it was never the same the stress at Dollar tree will kill you no weekends off I could go on and on I stepped down to cashier until I can find something else stay away from Dollar tree
bad,Learned how to manage a retail store and be assistant manager/cashier /customer service /Stocker a perfect career opportunity good people to work for an respectful company
bad,"only part time work if you are not in management 5 to 10 hours a week, during thanksgiving and Christmas freight is forced out and do not give the hours to get the freight out you are expected to put out 30 cases per hour they do not take into consideration that you may have to rearrange the pegs in order to stock product or work with broken glass or leaking bottles of chemicals. If you do not meet the required numbers for freight you are threatened to be fired"
bad,"District Manager was the worst manager I have ever had. She was inflexible to the point where I had to work so many hours in a lower volume store which had not run with a permanent manager for months. The expectation to manage inventory that had not been worked for 16 weeks with no payroll was impossible, DM simply refused to allocate additional manpower or understand that everything cannot be stocked when there is no sales to make room."
bad,"Local management was great but corporate constantly lied to employees and management, provided unsafe work environments, and put the smallest amount of profit before employees and customers."
bad,It was a terrible experience. I wouldn't advice anybody with children to work there because it isn't a stable environment. You don't have a steady work schedule.
bad,"60, 70, 80 hours a week for the same pay sound good to you? Then by all means, seek out a career as a store manager at Dollar Tree! You'll be told that you'll only have to work 48 hours a week! But then, your assistant manager calls off and you realize that you can't go home. So your 8 hour day becomes a 13 hour day. Then, two days later, your other assistant manager does the same thing and guess what, you're there another 13 hours. "
bad,place was fast paced and wasn't acknowledge for doing good work. Rarely received pay raises. Never received vacation time. Working schedule was inconsistent.
bad,As a manager i wasnt trained right there was a lot of discrimination lack of comunication alot of favouritism .this job is more ideal for a teenager the pay rate for manager is ridiculous
bad,As management you get no real breaks. You are always on call and can’t leave the store. Very unsanitary. Not enough hours to get everything done. Terrible
bad,They let assiociated yell at you when you drive by even thought it’s a safety hazard and do not enforce their own rules. Numerous times had I asked my managers to have associates to not yell at me. Managers failed to stop them. Also painted orange poles for a staging area for pallets to be put away but the managers would not enforce the rule to not put more pallets in designated areas. Very poor management.
bad,Over worked with no help physical expectation unreal they only care about the management not the empolyess favor other shifts because of the warehouse ceo
bad,"Dollar Tree has shown me how to better use my customer services also, It has help me to do a lot of tasks. I choose the evening because of school but am working every weekend which am having a problem with now for missing my grand kids."
bad,"it is a high stress low Pay No benefit retail company. 90% of the staff is part-time to avoid benefits. Pay is minimum wage, annual increases range from a nickel to a dime."
bad,"The environment is great the people are awesome, but due to strict corporate management the room for growth is zero if any. Even when gaining a higher position your pay is then raised but you suffer the sacrifice of being the one to blame for everything or anything that can and may go wrong. I find the people very genuine despite the downs of a poor work environment which is quite motivating for me and is probably why I'm on here out looking to do more with my life. Lol"
bad,Very under paid. You make below minimum wage but are required to work hard. I only worked 4 1/2 hours a day & 9 hours a week. I asked constantly for hours but they didn't give me any
bad,"Customers were rude, associates didn't seem to care about anything. I learned how to deal with unruly customers. Workplace culture was too nonchalant. The hardest part of the job was the customers and unskilled associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
bad,I wouldn't go back & work for the company if they tripled my pay. However this isn't to distract anyone else from working their. maybe they'll have an better experience than I did.
bad,"fast paced and great customers., not enough hours to sustain my life style of a single lady and only have one job. this is great for someone that is looking for a very part-time job."
bad,"Low pay, bad management, low hours, usually only scheduled 3 to 4 days a week sometimes less, no vacation, hard to get days requested off, no benefits"
bad,"Too many chances for associates."
bad,"Fast past job,cashiering and also stocking,also markdowns,damages, receiving;frozen,wonder bread,Pepsi,Frito lay chips,also making sure my cashiers are cleaning,giving great customer service, retrieving karts that belongs to the Dollar tree store"
bad,I had a a lot of good co- workers but they left for lack of hours and pay . there was always a lot of work but they would hire more help to save payroll
bad,"As a manager it was quite stressful. My store managers were great-outstanding people, however some of the co-managers i could not say the same about unfortunately. Most stress would however come from corporate. You would have one corporate official instructing you to do things one way while another would be telling you o do it the opposite way generating a lot of issues. Then at times they could be very disrespectful. From this I was able to learn how to deal and interact with people from a corporate office."
bad,if you want quick money but nothing too much this is the place to go but if your looking to do a part time you will hate this job especially if you need urgent money
bad,"The store manager has lost interest and it shows, she is never there but gets paid full time, she gets everyone else to do her work so that if anything is wrong she can blame them, there is a high staff turnover and if corporate looked into it they would discover that is was the store manager, she bullies if someone says no to her, this is the reason I no longer work there, the district manager needs to look into all the complaints about her instead of teaming up with the store manager and bullying that person into leaving"
bad,it was ok  to work there. some cashiers would talk to customers to death at  times. no hours even as an fulltime associate.short breaks and not even time.
bad,"A typical work day would be me, coming into work and as a soon as I walk in lines are backed up down the aisles and I have to wait for the manager who is on the register to lead me to the office and count down a drawer so that I can log in to an available register. After lines have gone down, I'm usually asked to stock an aisle or work on re-shop and be the backup cashier. The aisles usually look messy as though no one has done re-shop or recovery in the past three days and waits for the next person to come in and get the job done. The general manager was not willing to be flexible with my schedule if I verbally expressed my concerns, they had to be in writing."
bad,"Absolutely loved my in store manager!! He was awesome and the new DM destroyed our store. I loved going to work and now I hate it! I've worked multiple retail jobs but I loved this one because of the amazing manager. I'm now looking for other work because I am watching the store fall apart day by day. One of my co-workers cries daily because she misses our manager that much. The way the company treated him was despicable and should be ashamed!!!! The store has gone to H E L L, in less than a week! We can't get to our break room because of freight.  It's dangerous to even go in the back.  Don't work here! Ever!"
bad,"Dollar Tree does not give any one very many hours, Unless your a cashier and even then your not promised much, It is a bad place to work if you are paying bill with this job, this is a good job for a student"
bad,you get absolutely no hours! If you have a child this job isn't for you ! Recommend for first jobs because the hours and the pay is not acceptable at all
bad,"- picked orders to ship out. "
bad,"Can be busy, little to no help for cashiers, always short staffed, can be overwhelming when there isn't adequate help to get customers through the line"
bad,no hours four  your associate you as a manger pretty much do all the work. The regional manager is for his own kind you can kill yourself for there company they don't care. you are just a number
bad,Coworkers are rude the manager isnt very nice either. Not saying everyone has to be nice but it needs to be a comfortable working area. they would trash talk on everyone then act like friends to their face. it was just overall a bad place to work.
bad,This is a good place to work if it is only temporary and it isn't too far of a distance to travel. It's a 15 hour a week job and you get paid every other week.
bad,"Don't do it to yourself, the management was unprofessional. The store was always a wreck and customers complained a lot. items were always missing and draws were short"
bad,"Fun place to work at first but after a month in I started noticing a lot of drama and lack of team work with co-workers and Management.  Very Stressful, lack of communication from all parties. Unorganized and just overall emotionally exhausting work environment."
bad,Well to start the business is not ran the right way by management it's never organized the management think it's a game everyday they cut hours every week and on top of everything the pay and workload don't even put they overwork you and under pay you
bad,"Typical day of work consist of clocking in, reading emails, checking punches, walking the floor, doing assign stocking duty, provide breaks and lunches, recover the store and close the store"
bad,"I left because of poor staffing, upper mgmt support and guidance and the expectation that 12-19 hour days, working 6 days per week was acceptable with upper mgmt."
bad,"I worked in a small rundown Dollar Tree. However, the management would throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. They would also take credit for your work when the General Manager made an appearance. Would not recommend."
bad,"Expected to work long hours with only one weekend off per month. Low base pay. Can improve pay with bonuses, but not substantially. Minimum 10 hour days. Can't leave work before 5PM regardless of arrival time. (Example: 4:30AM-5PM on truck days). Very little payroll, so must do most of work yourself."
bad,As the only salaried manager in the building the store manager is at the mercy of his or her crew. Call outs and no shows influenced by job dissatisfaction and low wages are too common for the store manager to be able to take time off including regular days off during the week. On several occasions I was unable to get a day off for nearly a month at a time.
bad,"Not enough hours in a day to get everything done that needs to be done."
bad,No one really seemed to know what they were doing. I was put on the schedule when I showed up they say I was not suppose to work that day. Then later they would call and say can you come in I looked at the wrong day you were suppose to work. I worked a good 4 weeks then the manager says I'll call and tell you when to come in next. It's been 2 weeks and no call. Am I fired? Why am I not on the schedule? I did not do anything wrong. Either way they should communicate. I applied for the job because I need/want a job.
bad,"I love working with the company Dollar tree, I enjoy seeing the smile on the customers faces. However; the management needs some improvement, I have noticed that some of them don't do there jobs correctly in that put more work on the employees"
bad,"The management was pretty good. The work environment was crapped not lively at the pay really wasn't the best especially days the truck came. The hardest part was days the truck unloaded 2,500 to 4,000 pieces"
bad,I had a productive management.  Store was always busy no air-conditioning now it's completely worse with the new workers and new management I worked there when it had order
bad,Lowest pay imaginable in any retail business. Advancement is only bases on how well you kiss a**. Corporate policies are never followed unless it is used to force people out. Rules and Federal Work Laws are only followed if under investigation from Gov Agencies.
bad,"A typical day consist of  checking all e-mails, monitoring schedule changes, placing orders for weekly freight deliveries.  Checking for zero stock inventory, weekly cycle counts, checking in venders, reviewing weekly and monthly promotions."
bad,The maintenance department at the distribution center wasn't professional. They did not know anything about maintenance . You have to train management on maintenance procedures and techniques.
bad,"Was a great job for many years, but after Family Dollar acquisition, the entire company culture changed for the bad. Benefits were cut to save company money, and payroll was cut over 50% in stores the last 3 years."
bad,"As a manager you should be able to enjoy your job. At dollar tree that is impossible. Their expectations are unrealistic. Hours constantly get changed. High turn over rate for not only cashiers but management as well. Even if you apply for a store near you there's a possibility of just being placed anywhere. Store managers are rude and uninviting. Working at dollar tree has made me completely miserable and made me hate retail, something I once loved."
bad,"Everybody there was disrespectful, and the disrespect and the pay amount wasn't worth working there. The building was very filthy and the managers didn't know what to do their selves, very unorganized."
bad,"working for Dollar tree is a great place to work for there is opportunity for advancement. I learned customer service, I had excellent mgmt. to work with same as my work peers. the most enjoyable part of my job was working in the public eye with the customers. my learning experiences with Dollar tree were great we were tested on a computer to better our customer service."
bad,They were so unorganized.  Wasn't that much money being paid. Too much work and not enough pay. You did sweating a lot a walking around Stocking and being mistreated by managers.
bad,To maintain all merchandise handling and stocking. Observe and train employees. I learned that I am fair and can handle high pressure situations very well. Management is typically fair but the district management team is very corrupt in my opinion. Co-workers are hard working and easy to communicate with. The hardest part of working at Dollar Tree was dealing with unjust decisions out of my control. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing a smile on customer faces and employees when I came on shift.
bad,"Stocking shelves, unloading trucks and management good to work with. Greet customers and help them find items. Which products from one season to another."
bad,I worked for this company years ago. I was a slower employee and my manager had no problem telling the other employees how slow I was. I would usually work the evening shift. My shift would end at 9 :30 and I was told I had to stay sometimes until after 11 pm. The store was very poorly managed. I had also divulged to my manager that I had been abused as a minor. She than embarrassed me in front of my other coworkers how I had been abused. The products they sell in the store are sometimes broken. I personally did not enjoy working here at all
bad,The work place hectic day in and day out. No exceptions! lack crew makes it hard to get things done and yet the company wants results.
bad,"they stay with there items crowd, selling food that been out of freezer for days and rude. they call you for your schdule when i stared working they paid right out of the safe know card or check."
bad,"put things back where they go"
bad,The place is a very fast pace. They have high expectations and get no recognition for doing good deeds. Not enough pay for the amount of work.
bad,I already done my review on this company they have great health and dental insurance but very poor overall care for their employees!!
bad,"Customers service, heavy store traffic, always busy, close to home, good management team, work well with others, long hours, not good"
bad,"My first Job was at Dollar Tree,its a great place to work ,ive learn alot within my time being there.Manger shows that you're appreciated at all times ."
bad,"Dollar Tree is one of the worst companies I have yet to have worked.  The strive for customer service, communications and structure needs to be reevaluated.  Not all stores run the same, however management didn't want to see progression in the company once seen I was fit to run my own store, then took upon herself to tell my district manager I no longer wanted position as she told me I had to choose my child or Dollar Tree.  No employer should ever expect that as a choice.  I went above and beyond to do my job and duties and it was all taken for granted and I was let go without any discharge as to being work related, no discharge papers as I was fired for scandalous reasons.  Dollar Tree was a fast stepping stone and I could see myself going extremely far in a company just not Dollar Tree, shouldn't have to worry if job was lost that day because you made the manager made.  Personal conflicts should not be reflected. Dollar Tree has lost a lot of great assets to the company because of poor upper management."
bad,"Typically you take complaints and orders from your supervisor. Not a team job. I have learned how to hide feelings from the public to get through the work day. Some co-workers are ok to work with but you have some where you have to pick up the slack for them. Hardest part of the job is trying to get all of your cases out plus give customer service to customers when you are the only associate working. Also your hours are constantly being cut you are required to work anywhere between 5hrs to 15 hours a week BUT that's if the Store Manager favors you (NOT BECAUSE OF HOURS BEING LOW this is a term managers like to use frequently at this job). Most enjoyable part of the job is coming in contact with the public, making someone day and being appreciated for what you do from a customer and from those associates who value your hard  work."
bad,The company is a terrible place to work. Turnover rate is extreme high. There is no opinion for growth. The store manager is very inconsistent and fail to acknowledge his employees.
bad,"Working for this company for 16 plus years seen the good, bad, and the ugly. I have seen this companies struggles. Down sizing unknown so watchout if you make over $46,000 a year you may loose your job too. They need the money for the merger don't be fooled. They will come up with all the punches. Give the stores hours to run them you want shorter lines and building a brand start showing your employees that they are appreciated no one wants to work 50 to 60 a week trying to get the store back on track because you want to cut hours on Thursday the people already have less hours anyway. If you work during the holidays cut all your Associates down to hire more people then cut the hours so everyone had 10 hours or less. WOW This company does not care for its Employees. Greedy.... Hire external and give them more money. Work ten years with the company your pay doesn't come  close"
bad,"It started to be a dream job, but then went down hill, management got bad , the hours got long, and the help got worse. I worked a 10 hour day, unloaded trucks , stocked ,scheduled ,banking, ordering stock, cashiering half the time, gave customer service."
bad,The workday was typically busy. I learned a lot about how to load trucks and pick products also.. M coworkers were very cooperative in offering their assistance when needed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the pressure. the most enjoyable part of the job was the schedule..
bad,"Just okay, definitely nothing more.  I don't see myself having a career in such predicaments."
bad,When i was Working for dollar Tree . Ive learned Many Values Such as greeting people .
bad,"I really do not like working at Dollar Tree, especially with the managers being there."
bad,"Being a stocker at Dollar Tree should be a no brainer, but when you are constantly having to deal with hours being cut, or Upper management being a monkey wrench in the daily operations of the store, it wears you down. Not to mention that promotions and there attendant pay increase wont happen unless you are constantly in the ear of you DM. The turnover is so high, but the company would rather blame the failed associates are weak or subpar, instead at looking at the policies and enviroment that leads to such a high rate of turnover."
bad,"The HR dept is in no way out there to protect the employees in any way.  They are only there to help the company, no matter what's right and wrong."
bad,"The upper management was always talking down the other and making us change our whole store every other week because they didn't like what the other made us do. They were all very unorganized and rude people. "
bad,Get merchandise and stock them appropriately. Unskilled labor; not much to learn. Manager turnover rate is high. Co-workers care about self. Climbing in order to stock merchandise is hard. 
bad,love my job need more pay;love counting da money and doing things on the computer just wished we didnt work on sundays
bad,"The dollar tree is a okay place to work, but they need to do better about their short breaks and their poor starting pay rates for employees for when they start. Management is great. Coworkers need to know how to stop judging people before they come into the door."
bad,I had fun at work because the co workers are very nice and friendly and i always seen somebody i know come in the store and talk to me. The hardest part of the job was having to do other things around the store while i was constantly bombardedat the register because sometimes i would be the only one up at the registers and we were always short staffed.
bad,Dollar tree was the most awful place to starting with scheduling and ending with the way management runs the store at the fallbrook location not enough cashier's on there busy times of the day to the short staff during there busy times and etc.
bad,Nothing was organized at all. Always messy around the store. Didn't have a working bathroom. Not that many hours to work after Christmas. Very low pay.
bad,"I like working, & my job to a point, but pay, hours, overall care for employees is poor. We r supposed to do so much with no hours which when u put this on employees it carry’s over to the customers. Even though a lot of them destroy our store I bust my bleep to do my best for me."
bad,Not enough hours to live on customers are friendly always meeting new people I loved my customers but kept being put on the night shift cuz I have a car
bad,The month of December wrecks the store. Empty and trashed. You get around 350 - 380 payroll hours a week the month of December. January rolls around and they cut you back to 160-170 a week. You can't schedule stocking shifts or recovery shifts. You can't recover from Christmas. And then corporate is mad that your sales are down and your store is trashed.
bad,They tell you that you’re full time and give you 4-5 hour shifts . The pay is absolutely trash. But my managers were nice. They also have no consideration for employees time .
bad,"i’ll start by saying i hated working for dollar tree. it was a chill and laid back job depending on the manager on duty. the main gm was HORRIBLE! everything is unorganized, you never get off when you’re supposed to, the store is always a mess there’s tons of go backs and recovery... I could go on. you do way too much for $8 a hour I don’t recommend!"
bad,"No place for advancement , the pay for assistant manager is 11 per hr no lunch breaks only 10 minutes paid. Assistant Managers work 35 hrs per week. Cashiers 5 hrs a day min 20 hrs per week. No advancement at all !!"
bad,Loved my job. A merch manager came from LA as a fill in SM and he has not the slightest idea how to run a business. Needs a lot of ediquite skills. Also has teased this store.
bad,It was nice in the beginning but  now I'm not happy. The associates are nice but not treated fairly. I'm looking for different work. If things change I will stay
bad,The environment was hectic and nothing had a designated place to be. I learned what not to do at this job. The jib was super easy and faced paced. The customers were always a joy to deal with as well.
bad,I worked there for 7 yrs. Nothing there is consistent. DM's just tell you what u need to hear. Then they dont follow thru .... I literally wasted 7 years giving it my all. I did what was expected of me. I proved myself over and over. I kept being told I was too nice. Really?
bad,"There is no minimum wage in New Hampshire, so we follow the federal minimum wage law which is $7.25/hr. It’s an okay job if you’re part time and go to high school or something, but it’s seriously not worth it for the money. I was miserable working here"
bad,Dollartree needs to pay employees more than 8 dollars an hr . Asst. Managers about 12 he. Managers average 40 a year salery. Managers usually end up working 60 hrs. Only get paid for 48 weekly.
bad,"Don’t even try to work here if you like drama. The co-workers go behind your back and talk about you like a dog to one of the assistant managers and then they try to act fake in front of you like nothing happened and they put on fake smiles. They explain how to do things to you like you’re “slow” or “dumb” . Oh yeah and did I say that the pay is HORRIBLE??! The breaks are short (only 10 minutes) I was there for 5 weeks. I just couldn’t go any further. They work you like a dog for 7.35 an hour. This job is only good if you are a student or are living rent free. But I do recommend you not working at this specific location. "
bad,I was made to do job higher than my job description without proper pay. Promised higher wages constantly with no effect. I would sometimes have to work alone due to the lack of employment.
bad,Dollar tree was not a good experience my checks were getting smaller and smaller the longer I worked.  They worked around my schedule very good but I felt like I was getting cheated.
bad,I am the merch asm. I work nights and weekends. I feel like i never get to see my family. So if you have a small child dont be a manager. The pay sucks. You are constantly stocking the store. No discounts. I made more money as a waitress getting paid way less.
bad,"no structure or organization to that place at all, I was hired to do one job and when is started they said they do not even have that job available yet so they stuck me wherever they wanted and require too much out of one person.  I am a very good worker, but they just ask way too much."
bad,"Not a good place to work. The only get 4-5  hours weekly."
bad,It's a good job just not paying much. Company expects too much but paying employees in very low wage that is not suitable for cost of living. It is just work for school allowances or extra cash if your making money from other businesses.
bad,I don’t recommend this company as a good place to work it is highly unorganized and some may even say it’s a hazard to work in the back. The inventory is not organized at all and is sometimes stacked so high I felt it unsafe to work
bad,"Pay does not commensurate with what is expected. You work hard for a measly $12 an hour. They don't want to hire full time people because they would have to give you benefits. "
bad,Was never enough hours. Pay was so low couldn't keep up wit bills because of this. Didn't have enough people on at times the lines will be so long the customers will start to complain.
bad,Dollar tree is an ok place to work if your looking for part time work no benefits and not to much room for advancement. You will be working extremely hard for minimum wage
bad,"The worst job ever. The management sucks. The manager is horrible, she is extremely lazy. Sits in the office all day on her phone and constantly goes out for cigarette breaks. She was extremely bossy and doesn’t do anything. Basically all the workers do there own thing. The employees were cool it was the manager who always brought our mood down. You get yelled at for standing for like one minute and always told you’ll be written up in front of the customers. The store is very unorganized. Not enough staff. Too many people stealing and not taking control. My position was stocking and there was nobody to ever helped me. I busted my balls trying to get stuff out and still it wasn’t enough for the pay."
bad,"Working at Dollar Tree is one step up from loansharking, drug dealing, and pimping (with none of the income or glamor).  This is a minimum wage employer.  Annual wage increases are, maybe twenty-five cents (AND NO MORE!) . A shift is 4 hours and then they don't want to know you (go away, get out of here ...)   You'll get some extra hours around holidays, but during slack times of the year you may be lucky to get one 4 hour shift per week!  Work here so you can say that you're ""employed"" and look for another job where you'll get a better wage and consistant hours per week. Don't bother giving notice, for if they decide to fire you, they're not going to give you notice!"
bad,I had to move BK home had family emergency they black listed me so I could bere get another job at any Dollar tree very unprofessional and didn't take considering that I want from ga I had to go home family member dies and they got angry yelled and made sure wnevrr a g ainget a j ok vb
bad,I worked here in Northern NJ. I have never seen dirtier stores combined with horrible customer service and truly poor management. The pay for is bad. May be a good starter job for high school kids.
bad,"I have worked for dollar tree for 4 years, I liked the other employees (cashiers, stockers) my SM,DM kinda really didn't do anything everyone was just there to do a job like I said some of the people I met there are great I would not recommend working here unless you want unfair pay, 5 hrs a week and don't mind being used and abused and under appriciated.."
bad,"The store is always an absolute mess, and because of lazy stockers & uncaring customers, keeping it clean, organized, and pleasing to the eye is next to impossible."
bad,The job was ok but the store manager was very unprofessional. Her mood swings were annoying. The first week I was there the hours given to me were fine but as the weeks went by I got less and less. hours . 1 day fo 4 hours.  I understand it is a part time job but this ridiculous.
bad,Corporate is terrible. Always over stocked with stuff we don’t need/have too much of. Not enough room for stock. Trucks always a mess unloading. Always missing something
bad,The expierence I had was horrible but I don't put anything past Dollar Tree Corporation it's self. If I had a opportunity to to work with Dollar tree but at a different store I would. Retail is a okay job but for some people it just isn't good enough.
bad,"It would take me years to explain everything that’s wrong so I’ll try to keep it short and sweet. The manager I worked with on an everyday basis is amazing. But the district manager is the worst kind of person. Line cooks at McDonald’s made the same as I did and I was an asm. We broke our backs working on that store and all she could do was print out what was wrong (which were tiny petty things). She didn’t listen to people’s availibilty, scheduling them days they couldn’t show up leaving us short staffed. When we can’t come into work because of severe weather it was our faults. Whenever other stores were closing early durning the freeze we were open late. My car battery was completely killed because of the cold and yet it was still my fault. She promised positions that were never given. We empty the back room and she filled it back up. She took credit for things we did in front of her higher ups. The entire system there is messed up and toxic to all positions involved. The only thing it’s good for is people with disability and ssi."
bad,"I never worked more than a 4-5 hour shift. And, when you're making 7.25/ hr., that's no money. They hardly scheduled me. I might've worked 3-4 days a week. I had one friend working with me, but I got along with everyone else alright too. My managers were all pretty laid back. The hardest part was getting stuff stocked while keeping an eye on the register. The most enjoyable part was going on lunch and buying a bag of chips and a drink for $2."
bad,A typical day at dollar tree was great. I've learned that you should be patient with others. The management were all friendly and made working fun with great.
bad,It is a good job for a school student who wants to work while going to school. But for a working adult the pay was very bad. I would not recommend this company to people due to the fact that management has some flaws but overall it wasn't very bad. News some work
bad,"Senior friendly, good local location. Close to residential homes and shopping center.  Provides employment for many students. Friendly atmosphere, management readily available for assistance."
bad,A typical day at dollar tree was a regular day at work. The management wasn't bad. I didn't see anything that stood out to me about management that I think would need to be known.
bad,"Started out as a great job. Management quickly became hostile, rude, and rather harassing. All around a hostile environment. Easy to get time off when needed however and other shifts to pick up."
bad,"Unpleasant work environment. Very difficult customer base, very inconsistent replenishment system, unclean, poor upper management support. antiquated inventory management resources. The hardest part of the job was not being able to maintain consistent merchandise levels merchandising integrity."
bad,It is very stressful because of the poor store management. the cashiers and some of the management staff are fun to work with. You don't get paid enough or get enough hours. But they are flexible with the hours you do work.
bad,Managing needs more updates on servicing the public restrooms and cleanliness of the business overall. Providing world-class service to customers is important to me.
bad,they didnt let you have a full break but only 10 nminutes they didnt care about your well being.or you really they only gave you so many hours and mainly because managment got the most hours out of anybody.
bad,The people I worked with were very nice and understanding everyone cared for each other.  The store manager is awful he doesn’t care about the employees doesn’t care if you dont feel well he’s awful! The assistant managers were great always Cared and I love them! ❤️
bad,"work days are long and sometimes non productive, non productive, non productive, not enough payroll, not enough payroll in all of the dollar tree store"
bad,"Was a manager for 4 years. Lead stock team, overnights for larger store. Turnover was unreal. Hard to do job when constantly having to replace people who quit cause it's too much work for little money. Hire in at minimum wage which is ridiculous.  No benefits unless full time mgr. Benefits are expensive. NO overtime allowed. Freight is delivered by box and walked by hand. Large stores have ridiculous amounts of freight and no where to put it in small stores.  Almost impossible to keep up with freight every week and demands of job plus manager aspect. Hardly any manager team. I left because there was just too much for me to do to keep that place above water. Associates don't get paid enough to care so they work at slow pace. Very angry environment, customers always rude and nasty, messy. Impossible to keep store recovered. Very little hours to actually do what is expected .  Basically, managers do most of it with few employees, five hour shifts.  If you have a poor manager, you are double stressed.  I will NEVER work for a dt again. It stresses you out to the point where you dread going to work. Benefits aren't worth that."
bad,It was hard work for a women to throw 3200 boxes a day whether they big or small heavy or light. Cases of sodas and juices and water even gallons! I think a women shouldn’t have to do that kind of work in a warehouse especially when youth ave to work 10 to 12hrs a day.
bad,"What I know is to treat all people fairly and with respect. Build relationships and those people will be there to go over and beyond. Cashiers are only paid minimum wage, and are expected to do stock as well, even if there is only one cashier for the day."
bad,"First off the store management and coworkers are awesome; some of the best people I've worked with."
bad,"I did not work there long. I was required to purchase uniform attire from desired retail store. I knew in advance that the job was not guaranteed but to require us to purchase a uniform and then only give hours to others when we were told that we would work for two weeks. That in my opinion was unfair. "
bad,This job is a good place to work when you are fresh out of highschool but its not a great place if you have a family and kids its to much for to little to do
bad,"this isn't a place to work if you don't like being rushed. You will be given a certain amount of time to stock however many boxes they give you. If you're not finished in that time, you will get wrote up."
bad,"This company has an abusive culture that demands heavy work loads with very few hours for associates. Most employees are paid minimum wage part time. The company says they offer industry standard pay, however in reality it is far below that. Most of the work load falls on the salaried store manager because the stores are never given enough hours to even the work load out to hourly employees. All assistant managers are hourly and are paid $1.00 over minimum wage"
bad,"I worked at two different Dollar Tree locations in two separate states, which I am certain added to the different attitudes towards employees. In Utah the employees were treated decently. In California however employees were routinely treated like criminals, between management literally telling you ""The company accounts for at least $3.00 a day in employee theft, so we keep a pretty close eye on you."" to your district managers meeting the closing team as they're leaving to go home for the night so they can check your bags. Along with a dispassionate corporate attitude towards the well being of their employees, I don't recommend this job if you have other options."
bad,"I worked for Dollar Tree for 5 months and I came to the job right out of college. Every employee at the store was treating me like a child. The current management staff did not take me serious because I have not been with the company long enough. Even though, i made sales and competed well with other stores in my district, they were stressing me out with taking away all of my free time away from work. I wish, i like sooner."
bad,They give you extra work and little pay. The manager was a arrogant man and he yelled at you. They give you one task and then go be you another. Very stressful.
bad,"I think they should be more appreciative to their employees and treat them better. There needs to be security, because people steal everyday here. Also The pay needs to go up with all the maintenance and duties that need to get done by the employees."
bad,"Horrible pay for such great and dedicated workers. Also for a company that's not supposed to hire family members, some managers hire there's  and make them managers and that's just not fair to everyone else...but hey we are the little people."
bad,"Pay was horrible was expected to cover for calls off as long as you agree you are liked, dont bother talking to your DM or Corporate they have a hugh rug problems are sweep under"
bad,Fast paced work environment. Flexible schedule. Could have better management and assistant managers. The pay is not good. No benefits.
bad,"I love working with the people. The job is a good job, the company is not for the people. There is no challenges for me there. There is no room to grow. I go in and read the emails. I count the safe money set up the employee who is coming in for the day or night shift. we count their draw and make sure that their draw is right amount of money. I get them set up and fill out their daily sheet on what they need to do for their shift. I pull down the employee who is going home for the day I do an audit on them and a z read on them and count their money and hope their draw is right. I do all the paper work that needs to be done on them and they have to sign. I then get my stuff ready and I walk the store and start pulling the store forward what we call facing it. so everything is pulled to the front. The most import and most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers and helping them out and making the store look full and stocking the store. I love working in the office and dealing with applications and figuring out how to make the numbers work within the schedule but I do not do that much."
bad,"come in count your draw , clock in make sure store is clean and in order help customers if they need help finding anything . and cash people out when they ready to leave."
bad,"I enjoyed some of co-workers I shared work time with. Others need some retail respect and manners."
bad,Moving up to manager was my favorite part about this job. Great experience on how to run a store.
bad,"Expect to do everything and get paid minimum wage. $3 over or under on your draw you get wrote up. 11 minute breaks if you go over your wrote up, under your wrote up. Employee purchases have to be bought single items with individual receipts. If a customer decides they don't want something you have to call for a sup to over ride or you get written up. There is so much more to write about that is wrong with this company. I had a horrible experience."
bad,it was a fun place to work but the pay and hours were not that great and neither were the benefits that you didn't get. however this would be the perfect place for a high school student.
bad,"A good place to work/ but no roon to move up,, even the store manager has no say about running the store"
bad,a regular day at work was always fast paced . good team work and a easy to learn.
bad,Not the best place to work considering all the long hours put into the store and not getting any help from your DM
bad,"When I first started, I wasn't in the system for an entire month, the manager that hired me walked of the job on my second day, and I recently received an email that they are getting sued by current employees for not paying them for their full hours of work and cutting out overtime hours of managers."
bad,easy job co-workers where fun manager was easy to talk to did not like the pay
bad,"Great place for an entry level job.. Compensation is not what it should be."
bad,Training and in store experience was very bad. Trainer had me working freight instead of learning how to . District manager was negative and blunt. The store was a high shrink . Multiple managers being terminated for stealing.Registers and other equipment broken or not repaired by previous store manager.
bad,It was nice speaking with the manager an talking to her and getting to know her and working with her but at the same time sense her leave absense the store has gone down hill theres hardly any hours an the managers under nieth her dont do there job right as management
bad,"Does not follow corporate policies, does not care about employee safety, OSHA regulations, company assets, customer satisfaction, customer safety. My manager would not allow me to secure the building with the security alarm at close."
bad,"Poor pay every two weeks, the only good thing that happened for me at the Dollar tree was I met a lot of good people built my clientelewith the customers for the four and a half years I work there I was adopted into three different families and I always welcomed me with open arms and very happy to see me same with myself I was very happy to see all of them"
bad,My management team made it pleasant. She didn’t hire many people so we could actually make money. The salary is extremely low. However after she left so did i. The employees in store tripled we weren’t allowed more then 15 hours a week. Management get bonuses for keeping the hours down
bad,"to me working for this company kinda sucked, the treatment of the staff from my experience was poor an that they dont do any advancements into the company an dont care about well being of others."
bad,"Great managers, only reason I've stayed working there. There is NO opportunity for advancement, dollar tree has a policy against giving raises, even when my manager tried the system wouldn't allow him. You're constantly pressured to put out a huge amount of stock when you're working a few hours a day for minimum wage."
bad,"You’re barely scheduled, you will get walked over, Management is really bad, pay is not good, and I would never recommend working here to anyone. If you’re not a favorite to the managers then you barely work. And you’re basically an escape goat to half the people who work there"
bad,Having great customer service also stocking in making sure the customers us happy. Making sure that the products is is up to date in making sure everything is stock right.
bad,Management was never available to open the store so I can get my job done. I was always on time and willing to work. Never missed a day. Some of the employees never liked doing their job and that was sad. Then they laid me off!
bad,Nothing to tell or say about this company. everything was poor and ridiculous and no i will not require anybody to work at that location at  all whatsoever
bad,Wen i start working with dollar tree they were very nice helping u wuth hr and days of work now on this date they cut my hr from 35 to 9.20 hr a week.
bad,"Dollar Tree does not compensate their good employees for their good work, after 3 years I'm still making min. wage. Your hours are based on the production from the previous year. And weekly scheduled hours can range from 0-20 hrs. per that week ."
bad,"I had helped this location from the initial set up of the new store, at Grand opening, and part of the summer. I miss my stock crew and would like to come back but since I have left, the store has went down hill fast. Already the 1 year anniversary is coming up and this store has went through 2 store managers. Boxes everywhere; creating dangerous hazards. Staff is UNDERPAID. If you stock in the mornings, you have to put out a certain amount of boxes per shift. Sometimes the goals are unrealistic where your section is already overstocked."
bad,"My hardest part about this job was I couldn’t make enough money for the position I had,nor did I get the reasonable amount of pay so I do not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"The store I worked at was new when I worked there, I started second week after opening with no experience as a cashier. I had retail experience before as I worked as a temp at a CVS store but never register. At first it was fun I liked the job enjoyed the people and I was working at least 12 hours a week. When the new manager took over she favored the speed of other cashiers so she gave them more hours. Her stockers suffered and the store didn't meet its income requirements so our hours were constantly cut to where some days she would have to run the store herself. Unpro"
bad,Dollar Tree could care less about their Customers or their employees which are two of the most important things in any Business. Long lines at cash registers and no overtime allowed by Corporate to help ease Customer frustration. This Company just does not care at all about it's Customers or Employees. I traveled two hours one way to work a four hour shift just to watch Customers standing in line because this Company wont allow the manager to have a bigger budget to pay more cashiers. How greedy and sad and thoughtless can you be.
bad,"They cut a lot of corners and if OSHA walked through they would shut them down."
bad,"A lot of hard work. not enough pay, not help.  unload trucks by hand.  no support from asset protection.  need to rethink pay structure for the work required."
bad,Would not recommend working at Dollar Tree on any level. Management does not support one another. Regular employees turnover rate was super high due to nobody cares about the work.
bad,Management doesn't care about its employees. They only care about what you can do for the company. They don't care for the safety of their employees. They want to over work you for very little pay.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at dollar tree. I had no hours, my checks was not even enough to pay my phone bill. I asked for more hours but i only had gotten 5 hours a day."
bad,"I worked at Dollar tree for almost 4 months and both the pay and the hours were trash. I mean if you're in desperate need of a job then it's alright, which I was when I started working here. Cashiers are expected to be able to run  register and stock merch on the shelves throughout their shifts, which depending on what shift "
bad,the benefits are horrible although company pays your medical portion if you are an hourly associate. Co-pays are high and the portion they pay might as well be zero. My manager was the best I have ever worked for in the corporate offices. Went to dollar tree direct which is their online ordering department  it went downhill from there. The people you work with are cut throats with the exception of a few. I would not recommend working for this company the bad out weigh the good.
bad,"Not only is the pay minimum wage but you stay part time so they don't have to give you benefits. I was hired as a cashier but you are expected to stock a certain number of cases per shift as well as run to the register everytime you have a customer, so you never get to stock as you should. My first day I was shown how to log on and was left by myself as the ONLY  cashier. This job makes enough revenue to be able to pay their employees better. YOu make more money at a fast food restaurant then you would here. Driving across town for a 4-5 hour job isn't worth it."
bad,"It was just a job I needed in emergency. I had high hopes for the position. Early days, low hours. The management was great. Amount of hours was unsatisfactory."
bad,I think they need to pay more and give more hours. It is an ok place to work at very friendly place to work. I also think they need benifits. the management is great.
bad,"They work you a minimum of 51 hours a week, as a salaried manager.  Basically, at the end of the day, you earn less per hour than your assistant managers because of the minimum 48 hours that need to be worked, 51 hours including lunch"
bad,"Its an ok place to work but no room for advancement, long time before a raise and never full time hours. location is ideal on a bus route and close to bower mall"
bad,no benefits worst management dead end job no advancement only for a high schooler i liked some of my co workers the manager was not fair cut my hours because i found a second job
bad,Working for this company has been an experience. The customers are awesome for the most part. The management has changed hands so many times but overall we came together as a team to accomplish goals that were set forth
bad,"Being that the volume changes in the daily drops, the kind of day you have. Some days you may not have as much work as other days. Since i have been with this company i have learned a lot. I started off as a order selector, picking and shipping out freight for the different stores. I then moved to a traniee. Training new associates. I learned how to drive the epj, that's when i started picking offline. I learned how to pick break pack and expense using the RF.  etc"
bad,"Horrible place to work The Dollar Tree in Joliet IL. I wouldn't work there even if I was in need of a job again, Gave those people 2 years of slavery, Working in Shipping is the hardest department and they get paid the same as everybody else."
bad,"You Learned if you know how to teach yourself, & although they are not many, there are some good days, but trying to run a store where the backroom is out of control and the company want help by cutting some freight off the truck's but  I am expected to work or possible kill myself to get the work that keeps coming but work all of that in the back as well!"
bad,Alright place to work if you enjoy working in a fast pace environment doing everything in the store on your own. To much favoritism with the employees and staff
bad,Just keep your mouth close and get your work done. The managers and assissant managers are completely useless. They always pass the work they don't want to do unto the workers.
bad,The work environment was dirty and unreasonable. The management was nice but no one seemed to care to much about the job itself. It was fast pace but the environment was unpleasant.
bad,I believe they work people like dogs when they need them for holidays or anew store opens then when the dust settles youre lucky to get 8-12 hours a week
bad,"Liked interacting w/customers by talking to them,blowing up balloons or helping them find items. some customers were very friendly. hours are part time for cashiers."
bad,"I worked very hard and dedicated my life for this company, and in return I was treated as though I didn't matter to a single person there. The advancement was very quick, but too good to be true."
bad,Its a ok place to work. Work at this place when I was younger. Really low on hours. The building closed down. I will recommend the job for a teenager
bad,Did the go backs and cleaned up the store. Mgmt was not too helpful but got along with other coworkers. most enjoyable part was helping people
bad,"The first duty of the day greet the customers entering into organization. Handling all cash transaction of the organization, guiding and solving queries of customer"
bad,working here you dont give enough hours and you always get cut the break room is a joke its in the stock room which is hot muggy and you have to go through boxes to get to a seat. your break is ten minutes. you cant call off without giving them a 2 week notice .  and you if you do they will fight you to come in.
bad,"The manager at the Powder Springs location in Marietta, Ga is very rude and unprofessional and made it a point to express groups that the company does not hire, particularly people with physical or neurological disabilities. I am glad my clients and relatives were not hired at this company and I will be sure to tell everyone at every opportunity to join me in spending our money elsewhere."
bad,"A typical day at work everyone always talked about who was getting fired, who thought they were getting fired."
bad,"I like the job but cannot make a living based on the hours and pay. The manager is good man but the higher-ups takes obvious short-cuts at every chance they get like cheap bags,expired products, no benifits at all and very short brief shifts"
bad,Its a ok job my store manager is really nice. I wish they would promote faster
bad,"Corporate expects smaller stores to run exactly like bigger stores, only with a fraction of employees, & hours to give them. As management, we are often expected to do the work of several people, yet, we're not given hours to complete anything. Stockrooms are piling up, with no hours to throw any freight. It's volume, volume, volume, with no regard for employees or their safety."
bad,I loved this job becay\use i loved working with people the enviroment was great and they always scheduled perfectly for the most part it was orgasnized
bad,The job in itself is good and the co-workers were alright to work with but not worth it for the pay i was getting the job wasn't all that good. I was told i would make more than i did
bad,Well i would like the job but they dont turn on the air conditioning and i am overheating all the time. There is always work to do! Seems like they have a hard time aquiring decent employees. Store manager is awesome. The other 2 female managers are great to. The customers are rude and trashy.
bad,"First off... the pay. Omg. I started off at $7.25 an hour as a cashier...worst pay I’ve ever had. After 3 weeks I was moved up to Assistant Store Manager. Then I was making $9.25. Not the best but much better. Even my manager didn’t make good money and he had been there for 3 years... nobody in the store made more than $12 an hour. And the ones that did make about that, were the full time managers. I do NOT recommend getting a job at Dollar Tree."
bad,"Very unorganized, un professional very bias did not give proper training to the employees   The management was very bias no communication. Want the impossible done. not  workers"
bad,They cannot seem to keep managers in a lot of the stores. They do pay Assistant Managers pretty well. They do not give many stocking hours and barely enough cashier hours. This made it very hard to get anything done.
bad,Work for a place for over two years and only got $.15 raise was not fair for all the work that you had to do and all the hours you had to be thereLoved working with the people there Would not refer anyone there that was trying to raise a family at the dollar tree the cashiers do not get raises at all the district manager refused to give raises to a lot of people
bad,But dollar tree doesn’t care about their employees. They terminated me on my day off and I didn’t even get hurt on the job. Told me that if I can’t return to full duty that that have to terminate me
bad,Most of the people who came in stole from the store and none of the associates were allowed to do anything about it. The pay was minimum wage and no chance for advancement before a year of grunt work.
bad,Horrible place to work. I'm so glad I quit. Management was awful. No one cared expect when it came to firing people for no reason or writing people up for no reason.
bad,I recommend young people to work there. Like students this job is good for them not for a person that wants to move up in this field. For myself it was a wonderful place i got to meet some beautiful co-workers and we still friends til this day.
bad,"Dollar Tree as a corporation sucks. They don't give a rats butt hole about its workers and barely any more about their stores. Each location is different but the one I was working at had a great team of co-workers and managers. Quite frankly, that's the only reason why I stayed on as long as I have. I would recommended only if you had no other options."
bad,Dollar Tree doesn't pay their associates well and only wants them to work no more than 15 hours a week for minimum wage  it's very hard to find an assisstant managers who's want to work the third shifts and have high  expectations  To get the freight out in 48 hours and completed planograms in a very short period. Very hard to find anyone who is willing to work over nights. They don't pay their assistant managers what they are worth. Little pay for all the task that is  mandatory  This is way their stores are not cleaned or organize. When they do find the right associates they just don't want to pay them what their worth and still expect store managers to clean up a store that is far  Beyond  repair for one associates. This is why they keep   Promoting   Assistant Managers to store managers. Even when their not  capable of  managing a store yet. When they do hire externel they don't stay more than one month.
bad,"DC3 is distribution center that is more interested in creating turnover than distributing products.  The management staff is not trained on the jobs they are overseeing; they merely look at spreadsheets and ignore reality.  There is no preventative maintenance performed on any equipment and equipment will be used until it is completely broken.  The workload is not undoable if you are willing to work, however management will set you up to fail.  Mandatory OT is a weekly occurrence; even in the off season you will work 48-52 hours a week.  Family, school or other jobs are negated but management will take off whenever they want to.  From the moment you are hired, your every move is scrutinized and write-ups are frequent occurrences.  The average length of employment is 3 weeks which is why they are constantly blitz hiring."
bad,"bad management , other then that I loved it , its more about the customers then anything . As long as their happy you should be to."
bad,"I worked my tail off for Dollar Tree. I was hired as a part time cashier and was promoted to a full time assistant store manager within a couple short months. My store manager (direct supervisor) constantly discriminated against employees, talked about them in a derogatory fashion (even in front of customers) and forced myself as well as other assistant store managers falsify documents to suit her needs. I loved the work, but the environment was very unprofessional."
bad,"A typical day at Dollar Tree consisted of cashiering, cleaning and straightening the entire store, blowing up balloons, and emptying the trash. "
bad,"A typical day at work i would re-stock items, clean up around registers, say morning or afternoon announcements, and provided a friendly service as a cashier by making sure the customer found everything okay ,and made sure customers come in the store and out as quick as possible meaning check out customers quickly as needed. i learned that always being productive is what helps the company get finish with things in a appropriate manner. Management  was terrible there was only a few that knew what they were doing. Hardest part of the job was the Truck days in restocking items. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers out and understanding what they wanted."
bad,"I maintain cashiers ,I assist them with change,picks ups exchanges and audits. I also cash drawers out ,make deposits and change orders. Hardest part of the job is getting my co-workers to do what their told,and the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with money."
bad,They have bad management and no work pride. Got to meet new people rude or nice.
bad,This company has poor ethics and is not concern about theie managment team at all.
bad,"Dollar Tree is the worst company to work for. I do no recommend them at all. The upper management has no regards for family/personal time, was hardly ever able to use my PTO. Every year I gave back 30 + of PTO and they did not pay you out for them"
bad,They have order selectors jumping 6 feet in the air trying to reach product on pallets their first day!!! Super unsafe. They lie to you about what your job will be there. My trainer was extremely rude and didn’t wanna train me. I wouldn’t tell my worst enemy to work there.
bad,They start you out at minimum wage. They don't pay their managers enough. And allow verbal and physical abuse in their stores. If you work hard they put more on you and allow others to slack. And get away with disrespect.
bad,"As a member of management, this is a job that expects the world out of you... You can do the work of 3 people, bust your butt and drain yourself mentally and physically and receive absolutely nothing in return... The only thing you will ever receive for your sacrifice is a thank you, forget about asking for a raise. The district leaders would rather the company burn then reward you for your reliability and dependability which are the biggest issues as far as management goes."
bad,"I gave 1 star to Dollar Tree because it offer mostly 10 hours a week at $9.50 an hour, not enough hours or pay to survive or pay bills."
bad,Corporate for Dollar Tree don't care about there employees!!!! The store close to me has problems with kids coming in stealing & threatening the managers & the district manager and Corp will not do a darn thing!!! All they want is security in that store dollar tree says they can't afford it!!!!!!!
bad,"My manager was amazing. Coworkers were good too. Managers really tried to give me any hours they could which was 15 or less a week. But for 7.25 it does nothing. Can’t even pay any bills. On a good week of no days off because people called in and I took their hours, I got 335$ for my 2 weeks pay. Stupid."
bad,i learned how to run a cash regisister. The Manager was rude to me and to the customers. He made it a very hostle work envorment. I did however learn what I would do to make the work place better for the customers and the other employees if I was in his postion.
bad,This job isn't  worth it . You can't make a living working for this company. This job is for people that really don't need or have to work. They are not paying but 8.25 a hour no matter how much experience you have.
bad,"I was a store manager for dollar tree, company is in a constant mess on a daily basis trucks are days behind. No work life balance if I truck shows up you have to drop everything you are doing especially if it was your day off. Salary was terrible also our location was robbed twice at gun point did corporate ask if associates were okay nope didn't hear anything for four days only concern was how much money was missing."
bad,I used to love working for this company when I first started in Decatur Georgia I transferred to a store in Columbia South Carolina and the moral went down due to lack of better leadership
bad,a fast place working Environment but the hours was not what I was looking for this type of job was not for me I would like to see someone young and out going working there
bad,"This is one of the worst job I ever worked at. Management is horrible, too much overtime which take away your weekends, and the environment itself is extremely hot and disgusting. The only good part about this job is the benefits and payed lunches. I’m currently looking for another job due to poor management. I highly recommended no one to work here only if you need a job."
bad,Management is very disorganized and not helpful in many situations. Many empolyes with take advantage and the store manager doesnt do her job. It wasnt a fun experience
bad,"Worked from 4am until 10am once a week on a Thursday morning. Staff was tolerable, manager was shaky. Unfortunately was let go because I went looking for another job. Was very unreasonable, especially working only once a week."
bad,The managers prefer to go outside to go on lots of smoke breaks rather than do their job managers would prefer to blame others for management mistakes pay is barely minimum wage and ours are not consistent with what is scheduled
bad,Everyone was friendly helpful also speaking to customer the way you suppost to speak to customer and I use to welcome the customer to dollar tree clean stock/block item and run the register I even help close one time and count money
bad,"Would not recommend this job to anyone unless you like being treated poorly by the store manager, talked to like you are stupid, and 4-10 hours a week if you're lucky. Min. wage is NOT worth it."
bad,"I was given a temp SM position at a horrible store with high theft due to homeless, but the DM would always say it was internal theft. No hours, no work/life balance. DM hired people without me knowing before I took over and then gave me 00 hours to train them, including a PT manager. Trucks were always delayed by hours to days at a time and it would always mess up payroll, which there was barely any to work with. Youre no longer a person to them, you just become numbers(sales/hours)"
bad,"I loved this job and working with the community, I was a cashier and rang up eight hundred to one thousand people in a four and a half hour shift. I was able to meet the people in the neighborhood and I always went over and above my job duties. I was employee of the week all but 10 weeks that I worked there. I especially gave extra attention to the elderly by assisting with bags out the store and helping them to their vehicles. I often gave rides when i was off, if i saw someone needed extra help. During Christmas time I was given gifts unexpectingly from customers that really appreciated me (this made me tear up). This was a wonderful theraputic environment for me and never felt like work because i was able to help people."
bad,"Working at family dollar, I would stock the shelves with new items that have been shipped the night before. I learned that management in that current location was terrible. Hardest part was trying to talk to my manager because she was so rude and disrespectful. The most enjoyable part was helping customers, communicating with my workers."
bad,"The management was bad. They threw me on a register and literally told me to ""figure it out"" on a Saturday, which was very busy. My co-workers seemed very unhappy and urged me to get out while I could. Not an enjoyable experience for minimum wage."
bad,a typical work day at dollar tree deals providing customer service managers were respectful same as co-workers I liked being a cashier at dollar tree deals I like helping people
bad,The company will never pay a stocker above 7.35. Corporate does not want stockers working more than 15- 25 hours a week. They want a lot of work for their minimalist ways.
bad,A broken corporate business structure. Out of reach with business objectives and targets.
bad,poor working environment treated unfair did not have the support i needed as a new store manager.. very bad rodent issue in store could not continue working in these conditions
bad,"Pay is very low you only make $7.50 an hour, only work 15 hours a week, a lot of drama to deal with, and the store manager is very ratchet, very easy to get days off you just write it on the calendar and the manager will give you that day off once you put a week ahead. Customers are friendly and will talk to you like their own friends."
bad,it was a good place to work although it may seem insignificant you were able to build relationships with customers and as well with fellow co-workers.
bad,This company pays poorly and offers no incentives Expects employees to perform several jobs but only are barely paid for what they do Offers no bonuses or incentives to motivate workers
bad,They expect people to do more in not enough hours to complete the job. They continually cut hours. Also the people who get hired only get 5 to 15 hours per week.
bad,"not worth your time,effort,or energy.fast food makes more money.this will not pay your bills nor get you anywhere in life you need to be.honestly anything is better"
bad,They pay nothing have no benefits and expect you to bend over backwards the only reason I didn’t quit within a month is because I got lucky and had a great manager
bad,"Overall, I loved the store managers but cooperate on the other hand was very hard to work for and were just inconsiderate of their workers. Its not a hard job, if you can do basic math and stock items together neatly then this is your gig."
bad,"As with most of my jobs, I built a family here. As an assistant store manager, I lead crews, made sure product was out, met sales goals, dealt with customers and financials of the store. The hours were not acceptable anymore, due to family matters."
bad,"Typical day of work is calm and slow paced. Managers are lenient and coworkers are fun and cooperative. Only problem I had was the scheduling, I was only working 1 day a week."
bad,Poor management skills. This building need help with the right GMs. Instead of replacing the problem they rather try to fix the problems. I've been there for 3 going on 4 years. I trained over 5 managers and I'm just a regular associate.
bad,Dollar Tree is great if you're just starting out or need to get on your feet I was a cashier and used it as my stepping stone. The work is easy.......
bad,It was always great to see returning customers with a smile on their face. I learned that you need to stay busy even when it's slow. Management was difficult to deal with at times.
bad,Would not work there again. In the almost 2 years I worked never got a raise. I would have actually still been working there but I had to leave .Great  neighborhood store. A lot of seniors really  appreciated it since most were on a fixed income. Just a great neighbor store.
bad,"The hardest part of working at Dollar Tree was you never know when you would run into a rude customer , or a co worker might come in with a bad attitude and you still haft to deal with that person to complete the job."
bad,I started out as a cashier and it was good. Once I became a manager it went downhill. Dollar Tree took over my life and expected too much of one person. It took months to receive a raise when I became a manager. My schedule changed often and without notice most of the time. Upper management would cut hours and then write us up when things didn’t get done but how could they when hours got cut? But the absolute worst was when m mother died and I was given no time off. I had to work the day she died. “I’m sorry but you still have to close.” I finally quit after I got into a car accident when I was pregnant and they expected me to work the next day. I will never go back
bad,The atmosphere is cool to work with great people and not enough pay to live off of. The hours are flexible to what you want in the morning to the evening with the extra hours on the holidays .
bad,"They adjust empoyees worked hours reducing employees earnings. They lie about everything. Zero consistency, and management will go great lengths to sabatash unfavored employees and anyone who doesn't say yes to their last minute ever changing scheduling and unnessesary oncall freight shifts. Report them to Boli and other  agencies will end up making your life worse. Retaliation is expected and practicd by every level in the company. To the point they    public humiliation and defimation destroying your life. Even watched management laughing about forcing an employee from the place she rented and then trying to have that same employee now living in her storage,  calling the storage manager she rents from to have her kicked out if there too. They allowed people to come into the store and threaten the poor girl, and even went as far as to have her followed to her storage at night and harrass her repeatedly through out the night. All they had to say to her when she reported it to the store management and the district mangme t was it wasn't happening, and she was paraniid."
bad,"I didn't like working there because they wasn't giving me no hours to work."
bad,It was okay job . Just wish the paid more and give more hours . Also wish it was more a team not by yourself. The job was more like do what you can on your own
bad,Need to find another Job with more pay or more hours. Not enough paid or hours to help with my Bill's or living. I kind like the job but I rather work somewhere else
bad,"They over work you... I was offered a 6 cent raise after 7months cashier/stocker only making 7.35 an hr overtime is rare. Disorganized, staff drama. Only good for 1stt job"
bad,Like most job ppl are in they groups and the corporation managers are all buddy buddy. No one gets in trouble for the stuff they should cause they all friends. The managers are very disrespectful. They call you out your name. An the human resource for this company must be a joke. No matter what you let them know. one girl recording the general mangarr cussing at the assitant managee. Thevworst place ive ever workedJust blows me away.
bad,I feel like if someone have a day off the person with the day off should not have to come in less than 24 hours before her scheduled day off to work because other people can’t go over hours. The district manager should schedule more hours for the managers and employees so that if something comes up another person can cover.
bad,"When I first started working here the store was terrible, months later it approved a lot management changed. Its just stressful with kids and adults  stealing, and opening food eating thru store and leaving it on shelf,  now its not staying kept up like before. I do love talking to the customer"
bad,They only work you p/t but expect you to be on call. I'm not getting paid like a Dr. so why be on call like one. They have too many expectations but don't treat you fairly. Corporate is never impressed when they come into store. They show up unexpectedly and treat you so much less than. Also they stay so busy and don't give you enough help. Customers also don't give you respect.
bad,"This company has no care for its employees at all. The managers have their favorites and some in which they have affairs with gain more work hours and do no work besides hiding and taking breaks every hour. This company offers you nothing at all when it comes to benefits and will work you like a dog while their favorites do nothing. They call you in on short notice when no one shows up or calls out. They do not allow overtime or a pay raise, plus you will never move up in a position in this company’ unless you’re brown noise or friend of a manager. All and all never work for this company if you plan to I promise you it’s a waste of your time."
bad,"I didn’t like the job because I was fresh off an injured hand and couldn’t be in the cold. The manager had me working in the freezer, I explained the medical condition and she told me if I couldn’t work the freezer for me to leave"
bad,Don't recommend. Management doesn't seem to know how to train or at least they don't make sure you are following policies.  You are told to just scan any item when something isn't scanning a long as it is either food or non- edible product for what ever applies. Which orders the wrong products for restock.  I was yelled at & treated like dirt because was not properly trained. No hrs.& Low $
bad,Not my type of job. I like teamwork and communication. I worked a lot without getting benefits.  I was always called in on my off days. When I needed someone to come in on there off days it was no .
bad,"I worked here about 5 months and personally trained at least one other employee to use a cash register. I scored ""green"" on the manager assessment and had many co-workers congratulate me, stating they couldn't wait for me to take charge over a store that was having boxes piling up in the aisles. Despite my qualifications, I was never granted advancement. Instead, I worked even though I was running a high fever. My review, obviously, is based on my local store experience. The company has potential, but I personally would never send a friend here to work."
bad,early morning hours is the only positive thing i can say about this company.  management was horrible.  dirty disgusting back room.  worst i have ever been treated in any job in my life.  they will not value any hard work.
bad,"Dollar Tree was a very stressful place to work. I enjoyed assisting the customers, but, the stress of making sure the merchandise was stocked and the store clean was difficult to deal with."
bad,"working agt dollar tree wasn't a good job to have, you only work 4 hours a day and only make $8.25 an hour. wasn't worth my time whatsoever, would never recommend to anyone"
bad,A typical day at work would be to count the safe as soon as I would enter the store. Then count out the tills for the next cashier. Then unload or pack out boxes. Clean the store for the closing. Then finally close the store. count the safe again. Then the ending register tills. Prepare the deposit for the day. I learned how to manage a store and count money at a fast pace. I also learned how to file documents and keep a schedule. The hardest part of the job is to keep the lines on the registers moving. The most enjoyable part of the job was to keep the documents sorted and neat. I love working with computers and keeping schedules.
bad,It was OK working here as a cashier i love that everyone takes full advantage of the store for $1 no matter what. Itwas good enough to pass my time to get by.
bad,No hours show up and no truck comes so sent back home manager didn’t call when was running late for the 4am shift didn’t show up for a hour later do not work here
bad,"I was hired as a PT stocker, only got one day of training.  Management no good very unhappy no moral and not friendly.  The Manager would yell at me in front of customers and would be rude and yell at customers.  I was only there two days and manager never told me I was doing great job just be little me all day I could never do anything right with one day of TRAINING!!! I enjoyed stocking but could not work for unhappy people who did nothing but give you grief instead of encouragement and praise.  What a shame, I quit after my 7th day.  The pay is not worth the abuse by the managers and you get an 11 min break. I am not sure if this is how all the managers are at other locations.  What happened to customer service, care and friendliness, not at this place."
bad,"Managers are overworked and there are not enough of them so focus is not on the important, just enough to make it through the day. GM is not proficient and bases decisions on emotions, not good judgement or advice. dT as a company is worried about the dollar not the employee and the environment they work in. DT is not willing to change with the times and lives in a world that is changing and they are not changing with it."
bad,"If you’re looking for a job, do NOT work for Dollar Tree. Especially stocking overnight. You will lose so much of your sanity trying to keep up with the ridiculous standards."
bad,"This company generates millions, it has a very low operating cost, since it staffs the business with only  3-4 employees, all of whom are low payed, even management."
bad,If u are not fast on ur feet retail is not job for u. You want to always be sure to stay kinda by ur register so u can hurry back to the customer u are getting ready to check out.
bad,"My store manager is awful. She's always late. Leaves the store multiple times during her shift. She often sits in her car several times during her shift, leaving the only cashier on shift by herself. She plays favorites with her employees. The store is always a mess and unorganized, the afternoon employees dont seem to do much when it comes to cleaning the store. I dont recommend working at this store."
bad,"As a store manager, you are always there and that includes overnights so you can get things done without customers in the store. You are re only Salary teammate and cannot leave until the work is done."
bad,"I worked there as a seasonal employee and it only developed to part time status. Hours were as low as 6 hours a week. Management had their ""favorites"" which received all the hours. The feeling of working there was extremely stressful due to the fact you didn't know when you were going to be let go or even work at all."
bad,$7.35 an hour with no benefits and only working 25 hours a week. It's not worth it!!! Nothing can be done with $7.35 an hour......they should at least give you 40 hrs.
bad,"I was very good with nobody around, But management was freaking because they needed a smoke break first before they get quarters.  I was early for work as the supervisor was late unlocking the doors in 10 degree weather.  But that is okay I clocked in and she adjusted her and her friends time-punches."
bad,They make empty promises and the work environment is very disorganized its good for an in between job even the customers complain about the disorganization
bad,The mangers was so rude i didnt like it there but i worked hard and still kept a big smile on my face im a very hard worker i love meet the customers just the rude mangers
bad,"I enjoyed the actual job but however there was no professionalism and employees were mistreated. maybe I just had a bad experience but overall I did enjoy working for the company I just wouldn't recommend the location I was at,"
bad,"The experience I have met, the days can be very fruitful with the task of work and also the customers, Sometimes the days can be typically fruitful and a lot to deal with which I like, I learned a lot of ways of solving different problems, When there is a situation with customers there a times we have to be the mediator with customer and there are times you have to be able to do some extra effort with the customers, The hardest part of the job is when you don't have a plan when you get to work, The hardest part of the job just working when there is no extra help I enjoy being a manager,"
bad,the job was easy but no one wasn't getting no hours.i was only working once a week so I wasn't happy with the job..only time I got hours when shipment came in to unload the truck
bad,"I was promoted from cashier to asst. manager then did not receive training but two times being told what to do, i took notes but before i could use them they demoted me back to cashier. because i was taking to long to open and close the store even though i never opened or closed the store by myself, I pretty much got used to make the store look better than let go even though it was my choice sorry but a 25 hour work week at 7.25 a hour can't pay my bills."
bad,There is no positive culture there. You get ZERO corporate support. When you are told that by advancing it is worse its time to leave. The expectations are not obtainable and NOTHING is ever good enough.
bad,At the time management was terrable the gm changed schedule very often and would not let anyone know untile it was right before shift also a lot of things seemed out of the ordinary
bad,"Dollar Tree is so concerned with their money profits that they do not like to recognize employees who have been with the company for many years, instead they would rather promote people from other stores or hire from outside the company. They do not like to have more than 2 employees in the building at a  time, unless it is a holiday. Managers are not able to get work done on the floor because they are constantly ringing on the registers. Part time Assistants do not get the benefits that full time Assistants get (such as bonuses)."
bad,The managers seemed to always be rude. The training was short and uninformational and the managers didn't care to help when asked. I felt it was very difficult to get any information from them pertaining to the job.
bad,Poor Management.  Not the original culture that I was hired under.
bad,they have you run cashier and vacuum the back of store while teleport to the front when costumers are there. if you do not vacuum they wright you up 3x your out.
bad,This was an awful company to work for. Well actually it was the management. My area director was inept and more concerned with gossip than actually running a business.
bad,The management staff here are lacking professionalism. I would go in at 530am and by the time our 10min break comes by the managers are telling their employees some may take a break some may not because they didnt work as much as they wanted for the managers likeing
bad,"I did not enjoy this job what so ever, coworkers were very rude. I did learn how to work cash but that is about it. The most enjoyable part of my day was definitely talking to the customers"
bad,I learned how to understand that customers have needs as well and they'er human as well and they can also be having s bad day as well and that it was my job to help them when they came into my store and to help to the best of my ability.
bad,It would be a good place to work if when your supost to be at work at 4am but you have to wait outside for 30 mins or more because you boss over sleeps most mornings never on time. I cant tell you how many times I've got to work at 4am and had to wait on my boss to show up.
bad,They had poor management. They didn't treat people fairly. They use you wherever they need without being grateful. They work you to the bone. They are detached and are not very understanding.
bad,"It was a somewhat fast paced work environment, very disorganized and hectic. A typical day at work consisted of running around trying to do 10 jobs at once because we were so understaffed."
bad,"Was great until Dollar Giant became Dollar Tree. Dollar tree does things in really strange ways. i dont like how cluttered the stores are, or at least the one i was at."
bad,"Dollar Tree is like working as a mindless drone.  You repeat simple tasks over and over again, yet the managers are breathing down your neck non stop and like to slack off, making the associates do all the labor."
bad,"Good work place if you need a side job for extra cash, but not to make a carreer out of. A lot to do and very little time to do it between customers and throwbacks and cleaning."
bad,lots of drama between co workers everyone doesn't seem to get along. lots of work not enough people not enough hours to schedule people to help out with the work.
bad,"Worked very hard and let go after a week. The work load was not worth the back ache but it was worth the pay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,Dollar Tree was a bad experience for me to work in. It was confusing and I wasn't properly trained. I regret ever investing any time into that job. I was new to retail then and the people didn't really give me a days worth of hours.
bad,job at dollar tree is the worst they don't care about m=employees whats so ever I tell them the times I cant work and for some reason they schedule me on those times
bad,"Just a place to pass through, until something better comes along. you don't move up in the company until years of and years of working  for them. Not good"
bad,This was a friendly work environment between co workers but not the management. Managenment was horrible and they always treated their employees badly.
bad,I'm always willing to move around to learn more pick up fast very clean person get alone with every one I'm a team player always what to be on my moving around it help me become a better person
bad,This is a job for young people starting out or seniors just looking for a few hours. This is a minimum wage job. It only provides 15 hours a week and are inconsistent.
bad,This Company was great place to grow and get experience. They are flexible with people that attend school and have children
bad,As far as retail goes it was a very high stress low pay job. Most of the people I worked with were amazing and have become life long friends. On the other hand lack of store presents from corp. employees and their demands made working there extremely stressful.
bad,"Hired without interview, reference, criminal record check! No training! Extremely disorganized and dirty. High turnover of staff.  Unwelcoming atmosphere."
bad,I was supposed to receive two-five hour shifts a week and barely got one. pay was not worth the hard work that was expected of you. I enjoyed my co-workers.
bad,"If you are someone that is unemployed and in NEED of a job,  then you can work here.  The pay rate is good and as well as the hours, but i would NEVER recommend this job to ANYONE!!"
bad,I  really enjoyed the enviroment and how busy i stayed.   I loved metting customers and interacting with them -but not to many hours were ever available
bad,I would rather not speak about this company and/ or my experiences. However I really appreciate the opportunity to do so.
bad,"A typical work day at dollar tree is opening up and making sure is everything is clean and neat. Waiting on customers, stocking. The management was somewhat understooding"
bad,I worked for this company for many years. I worked well with my co workers. This job gave me the experience in management. The hardiest part of the job was unloading trucks.
bad,Everything was a mess.Not enough cashiers.Management was extremely rude.Overheard upper management yelling at employees and customers.How rude that was.
bad,"Not enough hours for the store ,alot of work but not enough time to do it in, not enough hours to make the money that you need to pay your bills unless you are a store manager"
bad,the store is great but the management was what I thought a good management should be.  always short staffed and hard to get help from the manager.
bad,Co-workers are great but the store itself is very unorganized. Management Is unreliable. Store was very poorly maintained because of lack of daily cleaning.
bad,"constantly being sued by employees and they don't address or solve any of their problems. customers don't appreciate anything(depending on the area) whether it be you or the merchandise, or the store in general."
bad,"always a fun thing! met lots of new people from all walks of life. helping customers is always fun, even when they are having a bad day. sometimes people just want someoen to listen for a minute."
bad,"Though there was room for advancement, I have to say that my experience with this company was not enjoyable. It is fast paced, which I prefer, however, they are not a friendly business."
bad,"Well I pretty much worked the cash register all day and greeted all the customers who came in the store. Also I restocked the soda machines and put back items in the store a customers decided not to purchase once they got to the register. The General Manager who hired me was the rudest women I ever worked with. Every time I would ask for her assitance she would act as if I was irritating her which many of the times she blantly showed disrespect towards me infront of the customers but I didn't let it bother me, I just did the best job I could possibly do. I enjoyed the relax enviorment of the store"
bad,this company was awesome  because I got to help people and secure the people too
bad,"Worst company to work for ever, and I worked at Wal-Mart before... The pay is horrible compared to what your expected to do, not enough hours for non salaried employee's, as management I was expected to work on my lunch and breaks. The store manager played favorites, she also sat in the office all day everyday. The district manager didn't care what happened in the store as long as he got his bonus. Always cutting hrs even when the store was making it's day. Treating it employees horrible"
bad,"The Customers And The Work Wasn't An Issue, I Enjoyed Going To Work And Received Compliments Often On My Customer Service Skills, My POSITIVE Words Of Encouragement And Smile. The Past Couple Months Has Been A DISASTER The DM Came In And Says That We're One Of The ""Red"" Stores (Meaning: Not Doing So Great In Sales, I Guess) And They Fired The Manager (Who Had Been With The Company For ""16 Yrs""; Just To Show That They DON'T REALLY  CARE For Their Dedicated Employees; They Should've Gave Her A Chance To Get Up To Their Standards: Give Her More Up To Date Training Before They Just AXED Her With NO WARNING) Only To Replace Her With G.I Jane  (Wants To Flip Flop The Rules When It's GOOD For  Her), The New Manager Of The Store Is VERRRY RUDE And Disrespectful And If You Have A Question About Anything She Says, Your Hrs. Are Severely Shortened And If That Don't Get You To Quit Then She And Other Outside Mangers Gets Together And Make FAKE Phone Calls To The Store About  You ""Like It's From Customers"") THIS PLACE On Ridge Ave. Is REEEALLLYYY ALL About The Employees On TOP And They Could Care LESS About The Ones On The Bottom (Who Deals With The Customers On A Daily) They WANT YOU TO BE A ROBOT/BRAINLESS!!! Don't Care Whether You Eat Or Have Enough $$ To LIVE As Long As They're Making Their Salaries And BONUSES; And Let's Not Forget The BILLIONS To Buy Out Family $ And Others."
bad,they play favortism.  Go back to college and avoid this nightmare
bad,"A company who doesn't care about their employees, as long as the store makes a profits, don't allow enough help to maintain the proper running of the store"
bad,Best part is leaving work. Some days are good some days are bad.
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had.  Other than the fact that all the managers were rude, I always encountered rude customers as well as rude coworkers."
bad,"Looking for a better environment to work in, I find it much better when you love your job and don't mind the work."
bad,the company treats it's employees like trash. it was not a pleasant place to work. not much room for advancement unless you know somebody.
bad,"I bent over backwords for this company and was never once recogniozed for being a slight over achiever. anyways, I will never consider employment within dollar tree again."
bad,Store Management is great and the atmosphere is good. Learned about the public and the rules of retail.
bad,"A typical day at work was horrible, the learning process was unprofessional. The training was never done. The co workers was were very helpful unlike the manager."
bad,"I basically go in to work and recover/face the store,customer service,cashiering,custodial,return misplace items,etc."
bad,They barely give raises because they'te too CHEAP. I've been working there for 7 years & got 1 raise. DON'T EVER WORK FOR THEM.
bad,"Manager didn't have the decency to let me know that he didn't have any hours for me, he just took me off the schedule. I had to ask him if I still worked there anymore."
bad,"typical day working was cashiering, cleaning, assisting customers with specific items that they were looking for, filling balloons, stocking shelves. Management needed some working on."
bad,Go down for an interview. Personal conviently sick. Get e-mail stating job is not available. And heres the posting eight hours later for the same job. Nice.
bad,"Manager has bad attitude, complains daily."
bad,Need to be cleaned from top to bottom... Dollar tree doesn't pay you for all the hours you work and also has a lawsuit pending about not paying people what they owe them
bad,I didn't get any hours and I didn't get mant days and I didn't actually fit into the job. I  didn't like getting called in was barely on the c=schedule to get any hours
bad,I worked for dollar tree for about 5byeara and the overall experience was not good. It was mostly understaffed and did not pay well. It is a great first job to get you to be fast paced and work under pressure.
bad,I like working at dollar Tree you meet new people everyday.The employees was great to everyone got alone very good.I never had a bad day working there.
bad,"working at the dollar tree was a great experience for me. I learned how to stock, cashier, worked my way up from my shyness to get to meet new people every day."
bad,"I’ve worked plenty of retail jobs, but Dollar Tree was unique in that I loved working with everyone at the store and deeply enjoyed the customers and the satisfaction of completing tasks. However, there isn’t really room for growth and getting a raise may as well be the same as asking for a pot of gold, ain’t gonna happen. No matter how hard you and your fellow store members work, the managers can’t give you any raises and the corporate end of things don’t care."
bad,Not given enough hours to have more then one person on shift and expect stock to get put out and not get paid for the job you are doing.  The management make the job easier by making the environment fun and well relaxed.
bad,Working at the dollar tree was fun and fast pace. I would come into work and start going through go backs until I was needed to run a cash register. I loved being able to work with the customers and being able to build a repro with them.
bad,It’s very easy  and sometimes the customer are extremely rude but you just have to over look that and do your job remember the customer are always right.
bad,restocking store after the construction people left. didnt get hired after the remodel management to indecicive on scheduling more help
bad,"Don't keep their word on helping employees when  needing assistance with additional skills. Inconsistent management styles, unable to get promised reimbursement for travel between stores.  Very disappointed in corporate management."
bad,Dollar tree is an okay job most likely for teenagers  who need a little money in their pocket. Part time doesn't get alot of hours the pays sucks wish it wasn't 8 dollars get paid biweekly and you have to zone the aisle. The managers  are great but I recommend  peoples that are in high school looking for a part time job.
bad,"The work itself was fun. I loved it. Very challenging. Store managers on the other hand came and went when they wanted and did nothing but sit in the office. With the hours dollar tree gives, everyone has to work. When work didn't get complete the assistants were the ones who got the blame. When assistants complained they were run off. This caused too much stress and drama on employees. I went from store to store and it was happening in most of them ,which  in return put stress on me. Getting help was impossible because corporate went straight to the store managers and nothing to get it fixed,it got worse for all employees. I felt unsafe working in a few of these stores. I wish things could have been different because like I said the work itself was challenging and fun."
bad,All the employees do is talk about each other and make fun of each other there instead of helping them fix there mistakes. Its always dirty and messy. None of the employees clean up the store or the bathrooms.
bad,Dollar tree is a great place to work for part time and entry level experience . I worked as an stocker and the hours were good and the pay was alright bi weekly.
bad,"Working At dollar tree wearhouse I was working at a fast pace & working in a wearhouse helps improve your communication skills and also leader skills ."
bad,"Very bad Training, Dishonest untrustworthy upper corporate Management &  employees."
bad,The money that you received is not worth the stress. They do not give stockers enough hours so the manager and cashier has to stock and run the register. The turn over rate is very high!
bad,Honestly being an employee of Dollar Tree I don’t feel secure. I don’t make enough money to support myself. I barely get enough hours for on a two week check. My smallest check was $26.26.
bad,"I felt like I was treated unfairly, I needed reasonable accommodations and they would not comply in order to attend a funeral of a family member. I had asked several days in advance."
bad,This company wants you to do so much in management (freight) but won't give you the tools that you need to make the store successful. I feel like the DM's will tell you what you want to hear just to keep you from getting upset. I hate to say it's my opinion only you can be the most dedicated worker be on time bust your behind be a team player but at the end DT make promises they don't keep.
bad,"I was on electronic monitoring and the store manager that came from marianna didn't do her job. I was coming in at 5 am, but she got to the store everyday at 11am and I almost went to prison because of her;I explained my situation to her, which she already knew but said if I wanted my job I'd suck it up and do as I'm told."
bad,"I would not recommend it. It is very horrible and un, and I mean un professional, especially when it comes to the employees that work at the store...."
bad,"Hardly any days are given, poor management. when your not given enough days & the pay isn’t enough already, your checks isn’t enough to survive off, I think this job should be for high school kids looking for extra money."
bad,"Very unprofessional environment. Store manager has favorites, will yell at you in front of other associates. Even make you work off the clock. Too little pay for the amount of work expected. Store manager will call you at home on your day off to yell at you. Store manager went to a concert with a stocker. Overall not a good experience."
bad,"They discriminated against an assault charge I had from 2013, and I was not able to be a manager. I really enjoyed my job, and wanted to pursue a career but couldnt due to my criminal record."
bad,I spent a total of a month here and I enjoyed my job. I was a stocker and I enjoyed doing my deeds of stocking and organizing. The issues came when we would go to work in the morning to unload the truck and I would come to find out that I had been rescheduled with no prior knowledge of this. This happened a total of 5 times. I did not mind as I am a morning person but I do not like wasting my time.
bad,This company has poor management. Stores are dirty an shelves never stocked due to lack of workers. No available hours. No chance for advancement. Very discriminate limited African American workers. Your work goes unappreciated. Your ideas overlooked.
bad,Management was the worst. She was incredibly rude to employees and customers. She took me off of the schedule without properly terminating me. Also with no explanation.
bad,"This is a short term job  or for someone who wants to work in retail  typical day cashiering, stocking shelves,  keeping the store clean. Helping customers find what they need"
bad,I joined the team in March and everything was fine until I saw that the SM lets the staff do whatever they want and hold me at a different standard. The SM has a lot of associates to close with her and one person for me who close 3 nights a week. She makes her assistants myself included tell and document the associates. The worse the is she gossips with her favorites. I actually heard her talking about me to one of her soon to be promoted associate. I have to find another job this place is to juvenile.
bad,You get treated badly unless you want to be a brown noser or be someones puppet to do their dirty work. Non stop drama and gossiping and lies. Its Sad
bad,They were great at first and they have there favorite people where they give them more hours and not the rest of us i nust mt butt and dont get paid enough plus they keep cutting hours
bad,"They didn't care alot about employees, the hours were not there. It was not something I looked forward to do daily,  the benefits were not good enough to keep me there. Not treated fairly."
bad,"This is my summary of working at Dollar Tree "
bad,Dollar tree is a job for a 18 year old that is starting their life off. It would be nice to get paid more then $7.64 for all the work they have us do.
bad,They are short of help Don't pay well and in need of better management.The store was very drity and unsafe .No one in upper management will listen when you address them about problems in the store they had no security system which I found unsafe die to dealing with money .
bad,"At first it’s fine, then they throw all kinds of things at you and kind of expect you to know it already. They didn’t teach the cashier people well. I was alone most shifts and I was a week new."
bad,It was a okay job but don’t pay enough  and no benefits  I just quit the job  I really don’t have anything else to say about the job  co workers were nice and managers as well
bad,"The store to work was awesome, working with great people my co-workers become like a second Family to me. But Their DMs, New Store Managers doing a poor job. My store went down Hill. After being a great store always positive on sales, customers reviews."
bad,I was more than happy to work when they needed more help but for being pregnant they over worked me. Everyone was always leaving. The store was never put together they had boxes everywhere. The manager would just sit in the office.
bad,"Entry level ok but low salary with unrealistic expectations "
bad,"If you need a empty mindless job to fill in for extra cash or till a better job comes along this is the place"
bad,Do not ever work at the dollar tree in Columbia heights Mn they have a mice problem and I would never tell anybody to work at Dollar Tree it's not enough pay that job if for older people and the management I would give them 1 star which is bad I would have lines and be taken care of them by myself while the manger and store manger walk around like they don't see the long line it gets very busy there was too much for me
bad,"I was a cashier for a year and some change, only thing that kept me around was my regular customers. The whole corporation is an absolute joke. They dont care anout their employees unless you hold a district manager position or highter. You do get sick time that they won’t pay out when you leave. They’ll do anything to not have to pay you overtime. Been times where i would be scheduled and then made to clock off almost a minute before hitting overtime. My particular store didn’t have cameras due to being “low profile”, I ended up getting terminated and couldn’t even fight it because of lack of proof."
bad,"I'm an employee of Dollar tree at the moment. I've been at the company for 11 years. It started off great, but has gotten worse over the years. Therefore I'm actively seeking employment else where. This company does not care about its employees. I'm under paid and can do way less at another company making more. I've reported money missing to district managers, yet they tell me they cant do anything. They claim they'll have h.r contact me. That never happens!!!! H.r doesnt care either. All they do is protect themselves. District managers have called my personal phone begging me to relocate, because I'm a great manager. I relocate and am not given the pay rate we discussed. Again do not work at this company! You will only get 1 day of the year off holiday wise, and that's Christmas day. They dont care about you or your family. I can promise you! This company is so bad, that I dont even shop with them. As I stated before I work for them, and I do not support them whatsoever. They claim tou can have flexible hours, then change your schedule last minute. Yet that's not what you discuss when being interviewed. If you know what s best for you, you'll choose a better company. Did mentioned you work hard for low pay? I'm 28 with the body of 70 woman now. Dollar tree has stuck me with several trucks alone. My body has now broke down. I have major back and foot issues now. Also, I now have carpal tunnel in both hands. The pain never ends... You're never rewarded or acknowledged for your work either."
bad,"The place makes good business money wise, people shop but has little to no room for advancement and the management not consistent. As with most jobs they have there favorites even if you are doing your job and beyond."
bad,My experience was good to start out. I helped my store from the bottom up. Brand new store. Was there for one year. Management played favorites. Don’t become sick of you work there. You are expected to be there and available on your days off. Drama and thieves is all it was. No room for advancement.
bad,"My average work week consists of 8 hours max making minimum wage, regardless of my availability. The training was minimal and I had to figure out how to do many tasks on my own."
bad,"Since getting this position I have average 90 hours per week as a salary employee. Job description says 50 hours, plus some extra on occasions. Upper management does very little to effectively help a struggling location, and it’s usually a very experience when they do."
bad,"Helped clean, ran the register,answered the phone, paged people when needed, counted the tills the safe the deposit and ect and took money to the bank."
bad,to be honest it was a horror show they hired me i was doing amazing as a cashier then we started training for A/S/M not even two weeks into being trained i was tossed in left alone
bad,My co worker and my manager were best friends and she allowed my co worker to swear in front of  customers. And she did not listen to any issues I was having.
bad,There is no respect for workers or customers. Not professional and very in reliable with hours. The company itself does not look out for their employees and the management team in the self are very unprofessional and talk about their personal lives in the open. Swearing a lot and is always a big mess.
bad,Working at Dollar Tree was fun in the beginning because it was almost like we were a family. Now it was like being in prison with on chance of parole.
bad,"There's not really much to say: They want you to sell, but won't give you any direction, support, training or tools in order to do so, or help you succeed the way they want. If you're not within the store's manager little circle of friends, you're pretty much gone within a week, and won't hesitate about firing you right around Christmas. Grinch much? Yup. Avoid this company like an antibiotic-resistant, mutated, lab-grown-for-biological-warfare plague."
bad,"No Review's!   Very low work of personnel,"
bad,"The customers are catty and argumentative because there is never enough staff on the cash registers. It's nearly impossible to get help if there's only one associate on the floor and one manager who has their own set tasks for the day, to come and help you when the lines are too long. Especially in the opening shift. Not to mention the unnecessary drama filled coworkers who love to be cliquish and turn against one another."
bad,The store i work at honestly it sucks. The manager there has no control on how to run the store and there is a lot of favoritism ..so yeah i know all te stores arent like that but its a bad experience for me
bad,"They cant seem to keep a manager, there disorganized, very inconsistent, poor hours. I would ask for more hours and i wouldnt get any, the shelves are always a disaster, they have had 4 different managers in the last year and a half. Theres no training and when you call someone up to help you because you have no clue what your doing they give dirty looks or the sigh loudly or make it seem like your bothering them. They talk badly about employees behind there backs. The pay is not good enough, i felt like i was working hard and wasnt getting anything for it. You only get a 10 minute break. Thats not long enough for any normal person because by the time everything is ready for break its half over."
bad,"Energy super negative, never had many hours and very random shifts, at one time we could work 15 hours, randomly. I did enjoy my coworkers, an a few managers. Over all i believe the leadership of our Store manager was the issue."
bad,"This job at dollar tree has no coordination at all, it is a very fast paced job with very stressful productivity.  The job is way too under paid for the labor that is provided. As well as there being no actual schedule."
bad,Okay company if you need a job.  That's about all I can say for my experience working for the company.  I do not feel much opportunity for advancement.
bad,Cut throat! Out with the old in with the new! 1-2-3 gone there for 15 years and no mote room for advancement they over work you and expect so much from you no matter what the circumstances are!
bad,"Directly supervise the activities of production and workers, such as workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators. Packed and restocked items"
bad,store manager only wanted spanish speaking people. nasty to customers work hours lower then what should have been no training you have to have a quick learning curve to be efficient enough per their standards
bad,"I could not even describe how disappointed I am or was with Dollar Tree. At the time that I worked there, the coworkers were actually quite good to work with for the most part. The main area that my issues lie has to deal with how they were more than willing to cut my meager hours from barely 20 hours a week to barely 12 hours a week. Coupling that with how management worked, it really was not a good job, even for the short time that I was there."
bad,"bad management, work to hard for such little pay, and little hours, didnt learn much. only to use the register. worked extra hard while supervises just took smoke breaks ever 15 min."
bad,I got into a great routine at my job. I knew what was expected out of me each and every day that I arrived. Starting with great customer service and ending with making sure that the store was ready for whoever was coming in to relieve you from your shift. Working at Dollar tree was a great job and I loved it but mainly because of the people that I worked with.
bad,"The store was always a mess; constantly had to do go-backs to put items where they belong. There were mice infesting the store, chewing through items on the shelves. Some management staff was very rude and unprofessional on most days."
bad,"its okay to work there as part time temp. i was a stocker so i was used to the environment and culture. i did okay there but the pay is not that great, if i had to say ups has the worst pay ever."
bad,The workplace at hunts point is so unprofessional I recommend no one to work there. Try to force you to stay or either barely gives any hours. Also a lot of favoritism.
bad,The manager would always get on to me but never would get on to anybody else. I always did everything and she knew i was her best worker and she would act childish
bad,"Dollar Tree is a multi billion dollar company run by a bunch of cheap, micro-managing people."
bad,The freight process does not work they send too much of the same thing & not enough of what sells the most. They don’t give u enough hours to process the freight before another truck is on u
bad,you have to be in 2 places at once. i was always going home frustrated and upset i the co workers are really nice but i wasnt getting the hours i needed i was only getting 4 hours a week
bad,My overall experience at Dollar tree was very different. My typical day at work was a bit slow and little out of the usual. It was very slow and normally stood behind the register most of the shift.
bad,Don't work for amber she lazy and store is a wreck the mangers here feed the gosup and fighting aloud no call no shows to favorites and they also could show up when ever they want to it was crazy
bad,"It's a perfect job for a kid that's in highschool for just pocket money, unless you are part of stocking, truck or management I wouldn't really recommend anyone to work there unless as I said you're a student or retiree"
bad,"I have learned so much working with this company but once you are let go you can not find another job with-in this field. I love working with my co-workers and coaching them about their job roles, and assisting customers"
bad,I started threw a temp service was not trained properly or told just how they wanted the pallets. I busted my butt heavy boxes stacked on pallets and my little self unloading trailers with a pallet jack. And friday i get a call from the temp telling me i dont meet there requirements in there productions... WHAT??
bad,"Sometimes friendly coworkers, never consistent hours. I usually only got like 7-12 hours a week even though I wanted more. "
bad,the only time they ever gave me hours was when nobody else wanted to work. the management played  favorite with some of the employees there for example like giving them more than other workers.
bad,Not enough staff and not enough hours . If you are new there you get nothing . Very rude and uncalled for . I only did it to pass time . Poor communication skills. Unprofessional by all means .
bad,"The higher ups from you have no self control and will use their own personal opinions to make a judgement wether true or false. Minimum hourse are given, between 3-5 hours most weeks."
bad,"I worked there for a couple months and the store manager was terrible. She acted really nice at first, but that didn't last for long. I was hired working plenty of hours and then more people were hired and everyone got like 15 hour weeks. I loved my co workers and the assistant managers. I would not recommend working at the chardon dollar tree."
bad,"Dollar tree is very fast pasted if your a cashier , you will be asked sometimes to help with shipment , you are required to do recovery of the store and about face everything"
bad,"Fast paced with little pay, expects to do alot for very little.  "
bad,Stocking products and unloading truck. Stocking back room and making sure it stays organized and clean. Periodically bring things on the floor when needed or when seasons change
bad,Being a cashier was not for me. I did learn to work the registers but did not like working with money. A typical day at work was helping customers in the store and with what they needed to buy.
bad,"Unfriendly employees, boring environment. Learned how to cash out and run cash registers. Often cleaned store, faced and stocked the shelves, and I helped set up the entire store."
bad,"Very low on pay, they wanted me to work full time hours on a part time pay. I was very dedicated and tried to go full time but they wouldn't take me full time"
bad,"dollar tree is a good jumping of point for your working carrier "
bad,"Working for Dollar Tree was a very rewarding experience, not only did I interact with customers I open and close the store, prepared the registers for the cashier for the opening day. Fun place to work, what enjoy about this job I got to interact with the customers."
bad,barley got any hours even tho i bust out not worth the stress puss a diff time in my life im sure not all dollar trees are like that bad time wouldn't work for them again hardest part getting up at 3 am
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company.  When I first got hired, management promised full time employment, better pay, I never got either. My last days while employed with this company, I was scheduled down to 10 hours a week.  I kept asking for more hours and what amazes me was the store would have a ""help wanted"" sign up."
bad,"Everyone would call in for work. You would have to call another employee in just to cover the shift."
bad,I do not like this job I will never get paid enough to do this kind of work.
bad,stocking and helping the mambers out and learning new things and working hard.
bad,If you are not considered a favorite you will not succeed with this company
bad,I did a lot for little pay. The manager scheduled me every weekend while she has the weekends off. I missed family events because the manager put me working every holidays besides Christmas because we are closed. Barley had Sundays off. Worked and cleaned and you never get appreciated for the hard work you do. Bad management and hours sucked
bad,"Not getting anymore than 30 hours in two weeks, the work place wasnt all that great."
bad,I made a few friends with the coworkers.  The machine that they used for balancing the registers didn't work so my till was off a lot due to this.  No benefits.
bad,"Jobs not hard. Simply work as cashier and stocking. Customers are nice, management is okay to work with. Needs to be full time vs part time to keep employees there."
bad,a typical day at work would consist of me going in doing my job... some days the manager would be in a good mood but alot of times in a bad mood an extreamly stressed
bad,"Maintained a clean productive work area. "
bad,"it was a wonderful place an I dearly enjoyed the customers but the management showed poor sportsmenship, leadership, communication skills, and work ethics."
bad,"Poor Management, hard working employees.  We were all promised 20 - 25 hours a week, we were lucky to get 12"
bad,"Not enough hours and not enough pay. Their managment is very rude when it comes to taking stuff that you bought out of the store. I cashier, vacuum, and pretty much do everything while the managers stand around. There really isn't anything I like about this job."
bad,Its is not good for working woman with kids. The scheduling is terrible.
bad,"I think the management doesn't take their employees seriously and they take advantage. they never listen to what they might be doing wrong as a management team, I am very qualified for the management position but they never even considered it. they could do much better. I think the employee are fine and considerate of the customers, I think its just the whole entire management team that has a problem with working together. The hardest part of the job is the consistant complaining over who should be doing what, if we are a staff then we should be able to come together. Management is known to ignore the customers while there are long lines and just stand around ignoring them or they run into the office. And for management to also discuss employee information to a customer within the store loud enough for other customers to hear."
bad,"Typical work day is providing customer service, the job is very easy and doesnt require alot of thought."
bad,Not enough hours to make ends meet. I did learn cashiering which is good to know. I learned more from Walmart Inc then Dollar Tree.
bad,ok working mang. was poor at the time part time promised full time hours not given min wage pay not fast pased at all
bad,"Its okay if your starting off as a cashier, but than a bad place. No one ever is willing to work, always have to work and wait a little longer to get off your shift. Don't pay enough for a assistant manager. No reliable workers. You do way more than what you need to. Can never find anyone to cover your shift if your sick. Customer are durtie and rude. They don't know how to put stuff back. Just not a typical job if your a busy person. If your in High School than might work. other then that NOPE! They also don't train your for nothing, just throw you right on, like they did me for assistant manager, i don't even know half of the stuff and taught myself."
bad,"I didnt not like working here, long tedious hours, with no real room for growth or advancement... you go from cashier/stocker to assistant to store mananger and the store managers put in rediculous for very little pay."
bad,They did not treat their employees very well. We all did what we were told and still got yelled at.
bad,This is a good company to work for if you don't have a family or a life. This job and company consumes alot of time. The jobs are harder for a more mature person to achieve.
bad,This was a cashier positon that I had. I enjoyed working there until my favorite manager quit...
bad,management was difficult the methods that they used were different from others. The atmosphere was fantastic and the customers were always the funnest to deal with and help.
bad,The best part about Dollar Tree was one of my co workers. This place is prooly run. The hours sucked. To much drama and to much buddy buddy going on.
bad,"they were unprepard to train me. i was placed directly into the cycle, and learned by trial and error. no bonuses awarded due to me, being concidered part time, i did exactly what the full time manager did, sometimes without help when they had many to help them. i was given the manual and told not to keep it, had about a half hour to look at it, and then right to work, after that i never saw it again. it was a disaster from the begining, i should have gone thru training like all the rest, at a special store that dealt with incoming management"
bad,"The manager of the facility I was at was a lousy manager, great person but didn't know how to manage his store. He argued with the customers and chewed out his staff in front of the customers of the store. Also the company policies did not promote growth or advancement."
bad,I'm supposed to be a full time sticker but I get paid part time. Things are unorganized from the products to the management. They cut our hours to keep for themselves.
bad,DIDN'T RECEIVE MUCH IN HOURS OR PAY FROM DOLLAR TREE the good times i had mainly consist of unloading trucks with my team members  i loved doing the  warehouse because it gave me a place of peace to focus
bad,"The labor verses the hours allocated was unrealistic to achieve company standards. You have a freight team with five to seven associates with a fifteen hour work week. This cause high turnover and frustration within the team. Out of stock and theft was high, which cause shrink to be above company goals. No bonus for all associates, and no recognition."
bad,"I worked for this company for four months. I knew from the very first day that I hated it. The manager doesn't really train you all that well oh, and I was an assistant manager. Most of what I learned I learned from other cashiers and employees not from the manager in training. I was miserable the entire time I worked there."
bad,Dollar tree is horrible as in that im talking about the so called managers very rude and do t want to do nothing for you like get change for your drawer it was horrible
bad,"Stores are always a mess because they do not give enough hours to get the job done.Their starting wage is min. wage and you never get a raise. They are not concerned about their employees at all. They are only interested in making money, The stores are always understaffed and the lines are long and the cashiers are rude when you ask them to call another cashier."
bad,I liked my work I tried to go above and beyond my duties. On my first day I was given a to do list. It said wash windows.i went to back to get supplies started to squeeze stick . manager said what are you doing?  She said stop we have window cleaners she said I meant the door how was I to know . Then she and asst mgr went out the front door to smoke laughing at me I ft awful   not enough space left
bad,"Any one but management was a good employee to work will... Management not willing to listen.... Stores look like unappeling ..... Customers would refuse to shop due to how messy, cluttered, unorganized, and the smell.   Not a place i would consider to come back too."
bad,"The management sucks, the workers get treated like badly. No matter how long you work there you still get paid the ame amount as everyone. The job is good for someone who doesn’t have much responsibility."
bad,"NOT a good place to work, especially at 106th pulaski with head manager barb .  I had pneumonia and the head manager made me come in.  A manger trainee saw how sick i was and told me to GO HOME.  the head manager was there and just said i looked terrible.  she also crossed out the hours i worked one night and i had to question her on it.  another manager, knows what i am talking about.  she told me that she can only give out so many hours and has to cut hours when she is over.  i still have a copy of her crossing out my worked hours to save the company money.  she lost four great workers within 2 months because she wasn't treating us right.  she cut out a lot of our hours to give them to the new workers who were terrible.  again, don't work here.  you too will find less hours (4 hours a day and maybe 3 days a week.  maybe)  and a small paycheck to live on.  no one at this store is full time.  only the head manager.  not a good place to work."
bad,Streesful work environment. Manger is 82 years old she yells and screams. She makes the work day very stressful. The best part of the job was my customers.
bad,i started working there and i was scheduled at times when nobody would show up or answer the phone my paycheck wasn’t on time and management didn’t want to deal with problems
bad,When I was first hired the job was amazing and it wasn’t that bad. Then we had a very bad turn of events one after another and it got to were they weren’t doing what they said they were doing and it was making it hard to be a college student and work there. They didn’t compromise on schedules or family emergencies.
bad,"While my time working at dollar tree, we had shifts of 12-14 hours, 6 days a week. The work-life balance is terrible, I was working upwards of 80 hours a week. There was no support from upper management to help change the culture and improve the overall relationship between associates and management."
bad,"As hard as the team works with limted support they continue to be harassed by toxic human resources and inept young in experienced regional asset protection. Beside doing their jobs you got to be staffing stores weekly as a manager gets termed somewhere on a weekly basis, stores are without ac in summer andno heat in the winter"
bad,but a lot of noisy people. provide customer service. make sure store is clean and neat. Do gobacks. restock the store. cash register. some managers are nice others are not.
bad,"Terrible place to work, low pay , no hours. No help, poor services , poor management. Safety hazards. No bathrooms work. Not clean, very nasty place to work. I’m getting out!"
bad,"Only hires part time, no place for advancement, not enough money."
bad,Hate working here I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy. Dollar Tree is the worst I will tell anyone don't work for this company. The store I worked at had mice and the customers was terrible.
bad,"For retired people. If you're a home owner it's best you find a better job,and it's not any hrs only the GM full time assistant roughly pull in 32-35 a week."
bad,Poor communication between store manager and district manager. Scheduling is unfair. Company Policies not followed at all times. A lot of turn over do to how store manager treats her employees. Low moral. Customer Service is poor. Lack of direction.
bad,"District Manager impossible to work with. Treats store personnel very poorly, i.e., rude, eyeball rolling, etc.. very unprofessional! No flexibility, no understanding of personal or family issues. If there was a work comp situation, you were treated very badly!!"
bad,"Before my lengthy rant, here are some key points:"
bad,Was getting like 20 hours a week... then several of us were lucky to even work 2-4 hours a week. Bad management too boot. Avoid it if at all possible.
bad,"Very busy store, lack of employees on most shifts to handle the long lines. Always beat when I get off.  Part time only.. Shifts are 4- hours. Schedule isn't posted until the last minute, meaning you get your schedule the day before it starts. Have to come into the store to get it. Not available online. Hard to make appointments and have a life when you don't know your schedule until the last minute"
bad,"the employees were really nice and the customers were easy to handle, not all the time, but it was fine with me. the problem was with the management.e"
bad,"Just get like 8hrs a damm n week"
bad,"Not sure what to put exactly "
bad,"Manager is very rude and liked to start drama. This place was just about ""Favoritism"" so I was the loner in that place. Managers we're very rude to customers as well and I didn't like that at all"
bad,"Management is really inconsistent and unprofessional "
bad,"Due to lack of management. The store from has really gone down over the years. Poor management has resulted in 4 managers in the past year. The teams mission seems scatterd and lacking direction, noone is ever on the same page. Managers often lack professionalism or pride in there work. There is not a team feeling"
bad,"Working as cashier, stocker, or recovery is fine once you move up to management it's where the problems start. There's a lot of fighting and throwing people under the bus. DM and Reginals are no help and dont support you."
bad,"This company strongly lacks any corporate culture. My experience here has been terrible at best.  Shady dealings by managers , unfair promotions and favoritism.  Management doesn't care about employees. Would only recommend if you absolutely need money."
bad,"I get along with all of my co workers, but some people there are unprofessional and gossip about you behind your back and management is not the greatest or most professional either. Be careful who you confide in. Also, you cannot live off the salary you get here you would need a second job."
bad,"understaffed, employee regonition is unoticed ,invetory was out of control,loss prevention not being enforced,customer theft due to no security ,store was rarely clean ."
bad,"nice"
bad,"I only worked there for a couple of months. Looking back, I probably would have never applied because the hours were so little, the management and staff were poor, and there was no way one could survive working only 20 hours a week or less."
bad,"okay maybe for a first time job for someone, but very stressful atmosphere. Has a lot of highschool type drama, every new member of management doesn't seem to receive much training. Obvious favoritism, and racism"
bad,"As a cashier I was asked to do a lot for very little pay. The manager did not hire enough people to cover each position and shift, so I was over worked for little pay and no benefits. Over all working there the work environment was very unprofessional."
bad,"i was a district manager for dollar tree with a very large territory.  Upper management had no regard for travel time.  It was not usual to get a call from my regional at 6pm. and say ""we need you to run out to Roswell, NM  and talk to the manager.  Roswell was over 5 hours from where I lived; making it impossible to get to the store before it closed.  "
bad,"worst company I have ever worked for seems like the company has no idea what is going on in the stores & the district manager needs to be replaced, she brings moral way down"
bad,"Started as cashier moved to assistant manager,  now running warehouse and was told I'm filling in .for 3 months now that's filling in?re thinking my employment here, I'm called to cover for  people once a week at least ,have worked 4 , 13 hour shifts was told by district manager that I didn't have a choice if I liked my job."
bad,"Store manager rarely in the store, cashiers stand and play on phones instead of being productive, not a good place to work, freight crew has team work but the front doesn't"
bad,Honestly unless you plan on being a Manager I don't suggest you make a career out of working here. The pay is nothing to live on and as far as I know  the benefits aren't worth the time.
bad,Not interested in working for this company again  the management is horrible and the cleaning of the store is bad they don’t treat people well. The pay is very unacceptable
bad,no advancement and employees are treated badly. general managers yell and belittle managers and assistant managers and are unwilling to work with you to help in learning more about the job. the hours are horrible. they expect their cashiers to live on 15 hours a week.
bad,"ok, don't recommend it "
bad,Dollar Tree does not allow overtime so if you have a project that has to be accomplished by a certain time frame you may be working off the clock to get it accomplished so you won't be written up.
bad,Had a lot of junkies that worked there steal money from us every night. They didn't care about the job. Would always be on shift with the slowest person ever who sat in the office or on the toilet all the time.
bad,Cashiers will not be able to make a living off of the minimum wage that is paid per hour. Most of the positions are part time. Benefits are not offered unless you are full time management.
bad,"They alienate the hard working employees and favor/baby the new people as if they can do no wrong."
bad,I didn't get paid enough to work the hours they wanted me to work. Also I didn't see a difference in my pay check when it came to the holidays. My manger was a child at most
bad,"weekly trucks stocked on sales floor with flexible Plano grams. condense items, relocate merchandise, recover, clean, process damages,answer phones, sweep"
bad,Just show up and do your job it a no nonsense environment and they have no problem firing you and finding someone else to do your job and they have plenty of options to do so
bad,You're worked like a slave for little pay. Managers and employees act like high schoolers. Everyone calls out. Some customers are nice. They do have flexible schedules.
bad,Im sure not all dollar trees are bad but the one I worked for was probably one of the worst. The amount of unprofessionalism is overwhelming. I think the only good thing about the company is its prices on its items.
bad,Dollars Tree  only  have two people working on night  they need at least three  or more to get the job done .sometimes  time u don't even  get a break
bad,"When I worked there I had informed them that my phone service provider was not very good, and Management stated they understood. I went camping one weekend and when I came back they said they tried calling me, but yet my phone showed nothing, so I told them I quite since things weren't working out and the management team just laughed and walked away. They are not very good people to work this and they aren't flexible."
bad,"Customers seem to think employees at a dollar store are less than human. You get treated and talked to that way. "
bad,"First you have to wait for a schedule then you are told what to do by 2 or 3 managers which leaves you lost. once that have been solved began placing items on the shelves. What was learn how to place items on a shelve.  The hard part was taking directions from more than one person.  "
bad,Work at Dollar Tree is very stressful. Iearned absolutley nothing while working here. management was very poor. The workplace was not ideal for progession.
bad,Dollar Tree is a terrible company. The products are substandard at best and a hazard at worst. The management is given little training. My manager frequently yelled. The pay is minimum. Would not advise staying there long.
bad,"I loved the management team, but there were times when a line was crossed by the manager. Assistant managers were more understanding. I love the manager as a person and friend, but not as my manager."
bad,The store manager lets other managers bully her into giving them what they want.  The manager schedule changes constantly.  There have been times that my schedule changed seven times in one week.
bad,"(Dollar Tree on East Capitol) I got robbed at gun point and that didnt make me quite (Management Management Management) I was really happy at first about working there, but if you dont kiss butt ,kiss your job away."
bad,"No hours, too many people hired and the boss isn't allowed to give enough hours for employment at DT to make sense for any of them. You get to meet a lot of fun customers but it doesn't offset the fact that everyone is staved for shifts or that schedule changes can happen daily when you already have plans, without warning, I got called into work while at my second job as they had changed the schedule between the last time I was there telling me I should've come in and checked on my day off. They also couldn't handle the wage increase, I went from having four shifts a week to one. I worked there for fifteen months and only got one shift beyond four hours."
bad,"Check out, Stock shelves, Clean store, Manager I worked with were not to bad. Didn't get many hours that was a down fall. Payment wasn't the best either. Hardest part was catching people stealing then try and lie about it. Or people say I was keeping stuff from them when I wasn't. Wasn't the greatest job but the people I worked with at the time, I liked working with."
bad,"Working at Dollar Tree you need tough skin. I was working at the Dollar Tree in Denton, Tx. The leadership was poor.  Great place to work for diversity. Management as a whole needs to be reevaluated."
bad,Dollar Tree was easy but it wasn't worth it. They needed to get rid of some people so they fired some really good workers out of no where. The pay was minimum wage which is ok sense I just ran the register
bad,"I was employed with dollar tree for over three years. I loved my job at first!  After a while tho I realized that all the upper management could care less about any of us.. they give you very hours and expect you to do the work of like five people, and if the shelves aren't fully stocked all the time , they wanna know why and even write you up. I was an operations manager  and was going to store manager training in two weeks and was promised I would get to run my own store, however a few of my associates decided to make up some crazy story about me breaking company policy ( which I never did!) And took it to cooperate! They called me on a Monday and took my keys away and suspended me until they investigated the allegations against me. They called me Friday and let me know I was terminated bc two people we wrote statements against me! So basically they fired me over hearsay after all those years and all the hard work I had put into that place!  I definitely would never recommend this place to anyone!  They work u like dogs and will replace u with no warning!!!"
bad,Just for part time work only. Going to be moving onv to the Healthcare field as soon as I can. Not a bad company for someone needing part time work only.
bad,"There are no benefits, only annual pay raises where you start at minimum wage, expected to do 3 times the work for no pay. Managers promote only people like themselves.  Not people with work ethic."
bad,It was a part time job just to have cash on hand always did stocking cashier made some good friends cleaned the store put away the items that customers did not want
bad,i was only given 5 hours a week and most of th time it was last min and that would of been ok but i was working 3rd so like i did not have any time to sleep or even get ready for work
bad,It was a laid back job but it was low pay. I couldn't get what I needed to get by for me and my daughter. The co workers and manager were very helpful but very pushy.
bad,"I started for Dollar Tree in spring of 2012.  I began to look for advancement/growth, however, none was available.  Typical day at work were busy as a cashier, front facing products on the shelves, housekeeping and closing.  If you dont care about hours...its a satisfactory  place to work."
bad,"open and close store as needed. work register, give change to cashiers, put out at least 40 boxes a day. This job only becomes stressful when i didn't perform duties such as working on my breaks and lunches Everyday. i understand sometimes being short handed but this place doesn't keep employees, which causes stress on the employees that actually comes to work faithfully. Customers welcomed my presence daily and i had developed a relationship with regulars."
bad,Everything I learned working at this company I have taught myself how to do. I was never trained as a manager when I was working at Dollar Tree. People Like to sit around and talk while you do all the work. It was a good day when that person wasn't working. But the worst part was that I had to close the store 5 -6 days out of the week. and I hardly ever got to see my kids. That was the hardest part. All they care about is themselves. don't work for Dollar Tree.
bad,"When i worked at the Dollar Tree, it was the worse job that i have ever had..Well, besides Labor Ready."
bad,"Basically started in this job when there was no manager, money was stolen, manager replaced twice, war between ex manager and new"
bad,"Corporate will arrive every few months add drag you through the mud,  no positive words,  they belittle you and make you feel as if your 75+hours a week are worthless. No praise, no encouragement, just negativity."
bad,"On a normal work day there is some people and then it would get packed. People will leave stuff around the store and we would have to put everything back. I get off on time sometimes, but somedays we stay an extra hour just to put the stuff back. I barely get any breaks and if I do get a break it's only 10 minutes. I feel like the employees should have a 30 minute break and be able to relax. Most of the employees call off so if you get off in a couple hours the managers will make you stay to do a double. I think it's ridiculous how the employees get treated."
bad,"Overall, the coworkers at Dollar Tree lean on each other well. However, there is poor organization and communication from the top down. There are also unsafe working conditions, such as the stock room, which contains no shelving or other form of organization; boxes are stacked on top of one another like a mountain, rather than an organized stock room. The place is filthy overall, with there being large amounts of dust on the shelves and products; additionally, products commonly leak or are coming open because of poor packaging. The carpet is covered in stains and old bubble gum; the bathrooms are also run-down, with stained walls and doors (along with other noticeable vandalism)."
bad,3days a week 4 hours a day isn't enough work time and management is poor.. it's just not the job for me I need more hours so I can support myself and my family
bad,"first off in every dollar tree store,  the heater runs 365 days a year.  not one employee has access to change the temperature on the thermostat. Corporate is the only one who can change or adjust settings  Ask the regional manager and they it will be taken care of, but it doesn't-happen,.With the body heat & artificial heat almost makes it unbearable working conditions, then add to the miserable climate being in Las Vegas "
bad,"During my time working for Dollar Tree, everyone was over worked and treated unfairly. The manager was always extremely mean for no particular reason."
bad,"The turn overrate is really fast so there's always new people coming in. The job is never constant, hours were always changing. Not the best place to work."
bad,"the location i worked at wasn't"
bad,They run through ppl. Send to much on trucks. Rude upper management. They dnt care about employees. Over worked and under paid employees management as well.
bad,Don't mind working here too much but when it came to getting hours that was another story. I worked very hard trying to keep the store clean and to provide the best experience for the customers.
bad,Dollar Tree was a very boring slow job with very hours. However the customer were very nice and they always wanted to tip me. Of course dollar didn't allow tipping.
bad,"This place was an absolute nightmare to even work at if you were a a stocker if anything. They had no training whatsoever when I was working as a stocker, it was really cut-throat on my first day. So a couple of things about this place that they will never tell you. "
bad,"They expect a lot from employees but do not give much in return."
bad,"Management wasn't as strong as it needed to be. As a cashier i had to perform stock worker, custodian & cashier duties. Never enough help on duty. No help to complete any tasks."
bad,some good people some not so much depended on the day. the manager I worked with at first was nice but when she transferred and the replacement came he was not so nice
bad,Tell you a million things to get you to work there then cut you down to two days while the manager and assistants get all the hours. They try to make you do two jobs with not enough pay. No insurance or benefits
bad,I would have liked the job if they would make shifts either cashier or stocking but doing both all the time is overwhelming. And if I would have gotten more than 18 hrs a week.
bad,Deal with customers on daily basis. Managers were always satisfied with me never having an issue with keeping store tidy and stocked. Employee of the week once.
bad,"People were constantly complaining about the short hours and the way everyone would always come in, especially around the holidays and complain about the poor quality of the stuff they bought for 1$"
bad,I worked here for a year it was cool at 1st but then they switched the managers and their was at lot of favoritism and their is no room for advancement unless you kiss butt to the managers
bad,"Pay does not reflect the amount of work that you do."
bad,"A typical day at work was basically being a cashier, customer service assisting customers needs, returns etc. I learned how to operate a cash register and I gained more customer service experience."
bad,Dollar tree is very unorganized company. They have mice and also have very lazy mangers.No one at this job takes anything serious. Their is no team work what so ever.
bad,"for this company to be a multi-billion enterprise you would think that they can compensate their workers better. The environment is hazardous, the vents are old and very dusty. Management is not great but not terrible either, they lack communication skills. But the customers are great, especially the older ones. It satisfies me that I satisfy them. The hardest part is actually caring about the position itself since there is no real opportunity in advancement"
bad,"Dollar Tree is not bad to work for there is just no communication there with employees or management, i loved the people that would come in, when a customer would ask where something is i would show them and my manager would yell at me and tell me to point them in the right direction that they could find it them selves"
bad,"It was to dangerous to work with only two people at nite and always womens closing the store."
bad,"I was cross trained. I would work the register, unloading truck, recovery & stocking inventory. The store was such a mess. I tried so hard to clean the place but the management would get upset if I spent too much time cleaning. It was bad to the point where customers would hide dirty diapers, bloody tampons, used q-tips, etc. it was the dirtiest store I had ever seen.  My hours went from 4 days a week to 1 day a week. They took away my cashier shifts to have me work on truck day once a week. I guess because nobody else liked working that shift. This job was not worth my time to get paid approx $30 a week to bust my behind unloading a truck for a few hours. It was great at first, but after a while I felt like I was being punished because I was not able to work the 5am shift. The times i would work as cashier, i would have an extremely long line while my ""backup"" would be making social chitchat with the manager or playing on a cell phone."
bad,It was a nice environment but with unreasonable expectations from its employees and there is little room to discuss any issues if you are just a cashier.
bad,"Always moving, short breaks, and always listening to complaints."
bad,"unfair treatment on the job. Becaus I was the youngest employee, other employees felt like they could order me and I shut it down and handled my situation."
bad,Typical day is I count my register and the bank when opening in the mornings. I learned to be able to handle more than one task at hand with efficiency. Management not the best and I don't get enough hours due to the managers decision. Work isn't hard  just tedious.
bad,I love working there but i dont like the fact that i am only there for a call in... I came in extra hours for my manager and instead of getting rid of people who have been there over a year and call in sick once a week she keeps them part time hours and i MAYBE only get one day per week.
bad,"Typical day at work just consisted of handling a cash register. Also, helping customers around the store."
bad,"need to increase pay"
bad,"the pople weren't as always nice"
bad,"Cash Customers out"
bad,I worked as a store manager for them for almost 7 years after they purchased the stores I worked for Dollar Express. Being payed salary for working 70 or more hours per week I was making less than most of my employees. From Thanksgiving to Christmas you have to work 6 days a week and they reward you with 2 days off for working an extra 5-6.
bad,"opening and closing, assisting manager in daily duties, daily deposits, inventory,"
bad,"A typical day at work. Dealing with late employees, taking lunches early. Wondering if the manager was in a bad mood. If he was in a bad mood, everyone knew it. What I learned there was that it wasn't a very nice work environment. co-workers are nice. hardest part of the job is the schedule maintenance. the most enjoyable part of the job was breaking down the registers to go home."
bad,"not a good work life balance, little opportunity for advancement"
bad,"It depends what location a person works at. I myself loved Dollar Tree on 82nd in Portland, Oregon because of the excellent managers and wonderful customers. Whereas, the managers at Vanplaza are incompetent and the type of customers are rude."
bad,"The only true knowledge that gained from this job was using a register and that was like second nature for me. My customer service   has always been phenomenal. "
bad,"A typical day at worked consisted of restocking shelves with back stock.  Unloading truck once a week, days varying due to federal holidays, weather, or if there is an accident with the truck or driver. It also consisted of ringing up customer purchases on the cash register, assisting customers if needed"
bad,was a good work environment and employees were very out going to keep a good upkeep store and customer service
bad,miserable place to work. manager didnt know what he was doing. would get yelled at doing something you were told to do less than 5 minutes prior
bad,A productive work place with great prices and friendly associates
bad,My manager was overwhelmed with shipment. That was so out of order many if us was my paid in a timely fashion.
bad,was like was the crew i work with but what dislike about was there rush u and there was on a time limit
bad,The hardest part of the job for me would be standing in the same spot for a long period of time because the lines are never ending. I like to move around a little bit once in a while between customers. I also wish that part-time employees could have more hours if requested.
bad,This is a good job for the most part but there are many things that are frustraing about it. It is almost like the company is super concerned about the sales to much they want us to not only do our jobs but our goal is to sell 33 plus extra stuff to customers or we could lose our jobs. It is almost like I dont want to go to work no more the more I go the stricter they get it is getting to be to much that is why I am looking for a better job.
bad,"Learn how to manege a store, did deposit, team work,. I love working with people i am a good customer service. Tuck care of alll the problems with claints. The claints love me."
bad,"Mangement,They didn't know  what manager to hire little work expereance,always unorganized. Staff was great,helpful at times  I would recamended for school kids"
bad,"I have now worked at Hampstead, NC Dollar Tree for almost 2 years now & I have received 1 raised!! & if was for $0.20!! In Dec my mother-in-law & father-in-law does within a week of each other & I was only able to take off a total of 2-3 days!!!! We were so short staffed that I couldn’t even mourn with my family & husband & I’m still furious!!"
bad,Operated cash register during my shift.  In between waiting on customers had to stock the area the manager assigned to do before shift is over.  Clean and straightened store before closing time.  Escort manager to bank to make bank deposit.  I learned how to work in a place that everything for a $1.
bad,If you finished high school and went off to college this is the job for you. A job to have while you're in school. Unless you plan to move up in management. But even if you do once you graduate... LEAVE!!!
bad,"Management needs to understand they are leaders and mentors. One cannot do the jobs assigned properly if they are not taught properly. Management lacks when it comes to communicating with each other about everything! Corporate needs to spend more time working in the stores cashiering, working frozen & dry freight and working recovery.  Maybe their unrealistic expectations of  what tasks can be performed in 4hrs  would change to something more realistic."
bad,"A typical day as a cashier would consist of being given a cash drawer and relieving the cashier who arrived before you. Unless it is the holiday season, the store only has one or two registers open at a time. Sometimes you may be expected to work a later shift than listed on the schedule. "
bad,"Plenty of work you can do if you apply yourself. Never board. It's fun helping customers. The store is currently under new management.  Previous management let the store get run down, dirty and empty shelves.  It's going to take team work to get it back in shape but we see it coming together every day."
bad,Nothing. Never wants to give hours and always low pay. Back room never organized. People that works there don't seem happy and always complain about not having enough hours.
bad,Not worth the time or energy of going into work. I dread going to work. The pay and hours suck. It is not somewhere I would recommend someone to work.
bad,"I enjoy my job for the most part. Some of the managers are very helpful and work with me and are very respectful. My customers are what make my job the most fun. They are very kind and consideratem they compliment me and it makes my day. There is nothing like a smile to brighten your day ,especially from someone just randomly."
bad,"Working at dollar tree is ok for a part time job. Can never get enough hours, pay is about what you would expect for the job and there is no benefits as far as I can remember"
bad,"typical retail place to work at for people who never worked retail before"
bad,Management at the location I worked at tend to have their favored people on payroll. Management easily influenced by rumors which determine employment
bad,"Dollar Tree sells everything for $1. This means in order to stay profitable, they buy in huge quantities and limit the amount of payroll hours the staff can work. They also have a very low hourly rate for cashiers and stockers, which meant a ridiculous amount of turnover."
bad,"Hours were insane. No work life balance, management only cared about sales. Pay and hours for associates is too low for the fast paced work that is required"
bad,I had horrible management and they were not flexible on the hours. No benefits. No overtime. Horrible employees. Store was always dirty and they would let me clean it. They always kept the bathroom closed to to public even tho nothing was wrong with it.
bad,"It was definitely a hectic work environment. The employees were a tad rude/inconsiderate. Management, excluding ONE manager, was okay, on the verge of awful/poor. "
bad,"It's not that bad, it's more like ""I need a temporary job before a real job"" type of job. It helps improves communication skill, most customers are rude. Barely get 10 hours a week."
bad,"Working at the dollar tree Iearned how to run the cash register but when I frist started I didnt hardly get any training,and I also quit because the management wasnt so good,would just leave me on the floor when they our sitting in the office,not helping me,I struggled alot working for retail,I just want a better paying job,someone who trains me to where I understand better, a typical day at work is I would go in clock into work and they would start me off doing cashier "
bad,"To judgement and very stressful ,have you working long hours and under paid.this company does care if you have a family.as long as they make money. They want you to work for 8.50hr and do job of 3 people."
bad,The pay wasn’t very good at all. The only thing I liked about the job were the managers. At times it was overwhelming but no tasks were impossible. It wasn’t all bad but it wasn’t worth the pay at all.
bad,They are very unorganized and demand you drop all personal/family life for the company. Pay wasnt good at all even at full time and you dont receive benefits.
bad,The job is very confusing on how they place their workers and their hours when they come. I can say that they will never acknowledge the employees for their hard work.
bad,Entry level work that requires endurance and multitasking. Fast paced environment that can become understaffed at times and requires diligent work to keep up
bad,"Bad management. Disrespectful to workers. No benefits. Don't work here. The entire company is a revolving door because your only options are work the same part time position forever or take on way too many responsibilities for the very low salary. Management doesn't have the ability to give their workers what they want in a job which makes everyone hate one another at work because the recurring answer to all questions is... ""I can't help you. Just do your job."""
bad,I would sit there for hours without a single customer. The cash resister was not hard to work. I hated the green shirts we had to wear. Totally bored out of my mind.
bad,I hate this job. The manager is bias and don’t like women they leave you alone and barely help you. They slave drive you and the pay isn’t worth it you get paid every 2 weeks
bad,"Working here you’ll never get the hours you need. And probably won’t really be on the schedule at alll but the manager would call you to come in short notice when someone else doesn’t.the co workers are problematic and the pay isn’t all that great and we don’t get any benefits at all like sick days or health insurance,401k, dental insurance etc etc."
bad,Management isn't horrible but not the best. There are opportunities to do other work in the store besides what is already given for experience. Long lines are common more than anything for cashiers. Only two cashiers are stationed at a time. A lot is given to take on and asked of on a kinda regular basis. Over time is paid for. Only part time is available unless it's for management positions. 10 minute breaks are given unless double shifts are taken. Store is undermanned and most employees don't care to be there.
bad,i liked the customer service aspect of the job. i also liked working on the cash register and stocking the shelves. what i didnt like about the job was the lack of hours
bad,Distribution Center uses Engineered Standards to keep score of Associates performance. The numbers wanted are achievable but have to work hard to obtain them. Opportunity to move between departments but none for career advancement without previous supervisory experience. Holding their Trainer title doesn't count as the experience they are seeking.
bad,I worked off the clock all the time as there was a high turnover in management.  Job promotions were offered to me but never occurred.  No respect from management towards ASM’s.  Everyone out for themselves.
bad,Very hot and all they care about is numbers and not about employees they will make you work on holidays and not very caring about home life or family.
bad,Terrible manager attitude. Short breaks. Not instructional. Was able to listen to music while stocking as long as I could hear the other employees. Temporary job
bad,"I did not like working here. Customers are the worst of the worst. On feet for entire shift. Pay was minimum wage. Working here, you’d definitely need more than one job just to get by. Pay didn’t match the workload."
bad,This job started out very decent I worked for a week after being hired but after the week they said i had completed the season and I needed to find another place to work. (When I got hired the manager never stated this was seasonal nor had I checked that on the application) I worked at another dollar tree in puyallup and this dollar tree was short staffed and had a high turn over rate and my direct manager was actually homeless and living in her car and while that is acceptable to me i know she had a lot going on and i myself never got contacted by her despite giving my number many times. Her situation made communication difficult and there had been times she told me to come to the store and there would be no one there or i wouldnt be schedules. I wasnt the only employee this happened too. I showed up on time and kept to myself and filled my quota only to never get called back for my schedule after about 2 months working. Very strange and it left a unprofessional taste.
bad,on truck days we unloaded sometimes a 2000 piece truck put it in  its place in back room. then stock all the product throughout the store.i then  moved to cashier.  and started closing store
bad,The manager is not a nice lady at all. Nothing was ever good enough. I'd do the whole list plus some. She was rude and nasty. The few girls told me thats why she can't keep help because of the way she treats her employees.
bad,"A typical work day is fast paced "
bad,"Dollar Tree is a job I started to get out of the house. But I enjoyed seeing people and helping the customers and my manager needed a assistant Manager so I took the job I had 15 years of Manager training. But you get no appreciate ion for the work you do. I would get about 30 hours a week, do more than 2 people in a 6 hour day.  Many many times I would have to go in to close 5 to 9 I would have to clean the whole store besides all the other management jobs to do inpossible by myself. After3 years I had to have shoulder surgery so I resign to help the store because it would take a year to be completely healed with the word of the top management I could come back   After healing I did try to come back. Only to be told by the same management I was put in the system as unhireable.  They also informed me the home office did it because I was to old. That is against the law not only was I done that way many others was also.  So no this company is not a good place to work."
bad,New distribution center with very high attrition. Horrible managers that have more concerns about impressing each other rather than the welfare of the employees. If you have any self respect avoid this place and their false advertising on job sites like this one. They definitely don't practice what they preach by saying they are very big on family etc. Terrible work experience with this company
bad,"Dollar Tree doesn't care about their employees, especially the Management. They expect you to go above and beyond the call of duty yet they don't care if you get a lunch break or that you have a life outside of Dollar Tree. In some districts you're traveling to other stores to help out 1-2 days a week and your store isn't meeting company standards. You get very little hours to run your store so most of the time there are only 2 people there ( manager and cashier). I was with the company for 8 years...3 ASM/ 5 SM. I loved it in the beginning but after a while you see through the blurred lines and realize it's just not worth it."
bad,"I've worked here for 4 years and have learned about money handling. I worked as a part time Assistant manager at one time and learned how to do deposits at night to the bank and handle the store and employees on my own.  If the pay were better and I could get into a full time position for the benefits, it would be awesome.  It is in fact difficult to get into a full time store manager position as they are the only ones in the company who have full time positions in the retail stores."
bad,"A typical day at the Dollar Tree stared between 3am and 5am, the team lead/manager would tell people what section they would be working and then we would all begin."
bad,"Last resort better than nothing.. very few hours "
bad,"Worst company to work for. The head management obviously cares very little about there staff. I had worked as a assistant manager there for two years. I received zero training and was just thrown into it, our manager walked out and took them almost three months to find a “replacement”. And raises aren’t a thing."
bad,"Our store got fined $50,000 twice for unsafe working conditions. There were multiple times that coworkers had entire shelves of merchandise fall on top of them."
bad,"When i worked at the Dollar tree located in Fountain, CO in 2012, the hours were inconsistent, i would get called to not come in due to the fact they couldnt pay me or give me hours to work. The two paychecks i did get didnt even cover any bills."
bad,"Store managers often work over 70 hours per week as store does not get enough budgeted hours to cover all shifts.   They threaten managers with write ups almost every week for not meeting impossible expectations.  "
bad,"It is a good job to start off with but the management really needs work. They do not care about employees at all. The payment is minimum and it is just not worth it. You have to deal with rude customers everyday and clean after the mess they leave.Also, you just have a 10 minute break."
bad,"It sucked at Dollar Tree, sometimes only working 5 hours or 8 hours a week. I couldnt keep going on doing all of the work to get treated less than. .."
bad,"This is a good job for someone who want to settle, It is not a happy place to work, often understaffed, overstressed, and micromanaged. Expected to work intense hours without appreciation."
bad,"Good if you're young. Most management doesn't know what they're doing. Little communication, one coworker constantly made me feel bad until they moved her locations (great idea ha). If you hang out with coworkers outside of work you get better hours."
bad,"The managers at the Bell Gardens location are horrible. Favoritism is definitely a thing here. Hours rage from how much you suck up to the boss. Although they attempt to work with your schedule, that will usually mean you get one day of work a week. Management needs some training and should learn how to communicate better with its employees because they truly are running a horrible show there."
bad,A very stressful environment....  Physically and emotionally. There were no chances to advance in position. I felt disrespected and somewhat discriminated against. The pay was poor considering the amount of work that was expected out of the employees.
bad,"During my employment I was subjected to a negative and hostile work environment. A typical day at work consisted of dealing with hostile shoplifters, ignorant, crazy, and disrespectful customers, lazy and disparaging managers and coworkers, and no sense of logistics what so ever. My managers and coworkers were disparaging, unethical, and lacking in communication skills. There was a toxic workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was dealing with bad management."
bad,"Long working hours, sometimes 7days a week, no days off, not enough time to eat lunch or break time for the hours that you work. Working conditions are not up to par like they should be ."
bad,"You never got raises or anythint, they treated there employee like garbage sometimes. Noone wanted to work so you would have to take everyone else's responsibilities."
bad,I can't say that the entire company is bad to work for because that wouldn't be fair. But I often worked 40+ hours a week as a part time employee because of employees calling off or quitting. I also got threatened a lot on the job and quit because I didn't feel safe especially on closing shifts.
bad,This is not a company to work for if you're looking for a career. Dollar Tree is a company if you need to work part-time for extra  income employment.
bad,"It was difficult working with managers who take advantage of there authority and try to make other feel less about the,selves because of there job position."
bad,"My manager treated me very unfairly. I was fired for an unknown reason. I was given no warning and no chance to improve. The district manager was not much help in the situation. The environment was busy, hectic, and disorganized at times. Whatever I did was never good enough. Pay was 10 cents above minimum. Would not recommend my local store, but I hope the others are better."
bad,"After working in two different stores for this company, it really depends on who your boss is that will make or break your experience. The management could be so much better, it is quite ridiculous on how the company is run. It is a good part-time job to have while you're in high school, but not a long-term career. The higher ups do not care about their employees, just the money and a good image."
bad,Great place to shop but not work. I think that alot should change . They is so much that could help the business if they would be open to things. Treat everyone as family and be a team
bad,Worst place I ever worked to get any hours we would have to be on call all the time. We would be asked 30 minutes before a shift if we could come In and if for some reason we couldn't  we would be treated unfair and lose hours only be schedule 2 days the following week. We work our butt off and get treated like dirt..
bad,"A good first or temporary job to apply to. Pretty easy going unless it's a very busy day which most likely are days after payday. Of course dealing with the public means dealing with different personalities. I would say I learned some good self control and how to deal with different people accordingly. Overall, easy place to work but management made it unenjoyable at times. My attitude would be satisfy the customers, get my work done, and head out. If you love to make money while keeping up with others peoples business and petty drama, this is the place for you."
bad,I feel like they just threw people in this store and said go ahead. Management doesn’t know simple things like how I can do direct deposit. The store is never fully stocked. Boxes everywhere. Just very onrganized.
bad,"Managers are not honest, they steal  and to them, ALL EMPLOYEES ARE THIEVES(except their friends). Managers are lazy and.  UNPROFESSIONAL, UNEDUCATED."
bad,For part time workers this is a good spot to start. Flexible hours and a small group of workers. Easy to get into and good for future jobs to get into.
bad,"this place had no benefits and no place to move up in the chain at all. worked you like a dog, had one half hour break and then right back to work. sometimes it was fun, low pay rate."
bad,I honestly didn't care for the job. The hours weren't impressive and the pay wasn't enough to pay for anything. But it gave me experience so I am happy with that.
bad,I will never work for another place that has a weak managment. If your management is overruled and overrun by your employees then it's not really management.
bad,"While working at Dollar Tree, I did not feel safe working night shifts. It was only 2 people closing, including the manager, & it was not a good neighborhood. The employees do not care about the customers, they only gossip and do not do their work properly. I did not have a good experience working there."
bad,"High stress and sometimes unrealistic expectations for stocking and managing procedures."
bad,"When working there the upper management did not properly schedule other coworkers. Management was not strict on all policies the way they should have been with all employees, Customers would have to wait in line for a good 20 minutes sometimes if not longer while waiting to be rng up. Upper management never did anything about this. Paid leave and sick days were not given when needed even after talking with HR."
bad,"Associate was hired in Davenport FL.  Instead of scheduling based on operational needs, associate is a back fill to cover only last minute call outs. Or for late truck deliveries. Discriminating maybe? When asked why no hours were scheduled for a fourth week, mgmt replied they tried calling the number on file, with no answer. Asked why associate was not informed when associate called store for schedule, silence was the norm. Or the potential to leave a voice mail? Now, since no one wants to work July 4, 2018. Associate was scheduled??? Let us see if there is any retaliation for speaking out."
bad,"They pitch this job as a great company.  Only work so many hours,  hard work rewarded, and great change for advancement  without the politics. But oh my god!!! The store they put me in is a hellhole! It's a large store, but they only give you hours for a small store so you have lines of 20+, only two stockers for 1800 piece trucks, and no sales floor associated to pick up all the stuff people leave laying around. And believe me in my store the customers have absolutely no respect for anything. They destroy the store and then complain about it.  I'll clean one aisle and 20 minutes later its trashed, boxes ripped open and stuff just thrown on the floor and shelves.  I walked into this store and was told would take 4-5months to get clean so I have been working 60+ hours 13 hour days, but then comes in three weeks later and says worse. I mean what do u do when backroom overflowing and still receiving 1800 piece trucks. Its gonna end up on floor. This company expects miracles that cannot be reached and then blamed it on your management skills,  not the real reason Dollar Tree doesn't want to spend the necessary money on payroll which would make a huge difference.  And on top of it 75% of your time is on register.  And they don't pay ASM'S nearly what they are worth."
bad,"management tried to be accommodating."
bad,There was a lot of work expected in a little amount of time with not enough staff to get it all done. Under payed and under appreciated. The staff was not always trained properly.
bad,It is a part-time company. they don't have the hours to give the many employees they hire to keep minimal cost. good first time work experience. Pay to low to Support a family. good for extra cash. fun environment
bad,"No advancement opportunities or raises"
bad,Don't appreciate hard workers. They hire by the buddy system. Managers barely work. Pay sucks. No one is full time except management. Everyone makes minimum wage. Very disrespectful managers.
bad,"My duties were greeting customers, answering questions, stocking during down time, and being the only cashier during shift. I had to run store while manager stayed in office the whole shift."
bad,Some days we dont have enough cashiers. So some days I have to come in and get on the register. I learned how to be patient with others. I learned how to work effectively. The hardest part at times is dealing with customers who are rude. I enjoy helping the customers.
bad,Working for Dollar Tree means taking on roles that you are not trained for. Dealing with customers who think you owe them the world. Some of the management staff was lazy and wouldn't help if you needed them.
bad,The job was ok. But at least in the location I worked they were constantly cutting hours because other stores stole all the hours for the district. It was a really thankless job.
bad,"Advertising products, cashing out people, handling money, good customer service, check and credit transactions, bagged items. I learned how to be a good team worker."
bad,"This Job was one of the worst i have ever worked. The store manager was horrible. screamed at you for no reason, bordered on harassment. Also did it in front of customers. wasn't understanding with schedules or anything personal. had a medical problem and had to go to the hospital and got yelled at for needing to leave. I've reserved my w2's late both years i worked there. i would not recommend working there. they work u hard for little pay. unless your desperate don't work hear."
bad,A typical day a the Dollar Tree is usually fast pace especially being a cashier. We were always short staffed which made an average work day more stressful. I learned the basics of being a cashier which included scanning items and providing good customer service to each customer.
bad,I didn't really enjoy working for this company . The customer service wasn't that good but I was only a cashier when I worked for this company . The store wasn't that clean or stocked that well . Things was all over the floor and my managers wasn't that professional .
bad,Always answer your phone for the Manager. Be very cautious counting money. Greet your customers and make sure they had all the help needed and are satisfied with their purchased merchandise.
bad,"Operate cash-register, customer service, handle exchanges, do ""go-backs"",  to over-qualified with my 25+ years of grocery experience, different clientele than regular grocery stores."
bad,"Stocking shelves, putting return items back, checking patients out when they finished shopping, cleaning at the end of the shift with moping, and vacuuming."
bad,Management was crazy the store was always a mess and no one cared i almost fell in the storage room and would of got hurt and because i left they want give me a job at any of the dollar tree.
bad,it was a awful job with very poor management no on wanted to work just stood around talking manager was always getting high outside on the property and the clock there was never more them one cashier  ever at once so the lines were always back to the back of the store so many customer complaints its horrible
bad,"I was promised more hours. I asked about the hours and was pretty much told that they never said that. I loved working there. Loved the people, my co workers, the store. I put alot of pride in my work. But I couldn't afford to drive to the store location for the amount of hours I was given. Would go back if I could get more hours"
bad,long hard labor very little pay or room for advancement. employees are shown little respect. conditions are horrible in the summer time very hots and given very little breaks
bad,the company is ok to work for as long as you don't mind no personal time constant phone calls and conflicting directions from supervisors and corp office. as a store manager you can forget about having much of a life outside dollartree.
bad,"Customer service is rough people treat you really bad sometimes I like a lot of my regular customers.i try to talk to some people they act like they don't know how to communicate to other people.i would really like to get a better job than customer service, I just need a change in my job"
bad,Do you want to work somewhere that will let you know Saturday the 1st what your schedule is for Sunday the 2nd-Saturday the 8th? You might close the store until 10pm Saturday and expected back at 5am Sunday. You are told Saturday what your Sunday schedule is. I absolutely hated that! DM was a big bully and Store Manager tried to bully as well.
bad,Is not a clean store. Hardley anyone working and manager duties are unacceptable. This is not a good job to obtain. All workers are lazy and do not help customers.
bad,"Dollar Tree is a billion dollar corporation and pay their management the state minimum. As store manager you are working 60 hours a week, work every position at the store from stocker to cashier to stocking and merchandising manager. overtime is NOT allowed which is why the store managers are so overworked.. but still get the bare minimum in pay? ridiculous. Store manager gets no real breaks or vacations because as corporate says ""you're salary"" which ultimately means you have UNLIMITED HOURS!! Busy stores and you're only allotted hours based on your sales.. so when people walk out because the lines are too long, hours are basically walking out your front door. Not enough pay for the work that needs to be done at these stores."
bad,"A typical day at work started with getting carts ready with store supplies to start restocking the store if the day began in the morning. Midday shift and night shift were assigned with with either cashier duties or with cleaning the store as it was always in a miserable shape. Management was poor very poor, some employees went in and were somehow above the manager. The workplace culture was dismal at best only a few employees spoke English as the rest were from Mexico. They typically formed their own small groups mostly keeping to them selves. Hardest part of the job was unloading the truck as we always used the bare minimum amount of employees to unload sometimes with no supervisor."
bad,It wouldn't be such a bad place to work if they gave more hours where they are needed. I got 0 hours this week because they hired a new manager and its just not enough for me.
bad,It's an okay place for someone to start working to save little money but definitely not a place you would want to stay there forever. Good coworkers and environment.
bad,I really don't like working for Dollar tree they require too much work for no pay this job is like slavery you dnt even get no raise and only hire pt workers only way full time if you become management and still not enough pay with the job that comes with it. You cant live off this job and take care of a family. It very stressful
bad,When I used to work there I was a cashier and never got a lot of hours. Working the register can be stressful due to the fact that you will be the only cashier for a majority of your shift. The assistant manager will help you if it gets big but when it gets packed customers will get upset and ask why there is only 2 cashiers.
bad,"its overall a good place to work , they just do not pay enough and they are very unprofessional. They also make you do more then what you applied for."
bad,"Yes! They got sued for not paying there employees."
bad,Worked there almost a year and the manager there was the cancer in the whole store. She was always talking about employees and customers. She was stealing money and hours from us employees. She had bad practices.
bad,"Management is terrible. No benefits, no decent hours, not enough employees to help. The wage is nowhere near manageable and everything is a mess. I would not recommend."
bad,I really enjoyed working for this company in the beginning then they switched management and everything went downhill from there. I feel  like this company does not take care of their employees at all.
bad,Good place to work if you are still in high school. They pay every two weeks. It gets busy all the time. There isn't really any benefits in this company. Management really isn't there its more of you teach yourself.
bad,"typical day work - entering data , cleaning , stocking , cashiering , resetting ,receiving . what I learned to enter data to do receiving and resets. management - long hr. under paid , workplace culture some what friendly , little stress . hardest part of the job making things fit in a very small store. most enjoyable part of the job - working as a team."
bad,Low hours and alot empty promises. Was told i would have garrenteed 2. Four hour shifts a week and because my siezures i was told i wasnt able to continue woeking cuss i was a safety hazard because my siezure disorder yet they kept me on the schedule.
bad,This is a very fast paced business and its okay as first job but not for someone wanting more out of life. Like its okay and all with the customers and what not but for what were getting payed i feel like its not to my liking.
bad,"A typical work day is dealing with a lot of customers and making sure they leave with everything they came in looking for."
bad,It depends on the situation. Everyone works differently. Everyone has a point of view. Cashiers do other things while certain people do other things but don't help as much.
bad,"I have a Strong Distaste for this establishment. They work you to death and give you low pay, with NO ROOM of growth to excel. They belittle employees, with negative disrespect. I have nothing really to say that's positive about this company. They're ruthless savages."
bad,"Bad management team, seems to have little to no grasp on basic functions and team building. Very low pay and hours. Very little room for advancement."
bad,It was a good job in general if you were looking for just any job but the dollar tree i worked at was not stable nor was it organized. It was very hard to do my job because there was no organization to do anything and communication with one another was not as it should be in a work place. The most enjoyable was when all the co workers would get along and work together as a team but rarely did it happen
bad,Dollar Tree where everything is a buck and that's how they treat their people: like they are things.  Since the merger with Family Dollar the culture is terrible.  Dollar Tree knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.  One is expected to work 60+ hours a week and senior leadership does not invest in the tools needed to do our job.
bad,Lot of hard work and heavy lifting.  Very fast paced be prepared to work hard.  Christmas time is especially difficult.  Need to think of employees more.
bad,"I got 2 promotions in about 4 months. After my second promotion I was maxed out and couldn't make any more money with the company unless I wanted to work 60 hours a week for 36,000 a year."
bad,"You'll fight to get hours, even after they lie when they hire you and say you'll get plenty of hours... the pay is terrible and management really doesn't care about you because the place is a revolving door. You're just another ""body"" to them. Nobody is really full time, except the store manager, and that's how they want to keep it. Don't waste your time. If you need a weeks pay, you won't get it working here."
bad,You are not only a cashier but a fill in manager and part time stocker. The store has a horrible turn over rate which means that when others quit you have to take their slack.
bad,I was only scheduled two days out of the week. I was told I get at least 30 hours never did happen. I also had no clue who to go to when I had a problem because our management was always different. Everyone that worked there was either having bad attitudes or didn't like the place.
bad,"When I started out at Dollar Tree I mainly stocked the shelves with merchandise and set up the warehouse for truck day and organizing how messy it became. I learned a lot how to work in a warehouse which prepared me for my most recent job at Flex. I enjoyed my Co-workers immensely. Though, My manager wasn't the best. What I did not like most about this job was how messy the stock room got the day(s) before truck day. My favorite part was being able to work independently."
bad,"Store Managers are pulled in too many directions often with very little support.  There is nothing you don't do for overall store operations and the feeling is you don't give your proper time to any.  Work hours are long.  Labor is very tight and it is difficult to remain on tasks as you are pulled in multiple directions.  Responsibilities include the following:  ordering, stocking, accounting, dsd deliveries, cleaning, merchandising, resets, scheduling, hiring/firing, receiving, and inventory."
bad,Management does not seem to truly care about the quality of the store. My co-workers were not concerned with the cleanliness or organization of the store. I enjoyed doing my job but simply take too much pride in my work to stay on a team that does not share those values.
bad,"Stocking, cashiering, cleaning, was the majority of the job.  Manager would make a list of items to be done for the day that was impossible to complete. The hardest part of the job was to get tasks completed and standing for long periods of time.  I enjoyed working with the public."
bad,Everyone's real respectful greets you with a smile and a hello. The greatest part of this job is being around a positive environment and the most negative is not having enough hours.
bad,Bad work environment. They treat you poorly. Low pay for the many hours. There was no real Management and the Managers were always leaving to go to other stores.
bad,"management would come in interrupt others working to go talk and smoke and leave work for others. Upper management did not ever come in and check on store, very un organized when time for inventory"
bad,"Management is very dysfunctional, assistant manager lies about employees to get them fired.  Co-workers don't like their job and do very minimal work. Hardest part of the job is getting a hold of the general manager and trying to clarify availability. Manager does not listen to requests for working and does not respect my availability. Customers are great and hardly give me a hard time but is easily sorted out when they do."
bad,"I had a great experience working with Dollar Tree"
bad,I enjoyed Dollar Tree but didn't like what management or corp did to the employees who were just trying to make a living.  One week they gave you 4 days the next 2 day maybe 1 day.  My co workers were great I loved working with them as well as some of the Assist managers and only a couple managers.  The hardest part of the job was not having the backup when the customer became Irate and you couldn't depend on your boss for backup.  The best part were the some of the co-workers and the customers.  I loved dealing with them.
bad,Although Dollar Tree was probably the most rewarding job that I had it was scary.  I believe in 2nd chances for all but I was afraid to go to work most days because they dont background check leaving you to not know who or what you are working with.  If your social security number matches your name....you are hired.  I dont even think the employment application asks any criminal questions.  The pay is minimum wage so people are barely making it and hours are cut according to the stores budget.  That leaves people to do what they have to do to survive.  I was in awe of the merchandise that was sold in the store and totally believe that Dollar Tree is a value to its customers.
bad,Can be a great place to work work is simple by the common sense method but the environment is aggressive and not good for your health due to Management and apparent and present surroundings..!!
bad,Company its great but benefits are awful. No personal life balance. Too many responsibilities. Great crew I had. Nice place to shop.
bad,"Show up to work early in the morning, Be the first there and wait for managers. Then wait to unload a truck that is late and causes the shift to last an extra 2 hours and pushes work back."
bad,"things were a mess most of the time, very rude and picky customers, bad hours, manager was not the greatest. i did not enjoy my time working there at all, i never got told what i had to do till it was too late. when i got told to ask for more hours if i wanted i did then got in trouble for asking by the same person who told me to."
bad,I think that Dollar Tree could of been a better place to work for if the manager and assistant manager would of done there job right and show up for work on time. When I am going to work I don't  think it is very appropriate for the manager to be showing up a hour or later for work when there are employees and customers waiting to get into the store.
bad,"get to work switch register with my co worker take over the store.   "
bad,"Good place to work if its your first job or for a second job."
bad,"For a typical day at work, I do not get the respect that I deserve. There is someone that continues to try to get myself fired over little things. I have learned that it is a dog eat dog world and you have to learn to defend for yourself. On the other hand, some of the co-workers are wonderful to work with, nice and understanding. The hardest part of the job is when family emergencies arise and I need a day off but they refuse and tell me that it's my job or my families health."
bad,It's a nice place to work but could be ran better from upper level. Some of the coworkers are fun to work with and make it worth while
bad,good company to work for as part time employment. I would not recommend a career future with this company. they offer no benefits and only pay 7.25 an hour not much for any one to live off of these days.
bad,This job was pretty brutal and with not a lot of people working each shift I had to cover multiple jobs and was always rushing. The co-workers and management were friendly but for some reason the managers tended to hang around in  the office for long periods of time.
bad,"Hours are short and people are friendly for the most part, co-workers are okay, most enjoyable is meeting new people in the community and seeing them everyday"
bad,"its a lot of hard work and you are on your feet a lot unloading truck over 4,000 pieces by hand its hard on your back it was  the worse job i had you work hard for very little paid"
bad,"I don't know where to begin. I picked up at job at Dollar Tree to help at bills between better jobs. The management was terrible. It would be a whole 5 pages worth of stuff to write about management. If you needed to pay bills, this was not the place. 16 hours a week at minimum wage. Good luck requesting time off. Also, good luck finding someone to come in if you called off. If they couldn't find someone, you were forced to come in. The customers were seriously frustrating. I couldn't keep count on two hands the number of times someone e came up to me and asked, ""How much is this?"" It's a dollar, it's posted EVERYWHERE in the store. By the time you got off work at night, you were ready for bed and didn't even want a social life. You got one 10 min break. Good luck trying to eat lunch or something. If someone called off, there was a good chance you were going to be forced to stay over. I'll shop there, but never again work there."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me greeting customers, completing all transactions in a efficient and timely matter, dealt with high volume lines and had to multi-task between product information and customer service"
bad,"Cash handling, light stocking, answer phone, greet customers, "
bad,calm day until customers realize store was opened. was always messy when i worked bu\because employees were lazy. i learned the more you keep to yourself at work the less distracted you may get
bad,"Very busy over worked under paid  long hours, rarely get breaks because (but it is against co policy not to take them)they are always short staffed. Little to no raise annually (.10),so come asking for what you want because your likely to see only 10cents a year raise. I've only had one good manager who was very hard working  and fair most manager have their pick and issue assignment according to their likes, others give out work that they won't do and they expect so much in a short time to complete it. One good thing is they have a program to advance to management positions if you like and it is a growing company so the have positions available."
bad,"The absolute best thing about this job was the employees. Only job I've ever had where it felt like management was constantly pushing employees. The total numbers at end of each night were the only criteria by which employees were rated. Employees that tried their best were still let go if productivity numbers were not attained within the timeline slated by management. The low rate of pay was excused with the promise of a bonus if the numbers each employee were held to was kept for the entire month. These numbers were set into a scale to determine actual bonus. Once the goals were attained they must be maintained or management was asking for reasons."
bad,Not so friendly co-workers or customers. Management wasn't pleasant. Not enough pay
bad,"A typical day at work was busy.I learned that you have to be on your toes all the time.I think management could of worked w-their employees better.Some of the co workers would slack on their job.The hardest part of the job was getting harassed by an assistant manager while pregnant.The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others,being employed,& getting extra hours."
bad,"Great customer service, good people skills, priced merchandiser stocked shelves"
bad,I hated working there it was a part time position but was called in for full time. management was like high schoolers causing drama and going out and partying all the time.
bad,Horrible management staff. The work there was never done because the manager only gave the employees part time shifts. Constantly getting ridiculed because the employees couldn't get products out as fast as the manager expected.
bad,Can be a great place to work if you have the right team and the right District Manager.
bad,"As an asst mgr you were always on call, no time for a personal life. The store was ALWAYS understaffed...usually only 2 people (cashier and an asst mgr) per shift. Being only 2 people in the store you were still expected to be back up cashier,  recover the store and put out freight. It was impossible to meet their expectations. "
bad,"unload trucks a lot of responsibility for little money, not much room for advancement"
bad,"I really enjoyed working for Dollar Tree the employees are nice management could be better. The hardest part of the job was the manager you never new if you were going to get in trouble or not. I love Dollar Tree and all the customers  that came in there, if management was different I would have never left."
bad,"You simply stock merchandise your whole shift"
bad,"A typical work day required me to provide wonderful customer service to all customers. I learned that if you go above and beyond to please someone, you most likely will get good results at the end. My co-workers were very respectable, I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers, and the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting nice customers throughout the day."
bad,management was not organized enough did not get many hours.wasnt professional at all
bad,"Other than running a productive and profitabe store I was the district trainer. I did all the highering for the management team in my district, was on the interview panel and conducted all the training in the district. "
bad,"Overall, the company basically gives no hours to employees who work there more than an year.  "
bad,it was not a fun place to work at people treated you bad and if you try to work harded they put you down and may you feel like dirt.
bad,Dollar Tree is a good work environment for workers that are just starting out in the work force. They provide the basics for customer service and provide training for good people skills.
bad,"The Dollar Tree I worked at had a kind staff, but it had poor values and security was terrible: There was none. I felt unsafe the entire time I worked there and I was left alone on the floor often in the huge store; I felt as if any second there was somebody going to come in and rob the place. If anything, I learned there that I would definitely need some self defense classes!"
bad,"bad management, under staff at times, store stayed messy at times , the pay was ok could be better."
bad,"I liked working there at first, it was a really fun store and a better job than taco bell, but my hours started to decrease and we got a new manager who is far from nice."
bad,"i worked at one of the London Ontario locations, i found the head manager was belligerent and sexiest in my almost 1 yr of working there i was maybe 2 males that work there the manager that interviewed me was nice and kind but did state that she normally hired females (many of my collages had confirmed that statement) after some hard times and due to a move i had asked to be moved from a position where i was to be on call and not having a proper mode of transportation that was reliable for that position they denied it and stated that was the only reason for me being there was mainly to deal with there unloading of their products and they are extremely biased"
bad,The store manager that we have now dosen't like to do much he's rude to us and the customers if we call him for change that we need in our register before we run out he gets attitudes about that he don't want to deal with the bread man bank people when they come and get the deposits and don't like to answer the phone when customers mainly call to speak with the store manager he doesn't speak
bad,Dollar Tree has stripped all their stores to the staffing bone. Expectations high without staff to achieve goals or meet expectations. Systems and policies create a compliance culture that is fast and furious.
bad,"Provide customer service and perform basic tasks at store locations. Primary job duties include greeting customers, ringing up purchases, handling returns, and answering questions about products, policy, and services. Inventory stock items and record data manually or using computer, Document discrepancies and adjust errors, Deliver incoming stock to various departments, Verify, inspect and label incoming orders and store in central supply area, organize, stock, and restock shelves with goods for sale, replace and rotate items on the sales floor in compliance with store procedures, follow inventory or restock reports generated by previous or ongoing sales data to replace items, assist management space and display areas where new products are offered, receiving as well, checking in expected deliveries according to company procedures, categorize and store these goods for immediate placement on the store’s sales floor or within the backroom or warehouse, ensuring storage areas are clean and organized, allowing for the efficient retrieval of items to be stocked and sold,  understanding safe food handling procedures and environmental temperatures is mandatory, ensuring  all perishable food items are properly stocked and stored in ways that maintain safe handling standard operating procedures."
bad,great starter job or job fr those who have been out of the work life for a while. If management were to work together more and not be putting others down the company would strengthen more.
bad,My daily routine were being a cashier customer service light cleaning and stocking the store And helping customers find what they were looking for an problem-solving
bad,"This was my first job, so i took it without a thought. I typically cashiered and ""recovered"", which consists of cleaning the messes customers make throughout the day while shopping. Not my first choice of job."
bad,I HATED this job. People where rude and it was poor management we were asked to work long hours and as a manager was denied my holiday bonus which resulted in me eventually leaving this company
bad,"Management and corporate absolutely do not care about you. Every manager I've worked with has shown almost no human empathy, and is instead obsessed with meeting corporate's outlandish goals every week. There is no communication between levels, resulting in disproportionate amounts of inventory, nightmarish schedule changes, and no room for upward movement. The only good thing about working here is that all your coworkers are your brothers in arms in the endless suffering this black hole of a job inflicts upon you."
bad,The hardest part about this job is the customers. They are some of the most terrible customers. A typical day at work is usually just checking out and bagging people’s groceries
bad,"Managers do not have any control over the stores. They are scared and afraid of the Regional Managers and pass this negativity down. We receive our schedule on Friday the week before we are scheduled for Sunday, no advanced notice. Dollar Tree Managers will tell other employers that you are not a good employee so that you cannot advance in your career. They want to retain everyone without respect."
bad,I even once had a manager call me  dumb for something stupid. great support let me tell ya. Any homeless person that comes in gets watched like a hawk and treated like trash.
bad,This would be a good company if the employees were treated with respect. They expect way to much out of their employees. They want you to go above an beyond your job title. They are never satisfied. You never have a straight schedule so you can not make plans. I never know when the schedule will change at a moments notice. Even when I have a schedule for the week in my hand.
bad,"I can only speak about the store I work at - my store is particularly terrible. "
bad,They were very unorganized and unprofessional. Management could be better and show up to work on time and also could give better instructions when it comes to a task being done
bad,"Worked there for a long time. Staff was constantly changing. Management was ""above"" everyone else. Hours were cut all the time. I was never offered an option of moving up to anything  like management position or anything. Overall felt like they expected a lot from staff but didnt have anything to offer but minimum wage and hour cuts."
bad,always stessed. no balence between work snd life. you dont matter. they push for profits. employee turn over is extremely high. Morale is very low almost no incentive to work
bad,"Cashier,go backs."
bad,I am an assistant manager.  I do not get paid accordingly.  I am not being paid as much as younger assistant managers promoted at the same time as me.  I am required to do the same job.
bad,"every day varied, the hardest part of the job is doing everything on your own, the most enjoyable time working there was my vacation time off, they dont pay enough"
bad,Job was easy but the pay was minimum wage and I never received more than twenty hours of work per week. Liked my co-workers but they offered no benefits at all since everyone except management was considered part time.
bad,Everything is a dollar can't bet that it was a nice place to work at until the manger that hire me relocate and another gm came in and it went to her head
bad,"Very under payed for the amount of work required from a person.  A very negative place to work, never a complement on anything that is done always negative saying it should be done better. There are never enough hours scheduled for the amount of work that needs to be done. And upper management is horrible."
bad,The customers were great and your led to believe in your interview that within 30-60 days you’ll get big raise with fulltime hours and benefits but it never happens it’s always part time minimum wage and there’s people still there that started when I did and are still waiting to become fulltime and get decent pay with benefits after several years. And if your cash register over even by One Penny it goes in Your File and after 3 times of your til being over or under they terminate You Thankfully I found different job Before that happened to me But One Penny?? Come On
bad,"I applied and when discussing my availability I mentioned that I would be getting a second job but as of right now I was open. I told the Store manager that I would obviously discuss my other work schedule with them to keep an open line of communication and make sure to be productive at both places of employment. He agreed to those terms but when it came time he was abrasive when talking to me, purposefully scheduled me when he knew I couldn't work and said ""getting a second job was your own doing. You said you had an open schedule and if you can't work here, you don't have to"".  He also threatened firing employees, talked about them behind their backs and sometimes tried starting fights with some of the delivery truck drivers. I finally quit when he withheld my check from me one time."
bad,"unless ur looking to get underpaid for a super easy job and basicly do ur managers job as well,and being the only one in the store when not supposed to be dont work here."
bad,Constantly made to work off the clock if you are the only manager there you don't get a lunch but don't worry because the edit your time saying you did
bad,Too much work and stress for very little pay! Only get 10 minute break if you work less than 6 hours a day. Told them I have another part time job that I'll need time off for but when requesting time off you don't always get it so then you got to tell them again! They treat certain employees better than others(favorites) . Not enough people working there in a days time. Only one employee and a boss working night shift.
bad,"Management was lacking and nothing got done by who should be doing it. Basically I did everyones job and received nothing but mistreatment from my manager. People left often and with no notice, all because of the manager. The manager mistreated anyone in management under her and it drove all of them away, myself included after being loyal to her through it all, bad mouthing about me to other employees as soon as I gave my two weeks notice."
bad,This job is just a job if you need one bad they hire anyone on drugs criminal record they don’t pay enuff or give enuff hrs I wudnt recommend this job to anyone it’s really a job for teenagers or a person retired
bad,they work their salaried managers to death and then yell at them when things are not right due to them.  do not give much help either.  Cashier and stockers were only allowed to be schedule 15 hours a week.
bad,"Dollar tree is not a very good place to work, they demand high volume with little pay, the amount of work you put in will never matter to the company I was there for 8 years and then was fired due to an out of work injury when I had to take time off. I would not recommend this for a career"
bad,"This retailer is about processing freight quickly, expected to cashier accurately, starting minimum wage, no benefits and not much room for advancement, flexible schedule, short shifts."
bad,Good for part-time must have open availability fairly easy position money transactions customer greeting stop and restock store clean and help customers
bad,"I loved my customers I loved the environment , unfortunately my managers and most co workers  had bad attitudes made work a little stressful and awkward ! It could be a really spunky upbeat fun store"
bad,The only good thing I learned at this job was how to help customers. The staff wasn't very friendly and the environment was pretty uncomfortable. They required us to come in extremely early in the morning and the overall attitude was unpleasant.
bad,"I've NEVER been treated like ""we"" as the employees are thieves and the dm's response to everything is, Fire them, hire someone else. I am appalled at how unprofessional the dm is and how he treats us employees, we don't matter, and he talks down to us. I've noticed customer service isn't #1 to this company."
bad,Cant find a job they are giving bad reference say thete not but found out from a manager that got fired she got set up like others i wouldnt work for them pay not worth it
bad,"Typical day at work:"
bad,"Working management gave me the experience to succeed with other Job opportunities. I got to work every position, some was difficult but it gave me a good outlook on everything."
bad,"No room to advance in other positions, poor management, minimum wage, strict dress code, no benefits, lack of hours, dirty stores, rude customers, rude employees."
bad,"“Good Ole Boys” environment; Management has a punish first praise last mindset; No structure for training; No opportunity to progress; Work load is manageable but ultimately days are long with tidings task to fill the day; punished for socializing or morale building of any form. If your a introvert married with five kids then the Warrensburg DC might be the place for you. Otherwise, not the culture or environment for any outgoing individuals."
bad,I atarted as a stocker and was forced to become a cashier because of short staff. That should not have been my responsibility though. The wage was the same 8.25 even though i was doing 2 difference jobs
bad,the job was easy and it was a cool enviroment it was just the manager that is no longer there now but he was very diffult to deal with so i quite he was messing with everyone pay
bad,"It is a peaceful, more slow paced job. But at times can get pretty hectic. Good if you are looking for part time work within your area. Dollar trees are appearing everywhere."
bad,"When I started, I wasn't getting a lot of hours - but it was enough to survive on. Management was fair, friendly and understanding. The store was organized and the tasks asigned were reasonable but they pay was never good."
bad,They had me work only 3 hours so they didnt have to worry about our breaks. No break. We uad 10 min instead of 15. Bigger dollar trees aren't as bad still little hours but at least 4 hours and up
bad,"Stocking, ringing up customers, and phone calls "
bad,"Dont do it!!!!!!!!!!! They will work you til the end of time.....There is no support from upper management and all everyone cares about there are the numbers. If you have a family uoy will have to choose one or the other."
bad,"Inconsistent job schedule, poor management. The manager is extremely unprofessional and favors certain employees. Never knew what day's I was going to be working until the night before."
bad,"Take advantage of people working there by not paying enough money to live on.  Not give people enough hours on the clock , and only hire part-time so as not to have to pay benefits."
bad,Inconsistent scheduling. Schedule changed on a day and hourly basis. Felt pressure to work when needed. Not enough help to do the recovery process. Worked 6 months and no iLearn training yet. Told that I had to find a moment when I was not working. Most workers work off the clock just to get the work done to make the manager happy. The manager fusses at you for punching out late yet does not complain if you work for no pay. If corporate knew that staff was not being trained then someone in management would be fired. Bathroom breaks are not allowed but when told to do so. On the ironic side staff can smoke as often as they like on work time.
bad,"most of the time i worked at dollar tree, i had to unload a truck filled with 1700 boxes om them and arrange them by the use of the product, weather you put the honey buns in the food and snack section or you put the toilet brushes in the houshold cleaning items. "
bad,Don't go in with a positive can do attitude or show that you are an exceptional worker. You will be a target for people to purposely try and sabotage your production. The rules only apply to whom ever they choose so dont depend on management to help cause they are no help. Knowing someone especially management has its perks because you will get a head faster than those who were there first. Most importantly do not trust people who work here they worry more about people's business than actually doing work figures why they always have trouble making the tote times.
bad,They just burn and turn employee's.  For what you get paid and what they expect are not realistic.  I would not recommend working for them.  There are better part time jobs out there.
bad,"A 4 hour shift at Dollar Tree, There is no hard part of my job as i am Recovery, So there for i do all different jobs,I put away the go backs after i separate them into departments, than fell up a shopping cart and sweep,go get shopping carts and collect all hand baskets from registers and haul all the card board /collect off the floor and take it to the back and put in the bailer, than in between doing all tha i also am the one who fells the helium balloons, when i finish the go backs i than go down the isles and recvery all the misc things and bring them to the front and separate them and than start over, i than stop and clean the restrooms there is one for employees and one for customers. than go to straighten up my isles which are 2 isles of toys and 2 isles for party i usually make those my main isles, except do to the holidays every thing is very messed up and there has been alot of changes with management, the managers have no momentum, and they do not put there heart in there work. Nobody wants to work.  There is good days there as well as some not so great days, the best part is the bold you get with customers, You really enjoying seeing your regular customers and that gives me something to look forward to it makes them happy which makes me feel happy and that keeps them coming back and looking me up by name for help."
bad,"Headache of a position. Be prepared to work with lazy and slow stockers or slow cashiers. As a merchandise/store manager (might as well be a store manager if your position is stock/freight/merchandise manager you're just getting paid less and a little less responsibility) you'll be expected to do five different things at once and be two or more places at once. And truck drivers and companies who don't care about regulation. Then when you can't be a do it all manager they'll wonder why and threaten to fire you but won't because they can't find another sucker to take your place. You can be the best or even just acceptable and you'd still be looked at as a nothing to corpprate management. Dollar Tree Corporate only thinks of money and not what it takes for individual store success. If this store doesn't have it the other one will. Dollar Tree corporate doesn't care or concern themselves with associates or customer safety."
bad,"Dollar Tree is a very unorganized company, they expect you to work like a dog and they do not pay you for it. The higher ups do not care about you not having enough coverage as long as you get the job done."
bad,Not enough pay or hours. Do more then one job. Never enough time to finish. But the pay and hours are what bother me the most I have a family to support. Breaks are 10 mins lunches are 30
bad,"I loved my customers but it's bull when you walk in and are not directed what to do or told what your till number will be for the day or anything. When I'd call for a manager for help, they huffed and puffed. Also, pretty sure when you work a 5+ hr work day, you get a 15 min break but we got 10 mins. I was a no call, no show one day. Got a new job in 2 days. If you have any sort of intelligence, this job is not for you."
bad,"If the management their is good then you will love the job, however if there is poor management you will hate your job. If you are a student they do work well with your schedule."
bad,"I was a high school student when I got this job. "
bad,"This Job is great for a kid looking for a summer job or something to make money on the side. It is not a very good career choice. The shifts were short but sweet and there is tons of things to do while not ""chained"" down to the register. Depending what hours you worked, things would get very stressful and fast paced. I enjoyed working here just because it was so laid back, but I would not come back unless pay and hours has gone up."
bad,"It's a job and it pays the bills.  The company is not bad, they hire very unprofessional people as manager.  The manager  needs  more customer training ."
bad,To small team member and to much work for only 2 or 3 people in the place especially when is a busy store. Security was a lack problem to much people shoplifting and but the time a police come they are gone.
bad,working for Dollar Tre was stressful and was always overworked normally only 1 to 2 people on the register by the afternoon only 1 person available. had to deal with a lot of rude and hands on customers. Along with managers who didn't appreciate or cared for to accommodate to their employees.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is you are always on call, I get no days off, I am always getting calls from the store.  Working with a limited hourly payroll, the expectations are unrealistic, I hit the door running in the morning and don't stop.  I like the fast pace working environment.  Staffing and training are also 2 of the hardest parts of the job, since you are given no hours for training, and you are always hiring new staff members."
bad,Dollar Tree would be a good job for retirees..Its not a stressfull or complicated work environment.   It gives you the oppertunity to meet new and interesting people.
bad,Will not recommend job to anyone and when I leave I will never go back I'm not a negative person normally but they have done wrong by me and other employees
bad,"Drama with associates.  Low pay rate.  Inconsustant hours schefuled. Enjoyed the position and the work, just was not comfortable with the environment done of the time.  The location I managed had a long time associate in management that was horrible to customers and employees.."
bad,It’s a laid back environment but the management is not that great. The hours aren’t to great and neither is the pay. Nice people to work with and everything is a dollar.
bad,"You can't make a living working there, they won't give hours or give you more than minimum wage. The people the manager hires, are not working material. They are rude, and not friendly"
bad,Very unorganized. Inconsistent no hours and very underpaid. Never enough cashier's or employees on per shift. You also never get a raise or recognized for your hard work
bad,Dollar Tree is definitely geared to be when you are in high school and trying to work a part time job. shifts consisted of 4 hours long and pay was minimum wage. advancement included getting another 4 hour shift.
bad,The main problem with the dollar tree I worked at was the management. The store manager had severe anger issues over tiny details. One of the assistant mangers invaded personal space all the time.
bad,As a whole i love to shop at dollar tree but as a worker at that location i had bad experiance...  i was a stocker trailer unloader and cashier..  There was never and organization no hours to do the work needed
bad,"Typical day consisted of:"
bad,A typical day is slow but around the evening time it gets slightly hectic. usually between the rush of customers id have to straighten up my aisle and put loose items in their designated baskets and then id take the baskets to their aisles and neatly put them away. the management is okay when i need assistance they quickly help. i would have cordial conversation with my coworkers and everyone is respectful. the hardest part is dealing with the rushes of customers  because theres usually two cashiers. the easiest part is counting my till at the end of my shift.
bad,"Although its hard work, it keeps you fit. If you have a lot of energy, its a good work place. I had fun there, I had the opportunity to move up, but with the management we had, I didn't enjoy the responsibility of doing my job, along with the store managers."
bad,"This place will hire just about anyone to run a store even if it's someone who has no idea what they're doing. They play favorites and almost everyone is replaceable. The higher ups are even worse. They expect the store to get a certain amount of things done everyday, they're unrealistic it never gets done. My DM had the audacity to ask me why I don't wear make up to work when we live in Texas and there was no A/C in the middle of the summer. The 'one cashier' rule makes everyone, especially the customers, angry. It is not applicable to a bigger store that is constantly busy. Also, their rule is part time is maximum 15 scheduled hours a week."
bad,"I loved what I did but they pay is horrible, and some managers used to be Walmart managers and didn't know how to treat good employees. Would I go back yes, if I were given full time pay for the full time work I was doing as a part time employee."
bad,"They do not pay enough for a living wage unless your management. "
bad,"hated working here, it was awful, poor management, low pay, short staffed, lazy co workers, messy store, co workers not on time, always making you stay later than your shift,"
bad,I only spent a couple months at the Dollar Tree and 4 the best part of it it was pretty okay... Like all jobs-- some days were good and some were bad... But what got to me was the very rude and disrespectful customers we would get from time to time mainly the elderly it's almost like they would treat us workers as if we were beneath them because we worked at a dollar store and they were buying from us; not realizing that if they were any better than us then they wouldn't have been shopping at a dollar store. *NO OFFENSE*... I really like to work around people though I enjoy being around positive vibes and great energy it gives you a good spirit and makes you want to do a good job at your workplace.
bad,"After working there for about 7 months, they do NOT have NO raises, they do NOT tell you that you are doing a good job, they pile all kinds of work on you and then....they say, if you do NOT do all your work, they write you up ( which is their FAVORITE word !) You only get 10 minute break, you are on your feet, glued to the register. They play ""Favorites"" , NO FAIR !"
bad,The leadership was all over the place no one took ownership. the pay was low for the work that was needed. stocking shelves being a cashier and cleaning the store.
bad,Dollar tree is a company that says 1 thing and does another. They are not willing to work with people and only give minimal hours and minimum wage. Does not believe in OSHA guidelines.
bad,Not a great place to work. Stores are not given enough hours to get the job done. Zero work/life balance.Good people are difficult to retain due to limited reward. Advancement is very possible due to high attrition rate.
bad,It was terribly cluttered and the bathrooms was a complete mess and worst than I've seen at a portable bathroom. I was working part time there and short staff even though there was 3 or 4 cashiers the lines would be running long and the customers would complain about only one line and the managers had to be the cashiers half the time and help stock as well. Just an all time terrible time there and the co-workers made the manager that I first interviewed when I worked there quit. Also I'm not sure but me and my brother was working there my brother was fired because he kept being wrongly accused of stealing money out of the cash registers but it had been happening before we started working at that store.
bad,The environment here is insane. The hours go up and down constantly one week you'll have 25 hours and the following week 8 hours. Theirs high expectations so be ready for anything your told to do whether its being helium takes to the front or mopping urine off the floors or cleaning a bathroom. Be prepared and willing to do just about anything even if it wasn't part of your job title. When you cannot make it to work staff is rude and hangs up on you.
bad,Good first job. Gives you some retail experience and how to deal with customers. Pay was only minimum wage and you got about 15 hours a week if you were lucky.
bad,"Company changed managers too often who followed they're own guidelines not the companies, therefor it was very difficult to know what was expected of me when it changed according to personal wants and opinions."
bad,They can afford to sale things for a dollar for a reason .They pay less then all retail compeditors and hire felons because they are willing to take less.Enough said
bad,"Company  was fair but depend on your demographic you didnt get the best of opportunity, half of the manager were unfair to the employees and had no customer service experience at all."
bad,It’s an okay job. But if your looking for a job that pays good and has benefits. Dollar Tree is no the job for you. It’s fast job so you have to be fast with your hands.
bad,"I worked here for about 2 months as a seasonal job and to build a resumé. The store itself was clean and the co-workers were mostly pleasent, but the management made it one of the most hostile environments I've ever been in. With the exception of the store manager (she wasn't fairly laid-back, but she wasn't there when I was for the most part), but the two lead assistant managers were rude, bitter and just unpleasant people to be around. They would constantly make passive-aggressive remarks at employees for even minor mistakes and when they actually needed to talk to you, they would speak to you as if you were 5 years old. I cannot stress how awful they were to be around, they really were that bad. I wouldn't recommend this job on my worst enemy."
bad,"I didn't have a really good experience at Dollar tree. I wish it was more organized. The manager that scouted me, never got my days right, then quit the store I was hired and went to another store."
bad,"great first time retail experience, but very poor management and compensation for the amount of work that was required, being in retail no set schedule, people are rude"
bad,Relaxed but occasionally busy environment. Had opportunity to gain management skills while still serving/helping customers. Worked various hours from opening up store to closing down.
bad,Everyone has certain qualities or places they shine. And Dollar tree was not for me. it was very slow paced and the job only offered few hours per week.
bad,"Manager places you on the floor as a cashier or stock person and you cash the customers out. some are extremely rude and impatient management doesn't help when they see long lines of customers. the store is dirty and unorganized, people steal constantly threaten the lives of the staff. unsafe and unfriendly place to work"
bad,"Not a good place to work for adults with family and responsibilities I ts not a good place to work they cut hours, they short  checks lack of direction"
bad,not a good team staff. management was mean and tried to bully people. hours not that great. no benefits at all . just overall no room to grow as worker.
bad,"One thing that is not enjoyable is carrying all the heavy stuff when you need to unload the truck.Since it was my first job, I learned how to interact with costumers and I feel like this job would give people a lot of experience in costumer service."
bad,"It's a really fast paced job, where at entry level you're expected to not only cashier but stock too. The hours can be inconsistent due to holidays, but they'll often call to see if you want to work."
bad,It was a great learning experience. it was really fast paced so i had to learn quickly. I had to ask for help a lot but that benefited me in the future
bad,"Overworked managers, underpaid staff. no respect, no development. Low Moral. 400 cases an hour. picture a day of cases of bleach, soda, cat food, water..."
bad,"Associates get about 8-12 hours a week. Management is compensated poorly. On a positive note, I did receive more training at Dollar Tree than at Walmart. However, employees still left on a regular basis. Poor employee retention problem."
bad,Manager was unprofessional. Manager would constantly cut me down telling me that I will be nothing in life.  Manager would tell me that I need to go back to school.
bad,"In my opinion the at the Dollar Tree my manager did not train me properly, and just let me wing it. I stuck it out as long as I possibly could however the raises were not big enough to keep me there. I started as a cashier, and worked my way up to assistant manager. I still did not receive full-time which I really wanted. So, I chose to seek  a higher paying full-time job."
bad,It was always busy. A lot of things to do. Customers always came first and service them. Cashier most of the time. Stocking shelves and keeping the store clean.
bad,"Work hours depend on store sales so they often vary. Most employees dont even last a week. Policies keep changing concerning responsibilities, or so Im being told."
bad,"es un trabajo facil,pero duro a la vez,y muy mal pagado."
bad,Horrible place to work. Great people all just trying to make it to the next day. The pay is horrible and they literally will use you up as a person. The expectations are no where near what the pay should be. Pay is 7.35 starting in this area and expectation is you do 3 people jobs. Just horrible. If you ever want to see your family again do not go into management with dollar tree.
bad,"This company hires a lot of people for ""coverage,"" but doesn't have enough hours for everyone. At some times of the year you can expect to get 10 hours a week, possibly less. There is no chance for a substantial raise. I got a yearly raise of 15 cents per hour. Upper management has unrealistic expectations. Assistant Managers are given so much work that they have to work through their breaks to get anything done. Store is falling apart, carts going missing, but upper management will not do anything about it. The company has policies that are very anti-customer, such as not giving refunds or store credit, charging for cash back, and I was often told to lie about whether we had something in the back room or not. Even as the most senior cashier with the most experience, I still get treated as if I'd been there a month."
bad,"As a manager, you're responsible for everything from running a cash register, to unloading weekly trucks, throwing freight, and checking in your vendors every day. Not to mention office tasks, and daily operations. The company doesn't care about its people and the environment is very hectic."
bad,"scheduling maxes out at 4 hours per day and 4 days a week that is if you're lucky. the price of the merchandise attracts a bad crowd, and not to mention there is absolutely 0, zilch, no security to protect you. good luck ."
bad,"A lot of turnover at this job. Managers are even in and out every other week. I was there for over a year, and I watched 4 new managers start at our store and then either get fired or quit. I kept getting my hours cut even though it was already a part time job. They knew I had 3 kids I have to take care of, but because of all the new hires who would not show up for their first day, I'd get called in on days I specifically asked off."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone I know directly. Managment is full of incompetent people as well as individuals who should not be managers. Company expects alot from their staff but will not provide hours or a decent pay rate for their staff so team memeber quit very often.
bad,Dollar tree isn't somewhere i would suggest to work at. There's only 2 employees that work all day.. it gets very busy. There is no security. So that means alot of people steal easy... I wouldn't consider.
bad,Management is lazy and disrespectful. Customer's are not allowed to use public restrooms. Food is not rotated. Called Regional manager. No response. Do not recommend employment at this location.
bad,Dollar Tree is one of the worst companies to work for. They punish people who ask for time off. They don't allow for item mistakes made by the customers when it comes to checking out. They refuse refunds. They also don't even pay the employs a wage to afford health care or any thing else for that matter. Most workers had to take 2nd and 3rd jobs. To top that the management at the store i was at was sexist and refused to have male management or most workers.
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. The pay is way to low for the amount of work you do. There is no support from any managements or corporate office.
bad,"The management was very unprofessional, rude, and their communication skills lacked severely."
bad,i clock in and i am assigned to recover the floor while the other employees are the cashiers . i do the floor amongst a few other people and the ther along with myself are tired of us just dong the floor it should be far for ALL of us to do the floor rather then just only the few people and by few i mean like 3
bad,The job was just a job after I Had my child but the pay wasn't enough. Sometimes i would only get 10 hrs for a work week and i had 2 kids and that wasn't enough to pay bills and take care of my kids. The pay was 7.25 and they expected a lot from a worker but the pay didn't match.
bad,"Management  was unfit for position, People always quitting, store was always a disaster. Nothing was ever done on time.  Hostility  in everyone there."
bad,"I only worked there for about a year and a half but it was not a great place to work. If you were on the boss' bad side, she treated you like dirt and it was very hard to get off that bad side."
bad,"My experience was seasonal so I had to learn fast, which wasn't a problem. The opportunity was good how ever the management was not. My over all experience with dollar tree seasonal stocking position is a 3/10."
bad,"Dollar tree is a good place for a first time worker, however it is not a place to make a career. Dollar tree gives very little hours to work and too much work for the allotted 4 hours a day. Its a place were you have to learn as you go at a quick pace. Store does not provide enough hours to make the store presentable for customers. Too many restrictions to regulate associates."
bad,"You are given tasks you almost cannot complete with any given time span, management is a joker using favoritism instead of who works the hardest for advancement, the pay is the least minimum wage available."
bad,This is a place that usually has a help wanted sign out. People don't normally stay with the company for long. It's dull work but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
bad,I didn't like working at Dollar Tree the pay wasn't good and hours suck. The people was nice and the work was easy. I unloaded the truck and restocked merchandise.
bad,"You didn't get many hours, about 5 a week and at very little pay. The management wasn't all bad, but the person running the store at the time ran the place into the ground. It's not a bad job to get yourself started with, but doesn't offer many options for growth, and the pay isn't worth it. The co-workers weren't all that bad."
bad,"Working for Dollar Tree was okay as a first job. It paid minimum wage, it taught me the basics of customer service, and it gave me a way to earn a little money as I discovered life in my early twenties. The management wasn't that great at times, but I suppose that's how it is with a small company. Everyone knew everyone's business and have problems keeping that information to themselves. Would I recommend Dollar Tree as a job to someone else? Sure. Not all places are the same. Not all people act the same. Dollar Tree can be a really great job for someone who is in desperate need of a little money. It is also a great job to teach someone the basic knowledge of customer service when they have yet to learn any skills from that environment."
bad,Don't waste your time.District Managementr has a lot to be desired constantly riding your back. with no compensation in sight.
bad,"my typical day at work at the dollartree can sometimes be very trying at times, sometimes they can be fun and sometimes they can be where you want to walk out and quit due to the management letting the customers and their kids come in and do what they want to do to the store and the restrooms. What I have learned is how to count down all the registers and  do the counts for the balloons when they come in on the truck. Some of my co-workers are fun and then you have some that don't want to work but collect a check. The hardest part of the job is not being able to defend yourself when customers are irate with you ands calling you names. Now the most enjoyable part of the job is when some customers praise you for the good job that you are doing and they keep coming into the store to see you so they can smile if they are having a bad day and they bring you gifts just because they love you."
bad,low wages no real benefits. so don't expect much. but if you are just starting out. good experience and easy to learn. if you stay with the company long enough you may actually go up in the ranks but not to far without college level
bad,Through many years working at Dollar and with the help of fellow managers learned a lot about computers and how to deal with people. The hardest part of jobs is getting past the politics. The most enjoyable part is training new associates and management.
bad,"Over worked and Under Pay; Management is Horrible, Not organized, have no concerns about what the customers need just all about money, Managers are not trained enough to work in a low poverty community, Managers don't have people skills training for the minority,"
bad,"Good with flexible schedule, good people to work with. Management could be better trained with interpersonal skills. great customer base."
bad,"manager are required to wear multiple hats at once. you will work long hours, DM does not support you, most of the time you know more then the DM. the DM will ask you for advise."
bad,They don't promote good people. They will look at outside managers to hire before promoting within. Not family orientated. You have to work with very few hours and people.
bad,"not enough hours, management not well at training and not good at being a customer friendly. Showed favortism to certain employees."
bad,Great job to have part time and get experience to advance. It is not a job you can expect to grow in the company. Meet great people from workers to customers.
bad,fun environment to work at but didn't get enough hours to make a living. they were giving 4 hours a week and i needed more hours
bad,Dollar tree would be a great place too work if everyone was on the same page. The benefits and pay was poor for the type of work everyone had to do.
bad,From the beginning management would basically yank the employees around. Every time I called in to get my schedule they would say they have forgot to put me on the schedule. They would also call an hour before time and call me in on my off days knowing realistically there was no way to get there in that amount of time.
bad,"Not much to say. No one works as a team, Upper management only cares about not getting in trouble, and the staff leave as fast as they came."
bad,"My experience at Dollar Tree wasn't as much fun as my experience every where else, Me and the manager did not agree with each other, at one point the Ast. Manager had to take up for me and my co-workers. love working with my Ast. Manager, he made working at Dollar Tree fun."
bad,I like that it keeps me busy. I have learned structure and have gotten experience being an assistant manager there. I have done everything for this company and beyond.
bad,"nice place to work but terrible pay, not enough hours and too much of a labor job. Employees are friendly and even the work environment, but when it comes down to benefits part time employees are not qualified which is very dumb."
bad,"A short shift, id start at 11am-3pm greeting customers and scanning products. when it wasnt as busy I would fill up ballooons and scan the store and putting products back in their proper places."
bad,This job was not my most flattering job. Even though I enjoyed working with the customers and doing what I did. I was very discouraged and dissatisfied with this company.
bad,"Honestly, Dollar Tree is NOT a very good job. The hours are inconsistent and I've worked less than 30 hours for them for the entirety of this year."
bad,Management was shoddy at best. Most of the time you'd rarely see them outside the office. Co-workers were Excellent. I learned how to be a stock crew member. The hardest part of this job was dealing with management.
bad,"A typical day at work was getting screamed at by my store manager along with other daily duties. "
bad,"Place of employement needs new management due to tardiness of all employees and the miscommunication between employee and manager. Dollar Tree General Manager was unable to keep establishment in order due to not being assertive with employess obeying rules set forth. The crew members were respectable upon one another. The most difficult tasks while working for Dollar Tree would  have been the miscommunication and interact upon the work requirements and schedule. The most enjoyable moments while working for this employer would be the atompshere of the employees. Despite the work load, all employees came to work and performed as directed."
bad,"After working at Dollar Tree, I would not recommend it to anyone unless you are desperate for a job. "
bad,Count the money in the register.I learned how to deal with people and different attitude.The management is really good.the hardest part of this job the costumer.I enjoy meeting different people.
bad,I did not like working here at all. The mangers played favorites. I got written up multiple times for doing things others did(I didn't know was against the rules) and they didn't receive any sort of warning even. I would NEVER work here again.
bad,"Have to dedicated entire time to company. No sales no hours for employees, if there are no hours the salary manager must cover.  There are no exceptions you must make payroll."
bad,"Typical night was just listening t music and stocking the store."
bad,"Although the management was good there was no compensation for the work done, nor did they offer any hours."
bad,"The mangement is great and my co-workers great only problem with Dollar tree that only have part time unless you are a store manager,There part time is maybe 20 hours week."
bad,Worked long hours with not enough break time. Great co-workers but management was unfair. Management would steal money and purposely target someone to sabotage to fire so they can hire family.
bad,"Learned to keep inventory, count cashiers, and safe money. Improved my customer service, and math skills. Not a secure job and minimum hours that were uncertain."
bad,It was a part time job that I worked in school. I didn't get much hours but the few hours that I worked I used as a learning experience. The culture was about the same all around not much diversity was here but that was no problem. Great experience just wished the pay was better.
bad,"My typical day at Dollar Tree was stocking shelves, cashier, and cleaning. Didn't learn much there. I liked some of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was doing store resets every month. I didn't enjoy doing anything at this job."
bad,"Way to much expected for 8 dollars an hour."
bad,"I was in college when I worked with this company, so I needed a part time job to provide for my self being a full time student. Typically I would come in, punch in, and cleaned my set aisles while also assisting customers or stocking product. I was one of the youngest workers there, so I was made to do a lot of heavy lifting and cleaning. I mainly did the night shift, and had to sweep & mop after putting go backs on shelfs. I eventually got moved around to mornings, and to the truck. I dreaded truck days, I was relieved when I would be scheduled for nights. I liked working with my co workers, it was management issues at my location; also rodent problems. Those long lasting issues prompted me to move on as I felt stuck there and no progression."
bad,"management never had the employees back. too busy doing personal things other than work. management delegated procedures but refused to follow themselves, but enforced them onto everyone else."
bad,this job was ok for the time being but not a life time kinda job
bad,"they said to come in at a certain hour got there and no one was around. i was told i was not coming in on my shift hours, I was. I found out recently the manager does this to alot of people. schedule changed daily so you never new when to work. you call in they tell you they dont know because the schedule isnt there."
bad,"I was a cashier and was mis treated in numerous ways, I wasn't properly trained, management was awful. very unpleasant. My fellow co-workers hated what they did and the customers could tell. Was just a temp job."
bad,"Fun work place."
bad,I enjoyed the employees that worked there but management has very little sense of balance between work and family.
bad,come in count till stock when no customer are present do go backs cashout customers
bad,Company is very cheap and do not give back to the empoyee's. There is no field support for DM's. The DM is P and HR as well.
bad,"Dollar Tree is a good stepping stone for anyone that is 18-24 anyone over that age is gonna age quickly.  I started working there part-time as a Cashier/Recovery at 26 and I will be 28 on December 5th, I feel like I'm 58.  Dollar Tree will work you like a dog and you will not have the compensation to show for it or the benefits which is nothing.  You don't get any real healthcare benefits if you are part-time which is everyone except the managers.  You start off at minimum wage which in Missouri is $7.35 I am now just getting $7.50.  You are not appreciated by the work you do for this company or even the SOME of the customers.  Other customers who are regulars are pretty friendly and appreciate you when you go an extra step for them which I always do even for the nastiest of customers. There is no security for this store people steal everyday.  We lose $118 a day because of theft.  The security cameras are only facing the registers and the entrance to the store that's it.  We call the police and for theft and even though we can see them on the plaza parking lot and all up and down the main street it takes them forever to show up. There is usually only one cashier by themselves at night while the other backup cashier is cleaning the store doing recovery, nobody is watching out for you which is extremely scary at night because we close at 10:00pm and when the store was doing bad our punishment was to stay to 11:00pm if you don't have a car or you take the bus it's dangerous at night especially in a rough neighborhood that is how much they care about their employees. When we have"
bad,".typical day helping customers"
bad,"Ring up customers, stock shelves, put merchandise back to its home location."
bad,"My time at the store was very hectic, a lot of transitioning was going on and nobody really knew how to handle it. I was a first time assistant manager working with 2 very experienced people over me, no training except basic knowledge and passwords were provided. It was very hard at giving my cashiers instruction when I really had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. I loved the work and job, I feel it might have been a better experience if I had more training and guidance as to what the overall goal was."
bad,starts off a great place to work then they change things up on you
bad,"Daily loading/unloading of Semi's "
bad,I was usually on the register for hours checking customers out and also was expected to unload freight off the uboats in a timely manner. It is almost impossible to be helpful to the customers with long lines going all the way to the ailes while putting freight on the shelves. I would get written up for not completing all the freight off uboats. The managers usually were in the office on the phone gossiping about other coworkers. The raises were pitiful. You work so hard and they offer you the MINIMUM amount of money. The district would always go over in hours and have the other stores cut back hours to prevent going over the budget which would leave the store short of employees...soooooo what does that mean???? MORE work was put on me that the others were suppose to do. It was crazy. I would not recommend anyone to work at Dollar Tree.
bad,I enjoy coming in and working with others as a team player and I put out more and beyond on what is asked. I enjoy being busy and making customer service enjoyable. I would love to have more hours than what I have now and would love to grow with a company.
bad,"I like the work and the people I meet and greet. Some of the elderly are comfortable that I don't rush them to count out their change. I know that it takes up time in the line , but I'm glad they are happy."
bad,"I was a manager at Dollar Tree. An average day would consist of processing damages, working out merchandise, organizing the store, counting money, and managing employees. All my employees were great people, but I didn't see eye to eye with some of me fellow managers. I feel that managers at Dollar Tree lack the necessary training to be effective leaders. Much of this was due to their tendency to promote from within rather than hire experienced employees. The job was not hard, but it could get very frustrating at times."
bad,"Possibly one of the worst experiences of my life. Mainly cause of district manager over the area at the time. Expect no support from that District manager in the Tallahassee area. You are on your own with unrealistic expectations. May be a better experience for someone in a different area. This one boiled down to this particular District manager, who seems to be in the middle of a lawsuit at the moment. If his supervisor would really watch what he does, he wouldn't have made it as long as he has. Seems like his supervisor is out of touch with the lower subordinates or just doesn't want to hear what they have to say. Was working 80 to 100 hours a week for the last three months I was there, until it broke me. 7days a week open to close and don't even mention about wanting a day off or will be labeled a whiner. Got paid well but after you count the hours a put in, was probably more like minimum wage."
bad,overall the company need to check their ops managers. They don't know how to run a company. i was employed there for 11 years and was discharge without any write-ups or warnings.
bad,"I run a cash register, help customers find what they need, and stock shelves while the store is closed. I found that my co-workers and those in management were difficult to get along with. I worked here temporarily during the Christmas season. The most difficult part of the job was having no emotional support during times of stress. Also, I was paid minimum wage and hardly got any breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people that I know come in the store and visit me."
bad,"As a cashier or stocker I greeted every customer that was the highlight of my day. I love to talk with different people and get different feed back on products and items to better your company and customers love there input. I learned in customer service the friendly you are with the customer the more they will return to your place of business, because everyone love a cashier that welcome they with a smiling face as they give up there money. I unstand how hard a managers job can be, but so manager need to remember the customer's or the biggest part of keep your customer's happy, because the more customer's you have the busier the store becomes and the more money that store make. Because the world of mouth can work for the good or bad of the business. The hardest think about Dollar Tree was to keep the store clean at all times. The most enjoyable time was working with my co-worker's and customer's everyday was different from the day before. For me I just love people and if they give me that chance I'm share they would love me to.."
bad,"Dollar Tree seemed like a great company to work for. However, I was extremely wrong in the time that I worked there they went through 3 Store managers and several assistants and fired almost every other employee in a matter of a month or two and replacing them with new ones that did no better. They took no time in the consideration in hiring the right people. Things are not organized and the district manager is a complete incompetent. I do not recommend this company if you want a great job with benefits and an understand management, because this is not it."
bad,basic store operations
bad,Well A typical day at work would be about five hours or less. We could not go over six hours to not risk being able to take a lunch. Since it was my first job it helped me learn to be a better work and expand my people skills. This is the kind of job if you are going to begin the work force it helps to train and disciplined you. I learned how to use the cash register quick. My coworkers were very nice and friendly till I got pregnant and sick. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up.
bad,most of my time spent here was made up of half stepped planning and poor management skills people always got fired or sent home if they weren't moving fast enough. but it gave me experience with a pallet jack and handy man tools
bad,I think the manage was a sexist against old women and he would hit on the young women. He would said inappropriate things to the younger women. He told me after my surgery I could come back. Then when doctor release me. He would let me come back.
bad,"Did not like working there so unorganized, management was unprofessional and seemed to hardly know anything...would not recommend i did not like working at dollar tree and i worked at more than 1...not a great experience for me"
bad,The people who work there are sometimes organized but they do know how to get everything back on track very fast they’re all very nice place. They all have great attitudes towards work.
bad,Dont do it..Unless it's a stepping stone..Or..You have another job or attending school...They dont care about their employees..People on the cooperate level look at their entry level employees as expendables...
bad,Dollar Tree is an okay place to work wages are not the best at 7:25 an hour a lot of turnover because wages are poor manager is not always helpful customer service is not the best that I would like to see
bad,"The overall experience wasn't bad but the distribution of hours is very unfair and those who kiss up to the managers get better hours than those who don't, even if they work harder."
bad,Management has no control. There's 5 managers. Some of the rudest employee's I've ever meet. No respect and alot of favoritism. Dysfunctional. Not in a group consider yourself singled out. I love the dollar tree but the employees here are terrible and run over management.  Management would rather have employees picked on then solve the problem. No control over store or staff.
bad,"If you’re looking to start a career with Dollar Tree, don’t! It’s not worth it. Low pay ($7.25 per hour) , no real hours through the week and no ladders to climb."
bad,"This is an unsafe work place if you are not thick skinned you won't make it you need to be a fast mover, be able to handle long line ups and theft on a daily basis. You will need to endure staff that if your not friends or drive the boss the your more then likely to get the sort end of the stick."
bad,"A typical day at work is: EXTREMELY busy, as it should be. You just go with it & do what you can! I've learned that this company yearly sales is 1 billion dollars, but yet you're paid $7.45 & biweekly???  What type of sense does that make? Management doesn't deserve to hold this title. 2 of the women are VERY unprofessional & it's a lack of communication. Favoritism is REALLY big in this store as well. Not cool at all! The one thing I will not continue to deal with is being surrounded by gossip. Grow up! Be an example of what this company is suppose to portray. The customers are the most enjoyable & making sure they're satisfied."
bad,"Alot of favoritism, easy to move up but not enough pay. Little to no hours. As a student it's okay but there aren't many hours to take. You get paid biweekly but it's usually 200-230"
bad,"I don't really have too much to say about work at Dollar Tree. Its a dollar store, I honestly did not expect much to come from working there. Especially since it was only temporary."
bad,Not at this time not a job for me 4 to 5 on your shift and that’s not every day just on schedule work days if you luck you might get 17 hours a week. That doesn’t pay my bills
bad,"a typical day at dollar tree is not the best. the job itself is dangerous, there's no security and management really was just there to get a paycheck. the store manager at my store would curse in front of people, talk bad to employees and she would rush us so much if we didn't get it right shed write us up."
bad,"Ive been at Dollar Tree a year and aa half at first I loved it and I loved the customers but they started cutting hours and hiring more people  but we wasn’t getting no hours, They don’t wont you to work over time. And Corporate just keep sending shipment and we don’t have nowhere or hours to put it out and we have to hear the complaints from the customer.."
bad,"All of the stores in general are the same..some of the managers are great to work for some are to lazy to do their jobs and some just micromanage..When I worked there, the manager did great however the corporate management would come in and rip on our manager and in rerurn she would work us harder."
bad,I left dollar tree because I wasn’t able to get more than 25 hours a week and my pay was bad. team was awesome we work well but no growth there for me
bad,The interview process was okay a bit or a long wait. The experience while working there was a little stressful due to the location. The over all job requirements weren’t hard. I just didn’t really like that  the store manager And I would have minor conflicts
bad,Dollar tree isn’t bad but it isn’t good the company dosent care about your where beings and they don’t care about you at all don’t treat you like family
bad,"After working here I learned pretty quickly that it's a joke never any stable work schedule hours vary, no kind of training or benefits and managers have horrible leadership I won't be surprised if the store went out of business."
bad,I love working there it's just a lot to deal with when it comes to the customers. The pay is just not enough for the stuff we deal with on a daily basis
bad,"No benefits,  no OT, no certain hours no reliable crew members,  breaks are few if any, very fast paced with little help at times, stressful times.  But management was very understanding at times."
bad,It started out being one of the best jobs i had also considering the fact that two of my friends were working with me but after a couple weeks they started to switch the schedule for all employees even if they arent available due to the fact of low hire
bad,The dollar tree was a great job to work I was just pregnant at the time and really limited to what I could do while working there I enjoyed working with the ppl just didn’t like closing when the store had to be cleaned due to it being so much
bad,"I really enjoyed working with the public. Interaction with the people that live in and around the community. I had no problem going out of my way to fulfill a customer's request. I took pride in my job at Dollar Tree. Unfortunately,the management had their own agenda on who they wanted to have working their. My hours and days got cut ridiculously without any explanation,only senseless unprofessional excuses."
bad,This is an easy job it’s retail at its simplest yet management lacks motivation and care for their store. I left dollar tree because I was supposed to be starting to lead the freight team and I asked the manager to come look at the stationary with me because I needed to show him why I needed to work with the freight team closely. I showed him how the same paper clips were on 3 different pegs in 3 totally different spots in the stationary “planographic” I told him me as a merchandiser would have to fix this to fit in something else and that they needed to be told that they can’t just stick things anywhere to fit it out. Well he got defensive towards me and said that he thought it looked okay. Well there’s the problem right there. He did not care about the planographic or appearance of the store .
bad,"Not all locations are the same, but the location I worked at, the manager is lazy and hides in the office all day. The store was never organized. And the pay was way below the job expectations."
bad,"Ability for advancement is possible but management isn't very understanding of store needs."
bad,Very slow paced. Management favors certain employees. Does not give enough hours to make it worth working for the company. Benefits and pay are very poor.
bad,can get stressful but for the most part I enjoy my job.i just wished I got more hours and better pay.i like my co-workers and I really like the store manager we all work together well but I have to find some else
bad,"The company was terrible in terms of Low earnings, barely any hours were given, management was all over the place, store closed at 9:00PM and some nights we had to say until 11:00PM with only a half hour pay extra"
bad,You have very few that want to work while others hang out in the office. This causing those willing to work to be over worked and only at minimum wage. Lots of drama involved.
bad,"Break time and the other workers is probably the only good thing. The store manager or my boss has not given me the proper training and I almost went in blind on the first week. For me, my store manager is hardly there and doesn’t seem to take the job seriously. So far, all I have seen is a poor work ethic and it needs to be improved greatly."
bad,Until they raise pay I wouldn't recommend working here . You will over work and run around . So if your expecting 9 or up I wouldn't say dollar tree is the BEST job .
bad,Hands down worst place I've ever worked poor management poor everything go somewhere else. We've been through four managers in the year I was there. Just don't.
bad,When I first started working the I was happy but dollar tree can't keep no one because they don't pay right.they want to you to break your back for them but you can't get in touch with anyone.I also found out they cheat you out of your PTO even after you have earned it.I will never recommend any one to work for this place.And that's why I left it
bad,Dollar tree was a horrible pay and they used me to help put the store together then dropped my hours completely in half and I was left with barley any hours .
bad,"I have 3 kids and minimum wage with splitting hours between several other's, everyone was getting minimum hours as well so everyone had hours. Having 3 kids living off of minimum wage and owning a car that was needing repairs, I was not benefiting from it. The money I was making was just enough for the gas to the person who let me barrow their car to get back and forth to the job and pay my car insurance on the vehicle."
bad,The job was kind of boring there would be times with nothing to do and you were suppose find something.  Hours and pay were very poor. Management did not what was going on
bad,"The manager is constantly complaining and gossiping about employees and never takes a second to evaluate themselves. I don’t like working in an environment knowing that if I get sick and have to call out, that the manager is going to complain and then gossip about it."
bad,Not a good place to work unless you're a manager. Associates are part time only and the schedule constantly changes. They expect you you to wait on the site at times without being on the clock and the pay rate isn't good. I was expected to work off the clock all the time and even though I wasn't obligated to do it I would have been treated differently if I hadn't.
bad,The only value that I felt was working directly with my team throughout any shift. Management was very difficult and manipulative to deal with. Lack of leadership by management (district and regional).
bad,"Nothing is good bout Dollar Tree as employee, pay is low, hours are awful, no flexibly , no room for growth,  no overtime, management need improvement"
bad,Not a good company to work for because they expect each member of management to do the work of multiple managers however they are now willing to pay you a livable wage. Getting promoted is more politically based instead of work ethic and knowledge.
bad,Manager was friendly at first but then cut everyone's schedule except the people from her town other than that I really enjoyed working there very friendly
bad,"Very boring job, management usually sucks and the store is ridiculously unorganized. Not to mention ridiculous work hours. If you absolutely NEED the money go for it, if you’re looking for a fun job that you’ll actually wouldn’t mind working this isn’t for you."
bad,"worked as a part time assistant manager, worst job in my 27 years of retail, 4 managers in 1 year and 3 district managers in the same year, not enough hours to keep the store stocked"
bad,not very many nice managers that work there and expect too much to do for little pay..I want out of there as fast as i can. I can't live on this kind of pay. I have alot of medical bills to pay and other bills to pay but can't afford to work for them that much longer.
bad,They didnt pay me. I had to go through so much just too get my first check it was like i was working for free & I wasnt the only one alot of people left from the low pay and no pay .
bad,"The nature of the job could not be simpler. It's an easy model of businesses, driven by a $1 price point. There are some great values sold at a loss that bring in customers and impulse buys that drive overall sales figurss. Due to the low pay the workers tend tword unskilled or under educated, but the need to make numbers weeds out the lazy. There is a sky high turnover rate because of this. Store level management is stellar. They work far harder and longer than they are compensated properly for. Corporate level management is negligent at best. They ignore serious violations of safety and labor laws. They punish valid complaints and grievances harshly and will cite at will hire laws to handle legitimate concerns by firing anyone who complains, no matter how valid. There is a constant shortage of staff due to strict labor hour policies that actually hurt sales and logistics. Overall, I would say this is the retail equivalent to fast food. Low pay, high stress, little to no benefit past a meager paycheck."
bad,The manager here (chris) is slow minded at times and it really affects the store and half the time they told us to just find a spot and set the stuff your stocking down if it fits in the general vicinity of the items around it very disorganized
bad,"A very fast pace work environment, great customers and associates. Management can do a lot better at treating associates with more respect and kindness. Overall a huge learning expierence."
bad,typical day at work was very busy. I enjoyed the customers. I enjoyed a lot doing truck and stocking. Management was great there they understood you and if you didn't know something there to help you out
bad,It was a good starter job but was not somewhere you can be for the rest of your life for a career. This job was nice for a newly graduated student before getting a real job or family.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend the Dollar Tree in Kansas City, KS on 78th and State Ave. The Hiring Manager isn't barely there to answer questions that are fit for them."
bad,I really enjoyed the customers. The management the last years I worked there was not fair to all employees. Some had to abide by corporate rules others didn't. They could do what they wanted or not.
bad,Management not friendly at all. Coworkers very friendly. No one is allowed full time hours. The person who's job I took over came back so my hours were lowered from 20 a week to 4 a week. Job not difficult but constantly changing locations of inventory
bad,"It is a starter job, there are no real benefits or career opportunities working here. Your day is dictated from moment you get there. You will do whatever the manager needs done and at the same time you are expected to ring out customers and clean up as well. I did enjoy working with the people their, it was a rather relaxed job and easy environment."
bad,If your a teenager and this is your first job then dollar tree is right for you but I wouldn't suggest an adult that has to pay bills work here they only give about 10 hours a week and the pay sucks. they start you at 10.40 an hour. well that's here in Utica ny I don't know about other cities.
bad,"I got hired for seasonal work and I did enjoy it, however, I called weeks in a row to see my hours and was always told I was not on the timesheet. I never once was informed that I was no longer working there."
bad,Wasn't run very well the stock crew worked well together during shift and everyone respected each other just a bad experience I had with poor Management.
bad,"Stocking, cashiering, cleaning, and unloading the truck is a typical day at this particular Tree. It's always understaffed and the hardest part of the job is trying to keep the store clean and organized. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customers find what they need."
bad,"I was promised a permanent position when I applied, and the job was going fine for the most part (nothing overwhelming or unrealistic), but two months in, I was told I was being laid off next month because it was only a temporary position. I was lied to and was not happy about that. The pay and hours are poor, and there are no benefits included. Not recommended unless you're in school or have a side hustle."
bad,clock in go to my register assigned count until customer service clean around register 30 minute lunch break back on the register  and clock out.  sometimes cover for other employees for breaks.
bad,Poor pay management is not organized at all they don’t care about there employees don’t  get any hours a day or a week and they ask u to do to much for a little pay
bad,"Train or Retrain Employees and Managers Effectively for a positive workplace culture, management needs to coordinate with the whole team not with selective employees. ONCE SAID BY A GREAT PERSON TEAMWORK ALWAYS MAKES THE DREAM WORK!!"
bad,"It's very hard to move up in Dollar Tree must know someone or be a friend to someone in management to get a raise or any type benefits. Working for Dollar Tree is just a secondary job unless you already walked in, in management or if you know someone who will put in a good word for you. You can also work your way up if you work there for so many years and well liked by the managers. some of it is based on friendship and who you know. Dollar Tree is for people who choose retail as acareer it's a start to your career. It can also work for seniors who's looking for a second income to help ends meet."
bad,"Dollar Tree would be awesome company to work for if they cared more about management and staff a little more like benefits ,overtime and paid sick days and give employers more work hours so they wouldn’t have to work two or more jobs to be able to support their families .. thank you"
bad,Cahier for customers. Help customers find items that they need.offer assistance if they need. Offer promotional items. Stock shelves; recover miscellaneous items
bad,Good job in the beginning. Then alot of drama and shut talking happening. Told manager and DM nothing got done. Also if you plan to relocate or leave there are alot of threats made and lies are told. Would not recommend working here unless you like hard work and drama. Loved some of the people I worked with though. Some people there became family so happy to met them but I would rather not work there ever again. Unless they give you good pay.
bad,They could do better paying cashiers.We put in work work our behind off basically for pennies.Its not worth working for this company unless youre a teenager or elder who needs a few bucks
bad,"before new management came, i was able to live comfortably with my hours i got a week, was able to pay my bills. now i cannot even afford my rent, had to turn off my phone, stretch 20 dollars for 2 weeks to eat, almost over 3,000.00$ behind on my student loans. i went from 4-5 hour shifts at 3-4 shifts a week to 1 day a week and only working 3-4 hours that 1 day."
bad,Working for Dollar Tree was miserable. Everybody including management complained about how unhappy they were with their job. Limited amount of hrs given. Low pay rate.
bad,"overworked with poor pay, but fun in general. not enough breaks, poor communication, poor job training. fun talking to customers and the occasional coworker."
bad,they work you to death but don't want to pay hardly anything. hours are never the same. one week you could work 20 hours then the next week it could be 12.
bad,Manager(s) at Dollar tree are rude and treat they're cashiers with little no respect. Any problems that someone has is ignored or will be held against the employee(s) when they are having a hard time with another employee and put down to make them feel like they're in the wrong without having to say they're part of the problem or even have the chance to fix it.
bad,LOTS and LOTS of work has to be put into these stores in order to maintain them in decent order. Dollar tree piles freight on top of freight to the point that it is a danger to the associates and customers. A dollar tree store will get base hours no matter how much sales are up. Not only do they make us work like dogs but the most of the management is corrupt. As a person with supervisor responsibilities I am needed to be available at any given notice. DO NOT work for dollar tree.
bad,"At Dollar Tree I came with many years of experience. They allowed me to use my knowledge to train several managers making me a training manager. I was able to successfully lower shrink and therefore offer my knowledge and skills to benefit the company's profitability, I was able to complete full training in two stores to make them model stores. I feeI have exhausted my options to grow within the company and therefore I am looking for an opportunity in a company that allows growth potential."
bad,"Wasn’t a great place, poor head management, nobody was held responsible for the jobs they had to do. would hire terrible people who didn’t want to work, or just didn’t show"
bad,"What you see is what you get with this job, and whether or not you will enjoy it is mostly based on your management. If the store is run well then it's a relatively hassle free place to work, even if the pay leaves much to be desired."
bad,"I had some great and not so great people that I worked for and with. This is in no way a review on them personally just the company itself. Dollar tree gives very few hours and the minimum required pay, while expecting you to do way more than what is required for your position in the company. They do not hire full time positions except for managers. The largest amount of hours for a week you can expect is 20, but you'll probably average around 10 - 12. The only way to pick up more hours is to call other stores and ask if they need help. If it doesn't interfere with your current schedule and it doesn't take you over the allotted hours for part time then you are allowed to travel to a different store to pick up your 4 - 6 hour shift. You get short shifts, which means you work the same amount of days as a full time job. Having it set up that ways makes it difficult to find another job to work alongside especially with the ever changing schedule. I would not recommend Dollar Tree!"
bad,"Before taking the management position, I was promised by the district manager that I would be making 12.50 per hour. I was given 10.50 per hour and was told I was given that because I didn't have any experience and after 3 months I would get my 2 bucks. Well long story short, a year and a half went by and I didn't see any piece of that money. When I asked the DM about it, I was told that the only way to make more money was to advance with the company. Upper management always make promises of store manager training for advancement but it would be years before you get it. Managers make deals with District manager so they don't have to do all of the jobs that comes with being a manager and puts that work on the assistants. Managers don't care about how hard you work. It's not about how hard you work, it's about who you know to be considered for your own store. Yeah there is PTO and STO but it still has to be approved by management. To save hours, store managers will have you work off the clock and they will put in your sick time so that they can use the hours somewhere else. The best thing about being an assistant manager is getting a bonus at the end of the month and that's only if the store does well in sales."
bad,"Company has a super high turn over, lack of training process, SOP are not well explained to associates.  Production incentives were very bad to the point most people didn't want to achieve higher volume"
bad,Got the most hours working around seasonal and for the different stores helping them get ready for inventory. Other than that there were inconsistant hours.
bad,"When I worked at Dollar Tree, they had me perform duties that were supposed to be of an assistant manager. They had me handle the money, gave me the safe key, I stocked merchandise in the back of the store, etc. I was only supposed to cashier but they claim they were so understaffed that they had to overwork me. I was young and didn't realize I was being used until the higher ups got my managers in trouble for making me do a managers duties. My manager also got fired because she was stealing from the safe when there was ""extra money"". This won't apply to all dollar trees, but mine was terrible when I worked there. Hopefully management in other locations is a lot better."
bad,"Working at dollar tree taught me how to have a lot of patience, about half of the customers were very rude and inappropriate, the management was very strict and unorganized. Hours were constantly being cut and hours were cut from my paystub."
bad,"I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to land a job at dollar tree. First of all management is so uninvolved and unorganized. The atmosphere is chaotic and there were never enough workers in the store to help ring when lines became enormously long. people would call out or just never show up sometimes and management DID NOTHING to enforce or change that. sometimes I was forced to stay an extra 5 hours there bc someone did not show up for their shift. there was even times I was denied breaks and meals simply because ""there was no one else""."
bad,I think they should be better organized and have a well staff team and appreciate them management is good I really don't have too much going to say there is really nothing else to say about Dollar Tree the one I worked at could have been better ran
bad,"constantly busy,  a lot of people shoplifts.  management disrespectful, Filling in for employees the hardest part.  the employees was most enjoyable.."
bad,"While the job is routinary, I have learned to exercise respect and professionalism when it comes to customers since everyone is different. You cannot satisfy everyone despite giving all your best."
bad,"Dollar Tree is not a bad first job; however, it's not a long term job. Not to mention there are zero benefits/insurance. If you are in high school and looking for a job for after school or just the weekends it's perfect for you. Just in my case if you try to work more than one job, management doesn't always want to work with you. Also, unless you are a manager you will be part time and they don't like to give over 22 hours weekly, at minimum wage. The job isn't hard, but sometimes seems quite tedious."
bad,i learned a lot working at dollar tree mostly all the things you shouldn't do the only part of the job i enjoyed were the people i worked with. The hardest part of the job was trying not to walk out on my manager for the unfair treatment he showed me.
bad,I didn't enjoy my employment with the Dollar Tree. The hours were inconsistent and hard to schedule. I thought the manager did not create a great work space for us.
bad,"No positive comment to be honest, especially in the are I worked at. It was in bad condition, the new manager was unprofessional. These are just a few things that kept me from having a great experience from my first job."
bad,"don't work here if you are looking for more than minimum wage or more than maybe 10 hours a week. in management the expectations are unattainable, they expect a lot in a week while managing the store the employees and your daily duties."
bad,I need to be able to afford my new car and pay off college and I model so I usually need to buy assessories. I have a lot going for myself and I’d like to afford it all. Dollar tree not helping me.
bad,"Not the best place to work. Management is okay, the back room is was a mess when i worked there. The customers that came in weekly was the best part of the week."
bad,"since buying family dollar stores the company has tightened payroll to the point that it is fairly impossible to maintain quality standards."
bad,"They had nice employees, they have great items at a great price, it was a fast paced job.  They offered flexible hours.  It is a good job for moms or teens"
bad,"Scheduling payroll"
bad,I enjoyed working there but I wanted better I will always love dollar tree because they treated me like family and was so nice and understanding people
bad,"Some management seems to be lacking, But staff works hard and does the best they can. Store needs to be updated so that staff can work properly and in the right environment"
bad,"The job itself isn't tough. The working environment is toxic. From the inability of the corporate office to fix equipment like the air conditioning for over a year to store managers allowing the employees to skirt responsibility due to personal relationships, Dollar Tree has issues."
bad,"Considerate of family life, advancement opportunity, could pay more attention to management that cuts corners to pass inspections, but all in all a decent company to work for."
bad,I think working there was way to much for me cause of my blood sugar and it stressed me out. I was always scared to go to work there and know i should have not been.
bad,Very hectic and barely any time to rest. Can be tiring especially if you're in an area where there's lot of kids and people all the time. You're always cleaning if there's nothing to do and the managers sometimes are inconsiderate.
bad,"Horrendous turn-over rate"
bad,this job was very stressful never enough help and management and dms didnt care about their employess  and i closed and opened store alone and not good at nite had to close store and take large deposits to the bank alone not confortable with that at all
bad,"Day at work was punching in, maintaining my job and others responsibilities. Hardly have back up when trying to contain a long line. I had a manager that would punch in and leave for several hours at a time. My other co workers were friendly for the most part and tried there best with the management they had. The most enjoyable part was being able to build relationships with some of the customers who were friendly and would come in consistently."
bad,All dollar tree positions are part time about 15- 20 hours a week. truck comes once a week. stocking usually is in the early morning. hours vary but very unpredictable. been there 2 years never got raise or promotion dont pay nothing but min wage.
bad,"A typical day at work for me was stock. There was an overload of items in the back that i had to stock when i came in, The work place was stressful because we constantly got more items but people were not buying the items in the store so we were over stocking shelves"
bad,district and regional believe that salaried managers can work as much as they say...i worked 60 to 70 hours a week and got paid for 40 hours. i worked 6 days a week 12 to 16 hours a day
bad,"Due to lack of workable hours, lack of professionalism, and overall inadequate business oractices, i wiuld not recommend this emoloyer except for a teenager."
bad,"A typical day is about 8 hours as an Asst Manager, with side work for "
bad,I only worked at dollar tree because I needed a position immediately. Although I like my co workers hours are sporadic and inconsistent. I didnt feel completely safe as there were many assaultive instances while cashiering. I regularly felt frustrated and angry.
bad,a typical day at dollar tree depending on the store is pretty fast paced with minimal staff. The culture is nice and bright green but need to allow more hours in order to complete the task at hand aand competitive pay.
bad,This job was unprofessional. Hours were not as par and they cheated me out of my money. I didnt get paid as I should've. They also didn't make me feel as I was part of the team.
bad,"Come to work under hot & unsafe conditions. Always load a trailer from the bottom side to side level out heavy products on the bottom light products on the top. Poor management not enough leaders in the offices. Good Natured workplace culture & people. When a wave is 70,000 pieces of products & may be assigned two 2,500 piece trucks as a temp. Its never a enjoyable moment on the grounds of dollar tree dc."
bad,Manager don't want to work with ur schedule staff don't show up for work sometime on you one person come in to work becz the only 5 hrs the schedule to work a day but for manager is 8hrs pay not good to all the amount of work.
bad,The job was great I liked it but management made you feel like they were always better than you & were always putting you down. Advancement was a sure no in this location
bad,I like to work hard and having management that does not follow policy does not work for me.  If new management comes in it not justified to give hours to other employee who have been there for a month or to and not to those that have been there for years.
bad,"This job overall was easy but not challenging in any way. would only recommend working here if you had no other options. Did not get much work, this was not even close to full time"
bad,"Disposable labor is a blight on the face of the economic social structure. The company mindset and objective at Dollar Tree Stores is to push employees beyond feasible limits of physical and logical accomplishments. In essence, they set extremely high work goal demands on employees in order to maximize Company's profit margin by using workers to do tasks in time limits that actually require two or more persons to do thoroughly. They do not even consider age, gender or disability, limitations"
bad,I liked working at dollar tree . I delt with the public worked as the assistant store manager. Got to be in charge for one of my first jobs it tonight me alot
bad,Working for this company I have seen and experienced more cons then pros. The pay is horrible and some of there managers are disrespectful. It has been quite an experience and I’m looking for change.
bad,"Can't advance, it is just okay if you need extra income. Cashier, stocking, customer service, loading and unloading trucks, order, inventory, cleaning, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, and putting up signs for the store."
bad,"I enjoyed interacting with the customers, however, the biggest problem was working so hard then taking home minimum wage with no health, vacation, sick leave benefit. Also, your hours of work is not guaranteed."
bad,The environment was always chaotic and there was always issues.  The hardest part of the job is there was never enough cashiers to cover the amount of customers.
bad,"My experience at dollar tree was like any other. New exciting place to work and, of course, a fast paced retail environment. The only down side to a quick day at work was the fact that management was very hostile. There were a couple instances where the employees came to me with issues or concerns, as I was the Assistant Merchandise Manager, rather than discussing it with the Store Manager due to fear of their reaction. Nevertheless the amount of pressure and guilt that got passed down from management to associates, at least from my experience, decreased the productivity of the employees. It was too tense and depressing of a place for me to continue to work there."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job. Hours are inconsistent and extremely varied. They also punish you for voiding items, and management is almost never involved in helping you."
bad,Co Workers were very rude. Everyone was a mess and was not on a schedule. Everyone was late. The only good thing is that the manager at the time was very nice at the time and took the time to explain everything at the training.
bad,"You have to work very hard to keep the sore clean and stocked. Assistant managers are paid barely above minimum wage, so it is difficult to find and keep them, and if you do not have an assistant, then you have to work all  days and hours."
bad,fast relaxing sometimes ovewhelming but the customer are respectful . Manger was never really there always leaving to smoke letting team members down. while there were customers who needed service.
bad,Employee since 2012. The store needs a stronger store manager. Daily company procedures are never followed. DM never checks to see if policies are adhered to.
bad,"Stay in the same department try to learn your department,know your job the ins an outs.....dont get too involved with management....just focus on yourself and your jobs goals.....it can be very stressful with  so many different manager's coming and going...knowone comunicates,no one is on the same page#@!!@"
bad,"not a teamwork environment. bad management. doesn't provide enough hours for employees......."
bad,a typical day at work is stocking merchandise during the early  mornings. I learned the value of time efficiency regarding stocking. I don't agree with management based on the way they operate the work schedule. the workplace is too quiet with no positive energy. The hardest part of the job is continuing to come to a dead atmosphere. The enjoyable part of the job is the sense of humor from the customers.
bad,On a typical work the employees would clock in and grab an apple seed paper (to keep case count) and walk back to the stock room and grab our designated U-Boat and begin stocking the items in their selected spots on the shelves. I have learned to keep calm in very heated situations between a customer and an employee. By this I am meaning if a customers begins to get a harsh tone of voice to just stay calm. The management is okay. The workplace culture is not at all what it is suppose to be. it needs to improve a lot before it is up to standards. The hardest part of my job is dealing with some of the disrespectful kids (of course you are going to deal them anywhere) that run around and don't listen to a word that their parents say. The most enjoyable part of job is the people that I work. They are kind and compassionate about your needs.
bad,"I have been with this company for 10 years and over the last 3-5 years it has gone down hill. Little to no hours to support the stores, long hours, poor very poor district and regional managers, and let's not talk about the freight flow and truck loads(2000 plus pieces at times with no hours to work the freight) which equals packed unstable back rooms and safety hazards that can or won't every b addressed. This is a billion dollar company that they run like a sweat shop. Look else where for employment, I encourage it."
bad,"There were times that I went without getting a break. By the time that I left I was suppose to have 3 raises. And NEVER did I see one of them. It was okay seeing as it took me 3 minutes to get to my job. Out of three of my managers there was only one that I enjoyed the others were rude and I have never been back to that specific store after the one manager left. Nor will I ever go back. I was very over worked and not appreciated one bit. I actually remember telling my boss that I couldn't make it in there was a family emergency and she told me that I was disrespectful and unreliable, which was false I was there always and covered shifts left and right. Then when I put in my 2 week notice, I got laughed at to my face and all I was told was ""Haha, good luck"" and that was that."
bad,"-stressful and no team work."
bad,"I would run the store with minimun hours, provide customer service, run a  register, build schedules, ect. I learned that in order to be successful you have to hire the right candidates for the right position  and that proper training will help run a business. The hardest part of my job would be holding on to employees, they always seek more hours and more pay. What I do enjoy about Dollar tree is that you write your schedule and that the customer are friendly."
bad,"no one shows any enthusiasm in their jobs and good work is not encouraged. no air conditioning during the summer, and you have to deal with bad clientele and district managers that don't care about the employees and force hour cuts. enjoy making a living off of one day of work."
bad,Over worked and under paid. Supervisors sit in the office all day with lines spilling into the isles. No concern for employee safety. No breaks. Only part time.
bad,My mornings would be nice to work at dollar tree. Meeting new customers who are up early in the morning and shopping gave a good vibe. During lunch was when I'd have to be alert and worry about shoplifters just so I run to the door and shove myself to stop them at all cost.  Working there I learned that the Team there is VERY Unorganized and due to my incident of being shoved by a shoplifter i realized that this job is very Unprofessional. Management could not advise me for a safety concern rather then rant to another store about what happened and what I did wrong. Unfair work environment if I say so Plus you have to watch out on voids as though customers dont ever change their minds on items. There are a lot of necessities that are convenient and cheap and accepts food stamps which I thought was cool. The only part of the job I find hard Is constantly keeping an eye out for shoplifters and stopping them before getting away. Other than that the enjoyable part is the good company and customers are the best part of working there.
bad,"There wasn't enough hrs./ help nor money. The manager was every rude to the workers. The assanitant  managers was more helpful then the manager. The whole time that I worked there, I only got one lunch break."
bad,"There is no typical day Dollar Tree. Everyday is different. You may plan out your day the day before but when you get there something always happens that changes that list. I learned to expect the unexpected, and that management was more than just telling people what to do. The hardest part of my job was working all day, and then coming in to work overnight for a stock party to clean up the back room. I truly loved setting up for the Easter and summer promos."
bad,"No Management directions. Very busy areas. Lock of culture only for the convenience of others. Hard part of the job none. "
bad,"The overall work place was hot, no AC. The staff and co-workers were polite and great to work with. Managers; not very well at job: forgetful, doesn't listen to co-workers concerns or wishes."
bad,working at dollar tree i had the worst time dealing with rude costumers but above all a rude manager. the store was a poor work environment to begin with but the manager made it ten times worse with her terrible attitude
bad,company expects to much for  little pay .managers are not very plesent to work for as for every one is way over worked if full time benefits are good but so not worth it
bad,Boss is very unprofessional and doesn't communicate well at all.  Workers are way too laxed and lazy at times. Definitely not worth the money or the time unless you have a better boss than I had.
bad,Working at dollar tree has been a blessing for me. Must be able to multitask and function in a fast paced environment. You must be a people person to be able to provide a friendly welcoming environment for the customers.
bad,It's an OK job if you need money here's the place for the pay minimum-wage and you have to deal with really dumb people. A lot of questions I got asked was how much is this in the dollar store.
bad,"This was my first job as a cashier amd at times it was a little overwelming at times, but only because I was new at it. I did had fun working with my co-workers they were always helpful."
bad,i was an senior in highschool at the time and needed a part time job but only recieved a maximum of 20hrs. every two weeks. my biggest amount of pay from a two weeks check was $130.00.
bad,General work duties for a deep discounter chain leave little room for any perquisits .Frequent schedule changes lead to occasional errors. Bleak environment.
bad,"There a good company, but the store I work in has its problems. It sometimes has to many high school drama times, and there are no high schoolers working at out store. But I like the company overall."
bad,"I liked the job, doing cashier and stocking shelves was ok. Hours sucked some weeks I only got 4 hours. Not reccommended for sole source of income. I liked most of my co-workers though."
bad,the work is pretty easy but the environment and some of the assistant manager are not good. the place is not safe due to some robbery and rude customers.
bad,Learned New thing about retail management. hardest part about being management is dealing with all the rude customers.
bad,what i learned about working there is that its always a he said she said. Manager is too much of a push over needs to stand ground and disciplining his employees.
bad,"When I was hired the manager said they work with employees to help them get the job done, this was a lie. I was written up 3x for not averaging 150 boxes per hour, they trained me for 1 day and didn't offer help until the 2nd write-up. Management there is garbage, watch out for the lady in the glasses she wants to fire you, she sucks and avoid her at all costs. The work is OK, you drive around a pallet jack and grab orders, but be prepared to work 6 days a week, even when there's ice and snow."
bad,Dollar is a place where you can become a much better people person. Working at a dollar like dollar tree you learn how to control yourself when a customer is being disrespectful to you.
bad,this job was easy but only offers part time and seasonal help again good for a kid but not for a adult with car payments and rent to pay older cashiers are crazy and rude
bad,They are understaffed and treat current staff poorly. They are over worked and treated like seond cless citizens. The upper management doesnt come through when they say that they will
bad,I don't think that it is a good place to work if you have bills to pay or a family too feed but great for a college student. But that is my personal opinion .
bad,"Not a great place to work. The management team is not great at all. Its a good job if its your first job but if you trying to change careers into this job, Don't do it."
bad,"Helping customers , counting money ,putting returns away "
bad,"usually everyday i come in and go straight to my register in between im putting back baskets and shopping carts and returning things to the shelves and keeping the front end clean...from my experience working there ive learned to multi task the manager almost always tries to overwhelm you with side task so your always busy..co-workers are mostly friendly and a bit older...id have to say the hardest part of my job is dealing with the big lines,sometimes customers are very slow and it holds up the lines..the most enjoyable part of the job i would say is interacting with the customers and providing customer service"
bad,"I was doing management work before I was made an assistant, very stereotypical job, too corporate.  However, this was one of my first bigger title jobs so I did learn a lot about leadership, responsibility, time management and quick to learn on my feet with crazy situations."
bad,"The upper management of this company terrorizes managers and associates alike. Company policies are non-nonsensical, and the people running the company appear to have little-to-no sense of what works on the floor when dealing with customers and with daily tasks. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a job."
bad,"If you like working 75 hours (getting paid for 40) a week in a an extremely dusty warehouse, where safety isn't a priority, the join DC 10 in windsor as a L1 Department Manager. They dont follow the values the company preaches, they arent open to ideas how to improve processes because "" they cannot afford it because we only sell things for a dollar"". Day after Day associates are injured as well as managers. Goals are inrealastic with this warehouse with the poor quality of workforce they hire!"
bad,"Not enough hours. to much required for time given. Never sure when working,Mangmnt always changing schedule without notice."
bad,"the place was ok. but at the time I worked there, there was no AC. not the biggest fan of the place. even on the first day of work I had no training I learned the systems on my own."
bad,"I just started, and so far so good. The managers are fun, and it's a good environment to work in. I am enjoying it so far, and am eager to see how I like it after more time."
bad,"there was a lot of people coming in and out all day long. "
bad,"its not a bad place to work, Manager have to get on the same page. i enjoy talking to customers. i have a good time and learned alot from customers and managers."
bad,a typical day of work was entering the store to your assigned assignments and not to fulfill someone else job while having to do yours by the end of your shift.
bad,its a growing company out of virginia. they purchased family dollar store. they have over 6000 store in the usa and they own a company called family dollar and dollar giant.
bad,"The flexible schedule works well for those that have children but it gets a little messy if you have another job. Reason being that Dollar Tree doesn't really give you set working days although, that's something that possibly could be worked out."
bad,"Location is awful. (West Side of Charleston, WV). Manager and most employees are horrible. Store is a wreck. Clutter everywhere. Most employees are late including Manager."
bad,"A very busy and fast paced environment. Wide variety of customers, including age and race. The most enjoyable part of my job is my regular customers and the friendly relationship that I have buit with them over the past two years!"
bad,As previously stated the constant understaffed situation is a major issue. The support wasn't there when there was an issue. A lot is expected from you without addional training. The lack of respect and juvenile behavior within the store was not acceptable. As An ASSISTANT manager  the wages weren't commensurate with the amount of work and responsibilities.
bad,"A typical day started at 8:30 as I arrived to count drawers and safe and start up the computers."
bad,"hard days at work,"
bad,"This position is a less than desirable experience.  Compared to the other places I've been employee'd.  Aside from the daily interaction with the public, there isn't much left to be explained."
bad,"It really wasnt a family, it was jus a work and go home, but I still did my best to keep a positive attitude.. But for the most part I ike it cause I love working with people Im a people person"
bad,"There isn't a lot to say about this place. The pay was minimum wage, and all the positions were part time. The store had 1 full time manager, 2 part time managers, and roughly 10 part time cashiers. That being said, the cashiers did most of the work (unloading trucks, stocking shelves, cleaning). But minimum wage with only 9 hours per week outside of holiday seasons is barely enough to cover the gas to drive to this job."
bad,Stocked cooler and the rest of the store as needed.  Got along with all co-workers.  Most enjoyable part of the job was getting everything done before the shift ended.
bad,Greeting customers helping with returns bank drops and logs. keeping cashiers drawers with necessary change. Putting out daily stock from stock rooms. And also unloading store stock trucks when they arrive.
bad,"After working 5 years at a Dollar Tree, Inc. distribution center, I have reached a point where it has become almost humiliating to remain with such an employer. Dollar Tree, Inc. does not value their employees and does not adequately support their employees in need of assistance in matters of either work or personal-life related circumstances. It is a very physical job that does not require any special skill or education. Dollar Tree is an employer that appreciates a high turnover of employees in exchange for the lowest possible wages and pending health insurance."
bad,The daily work life was a pleasant environment. The pay is minimum wage and hours are constantly fluctuating. it is difficult to get  full time hours or advance. management is very ineffective and as a result it is constantly changing.
bad,"typical retail environment"
bad,if you are just a student looking for extra cash this job would be ideal
bad,"Dollar Tree want you to do to much for little pay, in addition to the pay they only offer part-time which results into maybe 20 hours a week if your lucky. I just want a job that's more stable that has benefits, and an opportunity to advance at the work place."
bad,"I unloaded trucks and stocked products on shelves. My managers were nice and understanding, as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was stocking all the products from the pallot onto the shelves within the givnen time frame. Sometimes it would take longer to do than the time given. the most enjoyable part of the job was the environment. It was very peaceful ."
bad,"The company as a whole was a fun and great place to build a career, depending on the store manager.  The associates and the Asst. Managers worked as a team to maintain store operations.  The hardest part of my job was satisfying my store manager, who gave me little to no training  and coming to work in an unprofessional environment where my co-workers are coming to me with gossip both work related and personal.  I like Dollar Tree as a company but I do not like working under this manager"
bad,production and getting your numbers were important. and learned how to drive better and use wharehouse computers
bad,Very friendly retail area. Learned about the retail business and how to understand the process of retail
bad,"I worked here for several months, and they had undocumented people working there, using other peoples Social security numbers and name. The people that worked there were treated badly and the one's that had it good with management received all the hours they needed. Customers we're always friendly. Hardest part about the job was management. I enjoyed the customers and my co-workers. I left the job after the boss and I had a falling out."
bad,"Typical day was so boring, stood on my feet for 5 hours straight. Sometimes I felt like I was wasting my time. They taught me how to use the register but only for five minutes, then I was on my own. This place is so disorganized its not even funny. Boxes everywhere, items mixed up, break room had two chairs and a table full of mess, inside a dirty room with more boxes. I wont even comment on the condition of the back room. Management was a joke. Coworkers were boring/lazy. Hardest part of this job is dealing with people who bought less than 25 of the same items (must scan each individually unless quantity is more than 25) or who wanted money back for their returned items (only store credit is allowed), dealing with old equipment all while bagging their items, and dealing with management when I need more cash/change in my register/any problem. Most enjoyable part was the fifteen minute ""lunch break"" (felt like chow time for soldiers, had to scarf down my meals) How sad that that was the most enjoyable part."
bad,"I have been on their schedule for over 3years, worked , never any work available"
bad,"Refer to the aforementioned summary title."
bad,"A typical day of work at the Dollar Tree consisted of faced paced checking of customers at the cash register, stocking product and maintaining displays. The management and staff were friendly, yet due to the fast paced environment there was not a lot of time to associate with them on a more personal level. The most difficult part of the job was when it slowed down and I would wish I had more to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the public; as a people-person I like to meet and give quality service to my customers."
bad,"Basically assisted manager in setting up new store, stocking shelves, freezer, decorating store."
bad,Best for college students and high school students. it will give you a taste of working in retail.
bad,"Employees try to work with the conditions provided, however they are often lied to, thrashed, and ignored by certain levels of management.  Some store managers get too comfortable and sometimes aren't socially qualified to perform job duties."
bad,I actually enjoyed working here but wish they cared about their employees like I cared about my job.
bad,Enjoyed dressing up each day going to work and helping the customers.
bad,"I happen to know that I am an incredibly talented merchandiser and the management totally under utilizes me. I have even stated my interest in management, been passed over for less qualified.  So, I have no interest whatsoever in moving forward with a company with such short sightedness."
bad,"the company is very hard to work for, there is not a great deal of appreciation for employees and a very high turn over rate at all levels."
bad,I would not recommend people to work there. I have no further comments about it
bad,"It was always busy, but didn't like the way management handled things at times very unprofessional. I always was the only cashier working even when I called for back-up it sucked cause no one liked to help. Never was nothing horrible for me to do, I was always task oriented. Did everything they asked me to do. I loved working there, but to a certain extent."
bad,i dealt with customers all day and cleaned the store in between customers. i cant remember much else.
bad,"Not a good place to work, managers are not organized and they have a problem with losing paychecks and Hrs."
bad,I enjoyed my time with Dollar Tree but the only downfall was the cutting of work hours
bad,The manager was not open to suggestions which would sell more items. There were three assistant managers.Out of all three; There was only one who knew what she was doing. This was not a healthy atmosphere for myself. This job was not proffesional.
bad,S Nova RD
bad,"The job itself was very easy but the store manager lacked the maturity to be running a store. The two assistant managers were the most kind and patient people I have come across and were very helpful. I really enjoyed this job when the store manager wasn't there and worked as hard as I could (putting off breaks until I had to take them in order to get my work finished) but ultimately, the store manager was unruly and I left to look for better employment."
bad,"i come in an hour early because of the mandatory overtime scheduled, unload freight until break time, go back to work, go to lunch then finish my day at 430 pm."
bad,"I would open the store or close the store in that time period I would stock shelves, do cash audits, the daily paperwork and supervise the cashiers. I did bank deposits"
bad,the DM is very hard to work for...very disrespectful to the people who work under her
bad,absolutely no support. You are there to either get the merchandise on the shelf or ring up purchases. Both in mass quantities.
bad,Ring out the Customers.
bad,This is a company to work for if you are at the entry level of management. Job advancement depends on the employee work review and store manager.
bad,People and management are extremely rude. And Dollar tree expects to much out of their employees with such little pay. Did not like the experience. I have been at other places and they treat you better.
bad,they dont give enough hours and the pay is horrible. the manager chris gets mad and will give you one day on the schedule to be petty which is unprofessional.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. The pay if horrible and so is management . The only way I would recommend working here is if and only if it’s your first job .
bad,"My manager at the time basically ran around like a chicken with her head cut off, and hired people who weren't cut out for their position, then hired their friends. I loved my job but felt as tho I was unable to do it because of the way the manager ran things. I was freight manager and assistant store manager."
bad,"Dollar tree put money over employees pay. They make managers reused old outdated products to be restocked on shelves for future use. But the customers are well,"
bad,Working here is not bad but it will get exhausting and depressing. The pay isn’t enough to keep you going so you have just work to gain some experience to apply to much better jobs. Give it a few months.
bad,It's a good place to start your life over . Unfortunately when it comes to management positions sometimes it's your family at home that suffers.. I missed alot of my daughters functions at school due to trucks being delayed or not showing up on the day.. my employees were awesome..
bad,"Co-workers and bosses are great. The environment is fun and pretty easy, but the benefits are terrible. The company never gives raises. It isn't a terrible job just meant for someone who needs a part-time job."
bad,"great benefits, however company takes advantage of free work hours by salaried employees..(i.e, requiring 60 to 70 hours/week during Q4 with zero compensation,  not even a $10 gift card to dollar tree,  as well as requesting we work 50 hours instead of 45 hours a week last year without providing any raises as well as still showing we worked 45 hours a week in our payroll)"
bad,"A fast-paced environment with flexible hours. The hardest part of the job is managing time as best as possible to get responsibilities done, such as keeping your station clean and putting things away while giving the best customer service."
bad,"liked working at dollar tree, however the pay and hours given to work weren’t . The management was not good, there was room for improvement though. Over all the work environment was good"
bad,Great starter job or if u need extra cash. Its fast pace and u are expected to work hard. U get what u put in nothing will be handed to u but u can promote very quickly
bad,"I really enjoyed my position, employees,yet I couldn't make it on the pay to support my family,bills,e.t.c....would of stayed if company would of payed what I really was worth, from the store managers down I was recognized as a hard,honest, friendly "
bad,"Literally have to work 6 to 7 days a week to get anything done. No communication from home office about discontinued items. They send you whatever they want, regardless if you need it or not. Hardly any ability to order. Trucks with merchandise a week behind. Micromanagement."
bad,"It's more idealistic for students, not family oriented. Management doesn't care to talk to staff about their schedule or availability. People do not stay in employment for long."
bad,"As an assistant manager, I spent a lot of my time helping other stores in a worse shape. I hardly got to work at my home store. It depends where you go, but the places I got sent to, the management was irresponsible, sitting in the offices all day. The employees would ALWAYS call in sick but then get mad at you because they don't have any hours. Nobody wants to work hard. The dm doesn't care. The customers are always mad at you for not having something or just because they're having a bad day. Very hostile and nasty environment. I love the store- just hate working there."
bad,"Their management sucked! They need to give: their  employees higher waves. Offer more of an advancment.Typical day would be a lot of straightener,working straight through,barely an breaks."
bad,The company does not really care about its low level employees.  They expect the majority of the work to completed by management staff. Never give enough work hours to properly complete work
bad,Hours were bad and same with pay. Made enough to put gas in a vechile to go back to work and that's it. No benefits . Short shifts never any advance ment
bad,Being an assistant manager was really fun and easy to do. I love what I did I just wasn’t working out in the long run. To many call out from the cashiers and stockers. So just had to say goodbye
bad,"Working there was very draining and only because the customers made things very difficult. You'll either be verbally, sexually, or physically harrassed by one. They don't have boundaries."
bad,I was never reviewed in 2years employment.  Was supposed to have been reviewed after 6 months. Filled in for no show employees whenever asked  received more hours off schedule than on.  Took in average $1500 to $1900 each 5hr shift. When winter storm screwed up computers and my end of shift total differed $10 from from from cash count I was let go
bad,It was hard cause you had to do cashiering plus stock when it was not busy the pay was low for working there and the employes had a bad attitude and was not a fun place
bad,HR doesn't follow there procedures when being committed to helping the employees as they do  corporate employees. If you stand up for yourself they won't respect that.
bad,"I believe that stockers should get a pay raise for are hard work. Stockers do the most of the work In the store big trucks, barely Anytime to get it done, and we barely get Recognized for are hard work if your stocker. Cashiers are most likely to get promoted than stockers. Currently looking for other jobs because Dollar tree barely pays for my living expenses"
bad,"A typical day at Dollar tree was to unload the truck and recover the store while assisting customers in finding their purchases. I learned how to rotate stock, I learned how to communicate with customers in a positive way even if I am having the feelings of being overwhelmed.  The hardest part of the job was loss prevention."
bad,Dollar tree is not good for everyone you need to have a lot of patients and you need to be more than a cashier because it’s a really low Rate of payment.
bad,"I had productive environment always had a assignment to do. "
bad,"Management tends to be unprofessional. Promise of full time, but now very few employees get even part time."
bad,This is good for someone still single but not for someone who has a family. The hours you get aren't much but 4-5 hrs a day. And if you are sick and let management know you can't make it in on your shift due to being sick then you have to find someone to cover your shift. I have been there almost 2 yrs and have had 4 call offs due to being sick.
bad,This was a good place to strengthen my skills as a leader and trainer. The culture was more of building leaders who can build sales. It definetely aloud for free decision making
bad,"Schedule always changes with no notice. Alway stuck with just one cashier and a manager, so work is overwhelming.  No incentives and they never offer hours to anyone so no one working ever wants to give there 100% because they dont feel appreciated for the hard work they do."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time here, it was stressful and the people are not friendly they ask way to much of you for the pay and the hours there is no overtime and your lucky if you get full time hours not feasible to live off of the money and hours there"
bad,"There's nothing wrong with the place itself per say, however unless you are a manger you are a part-time worker, and will get no more than 30 hours a week. Not to mention that you only get paid $8, and that was for doing everything from coming in at 5am to unload the truck, to running the cash register, to stocking the shelves, to staying late to clean up and lock the place."
bad,It's an okay job for a very short time period. Too busy not enough help and low pay. The Customers are always rude and too demanding. The managers don't help you much at all.
bad,"HR was horrible did not help. Management was rude, harsh, treated the employees like garbage. Management would get upset when you couldn't work someone else shift."
bad,This place is hetic to work for manager's are over worked and not appreciated but got bills so i do my best and try to do what i can with the few hours givin in payroll 😖
bad,"They pay was awful. And they expect you to clean the whole store and watch the front doors and work the register at the same time. The hours were flexible and you only worked five hours at the most. The worst part about that is you only got one 10 minute break per shift if it was less than five hours. And they still expect you to work while you’re on break. It was nice to interact with all the customers. Overall, it’s a good place to work but the pay is the worst part."
bad,"Was hired on for renovations and then as a part time stocker. i was never told when i would work and ended up working maybe one day a week if that. I stopped showing as they stopped scheduling me,"
bad,You are easily replaced and You feel it. Short handed and expect to get riped off on the regular. Staff and customers trash the place and no one cares how hard you work
bad,"I liked the job at first but several weeks in now and I almost walked out. It’s insane what they expect from you for the least pay they can get away with. My coworkers are good people and the assistant managers work their butts off. I also enjoy most of the customers. This might be a good job for a high school student looking for a little spending money, but this job won’t pay any bills."
bad,"My first job experience.  Realized after having a baby I needed to make more money.  Before I worked here I was very shy.  This position really helped me interact with all kinds of personalities. I ordered inventory,  as well as cashier."
bad,"Employees constantly call off, not enough coverage on floor, long lines for registers due to 1 only being opened, lazy , lazy, lazy, wouldn't recommend"
bad,"When all is said I loved the position, the duties, and the people. However they seriously underpay for the work they expect from you. There is little to no effort put into the consideration of candidates for employment. They have a nice “buddy-buddy” system that they use to determine who gets access to a safe, if you’re reliable and trustworthy or not. And after many days managements optimism and go licky attitude started to fade. If management doesn’t even enjoy their job, how can they expect to keep employees?"
bad,"loads of work moving and lifting doing other people’s jobs "
bad,"The specific location I worked at was probably the messiest, dirtiest store I've ever seen in my life. It is in a bad area so a lot of the customers that come in look sketchy and A LOT of shoplifting happens. On average, I was scheduled 4-8 hours a week even with open availability. Was belittled in front of customers several times by one specific manager who was also the one to fire me over something that didn't happen and when I asked for proof of what they were accusing me of, they refused to provide it. I didn't try to fight it though because I was fed up with working there anyway. Besides all of this, the actual job was very easy and laid back and I would've enjoyed it if it weren't for the malfeasances."
bad,This is for the Dollar Tree Distribution. Your just a cog in the machine and they treat you as such. You step out of line they will just replace you. The management does not know what they are doing the building is  hemorrhaging employees so they make the ones who are still there work harder to try and cover the loss and they still wonder why they cant seem to keep a full staff or even close to it. The work is tedious and robotic and they seem to make policys to try and keep it that way.  No music / no radio of any kind. Only the sound of conveyor belts / white noise and hydraulics to try and keep you awake in the middle of the night shift. Last but not least the wonderful ARDENT system. The digital whip master that you have to keep happy. Gotta keep at least a 90% productivity rate of they write you up and get 3 of those and your out the door.  O yeah one more thing the No fault policy is a nice way a saying no matter what it is its Your fault.
bad,I give everyone the right amount of change an everything but for some dang reason my register comes up short every   time ! An I don’t take any money the only time money is taken out is when it’s full an the manager comes to collect or I’m giving change back
bad,Once you're in a management position you are forced to work thru your paid 10 minute breaks as well as your unpaid lunch numerous times thru out a week.
bad,Fast pace business with constant traffic. Countless stocking opportunities with early morning crew. As organized as any company with the amount of sales and product coming in and out on a regular basis.
bad,An ok company if you want part time hours and no pay raises and some micro management on certain days/times. Stocking shelves and maintaining store cleanliness is time consuming but makes shift go quick. Managers only hired part time people to work for an annual inventory check that an independent company does then they more or less let you go or get no hours and you find another job.
bad,Working there wasn’t bad at first but the store manager is too relax and pushover-ish when it comes to people doing their job. She hires people that have no interest in working and makes them managers because they have the availability so she doesn’t have to stay as long. Which wouldn’t be a big deal  if the other managers and assistant managers  actually did their job or anything besides standing around and chatting. She sees them not doing anything and really doesn’t care because they are close. Then she expects the few cashiers that actually work to pick up the slack of her assistant managers. Everyone there is a big time gossiper as well. Just not an ideal work environment overall. There’s too many other jobs worth the same pay that will come with a lot less headache
bad,If this company gave me more hours it would be a better place for me to work and I could look to having a positive future with growth opportunities; but I just don't see that?
bad,"I was a store manager for 5 yrs and I was assaulted 3 times with the ppl being charged and when I notified personnel manager and the loss prevention manager... I can give their names but I won't... they did nothing in assist with the assaults.  They didn't even call to asked question and the biggest was they didn't even ask how I was, their store manager running one of the biggest stores in my district.  "
bad,I recently left a full time position because after 5+ years with this company.. 3 district managers.. numerous complaints about the store manager nothing ever got done. I finally grew fed up of doing the duties of said manager and getting none of the benefits. After lodging complaints myself as well as numerous other employees.. we grew fed up with how we were treated and ran like dogs... numerous employees have left in direct result to your management and lack of caring/concern for the part time employees. SHAME on this company..
bad,Job was very easy to do but never got many hours didn’t make sense since I’m such a hard worker great with customers moving the checkout line very fast as always
bad,I really didn't like the company didn't fit a guy like me....not a bad one just wasn't to me....would I prefer anyone no...but hey everything ain't for everybody
bad,If they hired a new store manager I believe that the store would be a lot better. the manager is rude talks about employees to other employees. She also was witness being rude to a customer who asked her a question. She is very unprofessional.
bad,"Straight forward, typical retail store. You will tend to deal with merchandising products ranging from toys and books to food and candy.  Inventory recovery, stocking, and depending on your position management."
bad,"The work environment was easy but cashiers often found themselves doing the managers job because some managers were not properly trained. I found myself doing the managers job for $7.25 an hours. When my boss tried to give me a 10 cent pay raise, head quarters told my manager no."
bad,"Very busy,Didn't learn a lot there,Poor Management,Very devised,The hardest part is no one wants to work,Not very enjoyable. This is a very stressful place to work."
bad,"i was in charge of customer service, cleaning, stocking, cashiering, and unloading trucks alone most of the time. it taught me management skills, money handling"
bad,Dollartree is ok they don’t pay enough for the work we do they don’t have enough people they only get cashier no stickers but it’s ok thank you dollartree
bad,"The job was stressful, the mangers are strict and they don't work you enough, I only got like 4 hours a day and 2 days a week. They were nice people but the money wasn't good and didn't help me on bills at all."
bad,Work life balance is terrible. They will tell you what the schedule is but then mandate you extra days every week for a very important reason. Lol pay is below average and you are micro managed in every detail of the business. Terrible company to work for
bad,"It was quiet , we would get customers but not that much .  I did enjoy working with the staff. I would give the dollar tree a rsteing of a %7 . The boss that took over for a little while did clean the place up."
bad,Always have to work fast. Even when you have medical issues and they know about them you still have to move quickly. Have to pay for your own stuff and do not get paid enough to remotely live especially if you have kids and a family. I suggest that if you work here that you are young and no kids and pretty much live with your parents.
bad,"Only if you absolutely have to. Completely horrible place to work, unless you’re like upper management or just a second job to bring in some extra cash. overall horrible place to work."
bad,Management only hired family and friends and there was never room for employee advancement. Upper management tried to bully its employees and and always pitted employees against one another creating a hostile work environment.
bad,Great hours not to long come in and get stock from receiving and start packing out your isle my time is limited so I moved and worked very swiftly and quick as long nobody come to bother me as I'm working
bad,"No benefits, no discounts, does NOT know state laws, watch your pay, no recognition. No matter what you do you can't get anywhere. No promotions. If the top management doesn't like you you're screwed."
bad,"In the store I worked at, it was always very hectic and the manager was always too busy to really handle any situation I had. When I started I did a basic training on a computer and was told to watch what the other people were doing on the register. And the within three days I was told to work a register. I definitely  believe better training needs to be done, especially for cashiers. I also did't really get to take my mandatory 10 minute break."
bad,Dont really have anything to say if you have worked for dollar tree you know exactly how i feel about the company sorry i dont have anything good to say
bad,"They pay you barely enough to make a living. Hopefully you’ll have a good District Manager, Store Manager, and employees to work with otherwise you’ll be dying for a new job. Honestly... go work for Family Dollar. It’s less stressful there because it’s more organized. But being that they are the same company now, Dollar General can be just as good as Family Dollar."
bad,"Great company, great supervisor and employees, always treated us right doing holidays and made sure we got the hours we need and work with our school schedule"
bad,"the most important thing the tell you at dollar tree while working there is that you have to manage your time efficiently and effectively but these expectations don't take into account the amount of incidents that can happen during the current day. things such as rude customers, spills, etc. can slow you down and have you stressed for the next day. Dollar tree expectations are sometimes downright impossible to complete for managers as if the pay was something I need to poor my blood sweat and tears for which is sometimes I would have to do. As a current manager at Dollar Tree I can say that working here can drain you physically and mentally, someday's you cannot even have a simple 10 minute break so imagine a 30 minute lunch. I believe that managing at Dollar Tree is one of the worst positions you could ask for, being a cashier is simple and worry free and is only a dollar more than what cashiers get paid. Not worth it in my opinion. If you feel like working somewhere where you are unappreciated, Tasks that will make you question why you are doing this for a dollar more than a cashier, and little to no benefits whatsoever then this job is perfect for you."
bad,"I wouldn't work at another dollar tree. They say they wanna work with you til you say you need a day off or work a different day then they fire you. I will shop there, but won't work for dollar tree again."
bad,Attend my job I want time not lollygag with the employees do my work if I can help the next employee with their work Help customers that come in that are lost and cannot find whatever they need  keeps areas clean that out work it
bad,"Dollar tree was an ok place to work at. But they offered 15 hours max a week. Offered no overtime or even full time. Something about insurance? This was a few years ago, maybe it's different now."
bad,"Part time job with weird hours. Usually worked less than 5 hours and3-4 days a week. Got paid every two weeks. Customers are very rude. Managers walk around doing nothing and disappear most of the time. Main manager was ok, always looked stressed and tired tho. Honestly they should pay cashiers more and stock employees as well. Too much work and not a good pay."
bad,It was the worst work environment I've ever worked in. Others was trying to get others to take there duties or won't work much at all. Was a total shame to see store so down.
bad,It's a great job will work for them again. And will tell a friend about them.. Great pay and good hours and benefits.. Highly recommend great company to build a career with.
bad,"ive been in customer service long enough to know that every job is serious. However working at dollar tree was like working with a bunch of children for minimum wage. I knew most of my customers and was very fast paced working. I left because my hours was cut due tot the holiday being over."
bad,Dollar tree's system to have a low number of employees at all times is very broken to the point where customers would line up almost across the entire store just to pay for their items.
bad,"I didn't really like working there because I did not get much hours to work. It is a decent job, and the hours went by so fast as a cashier. It can get a bit fast paced."
bad,"You are always on the go with tasks to be done and always with people that are welding to work just as hard as you do. Typically you run a cash register and try your best to keep the store near, stocked, and clean. A big skill that one needs is customer"
bad,I worked there for less than a year. It took 2 months to get my retro pay and my insurance never kicked in. I was hired as pt management and was transferred to 3 stores before a ft position was available.
bad,"i learned to expand my mind as far as it can go."
bad,I was a supervisor at dollar tree it was a new experience there is not much to say there was a lot of work and the pay was not all there for the job discrimination
bad,Great environment a lot of hard work. Must be a great sales person. Management could be better.  Need more days in my shift. Could've done a little more than recovery. Please don't call me on my off days.
bad,"Management sucked. Perfect part time job, if you are going to school or maybe you are a stay at home mom and want to get out of a couple hours this is perfect. Super easy and fun, depending on location."
bad,I never got along with any coworker at dollar tree. it was not a welcoming place you always felt like your coworkers were talking bout you behind your back.
bad,worked here for about 6 years. easy retail work.  Store manager was not the best also didn't really know what they were doing. sad when a cashier or shift manager needs to fix their problems.
bad,"not enough hours to get job done, very low pay, bare minimum floor coverage and expected to process large quantity of freight,"
bad,"Management was more into popularity to take care of real issues like a manager caught stealing from the staff. I caught the manager under me stealing and got a signed confession from her, to be told to learn to be a team player and more like her. Since I served In the Marines with 3 tours of duty, I think I learned how to be a team player."
bad,Employees are over worked with little pay. The work environment is horrible. It may be just you or one other person unloading a truck with management breathing down your neck to move faster.
bad,One person checking out . The lines are really long . Store is junky . Only one person sticking . Takes A minute for manager to come . 30 min breaks in 8 hrs shifts
bad,Managers are nasty get attitude when you ask for help. Managers treat employees differently. Managers need a better attitude. If you don't want to be there find a different career instead of being nasty to employees and customers. Glad I found a better job with better management that know how to treat employees.
bad,"they really need to hire more people, they have maybe 2 to 4 people to do cashier, cleaning, and stocking at the same time, it was impossible to do all"
bad,"work is busy"
bad,"typical work day was stocking everyday, management was okay, i learned how to do what managers do, the hardest part of my job was holidays, the most enjoyable part was breaks."
bad,Very unorganized and tiring and overall bad hours  And basically only one or two cashier's open plus doing everything else it's ridiculously not a good ace to work
bad,"it was fast paced "
bad,As a store manager you have to plan to work way over your weekly hours. They say 45 hours a week but you can count on doubling that and plus some. There is not work/life balance. It is fast paced and I like that. But not to work my life away. I’ve missed a lot with my family and friends because of it. The freight is unreal of how much comes through those stores. You don’t have the man power or payroll to get your store where you’d be proud of it.
bad,it took them a month to hire me and i had to remind them every week that i had applied. i didn't know i was only seasonal until my last week there. i would not recommend them unless you are currently jobless.
bad,It’s not the best place to work. It’s friendly at first then everything changes. I had my monthly and was told to just go home and that I couldn’t come back even when I said I’d change clothes and come back. Not until almost an hour later did she say that I could come back.
bad,"I was a full time asm at dollar tree .. I worked hard and delt with all the BS they put you thru, such as chaotic work hrs, not enough pay roll for the employees, disrespectful SMs and DMs, Everyone throwing their job on me, lazy co managers etc.  And they fired me for something so small.. They dont have no remorse for the workers and they don't bother to give you a warning its just point blank fired and one to the next. ...   .."
bad,Ok company to work for but could use better management skills on the part of high management and district management. Also the freight system is not effective at all
bad,"I do not recommend working here if your life depends on it. But if you are a student that still lives at home and just needs some pocket change it's not to bad. Where I worked management was great, you almost made your own schedule, most of the customers are rude / unpleasant, and some days felt extremely long due to the labor and the employees I came to meet."
bad,"If there ever was a company to not care about its employees on a store level it is Dollar Tree.It is the absolute worst pay I have ever made in my life for the most amount of ridiculous work I did. Daily activities included stocking and organizing shelves, getting the stockroom organized and emptied as much as possible because it was constantly trashed. Meanwhile listening for who needs assistance at the front register. People would call out constantly. There was absolutely no discipline  There was always bickering and fighting between management. I feel no issues were ever resolved in a timely manner and that there was never a concern of work-life balance. Best part of the job was a select few employees and regular customers. Just filled with terribly careless people who are overworked and bitter. Store manager couldn't care less. Would take several vacations throughout the most high volume parts of the year leaving others without the ability to take their own. SM would wait days to submit issues with A/C and plumbing."
bad,"I was Store Manager at Dollar Tree, I feel like if the freight management was up to par, and the hours were distributed in the right manner, the company and this district would have run a lot better."
bad,"Not the best place to work. Wouldn't recommend working here for more than 6 months.  You aren't paid enough with the extreme work load and stress put on you by the manager.  Managers make threats to their workers, talk with very little respect. The most enjoyable part of the jobs are co workers and certain customers. This could just be from my own store experience."
bad,We don't get enough hours to get stock out on the shelves so we don't have enough workers to get everything done that needs to be done. Our brand new store looks like it about to close because we don't have enough hours or employees to get everything done. It's embarrassing for those of us who care. My self and another lady are the only ones who usually unload the weekly truck deliveries that range from 800 to 2000 cases. We have to handle each case by hand.
bad,very stress full one cashier one stocker and one manager on duty on busy day and time you need at least 3 cashiers but we never had that not a fun place to work but i did the best i could
bad,"I worked here on and off for around four years, but during all that time, they were unmoving with my schedule of 6 hours a week. At first I didn't have the stamina for a full shift and was offered super-part time till I got used to it, but no one ever let me take more hours, though I begged for them. "
bad,"From my experience the job wasn't to great for me, but I stuck through it.  The days were long and the management was kind of  bad. The atmosphere was bland and quiet at times. There were some customers who were rude as well."
bad,"would be nice place to work if had more staff on shift, better management , hardest part doing many jobs with only 2 employees on a weekend night, learned patience and to work faster and multitask while still dealing with customers"
bad,not enough hours to live off of everone on the staff was part time and and know one had over twenty hours or else they send you home and the customers wore rude.
bad,"Wasn't fair when minimum wage was raised I lost my raise work for 7 years n make the same as a new employee.I have been a loyal, hard working employee. I love my fellow employees and customers got close to most. But not making more then someone just started versus 7 yrs. Is just Not right."
bad,"This place can be fun but very stressful.   The job is fast packing but can be overwhelming dude to having to get it all done. "
bad,"Job Work life Balance is horrible. only allowed one weekend off a month. starting the week before thanksgiving mandatory 6 day work week. if you have a family, forget them. No family time over the Holidays.and the day after the Holiday you must be back in the store by 5am.to reset seasonal area. So No No No Family time around the Holidays. and they are 10 hour day's. Micro Manage is all they do."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend tis job to anyone. bad management, raises get wiped out every year when the minimum wages goes up. everyone is expendable. there is no job security."
bad,"Dollar Tree is a bit of a cut throat organization focused heavily on individual accountability versus a teamwork atmosphere.  I deal with the ""seedy underbelly"" of the markets in which I operate.  Hiring the lowest in my markets at $7.25/hour."
bad,"Very unprofessional and the overall corporation is just negligent and did not make employees follow policies and procedures . Due to the minimum wages pay and no overtime,the company has a hard time keeping employees."
bad,We have great customers. And good coworkers. Everyone try’s their very best but it gets overwhelming at times when we’re understaffed. The pay should be more competitive. I do enjoy the  obstacles that come up.
bad,"Over worked for the pay and you have to constantly run around to do things, very poor hours as well as a very inconsistent schedule from week to week."
bad,"I know this does not go for all Dollar Trees, but the management at mine was very poor.  Switched between managers frequently as many would leave.  Sadly, the environment rubbed off on fellow employees and wasn't a place of smiles.  "
bad,My experience working with Dollar Tree has been stressful at best. I was hired on and forcefully promoted which sounds great but when it came to balancing work and being a single mother my employer was disinterested in working with my schedule . The stores are usually dirty and there are several violations that go unsolved. It has been a steady job and I am thankful for the income but all of the employees are over worked and under appreciated which leads to the former issues.
bad,Low pay but good exercise and i'm close to home. The staff works well together all though it's easy work I feel we should be making at least 12.00 hr.
bad,"The management wasn't good.  The pay is minimum and you earn every oenny of it. If you are really pressed for a job or you have no work experience, I would say its okay to work there."
bad,"As management, there should be full-time shifts.  Enjoy working with the co-workers, but only down fall, evening shift their is only 2 people working. There is a lot of things that have to be done. Not enough people to get jobs done."
bad,A lot of blame is put on associate for not welcoming new associate. Never about management or human resources following up with new associate. It's a place where people become management because they could never make production goals? You would think that they would help to make your job easier but instead they are more likely to be the reason for associate to struggle with staying employed at this facility.
bad,stock shelves and operate a cash register. management was ok. the culture was actually OK  every body had team work. being pregnant and working. having a job.
bad,"Too much to do, not enough time to get things done. Fast-paced environment, unorthodox approach with organization. Order is hard kept with various items and no ""home"" location permanent for anything. Most difficult task encountered, customers coupon during transactions."
bad,"If you want your kids to earn money, dollar tree is a great place. They can earn money and get job experience. so they can have money through college."
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced and a lot of go backs, mainly one cashier ringing while other stocked or did go backs. I learned while working to go at a faster pace than normal, management had a confidentiality issues with telling other employees your personal business. Wasn't safe and a problem with safety issues. Having a few coworkers to make your shift go by."
bad,"It was just a temporary job, although the management lack the ability to train me on how to work at the store, it was a learning experience too. It was my first job here in the US"
bad,"I would not work here again. Poor work/home balance. Poor compensation. Management can be difficult to work under. Corporate does NOT care for its employees, and while you can advance, most people are just looking to leave."
bad,"Hrrible place yo work. Pay sucks, managment sucks Everything about this company sucks. The store is always a mess. Always out of order. Its just a bad eveything"
bad,"management was horrible. the hours were bad. no one knew what they were doing. they didnt really want to help you learn how to do things, they fired me because i was sick as a dog."
bad,Dollar tree ware house is a good job fairly paid for only those peoples that doesnt work in shipping deparment. Shipping department is the worst department of all only pro about shipping is the manager doesn't get on you like other department. aren't as strict as other department. Shipping is the hardest stressfulness job I ever worked not recommend if you are not in good shape. to work there you have to be 100% fitness to do the job or you just going end up struggling to keep up.
bad,"I worked here part time as a cashier for my first job.  Most of what I did was work register with some stoking shelves and cleaning up.  Unless it's a busy season, it was only me and one of the managers working at a time and no in store music.  The easiest part was since everything was a dollar, no one tried to haggle the price."
bad,"If you're looking for a temporary job until you can find something better this would be an okay place to work, but it should only be a temporary job.."
bad,The company is fine to work for if you enjoy a store manager who gets paid to never show up and pond all of her work onto you. If you enjoy breaking your back for a company that only expects more and more.
bad,I'm a manager I tell everyone job sucks and is not worth the pay. I started this job because of a store in Hazlett NJ. Loved the place then I worked for the one in PA biggest regret
bad,The holidays are the best time to work for the Dollar Tree due to good hours. Besides the hours for the holidays the hours are limited. Managers never last and employees don't either. There is no job security and no room for advancement.
bad,They give you 4.5 hours shifts max it is great. The customers are awesome and fun. It is a great parttime job and it is fun to work there. it is asjss
bad,"short hours "
bad,They only wanted to give me 2 days a week. And only 4 1/2 to 5 hours a day. Which wasnt worth the trip of going. So i quit. It wasnt enough hours to make a living on.
bad,"Terrible management, they were disrespectful and rude to me and played favorites. We had a lady quit because of it. It got so bad I found a better job.. U really dont wanna work here.. I loved the job itself, the store is amazing and the customers but management sucked."
bad,Fast paced and low paid with no benefits. Poor management. Restricted benefits. Not much room for advancement. Physically exhausting work for 10-12 hours a day.
bad,"management is horrible, nasty, rats every where. poor training. more training to get you ready to do the job. lesss negativity. more help from the managers."
bad,"Not enough hours. 4 to 8 hours a week, the management was very poor. they did not allow you to work more then 8 hrs a week. they had a lot of favoritisim, 95% of females work and receive all the hours."
bad,"freight manager, offload cases of merchandise, stock shelves, freight orders, customer service, cashier, janitor, loss prevention, managed others, only able to work a maximum of 8 hours a day."
bad,"Management wasn't responsible. There wasn't a lot of hours, and the pay was too low. Overall, I did not have a good work experience at this job or with the management."
bad,There is great opportunity to move up.  There is always a lack of man hours so managing your teams productivity is a must.  The higher volume stores do pay well
bad,"In my short time there my entire shift team was blamed for leaving trash over night even though when we where finished we cleaned everything up. It was the two to three person group that was not even suppose to be there at night that left a mess. We where accused of working slow even though we finished all our work by the time we clocked out. The manager was also lazy and left a mess when she ""worked""."
bad,"Started because I needed to pay rent. Hours were 18 to 22 to start. Minimum wage, been there since November and only 3 weeks where my schedule didn't change. Drama overload, management thinks the world revolves around them. You bust your butt every day only to not be appreciated. I can  seriously make more money at a fast food restaurant with less stress."
bad,Hide demand environment with multiple tasks to handle at once. There is an issue with the amount of work needed to be done versus the amount of people staffed on a day to day basis
bad,Typical day was about average sales and arranging lots of unessecary freight in the back room. Some managers know what they are doing and the others just don't. Best part was leaving. I'm still having troulbe getting my W-2s from this work place. Very bad.
bad,"The assistant managers really did not work with the cashiers they would just come in and not say nothing to us just have us do what they want us to do and that was it."
bad,Working at the dollar tree was very stressful. There was very limited amount of hours and it seemed to be very unorganized. I would not want to work at the Dollar Tree again.
bad,"Part time job while I was finishing college. Hours were very flexible. The manager worked around my schedule, which was really nice. Typical day depends on the customers and manager present"
bad,"The work was not difficult but had high turn over due to low pay. Management was very good. Most of team members were part time, management was full time. Everyone worked together productively."
bad,Unless you're in a management position hours are only about 8-12 a week. In management position the duties out weigh the time to get them done. They do not allow extra tine for extra duties. They are not OSHA compliant and don't seem to care.
bad,"It can be pretty non stressful, but when the managers become stressed with things, including things from their life, they take it out on smaller positioned employees. Managers do play favorites, and do not listen to those who have a problem about their favorite worker. They pay very little and cut hours regularly. Some managers can be kind, and patient. They are lenient when someone cannot make it to work, as long as they are a good employee."
bad,Dollar tree around the holidays are crazy so to be under pressure and still be able to learn your job is amazing cashier was good I could see myself back at dollar tree if I had more hours after the holidays hours went down to about 4 hours a week woe
bad,this job can get stressful fast with lack of organization and constant disaster of the store itself. boxes everywhere and nothing on shelves. not a job i would recommend
bad,"enjoyed seeing the customers on a daily basis, made lots of friendships, always new items being delivered, fairly decent place to work, positive work environment, decent lunch time and breaks"
bad,"dollar tree is good starter job for some one who never worked before but not good for long term goal work days usually 3 hours a day not much hours  "
bad,Promised at least 25 hours a week and most of the time got around 10 because hours were so low and they had to be divided between everyone who worked there. Store manager was highly unprofessional and only liked female employees for their appearance not their work ethic. My time here as an assistant manager has damaged my professional reputation because I can’t use them as a reference because I called them out on the inappropriate behavior and it was held against me.
bad,"Cashier, condense the merchandise, paperwork, clean the store, stock the merchandise, help manager with all aspects of the store. I work part-time (Monday and Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings)."
bad,It was ok  money &  job experience was a good thing but short breaks over worked under staffed . i also didnt like having short hours and being expected to complete so many tasks in the few hours i did have. The location was far from where i lived.
bad,"I only worked there for the holiday season- literally a month between November and December. Once Christmas was over, they simply stopped scheduling me without warning."
bad,They manager at the grambling store was racist and talked about the employees where they could here them. Said they was better off without me and I was slow and etc not professional at all
bad,"Good job placement to learn and gain experience."
bad,They don't understand anything the pay was. The overnight shift was unbelievable the Managers over took their job too the extreme. It's a very very paced job
bad,"love the people I work with. The company itself is a sorry company to work for. Never any raises unless you become management,not enough hours,want you to work like a dog for 7.35 hour."
bad,"easy advancement if you put in the work and dedication"
bad,it was ok i was just a teen when i worked there so i really dont remember the experience there it was in the mall when it was up and running i would work there again
bad,"Staff was okay, but most of the management was rude and disrespectful. Pay wasn't good along with very small raises. At times, it felt understaffed considering the amount of shoppers who came through the store. Not the worst place to work, but definitely not the best."
bad,All I know is that I work there barely 20 hours a week and the pay is not up to par. I would like to work another job with better pay and more hours in the exact location.
bad,"Expect you to do 8 hours of work in only 5 hours"
bad,People never showed up on time. Especially lower management. Sometimes if main manager was not there it was out of control. People were rude to customers or a general lack of customer service.  It truly was a stressful place to work due to a lack of consequences for a total lack of employees following rules and guidelines to our job.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Not a very appreciative company, not very much advancement, high standards but low wages. Not recommended for most, but acceptable for first job seekers."
bad,"most of the time only two people working in the store at one time, pay rate not competitive at all. store managers can work up to 60 hours plus a week on salary pay."
bad,Was the worst warehouse I have work at. They could care less about their employees. The management would give their speech in the morning and you wouldn't see them rest of day.
bad,Fun fast paced environment for the young and young at heart. The position I hold does require standing the entire sheft. Attention to detail as I am checking out the customer ensuring to give back correct change. While seamlessly making sure said customer has all of their bags as I start with the next person in line. Its fun and very busy yet has slow times. During the down time I am cleaning up the store. Helping customers find items or answering their questions.
bad,"When I first started working there, it was great. The manager incorporated me into her team. Wasn't long after that I was pulling her weight plus mine. She because unapproachable and I knew I had to go. After I quit, she treated me like we were the best of friends."
bad,"It's stressful , not paying enough , the people there are rude and disrespectful , I'm interested in this job because it'll be more money and I like meeting new people."
bad,"From the customers shooting in the front door, to the multiple vendor deliveries and the budget expecting every employee to multi-task; overall, the best to speak of, is workplace morale, if any."
bad,"Dollar Tree started out as a fun place.  However it ended s being very stressful.  Pay was terrible for the duties the job entailed. I had a lot of bad experiences at this job, but some of the customers made u for that"
bad,It Would Go Day By Day The Same Thing Unloading Boxes And Stocking Them Over Night And/Or During The Day. It Would Get Very Repetitive And Some Time Very Annoying
bad,"Assisting customer with merchandise. Restocking shelves and keeping a clean work area. The ability to train new employers but, not knowledge enough for advancement!!"
bad,"Nice place to work, yet wasn't enough pay. I wasn't paid very much and the management wasn't very nice. It was good to meet and greet with the many people who came to make purchases."
bad,"I only work weekends, the busiest days and it gets pretty crazy. Trying to get the store back in order is the hardest on these days but the time goes by quick so that's a plus."
bad,"Working at Dollar Tree was a job. It was a good job ,a fun job to work at because you could meet a lot of different people.  But it was hard to get to work on Sunday and the manger's act like they couldn't understand that. But overall I wouldn't mind working that job again."
bad,"I really enjoy talking dealing with people and have a "
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers, but not much more. The company guidelines changed to suit the manager. I liked the pace and physicality of the job. Stressful and tiresome"
bad,"Highly motivated in staying on task with my work! Nothing better then being Honest! Staying organized very out going with people/public,open to other ideas and thoughts,also Very willing to learn more and explore new  opportunites. Open and willing to be there and or pick up all  scheduled as well as open shifts! My schedule is very open ,and I can work around the cleaning job,not many hours with this job owner is doing more of the work now he is retired."
bad,"The job is by no means difficult. But due to this, never expect to go anywhere. It is really poor when it comes to getting paid, but you have to take into account ""You're working for a place that sells all it's products at exactly one dollar or less."""
bad,"This company is short on employment hours. They hire for part-time with no benefits.  The job is stressful because the stores are packed and unorganized. While cashiering, you are also expected to put out freight. "
bad,I haven't learned anything from my new manager he is with the company 2 months and I been there 4 years. It is a very stressful place to work because the associates are only allowed to work 4 or 5 hours and there's a lot of work to be done that can't
bad,"I was a cashier but was also did stocking, that they were not an organized company, because they could not keep employees because the pay was way too low.  Management was under paid also, especially for all the responsibilities they had to endure.  I had a great manager, I was lucky.  Because of the high turn around, there was a lot of retraining that had to be done which slowed down the workforce.  Keeping the store clean.  Decorating and stocking for each holiday."
bad,"Management is poor and scheduling is not fair. Manager would give more hours to those he favor instead of those who have been working there with experience. Typical day at work could be either slow or fast depending on how you would want to work. Learned many great things I can use in further retail jobs. Workplace culture is okay, prior to just being able to get your work done. Hardest part of the job is getting most of stock out when there is no where to stock the items in the sore when it is full. Enjoyable part of the job is everybody's favorite, pay day."
bad,No consistency in management and there is a significant increase in turnover.  No training in play for lower level employees.   Pay is very low for the amount of work your required to do.
bad,Some staff was fun to be around. Normal retail job where your day is decided by who comes in. Holidays are not fun with the deadlines given by the higher ups at Dollar Tree.
bad,"Bad management, warehouse is always dirty. The graveyard shift always has more overtime than all other shifts. Break times were inconsistent. Workers were cool."
bad,"Much of a hasil , not for me, very busy place, a lot going on , there can be annoying rude costumers at times . To me the day drags I don’t like it personally I ly isn’t for me."
bad,"Store management was unprofessional, yelled at employees, very belittling and rude, did not treat everyone fairly, I also was not paid enough. It was not a great place to work I dreaded going in."
bad,It's a pretty terrible job. You don't get paid well and it's mediocre. If you aren't interested in your own well-being and being financially stable work for Dollar Tree.
bad,"This store is very dis organized, it shows poor management skills and structure, the workers there have such nasty attitudes towards their customers, and as I was shopping there I saw a mouse running across the floor, everyone here is rude and disrespectful. Poor communication skills and over worked with low pay. They need to have people with more structure and highly professional."
bad,"I learned the computer systems at Dollar Tree, and how to order merchandise.  I also learned how to manage freight flow, merchandising.  I managed freight flow, and managing payroll on a daily basis."
bad,things were very stressful with no help from higher ups. never could keep good help. the store needed upgrades and it was not a safe place for 2 women with a deposit to walk out of alone at night.
bad,Dollar Tree is very slow paced and management was not the best. Very chaotic and dirty. Need more order in this work place and better cleaning skills.
bad,Worked almost everyday. Would work afer school somedays. I learned that its an easy job . Some of the workers wouldn't show up so I had to work longer. Some workers didn't like to give me my lunch break when I needed one. It was easy to help people and show them where things are. Also had to pick up after people.
bad,"Although Dollar Tree is growing, the primary directive is being forgotten. Corporate would prefer dirty, mismanaged stores with poorly implemented schematics and immature associates in order to get the product in store and sellable, regardless of appearance, placing and display.To be blunt, while I understand that obtaining the ""almighty dollar"" is a priority, some necessities are ignored and the stores look like yard sales. Moral and ethics aren't implemented."
bad,Salary is very very low do not get any paid days off nor do you get any benifets it is basically a part time part time job if you are just starting out in the world then it is an okay first job
bad,A typical work day at dollar tree was slow. Most of the customers where very nice but some of them where rude and hateful. Assistant managers are very rude and and very bossy. The most enjoyable part of that job was seeing the little kids get so happy over dollar toys and making their day.
bad,I'm currently employed this has been a very tough time due to management outside of head management. When I first started it was great. I honestly don't know what happened
bad,"great place to work and very friendly, no really good on balancing hours , they expect you to know how to work everything by yourself. store is always out of stock"
bad,"not a company you can really progress in, poor management skills,"
bad,Good place to work. Good managment. Good hours. K. Nothing to change. They may have needed more employees but everybody still got the job done I was unloading the truck and everybody was really cool.
bad,"This was one of my first jobs. I changed locations several times and most of the managers I worked for were great. However, the last manager I had was very unfair and treated her employees poorly."
bad,"They don't like to give the hours employees  need. Then when you get a second job to meet your means, They don't keep your days you work the same. So they need to help their employees by ether giving them the hours or keep they days they work consistent."
bad,"Low pay ,unorganized, dysfunctional, and biased. the work place was unprofessional, the staff was under the influence at times. there was no proper management"
bad,"I was cashier wit great customer service skills , I also did inventory for the store and helped wit the shipments and stocking. I cleaned when necessary."
bad,"Not the greatest place to work but most certainly not the worst. If there's routine and structure it can be great, otherwise it is difficult to be an employee"
bad,"Management at the time was a joke. I was stuck with quit a few jobs that were management jobs. While at same time running the front of the store alone.  A lot of times people call in and it's on you and manager to keeps lines short and do store stocking. Customers would be very lazy and leave stuff all over the place and store would be a mess. You have to have store cleaned and everything back in place before closing and that is a hassle when you are stocking, doing returns and running register. You are not given appreciation for the hard work you do for the little pay you receive. Best part of the day is your lunch and that's only 30 minutes."
bad,It was a good place to work always busy. Barely any issues. most of the customers were pleasant. most of the employees were pleasant. I had steady hours so in return I had steady pay.
bad,I am a cashier at Dollar Tree. The job isn't hard or difficult at all. The customers tend to be sweet. The lines get backed up really fats and the customers complain to us why is there only one cashier on one register when there 6 or 7 registers and I can't answer that question. But the only reason I could think of and I'd never say this in front of a customer is the pay is too low and that's why people leave and go elsewhere for job opportunities.
bad,Dollar Tree was really not a good working experience for me. The manger would sometimes talk about us behind close doors and one of the co-workers will tell us about it. The only great experience I've had was how nice the customer where to me and would be happy to see me there.
bad,"I was hired to be the manager at a new store they were opening in the town i lived in. when the store opened, the y gave it to another manager and put me in charge of a store that was an hour and a half away from my home. it was also the worse performing store in the area that hadn't had a manager in over a year. I was completely overwhelmed being a new manager."
bad,Turn over rate is extremely high. Good place if you're looking for time in title but the not competitive wages with hostile work environment make it a dismal place to work.
bad,dollar tree gives a manager no hours for stock or register or frozen stock room is full of  overstock because of to much on trucks weekly wont order products for us when needed such as bags or office supplies
bad,"This is good for part time work and you're bored. Good for high school students, do not try and live off of this job. Pays minimum wage. It was not fun."
bad,"My manager was great, but wrking at another store I received less than a comparable experience. Not only was the store containing rotted expired foods, it also was covered in fecal matter. Managers from other stores sexually harassed eachother and other workers and a female actually got locked in with another said manager who had been harassing her during this job. She ended up getting let go apon filing the report. I don't recommend working for this company."
bad,Working at Dollar Tree was a good first job but nothing long term I would recommend. I learned a lot from my time there and truly made me appreciate the job i went into. It is very stressful and you dont feel appreciated.
bad,"The Manager is rude and has a short temper becareful what you say, and don't be to friendly.A fake smile and a hard working effort goes a long way, for future reference"
bad,"$8 per hour and about 2-3 days per week at about 5 hours each day. Typical deal for most low skilled work."
bad,Working for this store is very hard due to thw fact that they play favoritism and don't leave you any chance to explain any of your actions at all and I hated it.
bad,"While working in retail can be both fun and challenging, working at Dollar Tree has been discouraging. After being there a year I never received a raise, was told they don't do that. Any ideas I had to advance the company or myself had to be taken up with corporate first, and was always shut down. There are no available benifits, and I was kept to a 14-25 hr workweek so I couldn't get benefits even if they were available. Only managers received benifits, and they weren't that great. Good first time job, but not a good career opportunity."
bad,the management is vey rude all she does is stay on the phone personally and talks to her girlfriend while the sales associates work with long lines and steady call for codes when needed assistance
bad,strangest place I have ever worked you didn't know when you were going to work till the day before and never quite sure what you were doing that day either.
bad,"Very low pay, very little opportunity for advancement  title of management =stocker dangerous working conditions. Under staffing as per corporate directive.  Verbally abusive customers."
bad,I was hired as a part-time cashier that worked around 25 hours a week. My schedule was pretty good and coworkers  where easy-going  which is maybe why I liked to clock in.
bad,"This business does not treat employees equally. One may be eligible for advancement but the position may be given to an employee that ""needs"" it more. Such as having a child or rent due. Rather than give to the employee that is actually competent of the advancement."
bad,"count change drawer , verify deposit, make deposit for mid drop off to the bank, complete markdown , cashier audit (2 per shift ) ,sign in and out vendors, cycle count ,review payroll, review schedule ,cash out cashier,productive and fun workplace."
bad,"it was a ok job but the manger was very non professional  and the hours where not a enough to live off of ..............."
bad,Managers are not given enough payroll hours to complete needed freight and store merchandising.  They need to work 60-70 hours per week to keep up with deadlines and freight.
bad,"You start out at minimum wage and takes years to even reach a dollar more than what you started. Depending on the management, certain people will be treated like garbage over others and business isn't always booming, meaning hours will deminish. You can only work part time unless you're a full time manager and you can only work 5-6 hours a day on minimum wage so you do the math if it's worth it or not."
bad,A typical retail place. You start off as a part time cashier and there may be room for growth. Dollar Tree as a company in my opinion needs to grow at a store level to treat their employees better as they ask a lot out of them.
bad,"I made some friends while I was there however I felt the establishment lacked communication between manager and staff."
bad,"The overall job was fun and easy, however the management was very poorly handled. Since I have quit, the store has hired new managers and seems like a much better work environment now."
bad,"Clock in start your shift , get a 15 min break after 2 hours then you clock out after your shift. There is no official job training everything is 1,2,3 and if you have any questions wait for supervisor to assist you. Customers are very respectful however."
bad,Learned a lot of customer service based experience. How to handle cash properly. Manage a safe and cash deposits to the bank. Handled freight and unloading boxes off truck to disburse throughout the store.
bad,"Management barley makes minimum wage, but are expected to do the job of the store manager who makes 2x we do. Toxic leadership runs rampant withing the Dollar Tree Inc..."
bad,"Poor ordering, not enough hours to realistically get your job done. Salary is a joke, with getting paid for 45 hours and realistically working 50 to 60 hours a week. You lose good employees due to lack of hour's and non-competitive pay. The insurance is over priced with poor coverage."
bad,i loved my job especially my customers but the ceo and district manager expected way to much with not enough hours. they expected their employees to be super people with powers.
bad,"I was a stocker and cashier. I made minimum wage with not enough hours. The staff was decent enough to work with. There were no benefits, no insurance, and no overtime allowed."
bad,The job site in Joliet is very racist and they don't treat the workers with enough respect for them to even want to come back to work the next day I recommend that if they haven't already done so to get new management
bad,The GM of the store was very rude. She spoke down on her managers and in front of everybody in a loud tone. Nothing the store managers did was ever good enough. She even went as far as calling the managers names in front of employees. Despite the several complaints she remains in her position.
bad,"Not enough hours. But nice environment. I would consider working there again as manager or supervisor, but not as team member. It was a learning experience."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at this job. The management was unorganized, the store was always dirty and my coworkers at the time were not friendly at all."
bad,you end up doing more shifts because people never show up or the company cuts everyone hrs down and you are the one to cover those shifts they don't realize in a high volume store they can't run they store on a slow volume hours
bad,"okay job, not enough pay per hour. management is lacking especially when training. hated working there but paid my bills. wouldn't ever work there ever again"
bad,"For the time that I spent there I did not enjoy myself. The management was all over the place. It really did not seem like they new what they were doing. They could keep an organized time schedule, and they messed up on the correct amount of money I was supposed to be payed multiple times."
bad,It wasn't really my cup of tea because the managers are really rude and they didn't really to much care about there customers and it bothered me a lot which is why I couldn't enjoy my day.
bad,"When I worked there the first store manager quit, along with the assistant manager, because the district manager treated him with like worthless trash, then another store manager had to fill in for him, working two stores without compensation. Then they found some tool to manager the store. Then the hours suddenly weren't available, so the store was stuck with two people per shift."
bad,You work very hard under paid. I really can not see how anyone can buy a full meal with the pay. Useless you work from 5am until you are told to go home for the day.
bad,this was a wonderful job I recommended it to everyone who wants to look for an easy fun work atmosphere promise you wont regret working for this establishment.
bad,I was not able to finish training and thought that wasn't right. The hardest part was toll to go faster on your first day of work at your first job knowing you did not do training or finish training.
bad,Not worth working for this company. You will be expected to do the work load of about 3 people & be held accountable for what others do not get done. Always short staffed & you are expected to punch out for your lunch & still work through it
bad,"Very time consuming and not much work life balance. I was in charge of many operational functions, such as money management and human resources. Many of my co-workers were involved in unethical practices."
bad,"I moved from a part-time cashier into management within my first year with the company which happens to be one of the better things about this company. It seemed as though my workload just became bigger and bigger  I was dealing with a family tragedy at the same time. It became very hard to manage at work and my home life therefore, I left the company. My boss was constantly calling out for some reason or the other she always expected ten times more out of me than other management it was like I had to be 3 people at once. So, as far as the company is concerned the pay for the position I held could have been so much better. I exceeded and done so much more than any other manager in that particular store."
bad,I was only the4 temporarily but it wasn't too bad. I had a lot of fun but wishes I could of had more time there. I stocked the shelves every day.
bad,Management didn't let me really interact with anyone he always had me stocking things away from people. my co workers was very friendly. the most enjoyable part of work was learning about new products that came in.
bad,I had a good experiencing at dollar tree noting it was not all that.. they didn't give me a chance hate that. aint that something.. but with that job I realized the cashier job is very serious and I need more help with math lol.
bad,"They some what take care of store manager and higher but they don't care of cashier except to give them up to 4 hours and no more than 20 so they don't have to pay for benefits ect, They work on a skeleton crew , But what do you want for a dollar store . Great thing is you can shop for a dollar on all items"
bad,Did not enjoy it at all. The staff was not all that great and the workers were treated poorly. Please stop asking me questions.
bad,Very hard to work there . Management team was atrocious very stressful . Hours were all over the place . Really needed to move on to a better opportunity
bad,Half shifts with short breaks and militaristic store manager lead to my leaving this position. It could have been great under different management.
bad,Cashier was an easy position. It's nice meet new people everyday. Stocking was a more busy position in my opinion but it helped time fly. Hours there wasnt that great for me.
bad,Complete and total micro managing of an easy business if you just allow the Manager to do his/her job constant interference by DM and upper management in your day to day duties. Very poorly run organization that assumes if one store is doing the wrong thing everyone must be doing it wrong.
bad,Working for almost 4 years there i can honestly say i am extremely disapointed with the corporation over-all. typical day at work consisted of employees calling in for work alot. As manager i would have to find help sometimes bringing in new applicants to start same day. I never received proper training as well.
bad,working at dollar tree is one of the worst jobs I every had the district manager always cutting hours and they want to unload trucks in a hour do a 100 cases and hour they you to work like a dog with low pay management  is awful some mangers need human relations class  Because some store mangers give the company a bad name  I  want same names but  its really bad in south florida  there need to be some changes right now if they don't  they are going down I promise you when the eeoc get through them It might not be anymore dollar tree.
bad,"Would work overnight, stocking products on shelves. Management was good at times, but not many hours were provided, as well as very little pay for everything that was needed of it's employees."
bad,"Nice place to work and great people. Just everything was hard to stock, nothing in order at all. Took all day to fix it. Dollar tree pay was not enough to live or support your family. Every 2 weeks pay day  isn't helpful. Other then all that the manager was a wonderful guy."
bad,"I worked almost everyday doing more then what a cashier should do and my check wasn't adding up. Learning about life, checks, and food stamps was the best part. Having a good transaction made the customer and I happy!"
bad,"It was not the best yet not the best place to work. It depended on which team members were working that day and what store manager was involved. In the three years I was employed there, we went through three managers. The first one was ok but not all that great, the second was wonderful, always treated team members with respect and overall made for a  pleasant working environment. The third however, was cold and mean and treated team members with disrespect and was quite rude, and since it was no longer a positive work environment I resigned without notice, after watching her fire an employee who was pregnant, and had worked there for almost 5 years, the day after giving her two week notice, rather than having her finish her time there respectfully. Since giving a proper notice was met with immediate termination, I decided it would be better if I left of my own accord."
bad,"Working for Dollar Tree was not an enjoyable experience. Most days were spent dealing with angry customers and cleaning up after their children. I worked for 19 different managers, including three different distract managers and three different store managers, and I worked with countless other sales associates, most of which barely lasted a few weeks. The hardest part of the job was knowing what to do. Some days I would arrive and be told to do something, and then later get in trouble for not doing something that I have never been asked to do. There was very little about this job that was enjoyable."
bad,"Dollar Tree is a good hands-on experience for people new to the warehouse environment or those as their first job. Unfortunately due to excessive overtime, hard work, and strict occurrence policies, I can't recommend people stay here for the long term. "
bad,"It depends on the store whether I would work there or not. Don't have any care about employees. The dollar counts. No help. Think employees always stealing. Care more about  employees who don't show up for work and lay out, than the ones who always show up and do their work."
bad,the management didn't care for the employees once so ever and would often hide like a child if called for assistance with a rude customer. Also you will constantly seeing a customer steal. its ridiculous
bad,Not enough hours giving to recieve a good check in two weeks. Not enough people working during shift of work. Did not like the fact you had to clock out for a ten minute break.
bad,i liked the people i worked with and for but not the payment it wasnt much or what i can really can with with it was very low not good at all
bad,"assistant manager/ in charge of employing, shipments, loading/unloading, stocking, employ scheduling. Enjoyed over all job duties."
bad,"cool nice place to work, you stock shelves and work a cash register great place to work when your young job not hard at all, fun at times"
bad,Only work part-time need more hours but they are not available.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
bad,I like dollar it was very fun stocking shelves and doing the recovery. from 6 to 10 four days a week and had a ball. we built the store from top to bottom before its opening.
bad,I was advancing in my job but I did not like the work environment. I think customer service applies to all work environments. Even at a Dollar Store
bad,"Dollar Tree was always busy, but never fully staff. Also employees called in frequently without any type of consequences, hence to why we were always short staff."
bad,"rung cash register, put up stock, and swept floor, front shelves, waited on customers, cleaned doors and windows and kept register area clean"
bad,It's fast paced and was fun to work at .But not always fair to their Employees. They change things every day and I know things change all the time but the time frame they give you to do things is unfair when you are under staffed.
bad,"This is a nice place to work if your in school, and just need something to get you by. The job is simple enough to learn within days, the management and staff are nice, and they are flexible with hours."
bad,Close the store maintain inventory as well count the money at the end of the night managed 7 plus staff and keep the store clean
bad,would never work for this company again.  They don't care about their employees makes them go to different stores without any compensation and treats them horribly
bad,"Childish management, low pay, tedious boring work."
bad,"Growing company, fast paced, hardest part of the job was consistent 6 day work weeks. Unrealistic goals set by upper management and inconsistent policies and procedures."
bad,horrible place to work never working there again management were a nightmare coworkers were always complaining about there job and arguing with customers
bad,"To much Chiefs not enough Indians to get the job done in the Stores."
bad,I think i work my behind off all the time but they dont give us enough hours or good pay. I love my coworkers but this job need to change.
bad,"The job duties are very facile, but, because of the location of the store, the work required is four times more than what it should be and neither the salary nor annual raise compensate for it. There is also zero work accomplishment appreciation."
bad,"A lot of multitasking involved, with a lot of very stressful customers. Flexible schedule, at times, but don't plan on calling in ever. My co-workers and management were generally good people with no inner drama between workers. Advertise competitive pay, but in reality only pays minimum wage. EXTREMELY stressful seasonal work. Overall, probably a nice job for people who hate themselves. One 10 minute break per shift, as they don't like scheduling part-timers more than 5 and a half hours at a time so employees don't need to be given a lunch. Not that I would want to work longer periods there."
bad,"Worked for this company off and on for 6 years. They're not very personal life orientated. Had two children and for my last child I was supposed to be on maternity leave the store manager put in the system that I wasn't rehirable. If you leave for whatever reason, you have to start back from the original pay in which you started, 7.25 hrly wage. No one can survive off of that for the amount of hrs you work weekly."
bad,"I enjoyed managing the store, typical day consisted of managing the safe, workers tasks, tidying up the store, working the register, inventory control and helping customers and opening/closing procedures."
bad,count your money. make sure you give and recieve accurate change. sell drive by items to make your goal. clean register and sort go back items in the bin. make psa every 15 mins
bad,i worked there when i was 19 and it was a laid back job.My biggest problems were on friday when the truck came we never had room on the shelves for the new stuff but somehow have to make it fit. The biggest problem for customers is that we have one line open at a time which causes alot of frustration on the customer & cashier.
bad,"My typical day consisted of operating the cash register and interacting with customers and the public, and unloading/receiving freight into the stock room."
bad,"The most I enjoyed about working at Dollar Tree was assisting customers face-to-face. The co-workers were very helpful and kind."
bad,dollar tree is a good place to go and shop but to work its not all that great... you dont get very many hours or very many days when i worked there. i enjoyed unloading the grocery truck that was the best part of the day.
bad,Its a starter job to get some experience and a little extra cash. Was some very good people working there with me on the morning crew but they left shortly after me and our morning freight manager left. That being said i did meet some cool people and learned a lot from a few. I wouldn't go looking to go back there but if they called me asking for help i would.
bad,"work was fine but the management was unprofessional with low pay other then that a regular day would consist of me cashiering, stocking, and assisting customers"
bad,"I begin my night with checking my emails for information concerning the previous day, then i proceed to start up to prep the associates of the work than needs to be done. After start up i supervise the mods and offline."
bad,Company treats Store managers like substandard people. Unrealistic goals set by upper management and no support to achieve the goals set
bad,Let me just say i appreciate this job for being my first actual long term job..but this job was just horrible job experience it was long hours with horrible pay the workplace was disgusting and the management was horrible with some managers i don't recommend working here but if you really need a job this is a place for you usually they are always looking for people but don't expect a wonderful experience from working here especially if you are a cook.
bad,checked customers out with their purchases  ran a cash register. stocked shelves. blew up balloons. keep isles clear of stock.
bad,"The most unprofessional job I have ever had. No real order, I was called to work and not even let in the building. I've never experienced such unprofessionalism in my life"
bad,"A typical day at work consist of running the cash register, greeting each customer and putting out the inventory to restock the shelves. I learned how to run the register, restock the shelves, unload the merchandise truck and place it in it's proper place."
bad,"a typical day at work would start out by unloading the delivery truck Monday mornings,on Monday and other days restocked the shelves as well as removed items that did not belong there and put them back on the shelves where they did belong. Swept the floors and made sure the store was clean before leaving the store at the end of my shift."
bad,"This job is mainly for young students. There is very very little job security and if your store manager has any personal issues with you and wants to be snotty just because they can , they will and no one can really stop them. They give you a lot to do and very little hours to complete your tasks. For all your hard work never really pays off. Your hard work the store managers gets the pay off. The only good thing is your part time hours give you flexibility at home but then again you probably want and need more hours to survive, or will end up getting another job."
bad,Good work but u cant get more than 15 hours a week. No one recognizes when u do good work. No advancement oppertunities...
bad,did the opening of the store and did stocking of the shelves and ordered product for the coming week. had to find cashier if one called off unloaded the truck if I was there when it came in. also worked at different stores if they need a fill in.
bad,"Typical day at work is stocking, cashiering, and cleaning. i learned to get alone with people even though they are not right.co-workers are ok sometimes but problem starters.which makes your job harder than it is. mentally and emotionally. Hardest part of the job is getting through tha day and still keep it. Most enjoyable part of the job is going home on payday. Honestly"
bad,A typical day at work for the dollar tree included stocking the shelves before the store opened. ringing up and bagging of the items for cusomers. unloading fo the stok truck and frozen food truck. stocking the frozen foods.
bad,"A typical day at work was 8 hour shifts, cashiering, stocking, co-workers, were great, hardest part of the job was unloading a truck the most enjoyable part of the day was working with the customers"
bad,I will have to come back to this part. I need to think about this more before filling it out.
bad,"I personally do not agree with some of the procedures that are in place with the Dollar Tree Company and they, as a company, do not take care of their employees as they should and as some companies do. The work is fine and you do receive benefits if you are part of management (after 6 months) even if you are not salaried but the company runs poorly comparatively to competitors and it hurts the ways the stores run.  If someone were to go to corporate and take a look around and ""fix"" some of the procedures so that they are more efficient and less out of date I believe Dollar Tree can improve and succeed even more than they already do.  Would I go back? probably not but I would not tell anybody not to work there."
bad,"Stocking groceries on shelves."
bad,I was unhappy with the work enviornment due to the fact that i was only allotted  hrs max a week.
bad,I have learned to work with everyone. Customers who give attitude is no problem or a bother. I also learned that there is a fine thin between professionally criticizing and unprofessional criticism.
bad,"A typical day would be cashing out customers and stocking shelves."
bad,"This company was easy to work for, and they provided good benefits."
bad,sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thankful. thank you so much management.
bad,"Learn the menu"
bad,"Created and installed Plan o Grams."
bad,I love the workplace at Dollar Tree. My customers are friendly and like family to me. The workplace is productive and very high volume.
bad,"A typical shift is mainly loading boxes and stocking shelves with items, I learned better time management and costumer service skills. My co-workers were friendly and willing to help. The hardest part is the physical aspects. I enjoyed seeing a section fully stocked and ready for use."
bad,"Dollartree is a very trying company to work for.The company has such high expectations and no compensation to any of the employees under the store manager.The store is high volume at certian times and doesn't provide the appriate help to assit the customers.I would have to say they need to teach the store managers  that they aren't just a leader,but a member of a team to reach their sales ,satisfactory customer service and encourage employees to want to be a part of dollar tree.There are only two things that i could say that was good about the job,getting to a part of helping customers and them wanting to come back,and the other is that you get such a good deal for a dollar.Management is unorganized and under paid.I learned i want to work with a company as a team player so everyone feels needed and important."
bad,Working at dollar tree is challenging only due to the fact that the company is not well organized and it can run slow at times.
bad,"Dollar tree was easy, but also an let down. I helped put up the store and my job ended"
bad,"Managers very snobby and did less then cashiers. Duties were constsantly thrown back and forth between manager and manager because nobody wanted to do it, thus they gave the work to me and other cashiers. Whenever you call for help to open another register, whether it's because someone is paying in all pennies or that there are just a lot of people, the management gets really mad that you're not The Flash and can't get it done fast enough. You are bombarding with musts, do's and don'ts whenever you do exactly what manager says. Greet every customer ask the customer for bag, ask customer if  that is all, ask if they would like to purchase an additional item for the troops, would you like to buy the Dollar Tree Special, are all questions you must ask to every customer and after you have to tell them to call the number on the back of the reciept, tell them how we did and have a chance to win a thousand dollars. That process alone annoys customers and we have had numerous complaints about it. Only positive thing I can say about this place is that they will work around school schedule. Other employees and snotty and rude when I am nothing but nice. Low Class Job forsure. Ten minute break for five hour shift and half of that ten minutes is cleaing your work area with cleaner and when you""re done uoui have only five minutes left to use the bathroom because they do not let you go on the job."
bad,"the company is ok to work for , but if you know too much you will be asked to do it all"
bad,It was alright but I didn't really like working there for only a month because the employer never told me that I was a seasonal worker.  They told me I was a part time employee until one day they never put hours up for me on the schedule.
bad,Not a place for everyone can get very hectic at times.But its a good.
bad,"make announcements, clean up sales floor, cashier, customer service"
bad,"Lack of positive leadership, high turn over rate, hours not conducive to my life style."
bad,"A typical day at work can be alittle stressful...i have alot of responsiblities and not enought time to do it all and i always have to stop projects cause since im a manager i have to deal with returns, freight, re-setting sections, pricing, inventory, cleaning etc. im only one person its hard to do all these things all the time..its defintley challenging but i always get thur it ...i get along with my co- workiers. i always try to help them out as much as possibly..happy employes happy job..the most enjoyable part of the job is when i can help a customer and they really appreciate it."
bad,It just wasn't something for me. Good environment but I didn't get any hours and their was lack of communication.
bad,Would never do it again if it was the last place on earth to work!!!
bad,Work was very stressful and in a bad area. I learned patience. Management was not very effective. The hardest part of the job was working for poor management.
bad,customer service stocking cashier and home and management sucked and the co workers were awesome and the harder past was the commute and most enjoyable were the customers
bad,the management was rude and very hateful toward the workers. customers complained all the time about the store manager. the job itself was very simple and the work was easy to learn and do.
bad,"I'm glad i had a temporary position cause I would of had to quit after 5 months anyways. The management was horrible and no matter how hard you worked they don't recognize you, so you wont advance.. Also its a minimum wage job and they gave 20 hours at most a week."
bad,I learned how to work with the lone star card and TANF and helped me build my cashier experience a bit.
bad,"A typical day a dollar tree depended on the hours your were working, the earlier hours were the calmest hours. I would usually begin to stock ,and eventually move to the register. the later in the day it got, the more hectic it became. Everyone worked hard, including management, but it was unorganized, especially when it came to long lines, running out of change and bills, and calling/waiting on a response on the intercom."
bad,"a job where there's little to no interacting with co-workers just tons and tons of work orders. orders ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 per day. not the best job but thankful for the experience. not very enjoyable being on your feet lifting 15 to 60 lbs on a conveyor belt all day..but i don't believe in job complaining so i learned from it. "
bad,I don't have much to say other than I found a better job and left.
bad,"it was ok, "
bad,Customer service and keeping the store clean and safe for customers were my first priorities. I would come in and clean the windows clean off the area of whatever register i was assigned to that day. I was always the main cashier which means i always worked the main register which is register one. Working at Dollar tree the hardest part was having to talk on the phone and ring up customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part was seeing my fav cutsomers come in everyday just to see me (: 
bad,This was a job for me to make extra money not a career and I tip my hat off to those who make a living off working here. No doubt I loved most of the people I work with and they are nice people but horrible at work ethic .  I don't understand how incorporating the 35-25-15 rule (hours that full time assistants-part time assistants-and associates) were allowed to work a week). Benefits anyone. If there is a good worker they should be allowed to get more than 15 hours. Customers were often rude but that's what you get when working in retail and that's no matter the social class of the customer. Most of the frustration came from management both in the store and higher up and that's surprising cause I am a part of management. Didn't want the position and I was completely fine being a stocker but took it and was promised that nothing would really change. I was in for a rude upset when I received a lot of broken promises I guess I should have gotten it in writing. Once really loved the job and now I clench my teeth to go in. Would step down but again 15 hours a week I question whether that's worth my time in gas driving back and forth. 
bad,everyday was different working there. i had some fun working there i just hate that had to leave.
bad,"I enjoyed my job, just never enough hours or raises to appreciate the hard work."
bad,It depends on wreather I was working on stocking or cashiering but either way I would help customers and be as upbeat as I could
bad,"It was ok. Good co-worker, good suprvisors. Hardest part is went out of business. I did enjoy my part of job."
bad,"The job it's so bad, but the way they treat their workers it wrong."
bad,"I wait on customers , run cashier, help manger. Clean up store for the next day."
bad,"overall not a bad company to work for, the stores need more hours to maintain them on a week to week basis, and ypper management need to be more involve in the stores. a typical day for a dollar tree manager usally 10 to 14 hours which involve keeping store fill and taking care of the customers, the hardest part of the job is managing the payroll not enough help to keep the store to my standard . i did enjoy dealing with the customers"
bad,Directly pervad sales workers in a railed establishments or department.
bad,"Its no job security there,pay is not good .it was'nt know full time positions."
bad,A typical day consisted of showing up for work at 2:30 and picking up my daily work schedule. I found out what trucks I was required to unload or what part of the plant I was to work in. It was a fast paced job and you expected to reach a certain percentage for each day. Some of the goals were unrealistic. Management was poor and numbers for production were often misposted. The harderst part of the job was meet the quota for each day depending on the department. The most enjoyable part was the intersting peopl was able to meet and talk to.
bad,salvery type of job. No payroll . to much demand. they dont care how you get the job done just do it
bad,"Its a good place to work for and its hard and the pay is ok, vey good co works"
bad,"equal oppertunity for employment, not many good hours for staff"
bad,"Management is terrible at Dollar Tree. That's me being very honest. The district manager is very charismatic, but overall they don't respect their employees. Best part of the job were the customers. They loved me, and vice versa. The stores aren't always in the best condition because most employees dont complete their job duties, then you have to pick up their slack. They expect you to go over and beyond for them, but nothing in return. If you come up with medical emergency or anything beyond your control, you pretty much rush being terminated because you didn't give them a 'two week notice'. Very selfish company but overall, it's a place to make minimum wage money that can be towards whatever you'd like."
bad,Work your fingers to bone for a medium salary. Great benefit package.
bad,"The Dollar Tree company in nashville, is a very unorganized place to work. They don't have managers of other ethnicties or races then White. They only give promote those employees that have parents or friends that work with the company into managment. and , over look those that have the skills and qualifications to complete the task. the most enjoyable part of this job is working with the customers."
bad,"The stocking was kind of annoying, instead of putting the things on a ""u-boat"" that you actually need they put everything in the department that it goes to on it and so you're struggling to move the stuff out of the way to get to the other stuff. I liked doing the freight. I didn't like how asking people to buy ""impulse items"" with every customer was annoying. When you're seasonal the manager will just take you off the schedule and not tell you if you're going to be put back on."
bad,Would be better if they gave more hours and pay was correct everytime.
bad,"I enjoyed working and helping customers, I just felt that the management was very poor and didnt attend to the customers needs like they should have."
bad,I feel that the work that is required deserves a lot more compensation than what is given. I think that this affects the attitude of a lot of employees. Team work was not a part of my position.
bad,"Was caught off guard and cut of all my work hours after being a loyal and caring and hard working employee, I didn’t feel that I was appreciated or had any job security."
bad,No home work balance. Do not pay employees or managers what they should be making compared to McDonalds or other retailers pay. McDonald’s emp make $11 while cashiers only make $7.25. There (Dollartree) annual raises are roughly 10cents.  The weekly trucks scheduled times are unpredictable. Only 2 people are unloading a 1500 piece truck with only 1 cashier running the front end.
bad,I was so uncomfortable with my manager that I just stopped going to work because he was extremely creepy and sort of perverted and I was too scared to contact him to quit.
bad,"This company is the worse!! Refuse to hire full-time employees, only 4 cashiers and 2 (in 80's) old lady's to stock...they want you to work over 40 but refuse to pay for overtime plus want you to work ""off the clock"".. The Store Manager would raise their voice, give bad attitude, be extremely rude to customers and also to the employees.  I could write a novel about this horrible company and go on and on, but this company is not worth the time and effort!!!"
bad,The hardest part of this job was not feeling like a team. While working I was around people that were not trust worthy or making bad decisions. The hours were flexible.
bad,"The pay is low for the area and the fact this company consistently hits $20+ billion a year in revenue. You are stretched all over the store, good luck"
bad,"They overwork employees, expect you to go beyond work duties. They dont do background or drug tests,they are constantly hiring people, people come and go,once hired people dont stay long."
bad,"Stay busy doing small tasks like stocking shelves, cleaning surfaces, and filling balloons in between helping customers while working the cash register."
bad,"It depends on the location of the store which changes quality. The work is easy management is horrible. If you could avoid I'd recommend, really a last resort."
bad,I trained for six months in other stores to be a manager. I made the schedule did payroll unloaded trucks set the store for each season set end caps to help sales.
bad,Honestly don’t really recommend maybe if you just want a cashier experience just to see what it is like the environment wasn’t great at all probably my worst job had
bad,So management is all over the place. No one knows the right answer so you get 4 answers and are expected to figure out what works best. The hr line /dept is a joke no one calls you back for benefits. Also there is a current bed bug issue that they say they have cleared but people are still being bit. No one cares you are being bit or they call you crazy and tell you it in your head.
bad,"Working at minimum wage employee is required to cashier, stock, sweep, mop floors, and clean bathrooms at end of each shift. You're only allowed to work part time leat than 30 hrs a week. Not worth the time."
bad,I enjoyed working here in time went by fast because I was always busy. The work place was easy to learn and I enjoy talking to costumers. Wasn't to on my feet time
bad,"I've worked in customer service in many different aspects, but the people who shop are the rudest i have ever worked with. I have to tell myself that people are not this rude but those that come in this location are."
bad,"Company was all over the place, unorganized environment, stock room was always a mess no matter how many times cleaned. The people that work there are also just somewhat friendly. The only fun part for me was that it was a fast paced environment and i appreciate that. Other than that, its a mess there."
bad,Would not recommend Dollar tree as they pay more in OSHA fines yearly than they pay employees. Employees take no pride in their jobs. Few hours for associates with only minimum wages.
bad,"The Woodburn store was nice cause it's big. There was lot's of choices. On most of there merchandise. "
bad,"this job would be perfect for people that are between the ages 16-18, but unfortunately you have to be 18 to work at dollar tree. the management at my location are excellent, i honestly feel that the managers are overworked and deserve to be paid so much more. if you have bills to pay dont even waste your time with this job, the 8 dollars an hour is absolutely ludicrous. at most you would probably work 3-4 times a week and barely get over 20 hours. they expect you to overwork your self for such a petty pay. being overworked, and treated like a dog by customers is not worth 8 dollars an hour. save yourself the time, and stress and go somewhere else."
bad,The employees are worked to death. Managers live at the store. Hours were short for cashiers and stickers. Managers basically run the store.  I feel bad for managers who work here
bad,Work with good bunch of people. But corporate doesn't pay well. Raises aren't good and it's difficult to get promoted. When you do get promoted it's not much pay and it's a lot of responsibility. You can be demoted if your store as a whole doesn't meet sales goals. Unloading trucks and fast paced stocking is the hardest part. If you cashier then between customers you will need to stock. Management stocks and backs up cashier. On a typical day it's 1 manager and 1 cashier. Good coworkers but a bad manager will really make things hard. Most enjoyable part of the job was when several people worked together good comradery. Corporate just doesn't care much about the employees. Also my Husband died in the same year as my Mother and I only got bereavement pay for one. Who decides you only get paid for one bereavement a year? It's good to not lose your family close together but if you do you should get paid for each.
bad,"My manager admitted that I had exceeded all expectations by implementing a new system that guaranteed a proper rotation of perishable items and incentives for customers to purchase soon-to-be-expired items. I was even offered a management position at a store they would be opening. Yet, I was denied a quarter raise after my probationary period. I was guaranteed a raise, which they didn't offer until I brought it up to them, and in the end they gave me a minimal fee. I was an assistant manager, offered a management position and they refused to even pay me $10.00 an hour yet expected high level and dedicated work?"
bad,"No life balance for managers.  Hourly rate is too low and expect a lot of work.  You can promote very quickly because of the growth, but training depends on a store manager and a lot of times they are not qualified to train.  "
bad,After my manager left for another store we were sent a new manager. Needless to say worst manager ever. I quit on the job because of said manager. In all Dollar Tree is not a place I'll ever work again no matter the pay.
bad,"I enjoy working for Dollar tree, however their Managers, District Managers and communication skills are absolutely horrible. "
bad,They'll take anyone and a lot of people just up and leave. Not a steady amount of people to work with. A lot of strange characters come into the store.
bad,"Typical stocking job but low paying! A lil too low for me! I enjoyed the environment, retail atmosphere is nice but I never got paid to much. Just need more compensation, not the job for me."
bad,the store was a mess there was not to many ours employees did not want to help..management there was no communication...there is always something to do when you have the right help
bad,I would either open the store and stayed until mid-day or come in during the evenings and work until closing. The job was slow-paced and easy. There was a rush always in the afternoons or around lunch.
bad,im only writing this bc i have to. dollar tree isn't the ideal place to work. the pay sucks and my managers were always rude. customers are rude. it sucks to work there.great for someone fresh out of high school still living with mom and dad
bad,"Dependent on the position (cashier, back office, assistant manager, manager, stock, etc.), each day holds different levels of responsibility. Constantly staying on top of the stores appearance, well stocked shelves, rotation of food items per 'best date by' standards, correctly handling sales transactions, constant rotation of stock per season for appropriate presentation."
bad,Don't apply unless there is no other options. They will work you like a dog and you can expect to not be compensated at all. If you are a checker you'll get paid even less and only about 16 hours a week
bad,"Ok for starting a career. Quick pace, energetic, fair pay for hourly associates. Have to multi task for all areas of the store. Family orientated....."
bad,"We only ever had 2-3 people (incl assistant manager) working at any given time excluding Christmas, meaning that everyone has to work ridiculously hard for the store to do well. I got 8-12 hours (2-3 shifts) most weeks, which was much more than most of my co-workers. There was only one week where I got 16 hours (4 shifts). I got paid minimum wage with no way to get raises. Some customers were friendly, but most were rude and a lot didn't speak English, making communicating hard. Also, a large amount of customers and co-workers didn't know how to count money. Overall, I felt overworked, frustrated, underpaid, and underappreciated. I absolutely do not recommend working here."
bad,Very high turnover of mgrs. One employee has been with DT for 6 years with NO pay raises. She has never called in in those 6 years and is great at her job. Dollar Tree does NOT care about their employees at all. Makes mgrs punch out for lunches even though they are constantly interupted lunches.
bad,"I worked at Dollar Tree for two and a half years. The people who come in are nice most of the time, and I can say that I enjoyed conversing with them. While we were short a store manager however, the company sent over another assistant manager from a neighboring town who ended up making situations worse for customers and employees. Most of the staff ended their positions while I was the last employee from the prior manager's time there. Several people were hired back on, including two assistant managers who had history we weren't informed of, which caused us problems later on, but managed to get a new store manager. Later, I come to find out that employees that had been working there for a fraction of the time I had were being paid more than myself, so I asked for a raise. Refusing to give one, I left the company after serving for two and a half years."
bad,"This job was awesome for a short while, but was stressful. It felt like we were always understaffed. Sometimes there would only be two employees in the whole store."
bad,"Do not get paid enough for the job! Only $7.35 an hour, but they expect you to be  a cashier, customer service, stockperson, and custodian. Did it as a summer job before I went to college and have no intentions of going back."
bad,I didn't get as much hours as I wanted. I wanted to work at least 3-4 days a week at most and I asked politely several times. This is what honestly made me quit.
bad,"Had a lot of issues with the DM from time to time. Sometimes the employees would not show up forcing me to work unpaid overtime and they were not very flexible with hours. I once had a whole week canceled because I had called off of a a shift for my finals in college, and I lost a pay check and suffered pretty badly because of that."
bad,I was a cashier for three months and then I got promoted to Assistant manager. I had a excellent relationship with the associates and customers. The job had it's ups/downs just like every other job but I enjoyed the experience that I gave the customers. The hardest part of the job was having to endure the actions of poor management and mistreatment to the associates. The most enjoyable part was the smiles and excitement from the customers whenever they entered/exited the store.
bad,"Horrible regional manager. Didn’t care about an attempted robbery that I had to unfortunately experience. Corporate only cares about the store and money, not the employees. Won’t spend another dollar or cent at the location I worked at."
bad,Was doing freight/stalking shelves. Was there for about a year but no real advancement. Pay was very low so had to seek other employment to make ends meet.
bad,"the management for dollar tree was horrible, the stockroom is always a hastle, to little hours for people what wasn't in good with the managers. the typical day would usually go fast, the breaks are to short u barely have enough times to go to the bathroom, and the bathrooms where never kept completely clean."
bad,In all my years working there I have never seen a company that put inexperienced managers in stores or open new stores without the proper staff on hand.  My store is called on a daily basis to bail out other stores.
bad,"While I enjoy the work at Dollar Tree, I am unable to make a living on minimum wage and only 4-8 hours per week.  The company does not allow their store managers to conduct their own hiring/firing, or set hours for their own employees."
bad,Dollar tree is a disorganized mess. Unloading the truck was often dangerous because of most of the boxes were loose. The inventory room was often cluttered. Delivery schedules were random. The shelves were dirty because they were never cleaned.
bad,It was a college job that i had in order to make extra money while i was going through school. I never had any plans of staying there in the store but it was decent enough.
bad,"Dollar tree manager at the time was AMAZING!! He lead by example and he had trained us so well on fright and cashiers/recovery teams. Once he got relocated, corprate had given us so many other managers who NEVER stayed or werent as motived to the store, so did the stores productivity. Work began to pile up and no one wanted to play catch up. Customers at times were also difficult, I didnt feel safe on multiple occasions and almost had to file a report. Most dollar stores have a bad rep because of the conditons their in because the lack of great management."
bad,I worked there for 2 months. Got fired for a false accusation for sleeping it was my fault I sat down but it was 20 minutes left everything was done. The manager and supervisor had it out for me. Did everything they told me to do. They talked to me crazy and treated my like trash. I got suspended and I called they lied and said my job was secure and fired me 4 days later
bad,"Ive worked for Dollar Tree several times.  They hob was always there for me in case of emergency.  My work there was great and thats why i always got hired there when i needed them.  the pay was the worst ive ever had.  The job it's self was fun, and something new every day.  The management and supervisory positions was forever changing and sometimes we would get a decent supervisor.  It was obvious we were expendable, because of the way they would talk to the employs.  There was no security implemented in the store.  Lots of customers would steal from the store.If you have any felony convictions you could not be promoted, so there was no chance to move up in the company. I liked my co workere,but the turnover rate was new each week, so it was hard to get to know the other employ's."
bad,"It was a great place to work until, and the hours were pretty good, that was until the new manager took over. She was very disrespectful towards me so I quit."
bad,"terriible work place enviorment, very catty and unprofessional coworkers. the whole experience was beyond wild not to mention they wanted a lot when it came to recovery and put backs."
bad,Worked a lot of weekends than the law allowed.  No time to spend with family and no time  to take care of your on business. Never get all of your days off. Not veteran friendly and forget about Martin Luther king day off and forget Veterans being important!!!!
bad,"Dollar tree had poor management, it was a very unprofeesioal place to work and i wasnt comfortable working there. My paycheck was missing hours and I was notified at the last minute to report to work."
bad,"I'm not saying this was a bad place at all, the exact place that I worked at had a very poor manager, the assistant managers were better then the actual manger. The manager was very unperfessional."
bad,They weren't very busy. Got really rude when it came to five to ten minutes after closing with customers still in the store. Had a rude boss that only yelled at me even if I was already cleaning or stocking shelves.
bad,Although this job would be good as a second job for some extra money and you can work at your own pace in a relaxed environment but the pay rate is so low that nobody can survive on basic living expenses.
bad,People who work at the Dollar Tree Store has full of enjoyment as a team member. Everybody help each other if any help be needed. Depends how your manager is in the workplace.
bad,"Good for a first job or for a few bucks extra."
bad,Dollar Tree was never consistent with hours and the customers are rude. The management is fine but it seems like some managers just don't care. We have a lot of workers but some never get any work time.
bad,I did not like working there. I only got 20 hours a week. No over time is offered. We was so busy but they only have one person waiting on customers. They did not offer a raise.just could not make it
bad,"I honestly cannot recommend Dollar Tree to anyone, not in High School or working their way through college. The pay does not equal the workload and it can be years before you even hear of anything resembling a raise. management only receives a dollar more than regular employees now that may seem like a vast difference to some however when you see the vast difference in workload you realize it is not worth it."
bad,i didnt like working there never gave me enough hours and the place was always dirty the customers were very rude and they would come and steal and the manager wasn't really fair to be honest
bad,This place was ok to work at. The manager was terrible and should never have been or in a management position. Didn't know how to professionally talk to the employees! The job environment was ok.
bad,"I began working for dollar tree to get some money saved up before I headed back to school, unfortunately it resulted in being one of my worse jobs. It was a steady amount of work but a depressing work enviornment with a constant air of uncertainty and disorganization."
bad,"This place was so rude for the 2 year I was there I constantly had to do Mangers stuff (I am not one) people never showed up and still they got hours and we had to call other people to come in and work for them. The back room is so unclean, and unorganized. The Managers play favorites, they don't like you will always be on truck, and all they do is set in the office doing (work). People constantly get in trouble for things they shouldn't have-like stuff in the walk way, phones, food. Or just not showing up, leaving early, or disappearing into the back. They do not take complaints by the customer or the workers surely. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!"
bad,"It could have been a great company but RM let things get too bad and didnt seem to care about what should be important, which is good customer service and in stocks. It almost seemed as though he was working against a store rather than with a store. It killed me, then shortly after my store manager."
bad,"management is overworked and underpaid, stores arent allotted enough hours to work enough staff to keep the store clean and consistent, many employees are forced to have multiple jobs to make ends meet, a real ""character building"" type of job, would not recommend except as a last resort"
bad,"Limited hours, low pay, I learned that if the manager scheduled an employee for more than 18 hours weekly, the manager would be called by her boss and questioned about it."
bad,"It was a good place to work but , the specific store I worked in was very unorganized with there truck orders .... So they had over stock for days kept busy but extremely boring"
bad,Didnt really enjoy working their. Wasnt uplifting or a positive environment . Made the best out of it by interacting with customers and co workers. But it was a job none the less
bad,"Management don't know what they are doing."
bad,"A Typical day at work is making sure the stock is out and store is clean, make sure the scheduled cashier is coming to work, never enough good cashiers. Safety for customers. Management well someday good someday never enough.Management is always stressed out about something. The hardest part of the job is standing and walking always on your feet, bending, twisting. If you plan to do this job make sure your body is in great shape, you will go home tired. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting, meeting and assisting the customer."
bad,terrible pay poorly hiring of management cannot get on first shift it will take 20 years to get that shift. not sure of hiring process for managers. but its not very good
bad,They are very polite with all customers and they know how to start a friendly conversation with anyone. They work well with any kind of call outside and they work very well when it comes to having pregnant women working there.
bad,Dollar tree is a great company but at store level is where the company suffers. Locations in urban areas where high numbers of EBT customers live brings the stores down. High theft and problematic customers make it difficult to run a successful store.
bad,"The people are great to work with, lack of hours are what I don’t like about this place of employment. Was promised hours when I took the job and I’m only work 8 hours a week getting paid no weekly 8$ an hour."
bad,"This job is only good for those who want their first job to be simple and easy. The tasks aren't too hard but certain days it gets more difficult with little help due to low staff members. But overall, both co-workers and customers are friendly and you can reason with the manager about what days you're able to work, especially if you're a student."
bad,management is ok. don't really see much enjoyable about the job. culture is ok. I learned that this company is all about speed and low hrs. hardest part of the job is not much is certain. a lot of inconsistency on truck days with delivery.
bad,"Dollar Tree is a good company to begin in the retail industry to practice time management and customer service. Staff is often sparse and hardly vetted (at my location) and management was disinterested in running business due to inter-company disputes. Little to no mobility, just relocation accommodations. Sub-par working environment and turnover is high."
bad,It is inside not the greatest pay but never lacking in work to do.  Fast paced set hours and chances of the company ever leaving are slim.  Like most jobs in this area you won't get rich but you can live good
bad,They try to push you beyond measure due to their lack of organization. The long 10 hour days are brutal in the building conditions. The place is a mess. The trucks on the dock are always dusty and dirty. Prone to get ill working here
bad,"The company is cheap but even cheaper when it comes to the people who make and running these stores. Dealing with customers every, and the fact that employees don't even get a discount is just unfair. So what if everything in the store is a dollar. You can't live off a dollar tree salary alone. You have no choice but to get a second job."
bad,"Working at Dollar Tree comes with great managers, and great co-workers. However, the work is overly stressful because you get almost no hours, and wages are minimum wage for whatever state your in ($7.35 an hour in Utah). There are no full-time positions unless you're corporate or upper management. There is no time off. No benefits, and almost no chance of advancing unless the guys above you quit in rapid succession."
bad,"responsibilities were to keep store fully stocked. Often times with a shortage of staff to fully get the job done effectively. Most of the time, upper management wouldn't be on the same accord."
bad,"My district had poor district managers overall. store managers were expected to do the work of 3 people but the pay was always sub-par. felt like i was killing myself and almost threw my back out. worked 2 months straight without a single day off. district manager got on my case when i asked for a day. too little hours for freight due to a weird payroll system. little to no training no matter the position. sink or swim. no room for a social life at management level. few/poor benefits. people you work with are the best part of the place. only reason i stayed as long as i did was out of loyalty to my coworkers. really only good for part time, but dont expect much more then minimum wage."
bad,While working for this company I learned the hard way that this company sees you as nothing but a number. I have never worked for a place that treat their employees the way they do and get away with it.
bad,"Great learning experience, was with the company from their first day in Seminole. The only reason I left this job was for better employment opportunities and because I didn't work for 2 weeks."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and interacting with them. "
bad,"I enjoyed my experience as a cashier and assistant manager trainee. I was able to engage with customers, help assist with their shopping needs and create a great shopping experience."
bad,"Unless a really dedicated SM works 10-12hrs a day instead of  8 since theyre the only ones getting paid salary, everyone else gets wayyyyyy overworked"
bad,company offers good benefits and offers overtime. How ever promises of advancement are never kept. there is no room for growth and the management is poor. Learned how to manage pallet yard and bettered my skills as a fork lift operator. the work culture is very unprofessional.
bad,"As a cashier you had a set role every day you went to work for your 4 hours shift. You counted your till in the back, brought it to the check out and stand at checkout for 3 hours before your unpaid 15 minute break. Then after closing your bring your till to the back, count how much you made, deposit it into the safe and assist the closing supervisor with what needed to be done before you left and repeated. Management has since been replaced but the store appears to still be in a messy state."
bad,Dollar Tree doesn't care who works hard and who doesn't. The ones that work the hardest never get rewarded. store leaders usually take credit for all the work that is done by others.
bad,Ok place to work. Good benefits. Teammates are good to work with. I've built my resume working here. Hourly associates have their insurance paid for by the company
bad,"The management was good, but often managers were late to shift in the morning causing worker to be late even if the worker was there on time. Good place for highschool job, but definitely not a career."
bad,"When I began to work at the Dollar Tree, I averaged 25 hours a week with a check of 350 every two weeks. But then they began seasonal hiring and not only were my hours cut, but I never got them back. My schedule was very inconsistent and I started beginning to accept whatever hours they could give me. The store is always in bad shape and the customers make it no better for you."
bad,dollar tree was just a part time gig for me. i was very fortunate to move up quickly and become the asst manager of the store. it was a great learning curve for me.
bad,"Great company to work for,can be somewhat adventurous at times.very fast paced,  great product turnover..named brand products. .And EVERYTHING IS $1,00or less"
bad,Nice bosses and coworks. Not enough hours. There are rats. Need be nicer when someone doesn't meet stock counts the are doing the best they can. And need schedule before Friday or saturday for the week
bad,"slow"
bad,"The people are great, I enjoyed working with the people there but the job itself is not worth it. As a stocker you don't make enough money to support yourself."
bad,Corporate company with employees who have a no-grow personality and mentality. It isn't the best fit for me because I am looking to grow and develop myself as well as the company.
bad,I think it's a good place for young teens to work that's in High School or in the college. They can use more hours a little better management. More respect more better pay better pay where the family couldn't afford to take care of their family with it it can be more money.
bad,I need a good paying job that always appreciate my hard work. I love to work I love working with people. I have great customer service .I'm a leader.I work hard to raise 3 kids .  I just want to find a good career and be successful at what I do.
bad,It was easy and difficult at the same time. I did not receive proper time to work consistently when I was being trained so I could get faster at my job. I continued to be slow because I was not properly trained when I did work there.
bad,"Assistant managers are basically glorified stockers. Cashiers handle the transactions, managers receive shipment and are required to put everything on the floor ASAP. If product doesn't fit, find a new home for it. In addition, managers also run daily store operations and cash handling."
bad,"A type day at the dollar tree was very slow pace, management could have done a lot better handling customer care. The job its self was not hard at all."
bad,Sometimes didn't get a lunch. Messy customers would leave items that they weren't going to be purchase everywhere. A lot of customers would damage/open merchandise. Parents let their kids run around the store like if it was a playground. All employees got along like friends.
bad,There is very little support from corporate when it comes to payroll. As the store manager the only way you will keep your store from completely becoming a disaster store is if you are able and willing to put in 50 hours per week minimum.
bad,"Unorganized, messy, rude customers, too much work, little hours, only part time, rude coworkers, not enough pay, not enough hours, the stockers mess around to much"
bad,"In Virginia, the starting pay is $7.25. Who can survive off of that? If you stay in a store long enough with the same group of characters, you can start to feel like a family... But the bologna you deal with from District managers.. FOR THE PAY? This company is awful... And you get 11 minute breaks."
bad,"Typical day started with a morning meeting , then job assignments then went to respective mods, labeled and picked 400 boxes a hour untill the end of our shift"
bad,dollar tree was ok  friendly people low pay not much thinking virtually no decisions to make vey monotone this is a job for someone who does not have work experince
bad,My experience at Dollar Tree was horrible. The manager never scheduled my hours right and always scheduled me for the mornings when I had school. The other Cashiers were nice just never did their job.
bad,every one came to work looking mad no one was happy there ever one never did there job  right every one was lazy they were sloppy they never were organized
bad,"It was okay working here, the fact that we were required to ""push"" the sale of certain items did not appeal to me, as most customers complained they were not interested.  Repeat customers threatened to stop coming if they were asked to buy more ""junk""."
bad,This location has some of the worst managers for the area its located. The reviews on yelp are even terrible for the manager. I will never go backhere
bad,"Typically slow mostly restocking and organizing/cleaning entire store. Blowing up balloons for customers writing down numbers for missing orders, and keeping the work area free of trash."
bad,When working at Dollar General I learned one skill which was to stock quicker the reason I didn't learn much was because the manager wasn't very concerned about her employees. The manager sat in the office on the phone talking to her fiance for most of her time on the clock. I did enjoy the other employees that had worked there also greeting and meeting new customers!
bad,This position is very steady and fast paced environment. You have to be able to lift heavy boxes and supplies. Customer service is very important to this company. The company doesn't pay very well for the labor employees deal with on a day to day basis.
bad,"Fun and productive workplace, I started at 4am and stock shelves till 12pm. I only got paid 7 a hour so it wasnt the job for me"
bad,"Corporate has the right idea and a good training model, however the people on the lower levels do not properly execute Dollar Tree Policy's and procedures. "
bad,"You can have good day and you can have bad with with your manager or customers "
bad,"only worked there for three weeks due to difficulty with reading the schedule causing me to miss too many days. The schedule was not set up in an easily legible way. When I would ask for help from my manager, she would refuse to help, and just watch me struggle or walk away. The customers were more helpful than my manager. Other than that, I quite enjoyed it, as it was not difficult work. While there were no customers waiting to pay, I would be organising shelves, sweeping, returning items to proper section, etc."
bad,long hours a lot of working from open to close no family life short staff  early to rise late to bed. very high expectation almost in realistic.
bad,"I was a sales manager there, started in stock and was promoted after 2 weeks. When I was there the pay wasn't bad the work was okay. in the year I was there there were 5 store managers the first one was there for 6 months. the next 3 were either lazy or didn't know what they were doing. My crew was awesome, in fact 3 walked out and quit the day I was let go. After the first manager left the next few treated the crew very poorly, and disrespectfully."
bad,"No work life balance at all........"
bad,"During my time there, the management was good  with the exception of one very bad apple.  New management is great.  "
bad,"Running around like crazy, putting out as much freight as possible. Hiring and developing people is a plus for me. Managing the payroll given was the most difficult. Learned a lot of useful managment skills and how to deal with difficult customers as well as employees.  Every holiday presented a new challenge to overcome. Definitely never a dull moment at DollarTree."
bad,"managers are glorified stockers and cashiers."
bad,"Dead end job with low pay, and no incentive. Can get very physical and understaffed at times. a step stone job, or a second part time job would be acceptable."
bad,"Shifts are okay, try to call for back up to get help cashing people out, and co workers leave you with 30+ people in your line when they're supposed to be helping cash people out. Then Try to go put away return/unwanted items and co workers decide their gonna go on break and leave cash register lines empty with customers standing there."
bad,It was not bad till customers stealing and taking things out of package and put it on the shelf it is a good envioment I liked the Co workers it was good experience
bad,"openingn store bring up cash registar. verify safe. review emails. customer service allday. Merchasing product for the sale floor. house keeping for the safety of the customer. Store order, bank deposits made daily. Training on going."
bad,"My personal experience: The entire time I worked at this store, I felt as if I were alone. The managers were very rude, and often spoke (loudly) behind my back about me and other employees. The store was also severely understaffed. I was often given too many responsibilities, and as a result, felt inadequate as an employee when I could not complete them all. I also did not have all of the necessary equipment to do my job. Most of the time, the store did not have plastic bags for the customer's purchases. A lot of the time, we did not have the necessary coins to give customers their change. Working at this store has been a very negative and stressful experience."
bad,"Only good thing about working there, was my boss and that's about all I can say about that company. moving up not a chance for that."
bad,"My day started various ways depending on what shift I worked."
bad,This is the place to get work history and nothing more. DT did not believe in regulating the air conditioning. The work conditions were horrible.
bad,"I have worked here for almost a year and it was great at first, you would get all of your hours and they offered overtime but, the longer I stayed there the more hours I wasn't getting and the less work they had for us. They would tell us that they were going to be picking up soon and that we would have our hours and they would hire a bunch of people but then turn around and say they had no work for us and send a lot of people home. I was constantly asking to be trained on equipment and they would keep giving excuses as to why they couldn't when they had plenty of people to cover areas so the trainer could train people. The supervisors showed a lot of favoritism to certain employees and to me that isn't being professional. I definitely don't recommend this place if you have a family to support. Its a great job for single people that only have themselves to worry about. A lot of people I worked with had second jobs just to be able to pay the bills at home."
bad,"i like working here PARK TIME i unload the truck and stock, its a great job, need something with more work more hours. and a opportunity to grow withing the company"
bad,"Depending on what they have you scheduled depends on how your day goes. If it's cashiering, it's not super hectic (all the time). But you have to be at your register, do small tasks, as well as recover the front of the store. Not everyone is able to do this. If it's recovery, then it can be a bit stressful (depending on the cashier), you walk the isles making everything perfect again, while picking up things that don't belong. Also paying attention to customers, helping them when in need. You also kind of have to pay attention to the line. Some cashiers can handle a busy day, others need the help. If the line backs up, you stop where you are to open your register. It's simple but fast paced work. Once in a while there will be a project assigned for you to do, typically a display, weather its take it down, or re-set (take down and put up), or even just finishing what someone else couldn't in their shifts. I don't think the pay is fair, they want you to work like you're making 10-12 dollars and hour but, something is better than nothing. Management is really great, with one exception. Most of them are awesome to work with, some can be a little bit demeaning or, belittling. Getting along with the other co-workers isn't hard at all. Almost everyone is on top of their A game, and things get done at a good pace most nights!"
bad,Over the past year the company went downhill when they merged with Family Dollar. Job expectations are hard to meet with the amount of hours allotted.
bad,"fun workplace with good management"
bad,This job was incredibly easy.  It was just running a cash register and having people skills.  I also stocked shelves.  I had almost no responsibilities and 12 hours a week.  Opportunities for advancement were nill and the company regulations were demeaning.  That was the hardest part for me.  The most enjoyable part was having access to inexpensive office supplies and seasonal decorations and candy.
bad,"Job is very tress full, have no personal life due to long hours of working. Pressure to meet dead lines that some times is  un reachable, also never have enough payroll...etc.."
bad,I've learned that management and quality determined how well your business will do. If your management is performing adequately enough then the entire establishment suffers.
bad,The store was very unorganized. was hard to keep employees that would work and come in on time. I was always having to stay late and come in from time with family cause people were hired that were not reliable
bad,"The hardest part of this job was that it was a fast-paced environment. Horrible pay, along with poor management. I would not recommend working at Dollar Tree if you are a full time student."
bad,"I was there for about 3 weeks. Then one day I get told by another employee that I was let go, without a word from the manager or an explanation of any kind, other than a comment about how another coworker allegedly said I didn't like my job, and this allegedly lead to the manager writing me off the schedule and letting me find out in a rather unconventional fashion. This is the God's honest truth. I hope they have figured out their issues and are operating a better facility now."
bad,"The office physical space is 3 stories of gray cubicles. Many of the directors and managers won't let their direct reports make decisions and there are many layers of decision makers for each project. Change happens daily on projects, project teams and personnel. In addition, since they are a dollar retailer, they work very lean and you will be on small departmental  teams working multiple projects.  If you are adaptable to lots of change, can maneuver well in political organizations then you will do well here. Management isn't trained in giving constructive feedback or in giving clear direction a lot of times. However,the pay is pretty good and the benefits can be good depending on your position."
bad,High turnover in many departments.  Not much room for advancement in IT.  There seems to be a large disconnect between employee's and upper management.  You have to be self motivated to learn what you can on your own and just move on.  The best part of the job is leaving it.  The benefits package for hourly employee's is pretty good though if you are full time.
bad,"A typical work day consists of helping customers, handling their purchases and payment. It consists of cleaning up the store and making sure it is stocked and ready for the next day. At the end of the day I would handle the final deposit and all paperwork that went with it. "
bad,"Pay is at minimum wage. Very boring job, and doesn't consist of much work. Manager was great and very positive. If your looking for something simple this is a great job for you!"
bad,"This company has so much drama. People working for the company are paid poorly, demanded to do more than what should be done as per how they're paid. Management is very poor. They talk about people behind their backs, don't follow company policy, and try to hide secrets that could have them fired."
bad,"Long Day of Stocking"
bad,There are a lot of customers and rude ones to. The store is too small for numerous customers going in the store whole people are stocking because the aisles are too narrow.
bad,"During my time here I found that my co-workers were fairly easy to get along with every one came together to get the task at hand done and the environment was for the most part  was fairly relaxed yet controlled. My only problem was with the management, on multiple occasions I've had to deal with work scheduling issues as well as receiving my pay during the proper pay periods , cant say that I would ever chose to work here again."
bad,"As assistant manager,  I would prioritize and delegate daily tasks to the employees."
bad,"a typical would be to go into Dollar Tree and set up my register, stock shelves, or both depening on the tasks and crew needed for the day"
bad,Management does have any leadership skills and dont know how to to talk to employees
bad,My true review I'm looking for a maintenance or janitorial position these were not even close so not really satisfying but I like to work and had bills so work was done.
bad,"A typical day at work is coming into the workplace going to the back to get ready for the day, I mostly stocked shelves I also cleaned the store, filled helium balloons, and provided customer service. the downsides of working at Dollar Tree was that the people and management wasn't good. the hardest part of the job was solving problems but I overcame that. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and satisfying the needs of the customer."
bad,"This is a great company to teach a child how to conduct him/herself in the workplace, but this is not a company for an adult trying to survive or support a family. They only hire part time and pt is only at the most 20 hours per week on minimum wage."
bad,"I enjoyed the customer service aspect of this job and making sure the store ran smoothly. My employees were top notch, and had no trouble following instructions."
bad,Great management team.  Wonderful associates to work with.
bad,"A typical day at work as a member of management differs for everyone. Some get by doing the bare minumum and its considered ok. While others like myself were expected to pick up the slack as well as maintain an exceeding effort at my own duties. Now I personally loved it because I can walk away saying there is no job in the store that i couldnt do exceedingly well. I am very self driven and a heavy workload does not scare me. But caution for others who dont believe in making the same wage as someone who doesnt care about thier job or doing it well. "
bad,"A typical day at work stayed fairly busy, but the theft rate was outstanding there. This job is where the foundation of my work ethic in the career industry began. The management there was inconsistent. The general manager had favorites and it showed, but the rest of the management team was very inconsistent as well and they did not work well with a full time student's college schedule without them paying for it in the long run. The co-workers were very inconsistent there, but the one's that did stick around were not very welcoming or a pleasure to work with. It was just a job they had to do! There was no real hard part of the job other than the theft factor in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were actually acknowledged for the hard work you did."
bad,Dollar Tree was in the process of obtaining and running frozen food sections. They were not good at it at first but became proficient very quickly.
bad,"it is a great place to gain experience with warehouse work in gerneral but the way dollar distribution center in chesapeake,va runs its warehouse is embarrassing and mismanaged.the benefits are great but to work and feel like your not being valued and rewarded for your efforts everyday is a low point.they sell you a dollar and a dream in interviews and orientation but they dont tell you that you are being looked at as just a laborer instead of a valued asset to the company.very drama filled enviorment and wouldnt recommend this job to anybody!!!! f.y.i i was there for 3 yrs and started at 9.80 n left making only 10.35 because throughout the yr they constantly look for reasons for write ups just so they wouldnt have to pay you when it comes to your annual pay raise...."
bad,i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. They sell you a dream during interviews and orientation but treat you like a laborer instead of an asset to the company!!!
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be throwing freight, stocking shelves ans assisting customers which i loved, It also included managing my employees on where and when to stock. The hardest part of the job was working without a store manager, 14 hours days are rough."
bad,i realy liked working for dollar tree alot of nice people and i learned alot
bad,"Start the day out with setting up the cash registers for associates and myself. Check the produtivity charts for everyone working that day on what their job duties are for the day. Set them up with what needs to be done. Then I have to check emails and then start my day off with the duties that I was given for the day. When busy be back up cashier while processing freight or creating displays of promotional items. I learned so much at this company on how to mange the store and the associates, how to process and recieve freight, and how to merchandise. The management team always changes, either in a good way or a bad way, but I learned how other mangers did their jobs in different ways. My co workers really enjoyed working with me because I was always there to help them if they ever needed some help in a department or the front. they came to me for problems and I was there to fix them or make them better. The hardest part about the job was the lack of communication with the other managers, especially with consistant changes of management and the lack of hours that was given each week. The most enjoyable part of the job was the doing the freight and working with the freight team."
bad,"was fun to work as part time, recommend to anyone needing a part-time job in high school"
bad,I wasn't there long enough to have anything positive to say about this job.
bad,"Work on the register and re-shop the merchandise, interact with customers, engage in small conversation but still professional with customers, load drink machine, blow-up ballons for buying customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is engaging in conversation with customers because I'm a people person and I get along well with my fellow co-workers. The hardest part of my job is when the previous shift didn't have time to finish their work it creates an unorganized work station and I like my work station to be clean and tighty so I would have to clean before I start working."
bad,"A typical work day would vary depending on the shift. If I had to work the early morning shift (5-10am) it would consist of just trying to get as much product on the shelves as possible. If it was a morning shift (8am-1pm) it would consist of getting the store ready for opening, cleaning the bathrooms, making sure the registers were neat and tidy, making sure the balloon rack was full, mid day shifts just consisted of making sure customers were being helped where that means helping them find products or ringing them up at the registers, and the night shift would consist of helping the few customers left then cleaning up the store and helping the managers close. My co-workers were ok some i could count on if i couldnt make it in for a shift others i just knew they wouldnt help me even if it was to just move a box but there was no tension between anyone. the hardest part of that job would have to be waking up at 4:30 am to get in by 5 for the morning shift but i managed to do it every time. Management was also hit and miss there were some mangagers that i could get along with and be able to talk to if i needed anything others i just wanted to do my work and get it done with so i could get out of there. but most jobs always have that one manager thats a tough one to deal with."
bad,"On a typical day at work, I basically work a five hour shift, checking out customers. With this job, I have learned how to suggestive sell better."
bad,There is little room for advancement here. They dont have benefits.
bad,"Corp.'s expectations for such a low wage is horrendous! but once you establish your 'inner family' with your coworkers its a fun place to work. aside from that once you have 'climbed the ladder' quickly (and they refuse to pay you any benefits for another 6 months after that), they will train you for 1 week of your '4 week training' and throw you to the wolves, then try to find whatever reason they can to fire you!"
bad,Working at dollar tree it’s no easy you have deal with the staff and customers which not always will appreciate that you’re giving your all. And not only that they will make do to work that it’s not your to handle.
bad,The store is only as good as the manager.  Employee work ethic and attendance depends on their attention.  Upholding company standards and rules promotes a better work environment and successful store.  I have worked with good and bad managers in eight years.   It can be a happy and simple place to work if the manager is doing their part.
bad,Very busy retail store; always short-handed; shifts are only 4 hours each; hard to make customers happy with not enough staff; pay is poor; a lot of management turnover.
bad,We have a large turn over of employees.  I’ve not been the happiest with my store lately.  I’m in the process now of going to college and looking for another job.  I’m only there one day a week.
bad,"Only work there because I need the money. The people who work there are very friendly. Half off damaged stuff. Payed breaks. 10 minute break, HAVE to buy before eating, bathrooms DO. NOT. WORK., work all holidays except Christmas."
bad,Dollar tree pays managers very low wages and has a big turn over rate I wouldn’t recommend working here.My store manager doesn’t care about her job so it makes it hard to enforce rules set out by dollar tree.High shrinkage because customers steal a lot it’s just hard .
bad,"A typical work day is slow, not a lot of people roam through these stores. Management is reliable, and try to help you succeed. The hardest part would have to be, that there are hardly any sales being made. The best part is the schedule is pretty flexible."
bad,"Management doesn't follow through with promises made. Dollartree doesn't care about solving problems within the company, apparently you can cost the company money in food and throw fits in front of Customers and employees and talk badly about others and still keep your job and position as Assistant Manager."
bad,What they were asking for during the holidays or what they expect and the freedom to think outside the box is not in Dollar Tree. They let you think you have a say but when you try to work outside of the box it’s wring when you do something right they find 50 other things to pick a part. No freedom in the company and expect a lot from staff during holidays and they do not get it.
bad,"They lure you in with good pay, then they insist you work 50-60 hours per week. The GM of the Cowpens location isn't that great with people; however, if you're a Clemson fan then you'll kinda fit in (I am not a Clemson fan). "
bad,Its definitely not a place to stay.  They say they like to promote with in but there is alot of out sourcing on that even if they say there isnt. It is easy to move to management but not much more then that
bad,The pay is not that great for all the things that you have to do for Dollar Tree & the business does not seem to care much for their workers. You can be one of the best workers and/or managers & it won’t matter because you aren’t treated fairly at Dollar Tree. The stockroom can be very small but still the store truck will be very big. You have to do many things for other people who aren’t doing their job & it’s exaughsting especially since you aren’t getting payed much.
bad,If I  had to work at dollartree I would but it would be my last choice  it can be a very friendly place to work or be a nightmare  I had some very great times and some very bad
bad,"My Dollar Tree experience has been overall good. I have met and worked with some good people, however as far as the working for the corporation of Dollar Tree the upper level management expects too much from the employees for the pay rate, both for the associates and the managers."
bad,"My days consisted of me coming in, clocking in and getting the register set.  When I had a customer, I would ring them out.  When the store was slow and lacked customers, I would either be cleaning or I would be stocked products.  The hours went by fats but when the store was slow, everything slowed down."
bad,No benefits. Fast pace helps the shifts fly by. Not enough workers to get everything done. Low hours for everyone except management. My manager was a very amazing manager who had to leave our store for a new store and now we are kind of in shambles trying to figure out our new flow. We will get there but need more hours and better people.
bad,"I started at the Dollar Tree as one of my first jobs. For a first job I guess you could say it's okay, but besides that not really. They give you hardly any hours start you at minimum wage, never kept it staffed as needed, or stocked enough to really work. The worst part was when I really needed certain days of the week off I told them about it ahead of time. I told them my schedule needed to change and I needed to get help/tutoring. They didn't listen, would refuse to work with me, and continued to work me the days I needed off. I valued my diploma more than a tiny paycheck so I quit and got the help I needed"
bad,Dollar tree is a great place to shop especially for parties and crafting. It's a good place for a second job but I wish they could pay a little more. 😔
bad,"My review at this job is horrible,  because there is poor management in the work place, coworkers talking about one another. Only worked 3 to 4 days a week when I had to be working 5 to 6 days a week 25 hrs. I only had 20 hrs on my check if not less. Just a poor place to work."
bad,My location is one of the busiest but they will only allow you to work 5 hours a day so you don't take a lunch. You are allowed one 10 minute break.  Management does not like voids so if a customer changes their mind on a product or a product scans twice you cant void that product; you must find a similar product not to scan. Any voids over 4 is a write up. Minimum wage for everyone so I suggest this be a job out of H.S. to start building a resume. You wish for it to be busy because time drags without background music. Wear flats because you stand the whole time.
bad,Loved the job hated the money.   The scheduling only allowed for 15-20 hours per week.  The staff was undependable as you woould expect for minimum wage.
bad,If it wasn’t for me this place would’ve been a wreck. I. Was asst. manager and only made .50 more then a newly hired cashier. No room for advancement after asst. manager
bad,its a fast learning job when it comes to being a stocker but cashier you have too learn a lot an be on point as well as a mangers runs the store. breaks are short unless you go over six hours you get a lunch for 30 min.
bad,The people there were really nice and the manager was funny and the tought me a lot of skills that i can use now to help me the superviser would tell me were things should go at night the job was very easy
bad,the Dollar Tree is a very fast passed place to work good for people who enjoy being on there feet and doing costumer service with flexible hours and a friendly work environment
bad,"lots of moving product to re shop back to it right spot on shelf. that slow you down from get your area stock. All the day crew don't do there part to help the night crew. Can't trust nobody and lots of high school bulls+it. Hardest part o the job is getting your box count,but when you got to clean the day crew mess. the box count doesn't all meet the quoted."
bad,this is an equal opportunity company which is nice for those looking to get back on their feet. The 3 or 4 day schedule option is great and the free medical is even better.
bad,Lots of hours. low pay. Expected too much. Lack of communication with everyone. Not enough employees to get daily must do things done. Very unorganized store.
bad,I didn't like working in receiving..it wasn't the kind of work that I was expecting. I asked if they could put me somewhere else because it was to hard on me and they seemed to ignore it so I left.
bad,I enjoyed working here it was my part-time i worked elsewhere for my regular job. I had lots of fun. Stressful at times they expect too much with the little time you have to stock amd if you dont do it all you get written up but there is favoritism here. I witnessed a guy being $80 short and this was the third time they just let him go to an atm and pull the money if it would of been someone else they would off got fired. If you'll be working here don't take big jackets or purses they treat you like a thief they pat you down to make sure you're not taking anything. Why would you lol its just a dollar
bad,"Minimum wage is the standard, a dollar more is offered for managers.  The responsibilities for managers is unreasonably high though, and this is not a job that can hope to support even a single person.  At the corporate level, there is no communication made to the upper level management down to lower levels, therefore the rules/regulations made at the top are not comprehensive to the problems and difficulties that arise -- in essence, corporate looks at numbers and makes decisions that do not reasonably reflect or relate the solutions needed to maintain individual stores or employees.  There is high turnover, negligence, lack of communication, and problems arise chronically, such as stock rooms overflowing with merchandise that managers do not order because somewhere in the logistical chain, an order is fulfilled based on a command that neglects to reasonably comply with the individual store's actual need."
bad,"Fast paced work, managers not really reliable in doing what they say they just want you to get the work done, the pay is good but required overtime is constant you will rarely if ever work a 40 hr week."
bad,"Dishonesty from certain managers to employees."
bad,"Not enough pay for the amount or quality of work they want from us, especially on truck unloading days, but I liked my coworkers and the stocking manager was awesome."
bad,"i starrted this job its been two weeks and i still dont have a work schedule, didnt reqally learn much they had me fix toy section and take a 10 minute break and havent given me a new schedule yet"
bad,Hours change on a dime. Employees hardly show up. Not much help on truck days.  Unsafe work environment.  Would go back to previous store if it were possible.
bad,"typical day at work is that i'm in the cashier and whenever theirs no costumer in the counter ill restock store stuff, greet costumers and put air in the balloons."
bad,"I was head cashier, I came in at noon to 530  worked some open shifts. I keep great costumer service with people. was always there and would come in on call. if someone did not show up they could count on me. I was good with money never too short or to over. I was one of the faster cashiers with getting the ideam's rang up. Bagged and money collected. I was a rehire. I started the year before worked  just for the season. went back the start of the next year. I worked there for a couple years. Decided to go to go to collage .  the hardest part of the job standing on my feet . The most enjoyable I got to meet a lot of people. They come in all the time. I am good with people."
bad,"Overall, Dollar tree is fun and comfortable place to work; I have friendly managers who are very understanding and helpful and coworkers who help keep the store going good but the pay is low and we receive no benefits. We all work very hard to earn our money but in the end it seems we aren't getting the amount we deserve for as hard as we work to keep the store running."
bad,DollarTree's management and upper management really only care about sales and that's it. They really do not care about the employees at all. We get paid not a lot at all. Our store got broken into a few months ago and they still have not fixed our door. We have a broken sink and another broken door. We are way understaffed and haven't had a store manager in months due to circumstances so hiring is really big pain.
bad,If you just need a job or are young starting out then sure go for it.. However this isnt a long term job for anyone with real career aspirations. you are worked hard for minimum wage.
bad,"The customers were easily the best part of this job. A lot of locals with low incomes did their grocery shopping at our store, so a lot of familiar, friendly faces came in all the time. I only wish they paid a livable wage or i would have never left possibly"
bad,"Every day at Dollar Tree slowly drove me insane. The company has little to no care for its employees. They expect managers to drive a sales team by giving employees 10 hours a week. All of the work load is left to the managers, because it's impossible to expect our employees to push themselves. The work load is outrageous, and it is impossible to keep up without working off the clock. At one point all other managers left, and I was left to run the store on my own for over two months. Upper management offered little to no help, and when new help came, I was overlooked for the Store Manager position. They gave it to the new guy who had no management experience, and had only been with the company for a couple months. The company has decent benefits for its full-time employees, but most people who have worked for this company will tell you that it isn't worth the pocket change."
bad,The manager was always helpful.  Only worked as cashier.  Never got a feel for the store layout.  Fast paced work environment.  Felt like working at a bank on Saturday with customers constantly wanting change.
bad,"I believe that everyone in Dollar Tree is a good workers. The issues I have with them is management, because the manager haves favorites and treated everyone else bad. I just want work somewhere I don't have to look over my shoulders and wonder if I am actually a hard worker. I am not very comfortable where I am at, I want a job that I spent two of college for and that is Sports Management."
bad,"Very stressful , disorganized , very low hours , this job cannot be a primary job for no one because people work 8 hours or less every week not enough to pay a bill"
bad,Typical day working at Dollar Tree. Overall the employees were very professional. They treated me with great care. I did not like how my supervisor use to call out on major holidays so that he could spend more time with his children.
bad,"A typical day at work is standing behind the registers for 4-6 hours completing customers' purchases. Sitting down is rare. The managers at my store are cool, calm, and funny. They work hard and try to make sure the rest of the team has what they need and do their jobs. The clientele is impatient and cocky 60% of the time, but there are some nice friendly faces that shop frequently. Most of the time, the workplace culture is fair without arguments or rudeness. The store itself is a small one and very crowded on the inside. There seems to be too many boxes in the back and few people and time to put out the merchandise. This often causes new items in boxes to make their way out into the store aisle which blocks pathways. Yet, the shelves struggle to stay full. I feel it is important to mention that cleanliness is not a feature of this store. One register is hardly used  because damaged items and go-backs are piled on top of it and behind it. There are mice that reside in the back and sometimes make their way to the front of the store. Thank goodness not many customers notice. The most challenging part of my job is standing in one place for most of my shift. What I enjoy the most about my job is stocking/decorating, if and when I get chances to do it since I get to move around."
bad,It was not the type of place you want to stay at. The job should be only temporary at best. Working conditions for me were terrible. Too hot in the summer for the fast environment and too cold in the winter due to the lack of the company wanting to use all the heaters to keep you from freezing while working on the dock. Only two out of four or five were ever on
bad,Hurt myself at work and made to feel bad about it restricted duty place one the heaviest locations to work after a knee injury. I worked there for 3 1/2 weeks straight
bad,They Make Do Too Many Different Things At Once And Want t All Done.They Want To Pack Out And Fill The Shelves But All You Do Is Be A Cashier.They Do Give Out Bounes When You Make Sales Which Is Nice.
bad,I didn't get as many hours as I wanted. My fellow employees were nice and so were the customers. I worked for 2-3 months but I never got paid even though I asked on multiple occasions.
bad,Dollar Tree was my first job. It wasn't the best job but it helped me get my foot in the door. I believe it helped me get out of my shell too. I was pretty good with packing out product or doing truck. I couldn't advance in this place though so it was a real downer to be looked over by other people.
bad,"I think dollar tree is a good place to work for someone that is in school, it isn't a lot of money but if you're looking for a part time job just for a little extra cash it is a good job for you."
bad,"The job is very stressful as a manager.  If you’re stocking and the lines at the register get long you have to drop everything you’re doing to help ring out customers, which cuts into your stocking productivity.  You’re graded on your stocking productivity so if you’re stuck on register all day then it’s very difficult to get any stocking done."
bad,did like when i started then i got transferred to another store the manager was unprofessional and did not train me. I got transferred to another store and was criticized and embarrassed in front of other workers
bad,Changes in management made the work experience terrible.  Co-workers were great and I enjoyed the work that was done.  I learned to be a valuable team member.
bad,Was not properly trained for management position. But a good place to work as cashier or stocker. The hours where good for the cashier's. Would be better if they offered full time hours.
bad,I worked here for 4 years got alot more experience in management and alot more in dealing with supervising my employees and opening and closing of my stores and new locations.
bad,"Very hard labor!! Mandatory overtime, stress on your back, don't get vacation time until you are there for 6 months and you only get 16 hours until Feb rolls around and you only get 88 hours for the whole year, HR are the rudest people I have ever met, GM doesn't care about the place, the health care option they give you doesn't cover anything, pay sucks for the work you have to do, get written up for anything and everything. Only good thing about this place are the immediate managers. Would not recommend anyone to this place"
bad,"Manager isn't professional, scheduling is posted every week for the next week only & posted sometimes late. Usually only have 2 people working in the store , manager & cashier"
bad,i feel like and also have seen it that the employees(in management) within the company do not get compensated enough for what they do. they hire people outside of the company to become managers and they get paid in some case almost double then what management that has been with the company for a long time. i don't think they treat their long time dedicated employees fair
bad,"It was an Okay Experience, I felt like there were times when I was working and nobody else took their job serious, I always take my job serious but the managers always slacked."
bad,Horrible place to work. Management only worried about themselves no benefits at all. I will say they are good at giving breaks. Managent staff thinks their employees are work horses
bad,Job Duties are strenuous and no room for growth. The pay is horrible and opportunity of advancement is very minimal. The workplace is very unprofessional.
bad,"underpaid, could never get full time employment unless you were in upper management, and that is not including assistant management. It was easy to go up the ladder if you applied when positions were available and were able display knowledge of the job"
bad,"Dollar Tree is a great starter job or secondary job but for anyone who wants to grow career wise, please do not consider. Managers put who they want to work with them on their shift and leave assistants to fend for themselves and have to deal with the childish teenagers they themselves hired. There are no benefits offered and managers show favoritism. Try to fix the culture or question upper management and you will be frowned upon and fired."
bad,the store managers were great it was corporate that had ridiculous ideas and forced everyone to abide by them. it could be a great store if upper management was gone
bad,"No matter how hard you work for the company, there is no loyalty. It doesn't matter how good you perform, they are not loyal and they break a lot of rules."
bad,It was OK place to work part time no full time at all 6 hours was all we could work in a day very stressful always busy 2 five minutes brakes is all we got
bad,Not enough hours and minimum-wage pay  Dollar tree is a slow paced environment standing behind the cash register all day dealing with disgruntled people was not for me I did like stocking shelves and unloading trucks but most of my time is spent at the regester
bad,"The employees, where very helpful in assisting when needed. The management staff are kind and understanding. New employees where welcomed with open arms."
bad,When i worked here it was okay at first until you see there back room its a mess. The only way to find what you need for work is to literally go on a scavenger hunt. All I Can Say is good luck when it comes time.
bad,With a lot of working extra hours and hard work and dedication I did move up in the company rather quickly. It was really hard at times to hire great help but I did the best I could and had a great team in the end. The company wanted me to move to a different store location that was on the other side of town and changed hours dramatically so I decided to go ahead and give notice and move on.
bad,We worked hard for what we got paid but wasnt enough for what we had to do there.We never had enough people working so things could get done. They hired people that had a hard times getting a job
bad,"I gained a lot of experience working there but overall they company is very scandal. The don't do anything for their employees.   They don't even have security they will only get security unless someone pulled out a gun and has threatened you. We've got robbed before they pushed us out the way,they literally got in my face trying to fight us and we requested wee need security some many times. Dollar tree is Worldwide company and they supposedly say they don't have money to fund for a security. I'm not risking my life for unprofessional company."
bad,Didnt really like how there operation was ran. need improvement on organizing and bigger building. isnt fair for us to meet our number as well. overall needs improvement.
bad,Loved my position and job but there is poor management is the store. No backing each other or helping each other. There is no team work
bad,"I enjoyed working with the company.  All the Co workers got along great, always taem work. I worked over night . We received and unloaded trucks merchandise and stocked up shelves."
bad,"A typical day here involved running the register by either being main or backup, stocking merchandise on the floor as well as blowing up balloons."
bad,This place is off the wall. Cheap pay. Training program is not that great. They basically throw you into the job and you figure it out for yourself. Big headache.
bad,"A typical day at work doing the stocking and unloading u-boats of boxes and dollar tree merchandise. Management is what I had the problem with anyone will tell you that I am a good work and I work very hard for everything I do .Management at the Dollar tree in Memphis, TN ion Winchester is horrible and very dirty. Management will not clean the store and hours are cut. I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone to work there."
bad,eh its good but pays 7.25 and that to low. So I wouldn't recommend it if you have a family. you don't get set hours. everything always mixed up by the main manner.
bad,"Management was not very good. They did not train correctly and fired people if they simply did not like them. They were very rude and handled what should've been professional situations, poorly. I would not work for them again."
bad,Don't plan on having a life if you work there! Mandatory OT all week then they post mandatory Saturdays. UNDER PAYED AND OVERWORKED! They talked about cost of living raises for a year that i worked there and still all they kept telling us was they where working on it. Lies lies lies from upper management. Too many rules and you're just a # there. No opportunities to move up but if you do the pay still stays the same.
bad,"But needs a lot of work. The store was always a mess. Even from my first day. I've stayed to clean twice and The store was the complete mess worst than before."
bad,"It started out fine as a job to make money to pay bills, but there was no clear opportunity for advancement. It is very much a dead end job with poor management."
bad,"Dollar tree helped me get my foot in the door so i could get better jobs "
bad,"Supervised team members helped customer with certain issues, learned that productivity is a very strong factor, getting extra work done was the most enjoyable part of the day, hardest part of the job not having enough payroll and having staff that constantly called out and that upper and the management team rarely helped to resolve important issues."
bad,"The store I was at is located in a different state from where I am currently.  I loved working there, the managers were very nice and understanding."
bad,"A typical day at work is approximately 10-11 hours.  During which time, management's focus is to maintain a compelling place to work and shop, customer service, daily, weekly and monthly reporting.  In addition, receiving and processing merchandise in a timely manner.  Merchandising, operational and office management."
bad,"the enviroment inside the store was upbeat and was a joy to work in. The down fall to this job was the district manager would use foul lanague towards you and would physically hit things. He would also, always wanted to put his arm around you. It made me feel very uncomforable and intimated by this man."
bad,"I would open the store and run the register. I would stock all registers and endcaps, and ring peoples purchases out. In this job I learned how to restart the registers and blow up balloons. Middle and upper management seemed aloof and out of touch although my coworkers and immediate supervisors were terrific people; humble and kind. The hardest part of the job was completing my job to the best of my ability but not being recognized for it via promotion or pay raise. The most enjoyable part of the job was the annual holiday toy drive in which donations from our customers were easy to encourage because of obvious philanthropic reasons.On a personal note I felt that the dollar tree made it glaringly obvious that they did not care about employees, and that the poor quality of products and low prices were immediately reflected in the fact that shifts were ran on few people with high work loads and few opportunities to advance despite any given worker proving themselves as being an above average employee."
bad,Great crew. Store increased by sales even 40% some days when I took over. This was my first Management gig. Got fired for unloading a truck in the front because 9 feet holes were in the back with construction. Every other store unloaded in the front as well. Got told this was against policy.
bad,It was ok to work at when you are a college student. Didnt work many hours a week since I was part time due to schooling but they were semi flexible with my schedule
bad,I hated it. terrible job terrible pay and not many hours. how can anyone work there like seriously it sucked balls. I would never work there again.
bad,i was a very hard job and i don't think that they think thing throw when they are taking in all of those order's they was hard and long
bad,Great Part time job . I gained a lot of product knowledge on various products. Tuned up my customer service skills. Learned to be more patient and have a better optimistic.
bad,"when I first got the job they told me they would work with my schedule as long as i dedicated my weekends to them... false. I ended up quitting because the job refused to work around my school schedule and kept scheduling me during class time, even though I helded up my end of the deal. Work days were great i loved the friendly customers and the job was pretty easy. I learn to bit my tongue and wait for the appropriate time to address a situation. management wasn't to nice and always on edge, even with customers. my coworkers were great but often bothered by management's attitude towards them. The hardest part was dealing with the manager."
bad,"during a typical day we cleaned, organized, and stocked the store. Greeted customers with a great attitude. My co-workers were all driven and loved the job. The hardest part of my job was deal with managers that show favoritism towards people. The most enjoyable part was having my regular customers that I really enjoyed."
bad,"Although its fast pace and busy work, they have a hard time suppling work hours evenly and fairly."
bad,I think this is a job for young men and women. For high school students with not a lot of responsibilty.
bad,was ok i was a teen when i had the job. nice hours and room for advancement
bad,Merchandising manager. I love interacting with the wonderful customers as well as my employees.
bad,I believe management should get paid more than just a dollar of minimum wage.
bad,"Okay first job, don't get stuck working there for more than half a year."
bad,"The work is easy, it's the same old same old everyday. They only give cashiers more then 20 hours a week. Their expectations of the few staff they have during a shift is too high. They will hire 30 ""so so"" people for two positions and stretch the hours as oppose to hiring 15 really good people so everyone gets decent hours. I feel bad for alot of the customers who have to wait in line because they only allow one main cashier and occasionally a manager on a register, then have one associate on the floor who can't help customers properly because they are in the back doing the lazy manager's job while they stay in the office for an hour. They are so cheap they'd rather sell a busted piece of taped up merchandise rather than put it as a damage, they resale half wasted shampoos and chemicals for the full price and beat customers. The stockers are so miserbale they just put up shelves anyway they want to and don't care if a customer or an employee gets hurt. The job sucks but hopefully it's only temporary."
bad,"A typical day is reviewing daily paperwork and schedule, assigning job duties to stockers and cashiers, motivating them to reach their time oriented goals.  I monitor their work while responding to customer service needs, complete any store orders or vendor requests.  Working with a diverse group of people keeps the job interesting.  The hardest part of the job is keeping the personal/professional distances between myself and the employee's so that they understand that I am not their friend, I am their supervisor, but doing so in a manner that I can get the best work out of them."
bad,"•	Served clients in a professional and timely manner assuring that all purchases are quick and complete "
bad,I work in a area where im challenged by people to stay unprofessional. 
bad,"Dollar Tree as a company attempts to save money every chance it can, and probably for good reason.  As such, no one but the upper management will be getting anything close to livable hours.  Shifts are always rather spread thin, meaning the few people who are at work at any given time typically have a lot to do to keep things in order.  This is a fine job if you are just out of high school or need to pick up a few more hours here and there, but if you actually need to make a living you are better off going elsewhere."
bad,it was ok
bad,Dollar Tree Was MOre Like A Starter Job. I Am Very People Oriented I Love Dealing With Customer Service Its A Great Experience. Smiling & Greeting Customers Is What I Do Best To Keep Service Coming Back.
bad,"The only enjoyable part of working here was the fellow employees. The hard part included basic pay, terrible hours, being milked of your energy and efforts, unpaid breaks, tiny tiny break area, people showing very little respect to you as a human being because you work at a dollar store. The store manager and assistant managers were friendly and nice. A typical day for me was cashiering for the first couple hours and then proceeding to clean up the store and organize the shelves. It also seemed that the store was always cutting hours even though I was only working maybe 15 hours a week as it was. We were then hounded about the store looking like a barn house or not up to code. The store I worked at had very outdated computer equipment and also a very nasty rat problem which was never really fixed. Couple that with a dusty and chemically smelling environment and you're looking at a ""great day"" for allergies everyday. Come on. It's a company that always makes money and it wouldn't hurt them one bit to fix some simple little things to make people happy and more tolerable. I guess that goes for most all companies nowadays. Big profits and minimal expenses."
bad,Alot of Responsibility
bad,Loved the customers. I would do it again. I liked helping customers and giving them ideas.
bad,Helping customers is the benefit the of the job. Some co-workers are pleasant to work with. The best part of this job is the conversations with the older customers.
bad,"When I began working for Dollar Tree, I did not have a family. I started as an overnight stocker. Then, I was promoted to cashier and finally to 1st Assistant Manager. I was in my final position, when I met the man I would marry. The other manager's did not approve of this. They told me that if I got pregnant at the wrong time that they would make my life a ""living wreck"". Well, I did get pregnant in 4th quarter and I was demoted from 1st Assistant Manager to Cashier. I lost my wages and benefits because of this."
bad,The company is an “ok” place work temporarily. Management did not care about worklife balance. If you called out your hours were cut severely. Not worth it.
bad,"The management was very poor for the most part.  The warehouse was in very poor condition with trash everywhere, boxes thrown all over the mods, mice running around, several bugs and not a single manager was willing to encourage anyone to clean up. Managers were quick to point out mistakes but completely ignored hard work and good workers."
bad,Management does not give associates room to advance and grow. Associates hardly get breaks and are only given 3-6 hour shifts. Manager hourly pay is very week below market value.
bad,Eh. It is what it is . Customers are very........ intresting.  They cut hours if your new ... Js. depends on where you work im sure . But usually not of lines open pther than 2 . So be fast etc.
bad,"Some days where a drag, but you had the time to meet different people of different cultures.I really didn't learn anything new at this job due to lack of employees with corrective experience. Very diverse, though you where not allowed many work hours or benefits. Valuable work experience, working hard for very little pay and not much leader ship."
bad,i basically work at dollar tree they hired me but didn’t tell me i was working part time never even noticed until about a week into the job . I like the job ! It’s an ok place too work just not enough money
bad,"Dollar tree is run by horrible management, it’s always unorganized and if you put in the time and effort to fix things the next day everything is unorganized as if the work you put in the day before hadn’t happened. Your coworkers are friendly."
bad,"The Dollar Tree distribution center seems like all they care about is their numbers. They put up a false sense of appreciation towards their employees. If it wasn't for the benefits and hours, then I'd give it 1 star."
bad,It's a good place if the crew is willing and they work together  and help one another out and make it a great place managers and employees to hold a job and enjoy the job n people as u keep doing it.
bad,Poor management underpaid lots of call ins with managers upper class management poor Don't care for there employees at all. But I did learn a few things there
bad,I overall disliked this job because of the lack of backup you have as a cashier. You're expected to deal with so many customer needs while getting paid minimum wage.You'll get put on schedule for two days and they'll try to call you in every single day you're off.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is not having enough staff to do your job effectively. Because we were always short staffed due to company hour restrictions, it was difficult to take time off. "
bad,"The job I  was eager to go to, they was able to count on  me no matter the time or day, they was able to call me to cover anyone shift, i had a lot of fun, but the manager seems at first to be a nice manager then you will see another side of him, he started cutting my hours saying that i was not wearing thew right uniform but he or assistant manager was out of dress code,, then he gave hours back then started cutting my hours again"
bad,"The location I worked at had very good people working there, but had a very hostile / caustic manager.  I had no negative run-ins myself, but the manager personally degraded staff in front of customers, assigned them other tasks when they should have remained at their registers, and when customers showed up at the cash register they got berated for being away from the register.  It was a no-win situation and I felt very bad for them.  The manager also made fun of a mentally-disabled employee and revealed the health condition of another."
bad,I worked as an assistant manager at dollar tree for 10 months and probably had 2 weekends off!!!   I didn’t get paid nearly as much as I deserved!!!   They expect way more than they pay!
bad,Unfortunately Dollar tree does not care about the safety of their employees. Stores are in very unsafe neighborhoods. No security. No good. High theft
bad,It's really hard to work there. They don't give much hours to run the store so it's understaffed and everyone has to do way more than what they should for their role with no incentive. It's hard to keep good people there so you're left with the bottom of the barrel. Corporate is unorganized and the freight trucks are never on schedule causing problems with the staff and product in the store. Everything comes down on the store manager no matter how hard you work it's never good enough. It's mentally and physically draining.
bad,When the founder of the company was still alive it use to be a fun place to work.  After the founder passed away it all became about the money.  They will suck the life out of you.
bad,dollar tree is a decent place to work. you will learn the register and and how to clean up the store. the manager will always help you in any situation.
bad,No drug test no background checks can pick up shifts but he will cut your hours if u start school or change your availability and not give u enough to live at only 2 cashier at a time sometimes only one during shift change long line rude customers keep in mind I worked at the ratchet one mabey not all of them are like that
bad,"It's ok to work at Dollar Tree. The sucky part of that job was the pay. The pay is awful when you're being paid minimum wage ($7.25). The store I was at is constantly understaffed due to high turnover, low wages, and the amount of stuff you needed to get onto the shelves. Backroom was always bursting at the seams due to this issue. Customers were also curt when you were slammed, but I am use to that from othere years of retail."
bad,Management has very low to none hours to work with. Cashiers don’t wanna do much. District manager / regional managers are very hard on management even tho we have only one stocker
bad,"I enjoy working with Dollar Tree, but the pay cause be better for working in a hot store.  I love my little part time job.  Dollar Tree also have a lot of mice, rats or whatever you call them when you see them.  I am scare of those things"
bad,It wasn’t a very good place to work at I just came home and needed a job I need something I’m gonna excel at I want something where I can make good money at and dollar tree isn’t the place
bad,Dollar Tree a ok company to work for if you looking for something to do. The employees are great needs to work on team work. The company needs to improve on giving their stores more hours and training  for the worker to put stock on the shelves. Dollartree need to work on for advancement for the employees in house not outside the store as for store manager 's. With a little more work and consideration for  hard working employees Dollar tree will be awesome!!!
bad,"stressful, overly busy not enough cashiers, wasn't trained properly but learned how to work cashier. pour management the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and l.earning about their life style and culture."
bad,You have to be ready to work very hard and still get scolded or told you're not doing something right or enough. You must be able to lift at least 30 lbs to be a stocker. As a stocker you will be on call for 1 or 2 days for truck.
bad,"I was hired quickly as PT cashier, I had no experience with the register but thought I would be fully trained and get to do something different. What I got was a ""trainer"" who taught me a minimal of 15-20 minutes in a 5 hour work day. Theres no management to train you consistently and make sure your trained properly. I found out most of the rules, breaks etc from only one co worker and she litterally spends the time and effort to show me everything I needed to know from the very beginning when nobody else did. I was told I pick 2 different  break times 10 minutes or 30 minutes. Pay is very low and so are the hours. Minimal 5 hours, 8.25 hr. This job is perfect for anyone on a very busy schedule and wants extra money and the job offers extremely flexible hours on your terms and tha th includes the days you choose."
bad,"The hours were much to be desired, and the pay is abysmally low. If you really need a job or a second job this is the place to work, its super part time. This will only be a supplemental income and is unlikely to really help you pay the bills. Where I worked we only got 10 minutes for our break and if we weren't back at our registers exactly ten minutes after we clocked out we could get in trouble."
bad,"As a an assistant manager, the work was slightly challenging however the company doesn’t show much appreciation for their workers, (no perks, no good employee discounts)."
bad,Not a very good company to work for when you ask for time off they don't give it to you most of the time and when you put in your two week notice they just make you quit on the spot
bad,I happened to have a great store manager but besides that Dollar Tree is over all not a job you want to have. The pay is not worth how much you are expected to do.
bad,"If you like to do the work of two people for low pay then this is the place for you.  Hours cut drastically after holidays.  Was only part time as an assistant manager and not informed of changes.  Many rules not explained until they were broken and security (spy) cameras all over store.  Used so employees didn't know when they were being watched by corporate, but in a negative way.  Very busy store but understaffed, expecially when trying to get stock out.  As assistant manager, was always being called to the front by cashiers for long lines and as a result could not complete duties.  Worked while I tried to eat my lunch or dinner.  Pay not competative,"
bad,Its is jobs that help you stocking job you stock items in it have benefits it pays $9 hour you can help you with. Bettering your carreer you can learn new position.
bad,Very laid back place to work. Decent part time job for someone in high school or if your looking for a job to help you gain extra cash on the side. As far as a career don’t do it.
bad,"It was a day by day expeierence. Some were good, some were worse than others. No set schedule unless supervisors liked you. And hours were never the same."
bad,"All around excellent experience ,cool and laid back atmosphere, management was not excessive on strictness,very flexible and provide a consistent productivity on my life at that present time.Even walk to work daily due to lack of transportation."
bad,Basic retailer store. Open every day for twelve hours a day nothing inside the store cost more than a dollar so its a great place to shop and save money at.
bad,Most days consist on helping customers by running a register or finding items for them.  Stocking shelves and managing payroll.  Trucks come in once a week and need to get processed in a fast manner.
bad,Like the job meet nice people! Supervisors was Kool! Like going to work! Problem is Dollar Tree should be shame for what they pay! cashier make $200-$240 every two weeks that's $480 monthly!pulling in thousands a day!$7.35 an hour! With nickel raises
bad,"very negative and stressful atmosphere, poor management/team work.   Manager at this location was not happy with her position and responsibilities and  create much stress and negativity.  More professionalism is needed."
bad,"It was ok at times, District manager could be a little more involved in the store. Finding management for the store is poor. Could use a clean up of the backroom where store items are stored. Ackowledge there employees, when you notice an employee doing a good job make sure you let them know. Dollar tree has a big problem with that."
bad,"A lot of advancement opportunities."
bad,"Not enough hours to make a living"
bad,Very short staffed and store plan is always disorganized. The pay for the work expected is un reasonable. Good luck to Dollar Tree employees. I wish you the best
bad,The manager was great but the pay wasn't you never work more than 4 hours a day. The employees were gross but it was only a few who had a personality. You only get a 10 minute break and lots of customers were rude.
bad,Dollar tree will work with your schedule my manager in Greenwood is pretty awesome but it's not to secure I feel sometimes as though corporate does not appeciate its employees but I am greatful for the little time I have been able to give thus far
bad,I worked several of the positions in Doller Tree. from cashiering to freight in the early mornings i learned the in's and outs of the buisness. it was a place that hired and had me working fast and that i liked.
bad,A typical day involves unloading 250 to 300 packages by handheld forks and getting those packages to the floor in its proper location prior to the store opening.
bad,"The worst time to work for dollar tree is during the Christmas season. Customers will usually corporate but when things don't move as fast as they would like they will get testy. I tend to small and joke when they may start feel uneasy, its my job to call for backup when 5 or more guest enter my line. I try to keep the fast pace but will usually have a lot of obstacles. I will 8 of 10 times greet guest as the walk into the store making for a better experience."
bad,"The management here is terrible, write ups for not taking breaks when manager doesn’t let you take breaks. Hardly any training and no organization in the store. Pushing items out when there is no room on the sales floor. You get your schedule a day in advanced and have to call basically every day to figure out if your working. The only good thing that came from this job were the hard working employees I befriended, they deserve to be treated better."
bad,"Be more prepared for a busy day. With only a 10 minute break, and 5hrs each day. I only work 2 days out the week. And they were paying $7.35 an hour, I was sick so I tried calling out but they said I would be fired if I didn’t come which was so inconsiderate."
bad,"The store manager was great, but the District Manager was awful. Very impersonal, frigid, unappreciative. They give out little hours with great expectations for productivity, which is unfeasible nor realistic."
bad,"Pay was low, but that.s to be expected at a place where everything costs a dollar. Low hours for part time workers, sometimes as low as four hours a week depending on what the sales projection is.  not well staffed and some cases we felt unsafe due to lack of staff on busy days in a not so safe neighborhood."
bad,"If this is your first job it is a good start. The management is not the greatest, they are hard to work with. You do get paid minimum wage and is easy work, but can be difficult."
bad,If you don't have kids and are just starting out this job is perfect but to take care of a family on it's not ideal there are no benefits and some of the co workers are so rude and dismissive  as their manager I am not taken seriously because they are all older then me
bad,"Dollar Tree is a good company to work for if you are a workaholic, but at times even if you are the best at what you do it still isn't enough. Between the very low wages and very low hours for employees to get the freight out and/or what the business needs are,  it becomes extremely overwhelming and stressful. Would not reccommend a management position in this business."
bad,"Low hours for hourly associates, burden is placed on salaried. Advancement from associate to manager very good for dependable, hard workers who can handle low pay until a position opens."
bad,"In my opinion Dollar Tree is not a good place to work for the following reasons:"
bad,"It was nice and friendly, but was very slow and you werent treated very well. expected to wake up super early to unload trucks and stock the shelves of the entire building."
bad,Boss had an bad attitude she was always yelling and she never gave me any work hours and I could never get any over time she was just all over the place
bad,"it was a nice little store, people that I worked with were nice the only thing was the store itself wasn't to big so it got really cluttered. other then that the store isn't to bad just get messy quick"
bad,I didn't get many hours as I was hoping and the coworkers that I worked with seemed to not really care about their job and it felt like I was picking up other peoples slack.
bad,some days can be very stressful because it gets really busy. some days it can be very calm. overall I really did like working at dollar tree. I would go back.
bad,"Usually, if you are lead cashier you can't do anything else unless it is slow or the store is closed. It is the most stressful job anyone will do. I would not recommend anyone to this job. Some customers are always rude, no one will help you with the lines and they will gossip all the time. I try to put up with the company but I am planning on changing jobs."
bad,"Not enough cashier help at all! This includes holidays like Christmas! Management was okay. Not enough stockers either. I had to stock the front of the store, manage the customers with balloons, run the cash register at the same time and greet people as they come in. Too much for one job!"
bad,"The job was pretty much what one would expect for an unloading/stocking position, just might be hard to stay excited about the work and get a regular, reliable schedule."
bad,To work for Dollar Tree can be fun if you love to get a good deal but working for Dollar Tree isn't as fun as their products are.  By the time you get a break and go through the line to pay for your snack your break is over or by the time you get to the stock room you only have a couple of minutes and no where to really break. But the biggest disappointment is the pay. The second biggest disappointment is they only want you to be part time with 12-13 hours a week as a cashier and their is no way to make a living that way.
bad,"Raises within this company are based on a percentage of your hourly wage and a minimal percentage at best. For example I worked there for 3 years and never received a raise above 15 cents. The first was 8 cents, the second was 12 cents, and the third was 15 cents even though I demonstrated a better work ethic than some who had been there longer."
bad,"Dollar Tree isn't a bad place to work although it doesn't provide me with the necessary hours that I need to pay off bill, student loans, etc. We usually go by the same schedule and have the same work tasks. I can definitely say that Dollar Tree did help me figure out how to work with people of different cultures and how to handle different situations better."
bad,"The work is very easy, minimum wage,nice people, but the management was horrible. In the time that I worked there I saw maybe 100+ employees come in and subsequently quit after 1 or 2 days. The turnover rate was huge. Lots of shady people got hired on and quit. I was left to pick up most of the slack and do around 3 or more employees jobs."
bad,"I stocked shelves and did cashiering."
bad,"$7.35 per hour and you're lucky to get 18-20 a week. Mainly all the employees and management where ghetto. The job itself was EASY AS PIE though."
bad,I have over 5 years experience in Retail.. I'm experience with dealing with customers. I'm a very hard worker and love to learn new things. I enjoyed working learning knew tasks. It was a great Jo. To further my career.
bad,Hardly any work life balance. Senior management manages by exception. The culture is entirely in the associates which makes it tough for management. Working here has given me patience with people. The hardest part of the job is motivating the associates to come to work.
bad,I was hired on as a seasonal associate and it was my very first job. I had no idea what I was doing but the managers were amazing they answered everything and walked me threw every step of the way learning about the store
bad,It wasn't as bad as i rated i just didn't feel safe in the work place i left because there had been a homeless man who came in the store and threatened my life and was coming up to me and also was threatening other people in the store it wasn't worth what i was getting paid
bad,"If you are a teenager or young adult needing to make some money, and you don't have a lot of financial obligations, this would be a good first job."
bad,I was supposed to be working there and all it seemed I was doing was just coming in to unload the trucks then leave. I  did not really receive that many hours.
bad,The stock room was stacked well over 5ft high. There was only a tiny squeeze way thru the boxes and you have to watch for falling boxes and totes full of product. Unsafe and unorganized. Hard to tell the amount of shrinkage due to the inability to count the stores inventory
bad,Nice place to work but they do not have security in the store. They expect a lot for little pay. I enjoy some of my time working there with employee.
bad,"Needs better management, and doesn't pay you for the work you do. Coworkers and costomers are great.everthing is just a dollar, but there's a reason."
bad,i didn't care for working here. the manager is the reason why i left. yelled at me in front of customers. rude customers. rude employees
bad,I liked working there just not with the in organized managers and team the heat never bothered me nor the work just the way it is ran..
bad,"Due to tight margins, the corporate office runs a very tight, very lean operation.  Most employees are doing the work of 3-4.  Many tenured employees tell you that this place is awful, and they are not sure why they are still here...but, the benefits are good, profit sharing is nice as is the ability to purchase stock at a discount."
bad,"* Used cash register skills to request and record customer orders in a timely fashion. "
bad,"my day at work consisted of taking care of customers making sure they found what it is  they were looking for, made the customers feel welcomed and made sure that they got to purchase their items in a timely fashion and recovery .the most enjoyable part of the job was my customers because some were always sweet and kind made me laugh. the hardest part was hardly getting help with recovery from other co-workers"
bad,"I enjoyed working with my fellow employees and the job itself was very easy and stress-free, but I received very low pay and minimal and inconsistent hours."
bad,"I loved my job and what I did, I did not like the team I was with or how the store manger ran things. A typical day is starting at 7am or 2p ,paper work, counting safe(money),dealing with customers most of the day and also taking in vendors."
bad,On a typical day I would stock merchandise and ring up customers. I learned that if takes a special person to work at the Dollar Tree. Management was far from being considered professional and the coworkers looked down on me because I was going to college. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the negative attitudes of coworkers or the time a coworker pulled a knife on me and was later promoted. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out and going home.
bad,"Able to work and advance in management"
bad,"This is not a company for an experienced retail manager. It will make you feel low and bad about yourself if you have real experience. I spent all day cashing and stocking the shelves, rather than being an actual manager. And if you like breaks or to eat forget about it! Maybe if you work in a low volume store, but if you are at a busy store you don't have time. There's only 2 people on so you can't leave. And the stores are so dirty I didn't want to eat in the so called break room. Hard to keep staff, and not enough payroll to keep the shelves stocked. I'm sure not all locations are like this but speaking to other store managers it was same across the board."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learnng from them. Dollar Tree has 500 or more employees at this corporation training people to become assistant manager at each Dollar Tree.
bad,"Typical day I'd arrive at 5am and process freight delivery and stock shelves.  THEN, they'd call me back later in the day for a split shift...CONSTANTLY."
bad,"If I was asked to work here again, I wouldn't, maybe at a different location. Wish I had a better experience here. This job did help me to pay off my loan, which I am still in the process of doing."
bad,"Work long hours everyday. Company requires at least 10 hours per day."
bad,this is one of the worst place's i have ever worked. Its unorganized and management wasn't giving the proper respect or showing good guidance
bad,"Good experience working in retail."
bad,"A typical day at work would be working morning shift."
bad,"I didn't really learn much from this job besides how to use a cash register. Management really sucked they weren't very professional. I think the co-workers were ok, a few were a little lazy and didn't take their job serious but I didn't let it  have much impact on my job. I would say the hardest part about the job would be running the register and cleaning the store at the same time. There was really nothing enjoyable about this job I would not recommend working here unless they change management & upped the hours."
bad,"I am not impressed with my experience while employed for Dollar Tree in Reading, Pa. The hours and scheduling were terrible. Management was poor and definitely not helpful to new hires and highly unprofessional. The pay rate for a management position was very poor."
bad,"For Retail, it is a very fast paced company.  I stayed busy with helping customers either checking out or finding things.  I also stocked the shelves and cleaned.   The other ladies were great to work with.  I loved working with all the customers to make their experience even better."
bad,"A typical day for me involves ringing customers utilizing my customer service skills while promoting sells. Managers and supervisors have various attitudes towards customers and employees. I am often called on my days off and when I am scheduled for recovery most of the time I am working 1-2 hours past the time I am scheduled to clock-out."
bad,"A typical day at work was not a fun thing, to say the least. I was put in multiple trucks while boxes came down the line. I learned how to stack boxes which sounds simple, but there is way more to stacking boxes in a warehouse environment. Management was scarce. They had shift managers come to my location from different locations to help us out. My co-workers were okay, a few of them were. The hardest part of the job was trying to mantain multiple trucks at once (overworked). The most enjoyable part of the day was break. I could not wait until break everyday. We had just a few guys on the dock which made it even harder for us. And the boxes never stop, they just keep coming. I worked two weeks straight a few times, and on the weekends even when my schedule said Mon-Fri. My pay was good for a guy like me, but I hated the job. Being a dock worker at dollar tree was tough. We had good days too, but mostly bad. The only thing I miss is the money."
bad,"I would get to work about 10 minutes early or so every day. I liked that so I wasn't rushed before work. Anyway I would clock in, get my drawer, count it, be assigned a register, then get to work out there at the check-outs. I really did love my job at Dollar Tree!! For the most part I got along with all my co-workers. I learned that getting along with co-workers is very important it makes it much easier for teamwork to happen!! There really wasn't any hard part to my job as I said I loved it the customers are what made it great!!"
bad,"In my opinion this job is a job for the ""right now"". I found that this job was however not the job for me."
bad,"There was always stable work."
bad,"Manage the truck crew and stockroom accordingly"
bad,"A typical day at work depends if I am opening the store or closing. I enjoy doing both, but there are different work expectations. Such as, when we open, I focus on the stocking and presentation of the store. When it comes to closing the store I focus on organization and the tidiness of the store. One thing that never changes, is that taking care of the customers is my number one job. I enjoy doing my job and I enjoy interacting with new people. The hardest part of my job is the dissapointment I would feel if I do not finish all my tasks on time. I challenge myself everytime I attend work, and I love staying busy. Another thing I love is how friendly all my coworkers are. It makes the job easier when the people you work with enjoy working together. I would say I have learned alot of new things since I first started working at the Dollar Tree. I learned how to multitask and do my job well, that there's always gonna be mistakes here and there that everybody goes through. That's how we all grow and get to be the best at what we do. Certain taks I learned during the job is assembling products and speed is key, to keep the store clean and tidy every chance I get, to stock products and keep them looking good because that is after all where we get our income from and to always keep a smile on my face."
bad,"It was the rule to have only 3 customers in one line. Only one register would be open (my register). As soon as there were 3 customers in line, I had to go to a speaker phone and order another employee to open up another register. When I called, the other employees would shut down their register after serving a few customers. I would have to call them on the speaker phone over and over again. Sometimes nobody would help me and the managers would blame me. One of the managers treated me with so much disrespect. The hardest part of the job was working with a lot of customers. The enjoyable part was interacting with friendly shoppers. I learned that its best to get a job not just for the money, but something you enjoy. "
bad,"I've learned how to make customers feel welcome, not just working at Dollar Tree but also at Hardee's. I've also learned how to keep work related stuff at work, and my home life at home. A typical day of work ,I start out with counting my teal, after I make the store presentable for the customers and also us employees and management, i welcome everyone that walks through the door even if I'm ringing people up on the register I make sure every customer feels like they are welcome anytime. I stock merchandise in between ringing customers up,and every customer that come in my line I ask 'How are you doing today and did you find everything okay"" and before they leave i say ""thank you and you have a great day"". I get a ten minute break depending on how long i work that day, and before i leave work i count my teal make sure my teal is correct and clock out to go home.The hardest part of my job is working with certain people that want to be a boss and not a leader, the most enjoyable part of my job would have to be talking to customers.      "
bad,I feel this company was not always fair with their employees. Some management would tell you to tell them when you could not work and I did that and they would still sceduale me when I was not able to work.
bad,"I opended and setup the New store down on Belmont St Brockton Mass, I became a assistant manager after being a cashier for about a month or two. Management switched and we got a new store Man, the store started falling apart and the hours declined. The assistants did more work than the store Man if she showed up on time or wasnt in the office the whole 8 hr shift. I did enjoy my customers and the new products we aquired. I met alot of nice coworkers. Id recommend shopping here it is fabulous."
bad,"•Assists with all store functions including scheduling, ordering, freight processing and all day-to-day store activities as directed."
bad,"Dollar Tree initially hired me for seasonal during Halloween, and it was a comfortable environment for me. A typical day for me at work would be to clock in, punch in my I.D. number and begin servicing customers at the cash register. I had never been a cashier before so that's something new I learned. My management was a little unprofessional due to training in a timely manner, but eventually I brought it to their attention. A few of my co-workers were awesome and also very helpful when i first begin working as a cashier, I was given different advice to make the job easy for me."
bad,it was a good place to work but they aways cut hours. I unloaded most of the trucks and put out the stuff coming in. the management was nice easy to get along with
bad,"Typical day would be ringing on the register, stocking the shelves, cleaning the store, cleaning the backroom, and help customers. I learned that customers really like dollar store. My co workers were hard workers and helpful.The hardest part of my job was unloading the truck of shipment day. The most enjoyable part was working with a fun staff."
bad,"Love helping people"
bad,They have free medical lots of overtime and most of the associates are pretty down to 666 rf system and scan gun temp and lumper positions available the place has 6 mods
bad,I have witnessed with my own eyes that no matter how much you do your job take care of their customers one phone call on you with a person that is prejudice can make your position be held all because a phone call and you've been there two or three years night and day talking about they would make you a manager and you still assistant manager
bad,Did not paid enough or give enough hours only 5 hours a day 15 hours a week and it wasn't enough to live on and it wasnt fair to work you do more then you are paid to do
bad,"For all the things i dealt with as the freight manager, certainly was not worth the pay. Then we got a brand new store manager and everything went downhill  I got shafted everytime i turned around. My freight team got no hours while i was there (I was the freight manager!) Somehow i was always on a register. Got no help from the DM the store manager was no help either (she was doing the shafting)"
bad,"If they paid more, it would be worth staying. Im not willing to accept $8.50 an hour when I can make $12 in fast food. Same type of job. I will continue to look for another job until i find one."
bad,Long day short handed packout ring on register help recover the store  manage employees make bank deposits handle customers complaints receive trucks try and maintain cleanliness of store
bad,Dollar Tree is a discount store.  Which means its a discount employer.  I may be bias because I worked under two incompetent managers (district and regional).  They expect you to create 80 hours of stocking to be done in 20.
bad,"I wouldn't be able to tell other people about this job, cause of the experience I had, not all bad in the beginning. work was easy and some customers were wonderful."
bad,"Reason i want to work at fast food is cause ive almost a minth of experiance before i lost job due to no transportation "
bad,"Dollar Tree Distribution was a fast environment. Demand from dollar tree stores were very high, and they offered a lot of overtime weekly, especially for the holidays. You have to be physically in shape, and healthy because this is a very physically demanding job."
bad,Messy store and barely scheduled hours. I was barely being paid minimum wage when I was working there. The manager doesn’t train new employees well enough for tasks.
bad,It was very laid back some days and a rush others but overall it was a good time working there. Co-workers were fun to be with. The downside was they never told me when schedule changed and would schedule me knowing I couldn't work that time.
bad,Unless you are just looking for a few hours a week to earn a little extra cash I would not recommend working for Dollar Tree. I was the only full time employee other than the manager and most of the associates were lucky to get 10-15 hours a week. The pay is low and not near enough for the amount of work they expect. Worked there about a year and never got a raise. The manager was great and worked with everyone as much as she could but corporate had her hands tied for the most part. They have benefits for full time employees but they are expensive and not very good.
bad,"A lot of inconsistent working hours not a set schedule. However i enjoy helping people i don't enjoy cleaning up after my co workers messes because of laziness. There is no team work and bad commucation all around. The manager can be selfish and thinks about them and not the rest of team. overall dont enjoy working for DT, also the DM are too friendly with management and let to much slide with the managers!"
bad,"Work could be stressful at times. Employees may like the job, it just depends on the person. work load could be heavy at times because of standing up for long periods"
bad,"Was let go after having surgery for a herniated disc in neck from loading too heavy of a box. Was also injured from improper stacking  boxes and had a wall of boxes fall on me. That was the first injury to neck a d back."
bad,I really loved my job however when a situation came up I feel the company is not handling it the right way. The company doesnt not seem to care for the people that work for them.
bad,Dollar tree is a great place to work with not many hours & poor pay but i enjoy providing great customer service & the  management staff is great people to work with....
bad,Working at Dollar Tree was good at first. I learned customer service and how to stock things correctly. The management was good but poorly ran. Work place was diverse. Hardest part of job was trying to keep the store clean. Most enjoyable was making sure the customers were happy and found what they needed.
bad,"I love the customers! It is a very fast paced job, and consists of standing on your feet. Overall I enjoyed my co workers and manager,  and there was always plenty to do to keep busy."
bad,And needs lots of improvement and need to appreciate there employees... so they won’t work with you so how do they expect you to stay as employee.. they have such an overturned on employment
bad,It was a great place to work and be around great peoples. I learned a lot and I taught an lot as well. I would stock up the shelves and I also was a cahier.
bad,The biggest issues come from poor managers that do not know what they're doing. The next issues comes from the company's systems of how they distribute products in/out of the warehouse. It's very backwards making it frustrating for the employees.
bad,A typical day at work is doing the cash register I learned that you can only do the best that you can with things Management was not professional the culture was good at work the hardest part of the job is having a perfect money count the most enjoyable was the different types of people that would come into the store
bad,Employees that are not management are obly scheduled 15-20 hours a week. Pay is minimum wage. The customers are stressing and can be a handful.It's a great place for high school or college students but it is definitely not a career.
bad,"I was excited being my second job, but I knew I had to start somewhere! I worked both cashier and on the floor and even stocking and no one would take in consideration your hard work at all."
bad,"A typical day at work includes not much of anything. You either stock or ring with little variation, and often if you're ringing you're left with nothing to do. I learned how absolutely irrelevant trying is at a retail job, having worked there for over two years and never getting a raise until the state raised the minimum wage. The store manager cares little for his employee's personal lives and often changes their schedules without contacting them, but the assistant managers go above and beyond to keep the store running."
bad,No payroll only 187 hours to run store just one cashier and one member of management in store not enough employees to process store operations and to recover store appearance
bad,"cashier, cleaning windows and shelving while waiting for customers to come to counter for checking  out."
bad,"This company really doesn't give many hours to each store. Most of the time the managers (myself) have to do multiple duties that aren't required for our position to do. Working here you have to basically give your life away, which would be fine if the company would show any appreciation."
bad,"The employees are nice enough, but the job overall doesn't pay near enough for you to raise a family on. 8.50/hr cannot support anyone, especially being paid bi-weekly."
bad,Quick-paced Kind of stressful its a lot of work if you're the only one working. You have to do more than one task while on the job & sometimes it gets hard & fustrting.
bad,"my experience was somewhat poor. power tripping new managers, worked with some really rude people. most of the customers that came in were nice. coupon people got annoying when we didnt carry what was on the coupon. they'll hire just about anyone as well. the hours kind of suck so if you have bills to pay i wouldnt work here."
bad,enough hours or pay. The management was awful! I wouldn't recommend anyone working there its dirty and in orgonized people there are violent  and rude!
bad,I enjoy working there but the work place needs some improvement. The work place could do with more cleaning .  Managers need to pay more attention to their surroundings and the equipment they have at their facility.
bad,"Management usually does a great job in the work conditions that they are in. The customers, i.e. the level of individual customers' human decency, is extremely low. We deal with perhaps the worst in society, or at least I hope this is the worst. The management that is higher than the store-level management are not good at their jobs, they do not allow the store to do its own ordering, they have horrible customer assistance above the store level, the quality provided by truck deliveries is horrendous, and quality checks on food and other items are virtually non-existent. I have learned to fend for myself without any help or confidence from the higher-ups. I would recommend that no one shop here or work here; this business should not exist based on its own merit."
bad,Nothing real good about it yet nothing real bad about them. Was a seasonal job so i was only there for a short time but I did learn so skill as to how to cycle products properly by dates and reading bar codes
bad,I cashiered and put re shops away. If a customer did not want a product I would put it back and reset the shelf/display.The job over all was easy and got to meet a lot of people on a day to day basis.
bad,It was a job just not a lot of hours. It was a good part time job if you was looking for only 15 hours or less. I learned a lot from dollar tree I learned to greet very customer I learned stocking and I learned how to build shelves.
bad,Enjoyable first job for high school students or teenagers out of highschool . Simple enough to build experience with customers and register.
bad,"A typical day at work would include working the cash register and handling money. I also stocked merchandise and counted inventory. I have learned that if you need something done do not expect other people to do it for you, take the initiative to do it yourself. The management needed to learn how to communicate with the employees better. The assistant managers did hardly any work, they were usually always on their phones."
bad,"I've been working their for only 8 months and I'm already looking for a better job. The management needs improvement such as communication skills, stop being personal with other people, They lowly gag around more then actually working. Now I don't mind talking and playing around a little bit would hurt but I don't do it too much. The hour they give us are horrible. For example, I only get one day a week even though I do have another job. I tell them they can give two days but I guess that's too much to ask. Some of the tasks that they want us to do are hard to especially in the summer time. For example, They would want me to do a project but I also have to cash the customers out , And sometimes its a lot of customers and it takes awhile. Management also tells us cashiers about the no more then four customers in line. I believe that this job is only for the high schoolers and if you want to go up in ranks."
bad,"Although while working at Dollar Tree I enjoyed working with various individuals on the job, I often felt that certain managers did not have the ultimate respect for specific employees. For example, certain managers would micromanage specific employees while allowing other employees to perform their specific duties in a haphazard manner. Also, a lot of favoritism was shown on the job. Eventually, certain managers would continue to give specific employees only closing hours and allow other team members to have a more flexible schedule.  Often times many altercations would occur with customers and employees, and law enforcement would have to step in and diffuse the situation. However, during the summer season the store did not have proper air circulation, and customers and employees had to suffer from the harsh, hot heat.Therefore, I believe that Dollar Tree located in Lanham, Maryland on Annapolis Rd is not a conducive work environment."
bad,stock. I learn that when you stock you know everything around the store. It is a good start. The hardest part is when their are kids that comes in store and purposely make a mess or break some of the objects. I enjoy organizing because I like to have an organize place. Great place to work !
bad,I was hired and no one was flat out rude to me but I could get the just of it. Too much intercommunication that resulted in a defeated experience. I would say.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of running a cash register, stocking shelves, and janitorial duties."
bad,"Dollar Tree Distribution was a company with little advancement, low wages, and a bad work environment. They had very good benefits and a proactive  management."
bad,come in sign in go back to stock room get your assignments and then go do it and then u break for 10min and then back in to finish the day. i've learned how to stock and to set up a store and the management is ok the head manager is great nice and easy to work for and my co-workers are great and fun to work with. the hardest part of the job is stocking the shelves with people in the store and having to stop and den also having to stock fast because your on a time. the most enjoyable part of the job in the people i work with
bad,"Management was pretty understanding for the most part. It was a great experience and my co-workers kept the job a little more fun and interesting. I learned how to work the cash register and the customers in the area were friendly. My responsibilities typically were being the cashier, re-stocking shelves, stocking boxes, and making sure customers get a wonderful shopping experience. I really liked learning the aisles and knowing them so I could tell the consumers and see them happy to know that we have what they are looking for."
bad,"was very fast paced and fun"
bad,"Typically you are involved in blocking aisles while checking out customers, greeting customers and keeping things tidy. Management was somewhat absent as being a leader but worked very hard and stayed busy. Co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is being expected to do everything at once and different jobs are not delegated to different people. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people find things."
bad,"The good thing about working at dollar tree as a night stocker was that you have nice employees, and you can work alone. The only issue I have is that the hours and all the hard work for a little pay."
bad,It was my first job and they failed teaching me how to do things. Rude and just overall not a good experience. They don’t communicate with you about what to do.
bad,"Full time hours is only possible with a management position.By full time hours, I mean 30+ and not 40+ No steady shift. "
bad,"After 11 years, I resigned because of no help from corporate after many requests   They gave assistants raises (deserved) but then cut hourly payroll and expected larger results   Poor execution"
bad,"I would not mind working at Dollar Tree if I was a high school student. Because I am a college student, the pay rate here can not help me. The pay is too low for me at this part in my adult life. I do not have the time to have two jobs. I recommend this job if you are looking for some extra pocket change, but I would not recommend this job for paying bills and students loans."
bad,"A number of co-workers come and go, so it can be difficult to have a strong team throughout the day (let's be honest, not too many people truly want to work here). Throughout my whole year or so of working at Dollar Tree, I've had maybe three or four different store managers (most of them were awesome, both as a professional manager and as a person) and none of them stayed very long at our location. Because of our lack of employees, we aren't able to get the store completely cleaned and can't effectively assist our customers (this does lead to conflicts with our customers). Given that we're located in a fairly sketchy area and have a variety of characters shopping here, you don't truly feel like you're in a safe working environment (which isn't a good thing for any minors, at the youngest applicable working age, working in the store). I personally didn't feel entirely safe, given that there were some creeps that made me feel very uncomfortable with their words and how they looked at me while I worked (mind you, I wasn't wearing ANYTHING that would've provoked them in any manner, plus I was wearing an apron over my work uniform).  There were some weeks where we received fewer shopping bags, which certainly didn't help with the busy weekends and seasons (the logic was that we would use fewer bags, but it made us use everything we had). If you want a gateway job for retail, maybe at least put in your application, but you might want to try somewhere else."
bad,"Easy work, very unorganized but great for someone looking to work small hours and short days "
bad,"They would have you wait around if truck doesn't show up on time which isn't the employees fault, I had to wait a hour and thirty minutes before waiting for truck."
bad,The job used to be really fun & then we got new management. Overall it was a very easy job due to common sense but it really makes you work on time management
bad,Shift in management was my reasoning for leaving. I believe a leader leads by action. I went from an awesome manager to one who did little of nothing.
bad,"hands on management style changing sections and displays throughout the seasons always just seems redundant and time consuming "
bad,You can only hire at 7.35 an hour. The salary is for 45 hrs a week but you are expected to work 55+. The upper management lies on a regular basis. Poor benefits.
bad,"I thought that it would be s permanent job , but it wasn't."
bad,"Dollar Tree is a good place to work at if you have an open schedule, sometimes I would get called numerous times to come in on the days I had off, and they only allowed part time and no overtime, management was childish and had lots of drama"
bad,"Good management, but low payments and no benefits for part-time jobs. "
bad,"This company was off balance more often than not. I found it difficult to find any job security within the company. The management at the time had been let go of after many long, excruciatingly stressful years that he dedicated to the company. This set the company awry. I feel they lack any concern or regard for their employees."
bad,"Everyone working there was fairly nice with the occasional drama usual in a retail workplace."
bad,no hours to give and promote wrong people that will last only a few months when you have outlasted the high turnover for 2 years and did everything asked you are picked over by some child who cant keep up with the work i left then they called me and ask me to manage i said no way
bad,It was a good job good people my experience there was like no other they all work together and help especially with the schedule it got really difficult twords the end sorry I had to relocate
bad,Didn’t like the management felt like anybody was in charge of the establishment employee was rude didn’t want to train the newly employed staff freezer area was terrible
bad,"Extremely low pay for all the work you do. Great environment, fun job. Easy to do, and great customers. Just don't get paid enough and no benefits or full-time."
bad,the managers were very carefree and unproffessional. The work was tedious and uneventful. customers were not top priority as they should be and the store was not well kept.
bad,There was no team work. Everyone was for themselves. Manager barely trains employees. Not enough stockers and cashier's. Very poor management ☹️  Needs alot of work.
bad,They are always hiring but you literally get at most 4 hours a shift. No benefits. They tried to pay me LESS than minimum wage. Very unorganized and dirty. The employees are all on drugs.
bad,"The manager at the Dollar Tree in Clinton, IA, is far too concerned about her own job. I was hired as the operations manager. She would not train me, or give me time to do the ilearns. She was a very rule by her own thumb manager. She was afraid I was after her job. I was not. I only wanted to be allowed to do the job I was hired to do. She is a unhygienic woman, who smelled of urine,. She looked like she just got up out of bed, when she would come in to work. "
bad,"It was okay working here, only downfall was that you really didn't get enough hours and that you couldn't really live off this income if you had children, especially if you were buying diapers. The GM was ok, but sometimes she would have a bad attitude as if she dint want to be there."
bad,"No one cares at Dollar Tree. It is just a place for people to go, get an amount of money for working the day, and going about their lives. Dollar Tree is not a great place to work if you have initiative."
bad,Working at Dollar Tree helped me open my eyes and realize life for what it was. There was no room for professional advancement and advances were only given due to favortism. I would only recommend working at Dollar Tree if someone already has a good job and just wants to make a little extra money.
bad,Te company is an ok company to work for. I wish they carried about their employers more. I feel as if they should pay you more for the amouth of work they want you to do.
bad,"If you’re really desperate for a job. And you don’t care about having a good work environment and having a caring manager, this place is for you. The store was always messy, the manager I say wasn’t the nicest, the schedules were unpredictable, even when I told the manager the days I couldn’t work. The only good thing was the customers. The store got busy pretty often. I had little to no help running the register. Not to mention the turnover rate was ridiculously high. I’m honestly surprised that I’ve worked there for as long as I did"
bad,i worked at the dollar store as an extra way to make money during college. it was a fun environment at the location i was at. i didn't stay long when i transferred from oregon to california
bad,"Working at Dollar Tree is fun, it's not a job that pays enough though. I've been there since September 2018, no pay raise, no vacation, no benefits and not enough hours. The customers are great, and management is great and my coworkers."
bad,it was an ok environment to work in work hard get paid less it only offered part time hours ok place to work the company not as much but the friends you made as far as the customers and the employees
bad,"After working at Dollar Tree for two years I quit because I got other better job opportunities. Dollar Tree is not the worst job, but it is far from the best. The management, for the most part were very nice. The boss of my boss would come in occasionally and shake my hand. After working there for two years I was only given one 15 cent raise, which equated to me making 7.45 after two years working there. If you are just looking for something to do to keep yourself busy it's a fine job because you're constantly meeting new people as a cashier. If you're looking to make a decent income you better look elsewhere because my paycheck for a whole month was probably $300. I started to realize the time I spent working could have been increased by a third If I started working somewhere else before."
bad,I was a stocker and it was awful. They need more people working on things like the delivery. they would get a huge truck delivery and only have like 4 people unloading it all by hand
bad,"it was okay working here, but i feel like it is for older people, or people who prefer slow paced jobs, and not a lot of hard work. the management was good, just very slow"
bad,"Very limited internal opportunities. Associate development not comparable to other like sized companies. Team work and collaboration non-existent. Nice, new building though!"
bad,"You sign up for stock or cashier but your doing the wholeentire store,managment messing up hours and not fixing themcoming up short everypaycheck istough when your pay is minut. Hardest part is low pay most enjoyable is the custome rexperience helping others"
bad,this was a seasonal position I took before my classes started.  I was pretty much thrown onto a check out lane with no prior training on how do run credit cards or checks.  It was frustrating but I had money for Christmas
bad,I was an assistant store manager when I worked here. I enjoyed helping out customers and just being a role model for all my fellow colleagues. But what I didn't like was the store manager. The store manager was not store manager material at all.
bad,"A typical day of work at Dollar Tree is 5-8 hours long. Your day consists of greeting and helping customers, stocking shelves, cleaning the store, etc. The management is pretty flexible with schedules. The people are awesome."
bad,Worked on a small register with one manager available in the office. no help given and when busy continued to keep only one register open when there are 3 or 4 a store Poor management and people skills.
bad,Well is ok just want to find something great for my daughter ? You have to stock but stuff on the shelves so customers can buy then u to the back room n repeat the same process
bad,the management was a little too lazy . and the customers mostly didnt know what they were doing without having the help of the manager and some managers spent too much time at registers
bad,"Dollar Tree is a fine place to shop, not to work. From October to December the job was fine, going in as early as 5am to stock was normal, but when the overnight shifts 10pm-3am followed by 5am-10am became the norm it no longer was a fine job. After the holidays I went from working 4-5 days a week to 1 shift every few weeks, not nearly enough to make a living off of."
bad,pay sucked for the work that was required to do when working and sometime store conditions were very bad. no advancement oppurtunities. i actually enjoyed rushes at work so i wouldnt have to stock the checkout areas
bad,When I fist started Working at dollar tree it was a lot Simpler than I thought it would be. Once you get used to it sometimes the hours just go by fast. It is a nice first job experience.
bad,"Took the job just to be working, stocking shelves and I was looking for a full time job.  So as soon as I was able to get a full time job, I gave notice and quit."
bad,The job was very boring if you want to stand and pretty much do nothing all day then its the job for you. It is a very good first job because it isn't hard at all.
bad,employees aside from management only get about 15 hours a week you have a ten minute break i would have to say the hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and never having enough cashiers on the clock to keep up with the amount of customers
bad,"Keep postive "
bad,"If you are not one of the managers favorites then you can forget about getting put on the schedule. There's only 2 workers the whole day, just you and the manager who is usually always in their office until you are desperate for help at the check out lines."
bad,"Fast paced enviroment. Fun place to learn, simple training. Always remember to greet customers because they will rate you on the dollar tree website, also show up on time because it really can affect ther schedule."
bad,"This was a job that i needed at the time to make some money,  The work environment was good but they didn't pay much at all and wouldn't give you more than 30 hours."
bad,"I didn't really enjoy working with Dollar Tree all that much because the manager at the time would always push me to complete my work at a very fast past. If I was not fast walking my way through the aisle and nearly hitting the customers nearby I would get scolded. My day to day duties would be to help customers with their purchases, restock products, and tidy up the surrounding area. I was the only worker that would be on the floor while the remaining staff were cashiers. There was a lot of pressure on my to make the store look as tidy as possible. The only times I found myself to enjoy my work was when the store would close up for the night and I would preform janitorial duties or when a different manager was substituting and let me go at a more brisk and relaxed pace."
bad,they didnt pay much .. i left because i got a better job at the time but overall was a good job just wasnt great to start a family at the time so i put in my two weeks.
bad,I like it but it's a job for highschool kids I just need good paiding job for my life so I can get my life together for my kids and family I just want a good job for
bad,"This is a retail job and working nights, weekends and holidays.  You a always are stocking the store with freight.  You have to keep the store stocked of product of a daily basis.   Low pay."
bad,"This store  is great for people on a tight budget. it is not however the best place to work. The store isn't always clean, the bathrooms are very bad and sometimes the workers aren't that friendly. I had a terrible manager when I worked there."
bad,"Working at dollar tree as a cashier was not the best experience. The manager was great but not so much of the customers and co workers. I felt people were a little too comfortable. We didnt have security and i worked in a low class community. People that came in were ALWAYS stealing, and cursing, also had police called to the store a couple times for multiple reasons."
bad,job was mainly taking care of customers and being alert on job duties. also a lot of cleaning and putting away unwanted merchandise. always answering phones and running the cash register.
bad,Dollar tree is one of those low end minimum wage jobs that you just cannot survive off of. You don't make up for it in the hours because they're very stingy.
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to interact with different customers on a daily basis. I met all kinds of different people while working for Dollar Tree.
bad,Nice place to work in.  The people are nice . Fast pace and you always have something to do. I'm a assistant manager now and I like it.  I do stocking and work on the computer sometimes.  I deal with counting money and making sure my team is staying busy.
bad,I worked for Dollar Tree almost a year and was never given the hours I deserved they had me come in onc or twice a week just to unload freight and stock and when I asked for more hours I was never trained on different areas of the storefront
bad,It’s a great job for someone in school. Have to start at the bottom and work to the top great place for someone who want to actually work and be managed the right way
bad,"it was always things to do it was never a dull moment , its was great workin there it was even time u would get over time but i learned how to vailue my money"
bad,I wouldn't recommend dollar tree. Its gives you less than part time hours. The pay isn't good at all. Sometimes the place is very dirty. there is alot of thefts  surprisingly
bad,"I've worked at two Dollar Trees in two different cities and both were poorly managed when it came to training new staff. The first one never gave me the required online training videos. Managers and supervisors would expect me to know a lot of information or protocol that no one had taught or told me."
bad,"good job for teenagers, young people, or elderly, Easy job, not too demanding. Lack of benefits and discounts. Needs better communication between management and associates"
bad,Not very long hours unless you are freight manager or store manager. Clean but customers can be very rude and impolite. Not a set schedule really. Be careful of cashiers and money. Cashiers are very lazy
bad,It's a great job to start out but not much advancement . They don't do over time so it's a good job for if you are in school . My boss worked very well with me while I was in school
bad,Always meeting new people and learning different aspects of the job.  You are kept busy which makes the time go by faster.  You get to see new merchandise as it arrives ( which is a great perk of the job)
bad,This place was only a seasonal job so I don't really have much to say about it. Everyone was fine to work with. Easy job really. I worked nights and days. Sometimes they would call me back in an hour after I got off night shift.
bad,a typical day on the job would consist of a lot of tasks.one would be being that you have to make sure that you satisfied every customer and gave them the proper service .next would be knowing that you and your coworkers are moving as a team.
bad,Pay is not as good as it could be. Company overall could improve their standards. With things like copies of your paychecks unavailable to you in a certain extent didn't help when i was trying to get approved on a house for example.
bad,I was the manager and loved working there. Love fast-paced but not enough hours for associates to do work. Company gives no chances even depending on the situation. Pay could have been better because half the year you do need to work about 60 to 70 hours a week and salaried people were never compensated.
bad,During my time here at Dollar tree I was such a fast picker. I did not find it ok to get a write up for picking 99% and then another one for 86% I bust my butt to always go as fast as I could and complete my job. Also constantly had to pick up garbage etc from the shift before. The communication and authority lacked among these supervisors and managers. They expect you to pick so much a day yet stop and pick up the garbage etc from the shift before.
bad,"Good company to work for but, not everyone is a team player, and no follow through done, to ensure fair treatment. Customers were great and usually job went well."
bad,"You work hard, part time employees are severely underpaid and because of that, do not produce high quality performance. You are always at work even when you are at home. Freight levels are high and most store conditions are unsafe and inadequate for productivity."
bad,Working at the warehouse was new it's loud and echoes everything .but it's was fun loading and unloading the trucks..I thing I remember about the warehouse is whatever the weather is outside it's inside the warehouse
bad,"work is usually easy and slow, just selling, cashiering and cleaning. Sometimes there would be bad rushes and people would be less friendly, but the atmosphere there is generally stellar. Unfortunately I had bad management and was only getting a single four hour shift per week so I had to leave"
bad,"My experience working in Dollar Tree was acceptable , I usually worked overnight and that was great for me. But working in Dollar Tree I'd had a rocking experience with the managers lack of communication and totally disrespectfulness. and some of the managers didn't had no consideration for the  employees. Everything else was good, I know I'm a good reliable worker. I'm a neat freak and I put a lot of time and effort into my work."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree.   When it became clear to me that values, and morals were not being honored.  I felt like I needed to take that opportunity to find a stable work environment that I would be proud to call my own."
bad,"I met a lot of different interesting people there and got to learn different skills, I made new friends and became part of a winning team which also became family"
bad,"•	Helped my department increase a new productivity record from 90,000 cases shipped daily to 120,000."
bad,Some of the people are good to work with and a good temporary job.                                                                                   .
bad,"You can pick up quick on everything. They should bring back late night stocking hours. The mood of the store is bland, they should put of some motivational music."
bad,"management was professional and understanding.. They always made hours available to me at the time of employment a lot of members of the team were leaving moving on to new job ventures.. The pay was the very minimum of minimum wage mostly all the employees were management, seems to be the only way you can get any reasonable pay."
bad,"Dollar Tree was pretty normal and never to bad, until someone is stealing. but the manager in the was very rude and nasty."
bad,"The job is run normally with only two people working. This puts a lot of pressure to the manager on duty. This would not be an issue if the management at both the store and district, even regional level where not so trigger happy with firing. Getting hired is easy and getting fired is just as easy. The DM and RM both preach firing and hiring a new staff every meeting or anytime something is not considered to meet their expectations. This does make getting promoted in the company very easy. If you are able to make a good impression and stay reliable you will be able to advance and quickly."
bad,It's a blessing to hear back from you and happy to interview for the job. Looking forward to working for your company and build from there.
bad,This is an Ideal job for kids. Not adults trying to make a living and support a family. You only get five hours a day as a cashier and only three days a week.
bad,Customer satisfaction was a big thing. Management was ok. Hardest part of the job was nothing really. Most enjoyable part was receiving my pay check.
bad,"There was not a lot of planning involved with getting the store ready and ended up with no communications about important problems many times, first manager was friendly but was left just as stranded as the rest of us"
bad,I was thankful for the opportunity that was given. But no person with responsibilities can live off of the pay they give. Its honestly degrading to me
bad,Great place to work nice place to meet people to work with. The bathroom needs to be cleaner. Bay Shore needs a bigger and keep better products.  Thank you
bad,400 packages an hr min in an 8hr work shift with a 30min lunch break but they expected you to get to 3200 everyday bt 4x8= 32 so how would you get to 3200 when you only work 7 1/2hrs  plus no breaks at all and no help with heavy packagess
bad,"A typical day at work is just stocking from U-boats and cashiering. The management is, in all honesty, a joke. The co-workers however are amazing. The hardest part of the job is the constant drama from managers and the most enjoyable part is working with great people."
bad,"Fellow cashiers we're wonderful to work with,  we all treated each other like family.  HOWEVER managers continuously disrespect their staff AND the customers. Managers would make their staff feel bad about themselves and their work being done.  I have never worked at a place that made me feel so worthless."
bad,"Your typical retail job, not too exciting or challenging. Store manager was great but overall company wasn't helpful or respectful of its employees."
bad,"my first experience in retail. not the greatest, but i managed. started out as a cashier the was promoted to freight manager. very demanding position."
bad,I really didnt enjoy working witah Dollar Tree. They did not give enought hours for people to maintain any type of living. They was not consistant with that at all n the lack of team work bothered me.
bad,"I worked for Dollar Tree a few years ago,, and was not very happy. The three times a shift check to see if you're stealing doesn't make anyone feel very good. I have been a cashier for many years, and I am not a thief, have no criminal record, not even a speeding ticket, and yet was subjected to this level of scrutiny for no reason.  Being required to work off the clock as well didn't sit with me, so I left this employ."
bad,management-alot to be desired     some of the coworkers were really workers and others were lazy  hardest part of the job doing shipment  the most enjoyable was waiting on customers and ringing up there merchandise.
bad,"While I enjoy shopping at Dollar Tree, I didn't find the position to be very challenging and I was looking for full time employment."
bad,havent started working yet but i cant wait i know that there will be endless oppertunitys for me once i start working i really love this place
bad,"Count your drawer as soon as you arrive, "
bad,I love my job I love being a stocker it fun going back in forward but I love working in meeting new people that's come inside my store but I the that's its a part time job I need a full time job am a teen mom with three children under the age 10 I really need the help to better my llife for them
bad,"unload trucks"
bad,Day starts off with stretching then are told what needs to be completed during the 8 hour shift. We then need to execute the plan that was set.
bad,im a cashier. i ring costumers out. clean the front/lobby area. wish there where more hours for us workers. i only get two days a week and theyare only 5 hours per day.
bad,its regular job sales customer service on floors and sometimes stock. the store is very busy everything is a dollar. most busiest during holidays.
bad,"Dollar Tree is a fun job with great customers and associates, but sadly, not enough hours to pay my bills since they consistently hire people so we are forced to stay at less than 15 hours a week!"
bad,can learn a lot about customer services is very busy place. staff work very hard to make sure the customers are happy. Over all if you want a place that will keep you busy for 6-8 hrs come work for this company.
bad,"Regional Director is new; all the talented folks are leaving one at a time which is quite concerning.  Pays well, but it's a 24/7 job."
bad,I got to meet and help new customers and see the daily so as to help them with their shopping needs. Cash handling skills inventory control and customer service. I became cashier of the month.
bad,"Dollar Tree was the perfect job to start my life. The hours are flexible so if you can't work a certain day, you don't. I learned organization attention to detail and how to treat customers at this store."
bad,"It was alright. I enjoyed the opportunity to take smoke breaks whenever. I enjoyed being able to snack on the job. I also liked having shorter shifts, but I was also part time."
bad,"I worked for this company back in 2011, the work wasn't hard, restocking the merchandise and unloading the newly delivered merchandise into the warehouse were the main responsibilities. However the manager at the time was not supportive of her staff at all. No training what so ever for first time employees and criticized employees without proper explanation of what they've done wrong. I don't know about now, but I don't have a good impression about this branch."
bad,"The people I worked with at the Dollar Tree were the best, but as far as being a professional workplace it lacked in a few areas. For example, there were not enough people hired to work so it was very stressful and some weeks, my coworkers and I, left extremely over worked. Other weeks there were too many workers and we only received at best 13 hrs that week."
bad,"Managers have a hard time talking to one another, very dis-organised assistant managers always try and do the managers job even though they were just hired to open and close the store,"
bad,I liked it but the had filled all the position. I built the displays and stocked them. It was fine. Fast paced got to learn about pricing and I like the store so I got to see how it was put together
bad,I felt like the people that worked there hated their job and it was just a horrible mood. especially when you have to stay an extra two hours after it closes just to organize and clean the store.
bad,"A typical day at Dollar Tree depending on the day it can be really laid back or extremely busy with just a cashier or 2 cashiers and a manager for the day. I have learned self-confidence working there, I learned how to become better at customer service as far as helping customers with things they need to find, balloon orders, making sure i cut the tag off sunglasses if i notice its nice out, double bagging items that are heavy, wrapping glass or fragile things that may break, keep things like bleach, Hydrogen Peroxide, alcohol, etc in sepearate bags, and helping the elderly with putting the bags in the cart for them as well as holding the door for them, and asking if they need help taking them out to their cars. Management is unorganized. No one ever knows about anything as far as what tasks need to be done and completed. They usually sit in the office most of the day unless there is a truck to unload their freight. Management just gets to do what they want any time I have a huge line and I call up for help when I'm the only cashier, they get really upset. Customers get upset when its only me and no other cashiers, I have no choice but to call for help. My Co-workers are Awesome. Everyone I work with over the weekends are friendly and I enjoy talking to them. The hardest part of the job is mainly the help with management when it gets too busy and the scheduling is never right. By the time I actually know when to be there or not I have to call and ask if I am scheduled just to be on the safe side. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the customers. The customers that"
bad,"It was hard learning to operate the register considering it was my first time but enjoyable to learn how to properly ring up customer items. Counted til before, during, and after after every single shift. Managers and coworkers were decent but weren't very informative or helpful on daily tasks."
bad,"I was suppose to be a cashier but because the store head manager was not good at finish her job, I ended up doing about three times the work that was expected of me. I was always cleaning her messes up."
bad,"If you are looking for a management position that still offers a work/life balance, look elsewhere!  As a manager you are often one of the only people in the store.  That would make you the cashier, the sales floor customer service, the phone operator, etc.  It is just poor planning on the part of upper management to not have enough staff to allow management freedom of movement throughout the store."
bad,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree to a point. I enjoyed my co-workers but since it was only part time the hours and pay weren't the best which is the main reason I didn't stay with them.
bad,"I worked at dollar tree for a short period of time, and my experience there was productive. My co-workers were friendly, and management wasn't that bad either. My primary position was unloading trucks and stocking shelves. I performed my job duties well. Overall, my experience with dollar tree, was okay."
bad,"Assisted customer in locating merchandise"
bad,"A typical day at work is performing job tasks that don't seem possible but just having to do the best that you can. I learned from being employed here that this company is not a job you put faith in to advance or for promotion. This was my first job, so initially I was happy and willing to work as hard as possible but after awhile the work I was doing was not being fully appreciated nor was worth the minimum wage pay. My co-workers were cool. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers and being stressed from the high demands despite the low pay. The most enjoyable part was just knowing that I had a job and I was gaining some type of experience to move on to a better place of employment."
bad,"don't work here, ever, this place is terrible and management never has a clue what they are doing"
bad,"Do not like it at all very unorganized, the manager was stealing and very rude"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the general public.
bad,i like to keep busy at work and the dollar tree is always busy always have something to do
bad,Uptempo Place To work.Good Job to have to make some quick money.There are perks but you have to advance in the company.
bad,a typical day at work is very easy getting set up where your at but when the work starts thats when your working really hard. Its an ok place to work but in my opinion don't work at dollar tree distribution center it has poor management and they have the best co-workers there they just need to know how to work with the associates but they cut everyones  pay for the holidays the reason why? you have to ask them about it even though its no where to be found on google maps but anyways goodluck.
bad,"Prepare manual conveyer line to replenish store inventory, of existing  products and potential new merchandise. "
bad,Co-workers and customers help me learn american english and american life
bad,"A typical day at this job, mainly just included stocking shelves with product.  I was never properly trained how to use the cash register so that was not a part for me to do."
bad,Working at Dollar Tree Deals is Just regular. Go work and leave. Hardest Part of my job is dealing with unruly customers. Most enjoyable part of my job is doing customer service. I really do like getting to help and provide with their needs. Managers and coworkers are fairly wonderful.
bad,Working there was a very interesting experience. Although it is really not where I wanted to be
bad,"Low pay, low hours. It just wouldn't cut it for me. Minimum wage, and low hours."
bad,"a typical work day would be to go and find what stock is for my aisle and grab it. put up as much stock as possible in a 6 hour span. stay to myself. then take a 10 minute break and repeat the same over again, and then clock out. very boring, repetitive job, using zero brain knowledge only man power."
bad,Everyone i worked with was really nice they just didnt give enoygh hours
bad,I enjoyed running the cash register and putting out freight but the manager could use some management skills improvement!
bad,"paper work, cash control, deployment of tasks,ordering,stocking,tear downs setups.etc.that great customer service get you return happy customers.the hardestest part was the heavy lifting all day long.the best part was the people I encountered every day."
bad,Long and hard to maintain stock count the hardest part of the day is putting out 40 boxes on the shelf a hour to maintain the store the most enjoyable is working with co-workers who believe in helping one another
bad,"They send to much junk into their stores and expect you to move it. Here is an example of one summer. The store I had, had got 3 pallets of pickles that were 8 ft tall. In a town of 4000. My challenge was to display and sell. Sorry but the town was pickled out....LOL I did sell 3/4 of a pallet. At the time I was there. They went through 8 mangers in the district I was in and was looking for 3. Their concept is good but not the support they give their management teams is not good at all. The guy that took my place asked me when I had came in to shop one day , How did you do it? The freight is ridiculous, I told him do the best you can. He said he was and putting in 12 hrs a day. Told him yep I know what you mean. Then he told me they threatened him that if he didn't get the back room clear he was gone. I told him I heard that too. A lot of managers were always threatened. I don't condone threats that's why I'm no longer with them."
bad,Working here I learn how to appreciate what I already had or have. The job consist of loading and unloading the container and cleaning.
bad,"Stocking, good management, co-workers didnt really talk to them, hardest part was trying to find some more work there, best part of job would be when I found something else to do."
bad,"unloading truck, stock merchandise, managed staff, ordering merchandise, customer service. Worked with very competent, pleasant people. There was no difficult part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers each day."
bad,"Summer job to make and save some extra money! Learned how to work as a cashier in a busy environment, also stocked different products all day and had to work with excellent customer service"
bad,I don't get many hours at Dollar Tree.Hours are based on sales.I think the job is ok but I need more hours.
bad,We got new coworkers constantly. This job was not consistant.
bad,Most of the time its not busy. I found myself just walking around with nothing to do. The days are slow but its a nice place to work. 
bad,"  I enjoyed working with many different individuals and age groups in this setting.  The customers were especially an enjoyable part of my day.  This was a very busy, multi-tasked job, and I did enjoy learning more about the retail competition."
bad,A typical day at work is checking customers out while also stocking merchandise. I have learned alot working for Dollar Tree. Management is great coldnt ask for better managers. Co-workers are ok not the greatest. They always call in and are not reliable. The hardest part of the job is everything if you do it right. The most enjoyable part of the job is cashier. You get to meet new people every day even though some are rude you just have to be nice and move on with your work day.
bad,"I helped originally set the store up and took pride in the store and my work ethic reflected just that, i would go above and beyond always for the customers and they really appreciated that.I worked hard on making the store always clean and neat."
bad,This job had its up's and downs with me when i had family emergency i felt as if it was a burdon to ask for the day off. Also being in school they did give me great hours after school but when i needed a day off for school activities it was as if i was asking for a month off so i rarely asked for time off.
bad,"everyday at that place is very frustrating for me. The U-boats they load out for me to stock are always packed with boxes and are all ready to topple over at any minute, and the back room is usually pretty unorganized, with boxes laying around everywhere. The manager always orders stuff that we don't even need, so we are finding ourselves trying to stock out boxes of stuff that we can't even fit out. We get truck loads that consist of as much as 900 boxes, which is ridiculous for our somewhat small backroom that's already cluttered with boxes. I also feel that they are making a job as simple as stocking way more difficult than it needs to be: First of all, they only give you a certain amount of time to stock an aisle, which to me is ridiculous. They give u this ""stocker performance slip"" that you have to fill out with each U-boat, filling out how many boxes are on said U-boat, what time you started stocking it out, how long it should take you, etc. They also give out write-ups for too many things. For example, if you stock things in the wrong place, you'll be written up. If you stock too slowly, you'll be written up. If things aren't cleaned properly, you'll be written up. It's as if no matter what you do there you are always gonna feel like you will be written up for it. Plus they're training is a little on the poor side. They'll show you what to do like super fast and expect you to know exactly what you're doing soon afterward. The time limits are what bug me the most. Especially when you find you are putting stuff in the wrong place and constantly having to move it around"
bad,"It's an okay job for now,just looking another job with more pay."
bad,"I did a lot of customer service, answer phones, I liked all my co-workers and the hardest part about that job was that it use to get rob a lot because the location it was in. But I enjoyed doing what I did."
bad,"Dollar Tree was good in the beginning, but there was no growth for me and no benefits as all jobs but Management are part-time."
bad,"Typical day for me ws 530pm to 930pm of gathering go backs 530 to 640 give or take..soet then go to break ,return and put gobacks in coreect isles while front facing also customer service,assisting cashiers and.manager ,loss prevention,security and janitoril"
bad,Pay at any level below the store management level is very non competitive. The training available through the company made it very easy to grow and advance.
bad,at my time of employment the dm was rude to me before I became assistant manager when people didn't show for shifts the extra workload became the managers plus juggling the store employees was not held accountable for tardiness or no show
bad,Worked in excess of 110 hours a week through xmas. Was guaranteed wouldn't need to work more than 50 hours per week when hired. Immediately mandated 60 hours per week.
bad,"I enjoyed working at dollar tree, unfortunaley, I had child care problems, and my children unfortantly got sick with visruses in there mouth. I was only late once, the only thing I didn't like is there was only a 10minute break because cashier only receive 5hours. and you also couldn't get over time, otherwise I really enjoyed working there and very easy and laid back."
bad,"The work itself is easy. Either you stay at the register or you are stocking. Customers are always happy and most of them will give you conversation."
bad,Dollar tree was very. Nice.  People were nice.   But some mangers  didn’t have.the patience to teach people. Or train anybody.   Some mangers were very nasty.
bad,my job was great. my boss was awesome but she is no longer there. we always had a great working experience together. they train you well and help you when you need it.
bad,"As a manager I was getting calls all the time, my hours would change last minute, was given unrealistic goals, unable to call off, and only make about 75cent more than the cashiers."
bad,My direct supervisor was awesome. People above them have no clue what is going on in stores. The job is very stressful. There pay is so so. The benefits are pretty good
bad,"Hard labor with high quotas is the name of the game for production workers. Top that with management that does not train, give advice, or care. A maintenance position is your best bet. This is the best place for a entry level job in maintenance."
bad,At this Job you have to do a little of everything there is no single task. Be prepared to be put to work in areas of discomfort. The payment is very low.
bad,I started working before the store opened helped build and set up store started as a cashier and went to becoming assist manager ... Pay wasn't as good as they promised
bad,"This is pretty much a dead end job. Fast paced environment with a good team. Other then the people I worked for, this job was not for me. More of a hands on person."
bad,ok place to work if you desperately need a job. can be stressful. crazy workload. not enough hours to complete work. pay needs to increase. very understaffed.
bad,Loved the job but hated the pay and it takes forever to advance. Most of the managers are really nice. Wonderful job environment and you'll never get bored.
bad,"This is a great job to have. I just found it hard to be there at 5am, I have no car at the moment but fun job.I wasnt here long so dont know much but I learned alot. You must be able to lift 40 lbs and stand on your feet for 5 hrs"
bad,"enjoyed working here until I left"
bad,a typical day at work consist of greeting co-workers clock in get my work details for the day. then completing all task but at the same time interacting with my co-workers witch makes my days go by faster.
bad,"Productive place to work if you have the right team in place, and you have the right people working for you. Becoming a manager for the company is very stressful and does take a lot out of you. You don't have a life anymore because your at the store majority of the time, and they locate you far away from your home, so travel time can be up to an hour away from where you live.  The company does not pay very well either unless you are a general manager and even at that they require so much out of you that their turn over rate to much at times.  A 40 hour work week that you would normally work turns into a 55-60 hour work week, and your salary, so your only paid for 40 of it."
bad,I did the same task from day to day. The most enjoyable part was helping customers. The hardest part was sorting the inventory. I learned how to work faster.
bad,Loved this job one of my favorites this job helped me an so many ways
bad,"The cashiers are sometimes expected to do to much on a busy workday "
bad,Is a good place to started they help you to be more comfortable person in your area.
bad,"Ive been with the company for 4 years and it’s not a good company to work for, the pay is low, most workers are slow and don’t last, and there isnt a set schedule for my position. Definitely not a good career path if i had to say so myself."
bad,"Dollar tree was only busy November to January which were the only 3 months employees got good hours and would get paid well, after the holidays the company was slow and not a lot of hours were given and the business was slow."
bad,"The place I work was okay but there was things that I didn't like. How they treated their employee and manager, they need to hired people that want to work"
bad,"I didn't get to work long enough to write a review. I only working  there during the start up, it was a good place to work for, management was very nice."
bad,This is a great first job. It is slow at times and fast at times. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a job that is good pay. The pay is ok. I think you get paid for what you do. You don't do much. Again it's only good for a first time job and that's it.
bad,•	Enduring high level of customers satisfaction
bad,very easy job. you meet diferent people every day your team workers help you out when needed. manager is very understanding . they work with you and your schedule.
bad,"It's a very stressful job you have to be on your feet all day long and not enough help.  They expect alot from you and not get much in return, they have alot to change"
bad,This is a good company I enjoy working for dollar because I love interacting with the public. I have been with the company for 6 1/2 years and I enjoy what I do.
bad,good company to work for..but can be very stressful when they put stores to close together..no competitive wages for hiring people which causes high turnover
bad,Over the years the company has forgotten about who helps make them the company that can thrive and that's the workers. Pushes numbers to the point it loses all of the good employees threw burn out and lack of appreciation.
bad,"it's was okay,not enough communication. There wasn't enough hours for someone who's trying to save up and attend college but a good work environment ."
bad,"A typical day is stocking shelves at 4am and breaking down boxes, i leraned how to problem solve and see the results before starting a task, the mangement was unorganized and my co-workers made it a fun environment, The hardest part of the job was stocking all the items pff your cart in 30min and the most enjoyable was helping out with the customers."
bad,Cooperate does not care about their employees. Compensation is horrible for the amount of work expected. Would not recommend. Not worth the stress of the job.
bad,"This is a good company but the pay rate is terrible!! If you have a family or bills, then this won't help you at all. They only offer part time hours and with the pay rate you barley bring home 250"
bad,"Great management, breaks are flexible, and workday is steady. There isn't really anything difficult with the job at all, it's a slow and steady position."
bad,"Management is very supportive and helpful; an environment is lighthearted with fun employees. Freedom to set merchandise without planogram. Ability to show skills and creativity. Unfortunately, there is not much chance for any advancement it is a good job for part time work. They hire three times the people that they need and then give everyone twenty hours or less a week. It's the kind of job for retired individuals or students. I had an excellent experience with dollar tree. The people were great. The only issue with dollar tree is most of it is part time, and the pay is minimum wage which doesn't get you very far. Ideal for people how haven't worked much and needed experience."
bad,"A typical day would be to cash out every customer, put away anything customers leave behind in their designated aisles, clean around the registers by sweeping, changing the garbage, and by picking anything up that was left around the cash station. It is also my duty to clean the front seasonal area and the front end-caps to make sure it looks presentable when customers walk in. "
bad,"The job was pretty hard, but overall it wasn't  too bad, the hours weren't too long and the pay was great, we loaded boxes from a conveyor belt onto a freight truck."
bad,It was a great first job with no problems but at a point in time it was just way to dramatic for me and I was surrounded by adults. But I will say that they work with you and your life.
bad,"This was an easy job, restocking and cashiering and customer service. And the training was fun and the manager was very nice overall the people are great i was just there part time"
bad,Working at dollar tree was a first time retail experience and I have learned so much becoming a merchandise manager in a short amount of time. Of course I had to be trained as I took on the position but I caught on and took the challenges.
bad,I have learned many skills while working there and I learn the customers needs come first it was fun and fast paced keeps you 0on your feet a lot and the pay is good
bad,"working at dollar tree showed me that it isn't easy nor being and doing a half-stepping job going to be accepted where you work at. "
bad,"Daily customer service"
bad,"My experience there was fun actually. I put stuff where they were suppose to go and redecorate the shelf's and satisfied the costumers. "
bad,Not something that iwould want to do long term want to find something that is pays more not interested in a job that is limited to hours per week they can give out
bad,The job is ok to work at but the service there is very horibble and I don't like that quality of the work envirmonet that was at the resutuarnst I would profer another work place
bad,Theirs no much to tell about Dollar Tree only that the Management were kind. But the place needs a cleanup specially the rug.
bad,"In essence, I simply couldn't keep up with it and had to leave to do other things. I wouldn't recommend working here but the hours are flexible and the manager I had was really sweet."
bad,"It was fun working at dollar tree very nice team members and customers i loved it, it was nothing but fun their,  i enjoyed getting up every morning going in to see my boss and my team members they treated me like family."
bad,"pack out merchandise on to sales floor"
bad,"A typical day at work for me was simple. Clock in, and go straight to the warehouse to get my U-boat filled with merchandise. I would finish the U-Boat of about 50 -80 boxes, and start all over again."
bad,I loved my job but not enough hours. I would have stay if I was able to make more hours. The manager there was great with me helping after work hours. But wasnt on the clock.
bad,"Cashier stocked whatever needed to be done vacuum took trash out"
good,The amount of pay is insufficient for the work requirements. The employees are treated like thieves with no respect and trust what so ever. I felt insulted
good,"While the freight manager was great to work for and knew the most as bout the store....the store manager couldn't keep employee availability straight and didntalk to you with any kind of respect. She would continuously speak down to you, blame other people for things she herself had done, and showed very little care about any of her employees."
good,I only worked here for a few months but in those months I saw just how bad the management really was! I wouldn’t recommend working here to anyone! Just overall bad!
good,I've been there for a month and I feel like I've been getting treated differently then everyone else. I've been doing most of the hard work while the managment just sit around.
good,No help to be found ever they took cigret breaks alot said to work cashier only no baloonarea then no ones was found and they're was a line so i went to help they were mad
good,"experience in grand rapids was excellent. Owosso not so great. "
good,It is an okay place to work. As long as you work. I had managers who did not care and only made certain people work so I did not like it at all. I heard other stores were better.
good,I worked very hard a dollar tree to only be treated like the help at the end. I started before the seasonal ppl I helped many customers always said hello. I greeted everyone one with a smile. I came to work when other people called in absent I was the one they called. I feel betrayed!
good,"I enjoy working with people.  Im a people person. A typical day at work is locationg merchandise.  I have learn all peoples are not the same.  Management is supportive.  Dollar tree is a great enviorment.  The hardest part of my job is gettting a customer thats never satisfied. Most enjoyable part of the job, is seeing the customer leave with a smile."
good,"At one point I was happy working there. But Dollar Tree as a whole company from what I've seen in the almost 3 years of working there, doesn't value nor appreciate their employees or mangers. They are more worried about making money than having good reliable, hard working, I love my job type of people to work for & run their company. Turnover rate is high & pay rate is low."
good,Dollar tree pay is low and they do not provide enough hours. My co-workers are great people and we all get along very well. The shifts are very short and need to be longer with a higher pay. I have been there for one year and I have not received a raised. I enjoy the understanding and compassionate staff.
good,"There has been no air conditioning in the store since I have worked there, several companies have been sent to look at it but none have come back to fix it. Very poor management."
good,When you call in if you or your child is sick the store manager throws a huge fit. The pay sucks. You can barely live off of it. It feels like you are still in high school with how much drama there is.
good,Good place to work.alot of hours always short handed.a all of my employees were great hard working.i worked right beside them stocked shelf's cleaned shelf's put things away.sweep moped unloaded truck.went to the bank.worked slot of hours.
good,"Definitely helped my organization skills, store was constantly dirty, customers where rude at times. Kept low staffed at all times because of corporate greed. Both supervisors I had where kind until we received new management."
good,Just because everything in the store cost a dollar doesn't mean you  have to under pay the employees. This is a good job for a teenager. Not suitable for an adult.
good,I was manager there for  4 years.  The DM at the time was not a good DM you would do the best you could do with the store size you had but it was never good enough for him.  The corporate office had plan a grams they wanted you to do but it was to there makeshift store never worked for our store. Would work you butt off for them and they was never satisfied.  Then to find out they put in as a no rehire because they believed things from other employees that was upset they didn't get manager when I quit.
good,"It's a great store to shop, but working there is a different deal.  I would get talked down to in front of customers over procedures I'd never done on the register. The manager didn't speak to workers with respect 70% of the time.  I had to sit her down about that, she admitted she was wrong apologized and even changed her attitude, right before transferring to another store.   They are cleaning the store with an ancient vacuum, it never fails to have a day off and get called in.  I don't mind helping on my day off, but not every day off.  The store is always like an oven, not a pleasant shopping experience."
good,get there clock in and grab my cart and start filling shelves. Honestly that was one of the worst jobs poeple would always call out and i would have to stay late mostly everyday. hrrible maegment horrible people non motivated.
good,I was trained in management and after being trained they said I was not management material. The other managers that worked over me would change my days around all the time. On my days off I would be out of town with my children and they would call me and tell me I needed to be there at work when they would not talk to me about giving me those hours. And they would right me up for something they had done.
good,These people over work you and don't give you enough hours or pay the manager is ignorant and very stuck up she's not a nice person I don't recommend this job to anyone
good,I loved the job when we had out first SM. Then she left after 8 years and we got a new guy who only cared about sitting around making himself look good. That's when all the work fell on everyone else i the store. It went from an enjoyable dream job to a nightmare. No body liked coming into work anymore. We all picked up 10 times more work daily. We would get our weekly truck to put out and stocking the shelves would be interrupted by our single cashier for the day to help her as back up. The one or two extra stockers didn't know how to stock. The stock room started to pile up. The lines were long and customers complained. The shelves were empty. No part of the job was enjoyable.
good,It was ok I was only part tine you got small pay  the best part of the day  the custer   I hope it get  you get more money for all the work you do not just 4 cent after I year of time with dollar tree I was hoping for more then 4cent at the end of my time the last one was 15cent after still  after 3 years with the dollar tree only at 8.05 I was not happy at the end of my time there
good,unless you know and are in good with management you will not get ahead.will not pay enough to there employees to be able to afford for there families. will not work for this company again.
good,"I have been working for this co. for 3 years, and just anyone can come in and take your hours, if they like them better.  Managers are allowed to schedule you as much or as least as they want.  3% every year raise, which is ok.  They work you really hard too."
good,making sure the customers are taken care in a friendly and speedily manner
good,This is an easy place to work at but the managers make the job difficult.
good,I loved my coworkers and the customers. It was really a fun place to work.
good,"You would begin by opening store setting up registers to start the day. Then you would do the appleseed which lines up your jobs for the day. Then you would really start your day by setting endcaps,stocking,and taking care of the cashiers needs and helping customers and talking to them.The manager was untrained and did not know what he was doing. Some of my co workers were great and others were ok.The hardest part of the job. Was tring to get twenty jobsdone at once and not being able to make no happy.I really in joyed my job until the last year."
good,The pay is low and there is never enough hours to work to make a living they will hire anybody including drug addicts and they don’t care about there employees they have unrealistic expectations of there employees and the stores are always dirty
good,i enjoyed working with employees.  i enjoyed working with customers and providing customer service to them. i have been in the customer service industry all of my life.
good,There was absolutely no organization at this company. The hiring process is all over the place. Scheduling is also not organized. I dreaded going to work every day while working at this store.
good,The new store manager was good in the being but as time went on she got a big head and did what she wanted for the store. Breaks was a joke as well and you only have 10 minutes to eat and no time for the rest room.
good,"Loved the people I worked with, very easy to pick up but wasnt trained properly and had to learn on my own. Not really anyway to move up in the company and management was terrible."
good,I wasn't getting enough hours usually less than 20 hours a week. The pay isnt great.  Wanted more hours and pay. I couldn't pay bills on 7.35 hour. They should b paying at least 10.00 an hour.
good,"My major complaint about the job is that the hours vary from week to week. While this is how most retail jobs are, I feel that it is especially concerning and difficult at Dollar Tree because you can go from an opening shift one day to a closing shift the next to opening again the next day."
good,Has it's slow & busy times through out the day. Hardest part is keeping the store organized as some customer make a mess & put stuff in random places.
good,"Schedule was changed daily. No set hours. Poor management skills, did not follow through with instructions. Hired incompetent workers. Hours were not distributed evenly."
good,"Management was untrained,  corporate and Hwere slow to respond if they respond and very non supportive.  They expect 5 star work ethics when they over work you for minimum pay."
good,"Overall, dollar tree was not the best place to work due to unorganized aisles and the amount of hours I got. I worked one day a week. It was also dirty and  I had 3 different managers while I was there."
good,the dollar tree I work for is not an ideal place to work. it is very stressful more stressful than it should be and its because of certain people that work there.
good,Give it a 4 out of 10. Very well treated there. Became very good friends with all associates there. Management was very knowledgeable about the store.
good,Always wants to tell you how to do things but were not doing them herself. She was rude in every way. No respect for her employees or herself. Always on the phone when suppose to be working.
good,But there is poor management i t was a second job i tried to have them fix my hours like a second job and they didnt want to work with me soo i left..
good,The excellent experience; I was able to implement my own management style.  Had issues with upper management when I attempted to keep our store moving forward when two of the full-time managers just quit.
good,"My experiences in two different stores. One was great, calm, good management, and the other one was unstable, not so good management. It depends on how you work, who they like, or who they trust, they would get the hours. The pay isn't good at all! At first I just love to work there one of my favorite stores. But when the shift manager don't like you because don't know why, they treat you different from others. Couldn't work for that little pay and unprofessional behavior."
good,I got calls from a Manager calling me in like 3 hours early with no Schedule. I had to keep calling Cashiers because lines were to much to bear. The manager barely does anything I was short a couple dollars and she was watching the cameras recording and made me feel like I was in a incrimination when I did not steal. That is why I quite at Dollar Tree because they have no regard for emotions.
good,"Pay is horrible DM very ""biased"" Its hard doing your job knowing  my coworkers with no experience getting paid more I have 15yrs of retail management."
good,Managing after the store manager leaves is a lot of responsibility than what i was expecting but confidence boosted my morality into making this job seem more fun than what associates made it out to be. I tried to be more of a fun but also insistent towards my employees.
good,"cashier stocking was a typical work day"
good,"una empresa con buen ambiente laboral, pero con poca seriedad"
good,Job was great because it gave me time to focus on school. A typical work day I would come in in the morning and make sure the cooler was filled with pop and water. While im doing this there are other associates filling up the isles with merchandise from truck. On a slow day im searching the store for stuff to do. When its busy some stuff may not get put away which causes issues among other co worker.
good,mangment sucks at this store no one cant be sick or have a family but the store manger can spend time with her family she dont care about the people who works there
good,Decline to comment I feel it is an individual opinion where some one works and it is an individuals responsibility to choose the company that suits their needs.
good,Didn't like it because if the people ... And it was very far from my house I really need a job where j can get ttoo... Didn't understand me at any point and doesn't get my life history
good,this business was very unorganized and not a very good place to work for minimum wage. Very unreliable workers with no consequences for last minute call offs. Made it very stressful to work because I always had to do multiple peoples jobs including store manager.
good,"I learned that it doesn't matter if you have open availability, come in every time a co-worker calls off or does a no-call-no-show to cover their shifts. Because you still don't get the recognition deserved by management. Its severely frowned upon to have any kind of co-worker friendships, barely allowed to talk/laugh/or have any kind of interpersonal communicating between employees. Fun is not allowed at all. Everyone is basically miserable. This store location isn't able to hold on to new hired employees for longer than a few weeks."
good,"Assisting customers with gratitude, I've learned the register and how to stock."
good,I loved working at the Dollar Tree because I like to work with people. It was my pleasure to serve all of my customers during the holiday season. The store manager was the downside to the job. He was not vocal and did not communicate well with his employees.
good,"A typical day at the dollar tree consists of me pursuing multiple tasks along side with my main tasks assigned to me written on a apple seed which is a task sheet you sign  to give a consent expressing that you've completed everything that was written down. Although The given tasks can be very stressful especially if the manager of the evening is super busy! he or she can become very impatient and impolite at times, but I still carry on my tasks at the fullest of my ability when tasks or things seem to get me down. Because you cant always get things done 100% but what keeps me up are some of our valuable customers, and co-workers that say to you keep your head up high and you can only do as much as you can!"
good,Would have had an better experience if the store had a manager who cared and kept the store organized and stocked. My store manager had her picks and chooses for who she wanted to be friends with and everyone else be damned.
good,Great work experience. Managers can be a but rude and there inconsiderate of peoples home life. Dont work with u on your hours and couldn't keep a manager at the store
good,Not appreciated for efforts made by employees.  Required to work while clocked out for meal time.  Comments to employees are mostly negative very few complimentary. Low pay ever increasing work expectations
good,"this job is NOT for anyone with kids or self respect."
good,"the store is weak"
good,"I worked at dollar tree for over a year , the management needs to treat the other employees with respect , other then that it's a good work place."
good,"I didnt enjoy working here for a few reasons such as being a college student and only wanting to work certain days but they force you to work during the week without having a car. I never called out except once when i studied for an exam, my store manager told me i could be terminated because of it. She never wants to tell associates things herself, she makes the assistant managers do it for her. She picks guys over females. She never tells the males they are doing a bad job but if a female messes up, she gets on them. I had a cashier working with me who was always coming to work doped up on drugs and he never got fired. I worked my rear end off and got treated terribly. Its a good first job to see how the retail business works and to meet new people. Customers are sometimes nice and then you have complete immature and rude who will make you feel like everyone in the world is against you."
good,"I worked with a lot of good people , but I couldn't get any more than 10-15 hours a week.. after 2 1/2 years of doing this I was tired of not making money"
good,"Dollar Tree being my first job, I learned a lot and am still grateful for the opportunity. However, I did not enjoy working in that environment because I felt that the managers were hostile and didn't create a great working experience. I felt that I needed to challenge myself and try other work environments."
good,The best part of the job was seeing the regular customers... The hardest part of the job was the recovery of the store. I like some of my co-workers due to the fact I was the oldest worker and everyone else was very young. Management was changed so many times I have nothing ta say about it. What I learned was to just do my job and keep to myself. It was the only way to be.
good,"If you like to be constantly busy and get a lot of hours, this is not the job for you. It worked well with me for a while because it was only 5 hour shifts and it worked with my school schedule. But I eventually needed more hours and money."
good,"My experience at Dollar Tree has so far been mostly negative. There's no benefits at all for part-time workers, especially college students. The management is terrible, and so are the hours. I am a freshman in college and this is my first job and I'm so upset that my first working experience had to be at this company. "
good,I enjoyed working there except when it came to me completing the last step of my medical schooling. They did not really work with me when it came to a flexible situation.
good,"Dollar Tree was my first job coming out of high school. I was mostly a cashier and stocked the front end of the store. i learned about working the cashier and how to handle money. My co worker was alright didn't get to work with all of them, just mostly managers .Didn't really get detailed training on the cashier being a first time worker."
good,"stressful, stressful, stressful, disorganized mess most of the time... No lie there wasn't enough hours at all. the customers were great I miss the Employee's I worked with but this Just wasn't the Job for me that's all I am going to say"
good,"I'm a current employee at the Charlottesville store and I was the assistant manager. I drop down because I was truly thrown in my position without being shown exactly what I needed to know. I was promised hours that I only got for two to three weeks and after that hours were cut. Everyone seems to be for them self, and you make goals just so the manager can reap the benefits. You do the same as the other three managers that are full time but you receive no benefits with the headache. It was fun at first but once the other manager goes behind your back sending text pictures to the other manager it's ridiculous. There is No team work because I have been on am shift and pm shift, no work from am should be left for pm shift and no pm shift work should be left for am shift. Not enough employees scheduled to get it done. All in all needs some better management."
good,"run register, stock shelves, and wait on customers. Not a fun place to work. Management is always changing. Co-workers are friendly. Unloading the trucks is the hardest part of the job. I liked meeting new people."
good,Dollar Tree is a good company for those seeking a part time employment. As a Assistant Manger you may be guaranteed 20-25 hours; but the pay is minimal.
good,different managers everytime you turned around its all about retail
good,I was there for a couple of months and Management was not very helpful nor friendly.
good,working as a cashier meeting and greeting customers very friendly atmosphere daily closing of store most enjoyable meeting new people.
good,"Clock in, begain working on cashier."
good,I wasn't at these job that long to write an review.The pay was not the greatest.I was a cashier.
good,"a typical day at work was just being a cashier, not making any good money but they want you to work for hours pay is horrible, if youre not apart o management you will make less than min. wage "
good,"The manager of this store was not given much to work with, since his DM was calling every day telling him to send people home, but his general attitude also left much to be desired. He talked trash about the company, not only in our presence, but in the presence of customers as well. He also talked bad about the type of people who frequented the store, stating that they were the main reason why he couldn't sell anything because all they do is steal, which he would also say duirng operation hours in front of customers!"
good,"compensation is min wage and the hrs are very low. Typically got 15 hrs week or less. There is no job security. example the store mgr I had was with the company 20+ yrs and last week they decided that they could get rid of him and get someone else at a lower pay rate. the way I know this is because any time they needed a mgr at a store within 30 miles to train,or just needed help for a day or so they always sent him because he was so good at what he did and he had been doing it for so long. The reason they gave for getting rid of him was sooooo lam and made no sense."
good,the crew was a lot of fun management not so much but i have learned a lot by workin there i think the hardest part of the job was a few guess but at the same time it was the most enjoyable
good,"Upper management micro-manages won't allow front line Managers to do their job. HR questions integrity of leadership team; double standard, and the rules bend based on the situation."
good,The hardest part about this job is getting everything back into order at the end of the day. The small items are the worst.  They have to be just right on the shelf
good,It is a job not a career if that is what you look for.i set up a few of them I have the knowledge to run one but they don't take this to mind. They will over look you
good,I work much harder it seems than most of my peers. I also am always on time and never call out and when my peers do I cover their shift when I am out of my classes. If you want to progress don’tcount on it.
good,"This was a pretty laid back job, everyone here was very helpful when needed, kept the store clean at all times. It definitely a good job for someone who is new to working."
good,Upon employment they will tell you that you will be able to transfer to other stores. IT is not true. Always understaffed. Benefits: paid time off if you get it approved and a 401K after one year as a part time manager.
good,I'd say the hardest part of the job was the fact I worked there when I first found out I was pregnant until I had my daughter. I had a horrible migraine 1 day and it caused me to faint n hit my head. Well I told my manager once I got up off the ground and she told me to take my 10 min break to gather myself and get back to work. I felt very disrespected and unappreciated so I told her I had to leave for the day. Later that night I gave birth to my daughter at home on my couch on the basement
good,"Not enough hours to support business demands  "
good,"I worked ther for over two years, I was hands down their best employee other than a couple managers. I showed up everydayand I never got a chance to advance nor did I receive even a nickel pay increase. After two years, still making minimum wage."
good,"A typical day of working at Dollar Tree would be working as a team player. If a person was on a break, another would have to fill in for that person. Also the job was structured that during a work day you can be a customer service person, cashier, recovery of items. The day was constantly changing with your duties."
good,"When you first get there, they have someone who's been there for a while train you. The people that they put me with spoke hardly no English which made it hard for us to understand each other."
good,"Dollar tree has unrealistic expectations without the payroll to achieve those expectations."
good,"I was not shown how to use the register, where the time clock was located, basically shown the register and told to get to busy.  Call if I had any problems.  Work schedules are inconsistent, no employee handbooks, no lockers for employees personal items.  And with the managers lack of people skills and ""I'm busy don't bother me ""attitudes makes working at this dollar tree store very stressful and tense to the point employees only stay until they find another job."
good,Dollar tree is an ok place to work at. Definitely not a long term job to have. The rest of the employees are really nice. I’ve enjoyed working there and I do recommend for a first job.
good,The location I worked was constantly being robbed. The management and employees were stealing. Also the manager loved keeping up drama within the employees and customers.
good,wish I could've actually got hours on the schedule I feel as though I was the most consistent worker at the time but the store had just opened so hours were limited
good,"This is my second time with dollartree and they have basically stayed the same from 10 years ago no upgrades really or pay increase, benefits. Its a job temporarily until you find something better."
good,It was ok if you didnt really need a job but wanted extra cash. They couldnt keep the schedule the same for more than a day. I loved my coworkers but not upper management.
good,"The job itself wasn't too terrible, however the managers weren't very good. The store manager would pick and choose who to get onto and let a lot of things slide that shouldn't have. A couple assistant managers were decent, though. Very low pay for the amount of work you do with little to no chances for raises. The main manager associates had issues with was later terminated, however."
good,Lots of managers doing the minimum to keep the store afloat. The store was always a mess hard environment to work in. The other works had no motivation and we're constantly quiting. Turn over was ridiculous. Other employees always late no matter if clerk or management.
good,On a typical day the day might start off slow but Dollar Tree is a very busy store you have to be a fast worker. Also you have to know how to multitask while greeting customers and helping them out. I think the hardest part for me was unloading the truck on delivery days. The most enjoyable part was just working with friendly people and everybody getting along with each other.
good,"It’s Was Good, Just Wish It’s Payed A little Better. Management Needed To Be checking on Employee More Often. But They Do The Best They Can. If The Pay Is Better Locals Will Make The Place Run Forever"
good,"I was hired on the spot as a stocker in Utica since I worked in Herkimer previously. Within a week I was asked to start cashiering, due to previous experience. I would unload trucks in the morning with the other stockers and if they needed cashiering back-up they would call me to the front. Dollar Tree is not a bad place to work but communication has always been important to me whilst working. I talked to management and told them I needed 20-30 hours within the next week and I came in the next day when the schedule came out and I had been scheduled literally one day while a few other co-employees had overtime. I told management I'd found another job."
good,A typical day at the Dollar Tree consisted of putting away freight and working the cash register along with keeping the store clean. My main job was to provide excellent customer service to all of our customers and greet them as they entered the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers.
good,"Management was not in sync. Too many managers and not enough workers. Not a lot of work ethics shown by management. Workers not happy about short breaks, or the pay. No security so did not feel safe during the night shifts"
good,"I enjoyed working at The Dollar Tree. I was grateful for the job. I moved on to a closer, better paying retail job. "
good,wasnt to bad some managers are nice others not so much could have some improvement in a few areas no discounts not enough hours given even when asked they wouldnt let you pick up extra shifts
good,"Fast pace working environment .if you are ready to work under stress I recommend this place to work .pressure is number one as a store manager ...."
good,In SC Dollar Tree is not the best be to be working. They pay very little for to much work. There are no discounts or benefits. There is no overtime. You have to enjoy not doing much outside of standing in the same place your whole shift on a hard floor. And if you are stocking you are still getting minimum wage and to much work.
good,"In my 1+ years working at Dollar Tree, I feel like everything has gone downhill and has been since day 1. Since the day that I started working there (even though I walked in as a manager) I was treated poorly by almost everyone there, even the people below me. When I would bring certain issues to my direct boss' attention she/he would dismiss the issues as something that she didn't find a ""priority"" and never revisit it in it's entirety. I had been accused of stealing money every time anything over $20 went missing and they believe that I never deserved an apology even after they reviewed the tapes and saw that someone else was the one who took the money. If I needed to leave even an hour early to go to the hospital or a doctor's appointment and there was already another manager there, I still wasn't allowed to leave even though they were always pressing matters."
good,"Good enviornment for students or someone looking for extra cash or a second income.  Needs to be more organized. The overall enviornment is fun however, needs more structure."
good,Not alot of hrs pay was 8 dollars which sucked since they don't give alot of hrs to work only got 10 min breaks which you have to time out for and schedule was in consistent
good,Had a few good managers but the one big boss knew I was a single mother and my son had school 8-3 but refused to work with my schedule it’s just unfortunate
good,"A typical day was for me to be stuck on the register my whole shift and not be able to do my extra work assigned.  I learned how to weigh my money instead of count it.  Management was to busy running around doing every thing they were suppose to do instead of helping us as we needed it,  The hardest part of my job was getting help from management.  The most enjoyable part of my job was most of the customers."
good,I did have some fun at Dollar Tree yet management was pretty bad at the time I was working there. Leaving the employment was the best decision being that I needed more time for studying my program at college.
good,The people was welcoming and friendly great to get along with. The time of hiring the interview process was fast and exciting and start to the point. Time is always important at Dollar tree.
good,Management in some places could be better. No hours nor benefits. Can not live off of this job. Needs to definitely be readdressed on things. Needs to make sure they have enough hours for the employees they have.
good,Working there felt like I was their full time instead of part time I was scheduled every weekend and we had to work holidays. You always had to keep busy either putting back merchandise or stocking and also cashiering.
good,Dollar Tree needs to increase starting pay and give more hours to cashiers. It is a busy place that has customers standing in line waiting for much longer than they should because of lack of cashiers on the clock. Management is friendly but does not cover the shift well.
good,"•	Responded to customers request and directed to merchandise "
good,When I worked there I wasn't trained. The manager told me to watch the worker and then threw me on a register. When I made mistakes I was penalized even though its the jobs fault for incorrect training. The pay isn't that good.
good,"I was only hired for a couple of months as seasonal worker so I can't say much for my reviews. I only have to stack up supplies, retrieving carts, minor maintenance work, mopping sweeping, and cashier"
good,Very stressful rarely any days off when you on 3rd shift. The managers do not know how to manage. The HR do not care about there associates. Higher up do not care either
good,"Their management is a revolving door because they can't pay their management enough to stay their.  They don't keep enough cashier open and the lines back up, then they decide to open another line because everyone is putting out stock on the floor."
good,A typical day at Dollar Tree was busy and stressful. Stressful because you may be the only one working on the register. Management seems like it doesn't care what you think. You may like working cashier but unloading the truck you wont like.
good,"The Company keeps the store under staffed, and wants two employees to do the work of three or more people each....stressful scheduling and to much micromanagement in play."
good,"Dollar tree is good job if somebody just wanna do something to put a couple extra bucks in your pocket, You won't get assigned no more than 12 hours a week and that's the most. Not for bill payer's!"
good,a typical work day for me was to be looking out for shoplifters. I've learned that i had to look out for myself. Some of the management crew was awesome. the hardest part of my job was to deal with customers and the fussy cashiers.
good,I made sure merchandise was stocked and presentable at all times. I loaded and unloaded trucks. I worked the cashier and was very polite to customers.
good,"i left the job not really wanting to, but i felt i had no choice. The work was good, the customers were fun, some co-workers were cool. But the place had poor management. As an assistant manager i was doing the role of the store manager except wasnt getting the pay."
good,The old manager was always talking about other staff. Staff was always complaining about each other. The only good about it was the customers. And that every thing is a dollar.
good,At the time i was working there in that location a lot of the managers & employees where very inappropriate & unprofessional at all times. They would never care to mess up your schedule because their lives where always more important.
good,"Its busy, job details and expectations are not equal across the board. Favoritism and lack of responsibility shows through lower management. People that do the hard grunt work to make the store look better do not get recognition by the company as incentives of worker hours or raise in pay."
good,Idk just a job I needed at the time. It's a paycheck and if u need it then it's worth it. If not it's definitely not a job you want to stay forever and make something out of it. Just temporary.
good,Overall the job was great in the beginning until New Management came in name Nicole she was very rude and think she could  push people. I was a cashier at this job the atmosphere is great there the employees  very friendly.
good,The quotas provided by the company are` high and unrealistic. The company does not care about the employees only about the money. They consider all employees replaceable. They provide no stability for anyone.
good,I worked at the Dollar Tree for 8 months. During that time I had four different managers. We were always short of staff and lack leadership. Scheduling was not in order etc.
good,"I liked working at the dollar tree, the managers were very fun and good to be around. always smiling and upbeat. But the lack of pay, the lack of hours, is why i left to find something better with more pay that was full time and that had benefits."
good,"The typcal day was very stressful and busy."
good,"When I worked there, I loved it. Up until they started cutting my Hours, talking badly in front of me, and some unprofessional people that worked there. There's definitely favoritism in the works."
good,"Opened/Closed Store, handled monies for cashiers, Responsible for deposits when closing, duties included going to bank for monies for safe, stocking, working on damaged items, cleaning restrooms, taking trash to dumpster’s, making seals on doors in backroom and breakroom doors, also worked truck on truck days. Making sure store presentable for customers, and also blew up helium balloons and getting tanks of helium for cashiers to also help with balloon orders. Traveled to work at State Street, Lima Road, Coldwater Roads and New Haven Dollar Trees."
good,"It is a great place to land on your feet and start from scratch. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a seasonal, part-time, or a job just for extra hours."
good,Poor work hours poor customer service  no stabillity Poor customer service shelves never stocked rude manager short mealtimes short breaks unorganized
good,"While I appreciate Dollar Tree as my first job, the employees, and management, as well as District Management were incredibly unprofessional. Drama, backstabbing, gossiping, and inappropriate harassment were all things I, and others, experience from management while working there."
good,This position is only part-time and the scheduling is unpredictable. One week you will be scheduled for 2 days the next week 0 days. They will call you in on your days off then cut your regular hours at the end of the week.
good,"Dollar Tree was a decent work experience because I really needed a job, but overall the management, & job security is VERY lacking. It is a VERY poor experience working at Dollar Tree."
good,rules were kind of everywhere not really well balanced out. loved my job but the voids on my register were too high but if the customer didnt want the item i had no choice but to take it off the ticket.
good,I worked at dollar tree for approx. 9 months. during this time I excelled at the job in question. while working my way up to the lead cashier I was given the opportunity to advance to a higher position. upon further review of my file I was told that advancement in this company would never happen. at that point my hours were cut from 30 hours a week to 5 hours a week...
good,"Fun place to work, but Management need to lighten up sometimes. Employee is very fun to work with and they admire you more if you don't grow to be more of an person that don't care what they think. I believe in empowerment because employees are the most important part of the company's assets. Without the voice of employee's opinion it's possible to ruin your bottomline. It can be an successful company if seeing between the cracks will enhance the outcome and double their bottom line. Too many cutthroats and no support of the employee's by management. If they get an good management they will lose them by not seeing what they have to offer."
good,"The best part of the job was that I was allowed to reorganize any section of the store that I felt needed an overhaul with my store manager's blessing and without having to talk to her about it first.  Several sections were pretty much destroyed during Christmas and needed fixing. She told me she liked what I was doing after seeing the results after I'd fixed three sections. She allowed me to continue this work. "
good,"I like working in  the public,  meeting and talking to other people and helping them. I like working at Dollar Tree I need to get more hours. I have learned how to stock and count my register."
good,"Very poor pay, poor hours, no benefits. A lot of work for the pay that was offered for a cashiering position. I had good managers but very poor co-workers that did not want to do their jobs."
good,"I learnt how to run a store without management being there. Training cashiers, handling cash, helping customers, dealing with complaints. Receiving products ex coke cola, old Dutch, submitting payroll, making up the schedule."
good,Their are a lot of opportunities working with dollar tree. The management was amazing every employee was polite. They gave good hours.
good,"Overall I didn't enjoy my employment. The management sucked and the employees were from another planet. I like the manager that was there at the time but the store could never keep a great look. Always trashy and items will always be out of place. The people I worked with, again, were from another planet, very unprofessional, the most I love about my job was cashiering and being able to see that I've done a great job with each transaction. Customers would always say you do a great job keep it up and some even tried to tip me or buy me something to drink out of the store."
good,The manager of the store I worked at was very negative about the store and twords co-workers. No professionalism could be found at this business. Work was often done wrong or left for someone else to do. The only enjoyable part of the job was catching the deals that occasionaly showed up which employees got first pick of.
good,Working at the dollar tree I have had the experience of working full and part time. I have had the opportunity to work as an assistant manager at the age of !8. It was an ok place. The manager was awesome and made the work environment fun. The saftey of the place was not so good. I had the opportunity to work all shifts. The hardest part of the job was making sure the stores were clean and up to par. Making sure all duties were done before the night was complete. Making sure customers were satisfied was the best part.
good,"When I started working there, I was promised a management position by the store manager, but after a meeting with the district manager everything went south. A couple a weeks after that, the store manager moved. I then just became a part-time cashier. I got so comfortable working there, I stayed there for three and a half years. My usual working duties was to ring up customers with their purchase, put out stock (if we wasn't busy) and do small displays. the job was simple and easy."
good,Dollar Trees management is awful. They are very disrespectful to their employees and customers. The location I worked at was constantly dirty and it was never cleaned. The managers were rude.
good,just some part time work to keep from being lazy and bored until something better is achknowledgeed that is available for over certain age groups.
good,Nothing special good or bad. It's quite simple a job. The worst is getting enough hours. Being a company that tries to sell things for as cheap as possible cuts corners. I personally think putting the extra stress on the employees is why they have such a high turn over rate of employees.
good,"Great work place for college students."
good,"When opening the store, you were expected to fill coolers with drinks, make sure store was cleaned and items were in proper locations. You then had to count your till and get the register ready for daily use. I was a cashier so I'd mostly stay in the front of the store and greet customers and work the check out counter. When the store wasn't busy I was to make sure the front of the store was clean and move items to their proper location. At the end of the night the floors would get swept and tills would be counted for accuracy. The manager there was difficult to work with and constantly belittled employees.  Employees were lectured and disciplined in front of customers in an unprofessional way, it was humiliating. The break room was used as storage, the water fountain had boxes stacked on top of it. However employees did have access to microwave and fridge in break room."
good,"Always had to be up and running for this job , it was being on your feet the whole 5 , 6 , and or 8 hours no sitting down. I loved most days at work we had really nice customers ."
good,Was busy at Christmas time. Was a cashier for the seasonal rush. Worked well with all personal. Standing in one spot for periods of time. Being busy.
good,I loved helping customers with their purchases.  I made sure my customer service skills were impeccable. Made sure sales were met whenever I was on duty
good,The way the company is run is absolutely ridiculous.  They will not spend any money on things that are needed for the appearance of the stores.  If a store is falling apart it does not matter.
good,"would had to clean and cash customers."
good,I love Dollar Tree as a customer but as an employee they don't enough hours for their employees to make some type of income.
good,waiting on customers helping them fine things they cant find. learned how a reagular retail storer is ran
good,Just wasn't happy after I got hired that I was only working seasonal position.
good,"A typical day at work:  Unloading freight trucks by hand and/or stocking shelves, setting the floor up using a plan-o-grams, helping costumers locate products on sales floor or in warehouse."
good,Herrasment by store manager and DM. Over all my co workers were amazing. They always helped getting the store in shape.
good,"cashier and stock, customer service, management was ok..really did not have co workers kept us separated. their really was no hard part to the job, enjoyable part was socializing with customers."
good,The Dollar Tree was nothing but drama and shady co-workers.
good,"A typical day consitst of managing and running store and employee. I learned to be an Assistant manager. My co-workers enjoyed working with myself. The hardest part of the job was learning the new position in such short time, it worked out the trainer make it enjoyable and fun."
good,I liked doing stock at dollar tree but i did not like how corporate or management ran the store overall it was not an ideal job situation or enviornment i would want to make a career out of
good,"When working with the current management of this particular store, there were too many inconsistencies."
good,"Part-Time Morning Cashier,Custmomer Friendly Enviroment,Onload/ Sotck Store.etc."
good,The hardest part of the job at Dollar Tree was trying to keep up with the company expectations on getting stock out while trying to manage the store as well
good,My biggest issue with Dollar Tree is the lack of hours after Christmas and the manager never offered sympathy in tough situations.  Also never complimemted you on your work or thanked you for coming in on your days off.
good,I've been there a year and 2 months work my butt off and then they cut are hours hours completely I only work one day a week I had been there the longest. Of everybody that has been there this company needs to find ways to get more hours for their employees did you cannot make it off with only one day working how you supposed to pay your bills if you can't that's why I am trying to find a new job
good,"The good is there is some nice people "
good,Not enough time for the amount of work needed to be done. The Corporate Office has no idea of the situations and issues that goes on with other employees. The Corporate offices care nothing for the people working for them. I would not recommend this job to anyone that values the fair treatment of a person.
good,Count your own register even if you don’t know ask & learn how to do it. Also count it in front of a manager. Count all of your hours. The hiring manager did not have no professionalism. Always use to hire new people to let them go. Let the old employees get away with everything.
good,a good Job for someone who is driven to work everyday. Sometimes you don’t get recognition. Most days you work you spend cleaning ip after customers no matter what your position is.
good,it was a great opportunity to work for the company I have learned a lot there the associates was easy to get along with it's just I felt sometimes that I have been looked down on by my district manager who did not like me personally for what reason I don't know. but overall I liked working for Dollar tree
good,"I can say that dollar tree was just something else, the employees were pretty cool. The manager was pretty sweet but when it came a problem or so. She'll do nothing about it and take orders from assistant manager or even employees. The job was good but it was always favoritism around. Just need to work on to work as a team and treat people with fairness and respect."
good,Pay sucks. Not enough hours. Store manager is nice. Assistants don't seem to care about customer service. Important changes etc. aren't passed down. Poor communication.
good,"This job is stressful in many ways and relaxed in others. "
good,Dollar Tree is horrible to me. They can do better far as pay management n workers. Their need to be more registers open. And more ppl on floor for packing out to insure stores looks great
good,For the amount of work you have to perform and pay rate and over all job isnt worth it. They dont give you enough hours to even complete a daily task. Not enough pay for the amount of work expected of you. The store looks horrible cause there are not enough employees to help keep it stocked and cleaned. The customers you deal with are rude and dont care and will go out of thier way to make the store look more horrible then it is on a normal. Usely only a cashier and a manager on duty. As a manager your told not to be on register but yet have to or customers complain the only register open the lines are too long. So as a manager you never get anything completed or have time to stock or clean the store. Your stuck being a cashier for 80% of your shift. When you can get time to do a task you can never finish it cause you get the next truck coming in to start on a another holiday seasonal set. Halloween in August. Xmas in September. Customers complain the items are set to early the distribution centers send to much and you end up with way to much over stock and no room for anything in the backroom.
good,started as a cashier working after school. eventually advanced to stock and then manager. wasnt worth being a manager because they dont get paid much more than regular staff and you have more responsibilities. management made it a nightmare to work because we were always understaffed and too little hours were able to be handed out. no benefits and not too many opportunities to advance. I only did because they desperately needed someone
good,"A typical day at work included counting in the registers and Bank, doing the daily paperwork and entering into the computer, ordering freight, making u-boats to stock the shelves, setting up stations for cashiers, doing deposits. The hardest part of my job would be working 12 to 14 hour shifts without lunch, as well as no call no shows. Enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers p"
good,My review of them is that things could be done better.I would change somethings about the store if  I knew it was possible. I don’t get enough hours there and my schedule is crazy and such.
good,"The typical day at Dollar Tree was, frankly, not knowing what you were walking into. Happy, angry, frustrated...it changed moment by moment. Very passive and aggressive demeanor by the 'then' manager. He was unhappy in his life and took it out on everyone at work. This made the positivity flow almost impossible. Eventually he left, and we then got a very young girl as manager. Age didn't matter to me, just please do your job and set a standard for us and lead. She did not. She sat in the office on her phone...all shift. We tried to get as much done as possible, but you can only do what you can. I think this describes the workplace culture. The full-time assistant tried to pick up the slack, but she was only one woman. The hardest part of the job was to actually do it. The first manager would under his breath complain about you. ""Slow, stupid..."" etc. The second was just absent. How can you do a job that is constantly picked apart and told its not done correctly? The most enjoyable part of the job was when the manager left. The tension and thickness in the store quickly disappeared. The assistant was a great worker, and we all enjoyed working with her. She now has the store, she is the manager and the store is doing great! What did I learn? I learned that some businesses just take and take from the responsible employees without any benefit to them. We had to squabble over getting hours; and struggle to get a problem solved. Dollar Tree brought many things to light for me, but back then I would not recommend anyone to work for them. Now I definitely would."
good,"When I first started working I loved it. My boss was incredible, a great leader, highly under-appreciated. She showed me not all managers are bad. The people hired under her were good people. We had a great team for about 7 months straight and I was happy."
good,I loved working there it was really fun and we were like a family there. They staff and workers there were fun to be around!! It wasn’t always so serious with them.
good,"What can I say except that we were worked like dogs, treated like morons and payed like children asking for an allowance. The manager will probably ignore you if you're a lazy goof, but if you work hard, expect criticism."
good,Enjoyable work environment. Greeting and assisting customers keeps you busy all day. When business is slow there is always stocking shelves to be done. My opinion is we worked really hard for Min wage with No raises and we was not allowed to have over 18hrs a week.
good,"The job is a great place if you like to constantly be busy. Along with attending to customers, putting away the truck is another job that you do as a cashier. "
good,Working at Dollar Tree is great. Mainly on register. Customer's are very friendly and nice to talk to. Restocking shelves. And recovery. Coworkers are great to get along with.
good,I didn't like working at Dollar just cause how the place was being manage nor run wasn't no structure nor good manager they wasnt tryna to let you more hours or anything
good,I never really knew what was going on at work. They were very messy with managing each other and the work place itself. Nothing was ever really set in stone.
good,Productive/Customer's /Cleaning/Packing/Stocking/keeping the store going/customers happy-finding what they need or needed/stocking water/changing the store around - making it asset easy for customer's
good,It would start off slow and depending on the time of day when rush hour came we were almost always understaffed. The management was OK but by the end of my time with them became overbearing and would ask me to do more than what I was paid for.
good,I worked for dollar tree for 4 years I would like to think i was one of the best empolyee. It is on the job training and unless you have no life and or dont have any kids then rhis is the job for you in my state pay rate is 7.25$ an hour. At the end of my pay i only made it to 7.68$ an hour. This job with the wrong people in management will be very stressful.i was given kinda like an ultimatum with what I had do in my personal life or I would lose the one thing I was responsible for which would be truck and stocking so I ended up quitting and going to a better job. Even though this was stressful this was my favorite job the customers loved me and I knew the store like the back of my hand and I got to see everything that came in that store but I probably will never go back.
good,"Transferred to a Richmond Dollar Tree from a small town. Management, Store Cleaniness, Store stocked efficiently like night and day. It really is pretty bad. No consistency in stocking products. Shelves are bare. No team work. I Loved my job in the small town I was in, dread going to work now."
good,"The compensation for part-times and management isnt nearly enough to live on. You're expected to do so much as a manager even if you have no one to run the store with you. Between abusive customers and management, you need to have patience to keep yourself sane. If the compensation was bumped up, it would make it a little more worth it."
good,"Part time cashier enjoyed who I worked with but not enough advancement or hours to stay. I did stocking while also doing cashier work, and cleaning of the store."
good,Dollartree is a reck. It is inconsistent. And a stressful environment. I feel like there is a lack of mangment and a lack of knowledge on how to run a store. Its not worth the 7.35
good,As a store manager you live at your store. No hours to have more than one employee on at a time. If someone call off and you cant find someone you have to stay. Doing every role but the actual manager role due to the lack of payroll hours given.
good,All around dollar tree is a good place to shop for bargains .employees were more friendly then the management staff. To many call off n no showsstore was always dis organized or understocked..
good,"I loved working with all my teammates! The assistant management team were excellent to work for. I got along with everyone (customers, work staff etc.)"
good,"Managers have to work like slaves.  A manager has to stock shelves, unload trucks that are not palletized, work in unsafe stockrooms, minimal payroll to keep the store filled, complete payroll, HR work, retention etc.  The managers also run registers, barely get lunches, told that the impossible can be done without proper staffing or compensation that will give the staff incentive to work.  Managers are mentally and physically mistreated.  Your family is supposed to come second to the business."
good,"The job is really easy, simply come in cashier, stock or recover. Depending on the management sometimes they're laid back and won't bother you while you work, and sometimes there hard to work with because their lazy and want you to do all the work."
good,Dollar Tree now is just a. Job now they do not give you what you are asking for they are just like other job working you so hard for min wages. That not enough money to live off in Florida Rent goes up $75.00 every years.
good,"It was an ok plc to work..The pay wasnt good,customers were always rude,my mangwr was kind and very understanding..There are no benefits so it was jus your 2 weeks pay no over time ever..Never over 30 hrs per 2 weeks"
good,"As a cashier I attend to and assist customers either as a cashier or helping find merchandise. I also recover unpaid merchandise around the till that customers leave behind. when the store closes my duties are to clean around the store such as; sweep the floors, disinfect tills and areas and throw out garbage. I also assist the manager on duty with cashing out and making deposits. I also assist in stocking shelves while I am on till. I do late night stocking as well. Cashier hours are 4.5hrs and off hour stocking shifts are 8hrs. The hardest part of the job is the lack of hours, not a good suitable job for a family person but perfect for an individual without so much responsibilities such as; bills, and family due to the lack of hours."
good,Wouldn't recommend anyone to work unless new management. I worked really hard and received no raise. I don't feel like this is a position that I would recommend
good,"Learned Skill in Warehouse shipping/Receiving/Stocking/Cashiering/Pallet Jack"
good,It was the work place culture of Dollar Tree the customers felt just because it was the dollar store the they could get away with everything and there weren't any security.
good,"The best part of the job was making some money and the customers the management was really good at the store i worked at. But the company overall is not good at all. no benefits, no tools to work with, no incentive, nothing to work for, no raises."
good,"unpleasant environment, great customers but not professional hiring, the district manager changed every couple of months which led to  zero continuity"
good,as a worker corporate  fails to acknowledge  us. Don't give any raise . depending on location you can tell who values the store . other times its just the customers.
good,"A typical day is moving around the store constantly without stopping. Not getting a break until you clock out for one. Lots of running. I learned how to trouble shoot computers, and how to build a schedule as well as how to do a bank deposit. How to count the register drawers and the safe correctly. How to turn time. Management is very hard. even lower management has high expectations from its team members. Workplace culture isn't that great. Customers can be very difficult at times. The hardest part of the job is Christmas time. The sells are ridiculous, the expectation of sells makes it hard to get a bonus. The most enjoyable thing is the slow days. Those days make the job okay."
good,"Lots of customers  searching for products, store is scattered and unorganized, no advancement, hours constantly change hard to plan other life style.."
good,"Great job until the pick manager quit and another took over than it went downhill with the new manager playing favorites. Dont expect an easy ride as the last person to touch a bay is accountable for the actions of the person before them and write ups are handed out like Halloween candy. If you do get decent pics and make target, which isnt hard if the pick is good, you dont get a lot of recognition but since there is a bonus for hitting numbers higher than goal most of your coworkers will sort through the stacks and take the best picks for themselves and friends leaving the trash for everyone else"
good,As a cashier had really work hard to help customer to find what they needs and my co-worker who i work with has a team. I had work overtime when ever I'm available to work when they have someone called in. I'm there.
good,a lot of time working rarely got a break. the manage always called out and I had to open to close several times. he was physically abusive and like to bully his employees
good,Hours are barely enough to get by on as my only job. I feel at times I need two jobs just so I can save. Due to such low hours most positions besides management are part time and nothing more except during holidays. The job itself isn't bad but the lack of help and hours puts you in a state of mind of constantly being behind on almost everything.
good,To work at Dollar tree you have to have plenty  patients.  Dollar tree is a good starting  job for if your  in high school or in college but it is not the right fit for if you have a family and have to take care of a family. As an employee you are required to do job tasks that is above your pay grade they only do annually raises They do not offer any vacation time for part time. Sick time  varies it’s never a set amount of hours the more you work the more sick time hours you will have.
good,Theres bosses who will allow you to work over time then there those who dont do anything. Dollar tree was just not my job due to low payments. Stressed as well for only $180 every 2 weeks.
good,As a store manager you have to work 50 or more hours per week. This is to keep your sales going and also requires you to work at other stores no matter what is going on in your store. Work life balance is way off. You spend more time at work than you do at home about 55 to 65 hours per week. Not a good place to work if you have a life outside of work.
good,"The job as it is, is a pretty simple retail job, as you'd find for most companies. Like most there are the pros, and cons to working there. In general I have been treated well, but, this is not the place to work as your main job, unless you can get promoted high enough. The hours are incredibly minimal, especially if the DM doesn't like your store manager. If that is the case (whether due to professional, or personal reasons) the store suffers, which only hurts the line level employees, as you lose hours like crazy."
good,I liked working there but the managers could have scheduled people better or helped themselves more than what tbey did. It was very stressful ar times
good,"When I started at Dollar Tree, everything was great, fun place to work, fun people to work with, relaxed and happy atmosphere. Recently, however, things became much more stressful there, and people began to try to get other people fired for their own gain. Dollar Tree corporate staff does nothing to alleviate the issues between levels of management or associates and as long as they are sure that their strict rules are being followed, they will ignore any problems anyone brings to their attention."
good,Honestly it was bad just all over bad. Management had no idea what they were doing. Than they didn't treat their employees as humans they acted like we were robots.
good,Over all the company is ok to work for. but once you become a manger you life is over .The customers was the best part of working with dollar tree. the hardest part was the high turn over rate.
good,Dollar Tree was a cool place to work they just didn't have enough hours and they didn't give any benefits it's for somebody like in college. The pay was not that great
good,"I really enjoyed dollar tree until it started falling apart, unfortunately the location that I was at I grew to love the daily customers but the employees became an issue, employees had the store manager fired because they didn't like the way he set up the store, after he had to leave everything fell apart and I was promised a raise because of the extensive work that needed to be done and because of a promotion, raise never given and left at part time even though I worked full time hours, I believe the jealous employees can really turn a company around without corporate even caring about the truth, I loved it but not when I was worked like a slave especially under unsafe circumstances, I could continue with the wrongs but not all dollar trees are like this."
good,stressful workplace. its only part time. There is no way for you to advance on this job. You might be hired for one position in the store but you have to work all positions in the store for the same pay rate.
good,It was a just a convenient part time job. The work isn't hard and the manager was a ball of sun shine. Better scheduling is necessary but is a team effort type of job.
good,"Poor managment at the burlington,nc stores.Your pretty much on call as a stocker.Cashiers get all the hours so its not so bad if you are a cashier.Youre paid every 2 weeks but the checks do be ok,"
good,I would not recommend Dollar Tree as a place to work poor management with not many hours to work. Manager not understanding when it comes to missed work days.
good,"Dollar Tree HQ has many who have been there 10+ years, if you are willing to work there long enough you have a chance of moving up. If you are looking for long-term employment, this is the place for you."
good,"Pay disparity is definitely a problem in most stores which leads to heavy turn over.  No real stop gap if there is a loss of management or associates and often times it was required to work ridiculous shifts to cover someone calling out or quitting.  Unrealistic expectations and an ever increasing workload.  One work shift included working from 5 AM - 6 PM, going back at 11:30 PM that night and working until 5 PM the next evening to cover shifts and get the store ready for the next season.  There are a ton of stores which makes it easier to get advanced."
good,"It's a slow, steady, and relaxing work place although it is a part-time job so you will most likely work three to four days at the most fives hours a day."
good,"Assisted customers with purchase"
good,"My duties was to stock stroage room, restock shevles with merchandise also the refrigerators and rotate the product and loading and uloading trucks with merchandise also inventory monthly."
good,"Over the whole time that I worked there, I was pushed around to all parts of the job. My schedule was messed with continuously, they would not work with me one the hours that I hired on for, and in the end they pushed me out because I think that they wanted new to fill in the position so that they could train them in their way. I was too smart for the position.     ]"
good,"When I got to work it was hurry hurry and get on a register so this person can leave. Then there was the cleaning, stocking, that needed to be done too. So I was pretty busy from the moment I walked in the door till I clocked out. The hardest part of this job was to try not to shop while working. I would see the cutest things and would want them but then talked myself out of it. The most enjoyable part of my job was to hear the customers praise the store for being there and open."
good,it is a stressful work environment though the manager would work with you if needed be off for anything and as long as you call wasn't to strict on being late
good,"I have worked very hard to keep this job but in the end new management did not see that at all. I walked 2 hours to work almost every morning when I had to go to work at 2 am. No car but at least I could take the bus back during the day. I was a good worker, moved from stocking shelves to cashier in a few months until management was becoming a problem. Too many new people and very little was I able to get to know them and for them to know me. In the end it felt like my 2 weeks notice was too soon and it left a bad impression with me but still glad I learned a little more about low chain stores like dollar tree. Good luck to whoever works there, because the new management is terrible and possibly sexist."
good,"Dollar tree culture on the paper is good but they do not stand up for their culture leaving all stores messed up because of low payroll. Management in particular not helpfull and district do not allow to help each other if there is a shortage of help."
good,"Decent place to work for 1st job, to gain experience. Upper management does not allow overtime, will call you to say your close to 40 hours, get off the clock. Not competitive with wages. Only promotes favored employees."
good,Wouldnt recommend to anyone that wants to have  work-life balance. They don't appreciate hard work and dedication.....................................
good,"Management didn't care if you worked late or worked more that you shpoould, but were not allowed to get overtime for any reason."
good,Time is everything!!! I had my moments where I thought I was scheduled but really I was scheduled earlier because the communication between the managers wasn't very good
good,"most of the coworkers were great, i was an assistant manager here and another assistant manager was hard to work with. the hours sucked. the back room was always a disaster as well."
good,It might not be every Dollar Tree but this store is not under control. The managers and most employees do not want to do the job. The hardest part of the job is actually trying to get work done. The store is currently in bad condition and trying to keep up with what the store manager wants makes it difficult to do other tasks required. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers. Dollar tree has a lot of regular customers who always greet employees with a smile.
good,Nice job to have as a teen to help start you off with work experience and to have a little cash in your pocket or to pay small bills. Hours aren't bad and public interactions can help further you with communication skills.
good,company has high turn over on cashiers; management not the best on one on one people skills; markets pay better for part time employees; call outs are constant with no consideration or appreciation for those who compensate
good,Great people and environment but very store focused. I enjoyed my job there but found there was not enough hours in the day to do what was needed. Very rushed atmosphere.
good,"Wonderful place to show and work if you have a way with people. it can be harder during the holidays due to everything is a dollar. i found that if you have to be able to come in at a moments notice and by me being in school mat the time I stayed up long hours at night and not able to get much rest. yet, I enjoyed my coworkers and the way we worked together."
good,"For a first job it is a fast pace environment for anyone to work in but it takes u from point A to B in the life of jobs. Management can be on the strict and mentality unstable side but , if u have the guts for itc you learn how to deal with it until you or they quit."
good,Upper management didn't care about they employees at all. Mid day and morning shift would leave everything for the night shift. So we would be crunching time at the end of the night. If I would of done EVERYTHING in a night I wouldn't of been out of there till midnight
good,This place was not good. Too many disrespectful people and always complaing. Everything is cheap and they know it and they act like its suppose to last or something.
good,"Loved working at the Dollar Tree. It was fast paced, always busy, never boring, not as many as i preferred but the hours were great. Pay not so much. But I did enjoy working here"
good,"Working here at first was great, but they kept changing store managers. Each time my schedule would change and I was going to school at the time. I had to walk in the rain some days and they didn't care even when they called me on my days off. "
good,"I never had any hours, I only worked like 30 hours a month! I never knew when i was working, it would always change and I hated it. It was okay for a first job, but still wasn't that great."
good,Not enough hours/pay worked at norwich dollar tree managers only care about themselves and their pay i got like 15 hrs a wewk bc they rushed me to do work so they didn't have to pay me while they sit back and do nothing
good,"It was easy to advance, there was some favoritism, they made it too hard to make bonuses now, they expect a lot for the pay.  If you enjoy customer service its for you."
good,"This job was alright, i really liked my first manager, she was cool. A day at work was average, lots of moving, always busy. Learned how to deal with customers."
good,Dollar tree is a fair company to work with. The pay is okay but the hours aren't too satisfying . Some weeks I can earn up to 40hrs and then I have the 15hr a week schedule. Sometimes you just don't know what to expect.
good,"Recommend his job for anyone young looking for a starter job, or working while in school. Not the best place to work, but ok if it isn't long term."
good,"straight to the truck, and from the truck to the shelves. Peaceful job."
good,You have god people and then you don't I really liked my job at first it was run. the Old DM really sucks he would only listen to one side of  the story. New Head office people
good,"the short time i spent at dollar tree was very enriching, it s a job that calls for patience and excellent public relation skills due to the fact you deal with the public every second of job."
good,The job itself was good for being part time but the management was horrible and always unstable. Other co workers were more helpful then the management.
good,"not the funnest job to work "
good,Most days ok nothing to brag about. When I worked there they did not have steady management. Co Workers was ok the ones  that I met. Nothing was hard about the job. The customers was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,Management will treat people like they are dumb some cashiers are rude to others they are disrespectful. I had to call they Bremerton store due to missing a phone call and when I asked for the manager all I could hear in the background is them mocking me and saying it sounded like a child on the phone
good,This would be a place to do what you need to do to get the job done and enjoy yourself doing it.  The job is only a part time basis.
good,"Best part of the job was working with the cashiers and the people on floor. Wonderful, hard work people. The worst part was the lack of skills in the management."
good,Responsible for the day to day operation of the store. Established new opening and closing procedures. Assisted customers and maintained inventory control. Managed all employees and trained them on new store policies. Made decisions and delegated task to employees
good,"Working cash register, keeping front end clean and organized. Management seemed a little unprofessional. Co workers were friendly "
good,"Working for dollar tree in the beginning was great but as months past management started being rude I then left Dollar Tree to perused a new carrer.  ,"
good,"management was always equal, I don,t think the job was hard but it was frustrating because after arranging the shelves people would throw it back on the floor"
good,I provide customer service by providing assistance when needed and cashing out customers in the check out line. I also stocked items in the store on a weekly basis after each shipment of merchandises.
good,"Poor management, I had a Assoicate Shift Manager throw items at me so I decided it was time to find a new job. She still works the company and I do not understand how she was able to keep her job. I was told by the Department of Labor I should have called the cops."
good,"My typical day at work includes greeting customers, stocking register area, being expedient in my service provided. I'm also in charge of making sure balloon area is stocked, and assisting with orders as needed. At the end of my shift, I make sure that the shelves were organized with all returns. Clean and take out trash before assisting with cash drops at local bank."
good,Good corporate structure. Poor upper management skills. Store level teamwork was lacking. All together a good place to work but no room to advance.
good,It was a busy environment. This was my first job so I learned how to cashier and how to provide good customer service. The hardest part of job being the only cashier in the store while there is 20 people standing in line with a hundred of dollar items.
good,Ok job for a first timer to get invloved into the work life. Wouldnt recommend it for career basics. But like I said good job for a first timer to get setttled into the work life.
good,i didnt like the management team or the times that was giving to the employees but i did like my position that i held with the company and i definitely enjoyed shopping there
good,"My typical day with this company was serving as cashier/stocker for the front end.  I enjoyed working with the public and being available to help those who needed assistance due to handicaps.  The most difficult part of the jobs is last minute overtime, requiring to work double shift because of no-show employees."
good,Dollar tree is a normal minimum wage job. The assistant manager  work you for a salary that is not worth it. Working there will make you   hate working a local stores.
good,"A typical day working at DollarTree can be positive with the right attitude and being focus on why you're there."
good,Cleanup around plant grounds.That flowback water don't smell good.  All I did work try to help out as much as I can. Dealing what the smell. My pay check.
good,"A typical day at worked was i first unloaded trucks then when we were done i started to stock shelf's and organize items. I learned how to unload trucks and how to work good with other co-workers, i learned how to organize items correctly on the shelf's on the job."
good,"Days were slow , management was unorganized and all over the place. My co-workers were more help than the managers. Hardest part of the job was remembering were everything was stocked."
good,My employment is part-time while I attended college full-time. The job has taught me how to converse with customers in a professional manner and to be responsible. The management works together to ensure all tasks are properly administered and complete. My co-workers all work hard to keep the store full and running properly.
good,"A typical day at work if opening would consist of clocking in, turning on the registers, counting the register drawyer, cleaning and doing anything else on the appleseed sheet. If it was a truck day I would go clock in and head to the stock room and set up the rollers for the truck driver and then help unload the truck by putting boxes on the designated U-Boat and then proceed to stock the aisles after the truck was unloaded. If closing I would clock in, count my register drawyer, work the register, do recovery of the area around the registers which consisted of making sure any items out of place got put back in the designated areas, do anything marked on the appleseed sheet and then count the drawyer and clock out."
good,I loved the customers especially the older ones. There were times that I did not get my breaks or lunches when working here. When I worked the night shift it would be sometimes midnight or 1:00am before I would get home for cleaning up the store after it closed. There was this one time that I was having a kidney stone attack and my manager would not let me leave to go to the hospital. I was in so much pain. As soon as I got off work I was in the ER. During the off season I was the only cashier so if my line got backed up the customers were not happy. If my manager was unloading the truck and I needed money she told me to figure it out. So if they did not have a debit card or correct change I could not check them out so they didnt get what they needed. My manager yelled at me once from across the room because I needed change. She hated to bring me change as you see and she was cursing me and she brought the change to me and slammed it down at my register in front of the customers. She was very rude to the customers when they would ask her if we had certain items or where they were located in the store.
good,"Most of he costumers are very out-going and respectful. I enjoy going to work just to put a smile on my costumers faces they make my day, even the rude ones I still smile and say have a nice day come again. Having good costumer service is a big big plus working in retail you can't let no one bring you down, when your having a bad day you can't let that show on your face that let's the costumers know you don't really want to be there and that makes them think you have an attitude and they might send a complaint to the manager."
good,"4 hours and 4 days a week, stock items everyday with my co-workers. maybee if we lucky enough we might get 8 hours work."
good,Fast paced marketing experience encumbered by arcane Management and Information Systems . Long but rewarding hours were compounded by difficult commute . Enjoyable co-workers dampened by culture of insecurity due to take-over by U.S. corporation .
good,worker was ok but the management sucks they did not know how to talk to there workrs
good,"I liked starting out there, but then the values of the managers changed recently and same with how the store is run."
good,the company was very unorganized and poorly managed. what i did manage to learn was how to work under extreme pressure and timing.
good,"A typical day of happiness from working with the public, meeting new people. Affiliating with fellow co-workers & assisting management with various task throughout the day. "
good,I really needed a job at the time but i could have ran the place myself
good,"a typical day is setting up sales floor and cashier,"
good,I liked working there but it only last a short period of time.
good,This job was not the best....alot of things i believe to b illegal....7.15 an hour is NOT THE MINIMUM WAGE!
good,"Went in, got right on register to ring customers. cleaned at end of night."
good,I enjoyed the interaction I had with the local town folk. Management was uptight and not flexible.
good,My manger was bad i just took it like a learning tool in life the work was okay but my mangers was the worst ones i ever had all they did was smoke all day
good,Fun place to work and overrall easy job. The pay is what makes is a horrible place to work for the amount of work you perform. If you in need of a part time job that you only work 5-20 hrs a week this is for you.
good,It's easy work but they need to update their technology for a better and faster working environment.
good,Working at the DollarTree is nice but management and employees are not good to work with.
good,Needs to be a more organized. Management was frim but fare. What i took away from this job was what not to do. Recieving room not being organized was the toughest part of the job.
good,"After transferring with Dollar Tree to Greensboro, NC from Cranston, Rhode Island, I was on a good trek in my life for a change! After less than 2 weeks being here and working in the store I was promoted to Assistant Manager. Then the problems started. Another Assitant Manager in the same store I was working at started to undermind everything I was doing. I had found out from others, she does not like white people. I had lost my job in 2010 and bought a camper so myself and my pets would have a safe roof over our heads! I still live in my camper and have for 3 yrs. Well, this assistant doesn't like change either. She called the landlord of the proerty and complained I was living in his parking lot and making a mess(not true), called animal control and stated I had a bunch of animals locked in a closed camper when the temps were triple digits(again not true)and called corporate and told them I was using the stores electric(true). The manager knew I was and on Monday the DS showed up and terminated me. The Manager was terminated the following day! So, if your down and out and trying your best to get back on your feet, find another place to work for because you won't get any help or sympathy for them!"
good,"I like working here for a while unfortunately they when new management came to our store, they no longer wanted to work with my school schedule, so I unfortunately had to resign."
good,"I stocked shelves, cleaned areas, put up shelving. I liked working with people"
good,not very good management at the time. always busy and fun dealing with customers.
good,"Fun work crew lots of advice from co-workers, lack of management."
good,"Friendly employees, manager works with you if you go to school or have another job. Pay isn't good for the work you do."
good,"I joined with the promise of advancement. I have a bachelors degree and had previous been an assistant manager at Walgreens and CVS, however I was not ""good enough"" for Dollar Tree."
good,"I honestly love my co workers... Our team handles every need that can possibly be met with concern and precision... Treating all customers as we our selves want to be treated... There are moments, that minimal hours come into play and cashiers become sticker... Other than these things, all is well..."
good,I have felt very undervalued there. They promote and demote me every year as a seasonal manager and I've never had a job do that. They are so cheap that they won't even keep me on as a manager permanently. So I'm constantly gaining and losing huge amounts of hours and pay which is incredibly hard to live on. The managers can do no wrong and as a cashier you will never be promoted or rewarded for anything.
good,"It was an alright job , not the best , started out stocking and moved to working the register, store was a complete mess when I arrived there , managers really didn’t do much except only when they were needed, pay is barely minimum wage but experience is good."
good,It was fair .. But too much work needed to be done without enough hours overall management needed work not too much team work could be more of that my opinion
good,"Working here is a lot of fun, but over time they can over work you. Managers are really nice. If you ask they will give you extra hours. I had an amazing experience there, but had to leave due to school."
good,But the district manager was discriminating and made me work without pay and the company did not provide staffing support.  Also the company did not provide the tools to complete task  management
good,This is a great first job for any high school or college student. You must be 18 to be able to work there because of the equipment used on site. The pay is low and that is why it is a good starting job to get your feet wet in the customer service realm.
good,It’s so easy bein a cashier for Dollartree and less work then others working there...I’d work there again if I need to in the near future...............
good,"fast paced ,very polite workers needed higher pay for the job and more hours for each worker in the weekly schedule.the need for more workers per shift,at least three."
good,"The manager at the dollar tree was awesome, nothing wrong with the job it's just no one you can support yourself on. Cashiering was great enjoyed my job."
good,The people at this job were very kind. i hated making 7.35 an hour especially living in houston.the cost of living there is so high it takes like four jobs just to servive there.
good,"No hours, management comes in and lasts maybe a month and nobody in house is ever promoted.  This place is a total joke.  Good luck with that whole finding good people to work here when you seem to only hire lazy ones and won't compensate the good ones."
good,"stocked shelves, cleaned store and front faced. The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours to pay bills. The best part of the job was the people i worked with"
good,U get lots of hours and cool people fun to work there i really miss working there i wish i could go back i was fun fun miss u guys lots but it was time. I moved on to bigger and better things
good,"Started off as a good experience, but declined due to poor management and poor communication skills."
good,"I worked at dollar tree as a part time assistant manager. It was ok, not a bad job. One of my issues were working just as much and harder than full time manager and store manager but at a less pay without benefits, all because the store volume couldn't afford another full time management position."
good,"loved it so much// blindsided with termination 8 ,mo. after write up.worked very hard loved my friends and managers, new manager came in from chicago, fired wihtout warning.  RATS TAKING OVER EVERYWHERE.."
good,I Did not get enough hours. I did not get enough pay. The people always play favorites. Store was always falling apart. Cash register was always messing up.
good,"Dollar Tree's management and staff were very unprofessional and disorganized, and my role was trying to advance the culture with respect and genuine positivity."
good,"I worked just enough hours so that i wasnt considered full time and couldnt get benefits. I worked every holiday they were open. I didnt get many days off they would schedule me everyday for 4 hours. While i worked there i often worked off the clock, on my breaks and lunches."
good,K no saben cómo hablar con los clientes para darles un mejor servicio y cómo mejorar las ventas y cómo hacer para k haya menos perdidas
good,i have an opportunity to provide and one time experience in a city that is severely depressed. It is an honor to provide an refreshing feeling in an aggressive environment
good,manger's have impunity to make up their own rules according to the guidelines of dollar tree that aren't enforced in every store. this leads to no solid ruleset that varies from store to store
good,"The management is hired not on qualifications but mere attractions. Cashiers/stockers, about the same. Unfair wages in regards to job placement. Poor communication. Poor judgement. Poor assessments. Poor preparations. Overall the only good is the price per quality of their merchandise"
good,"The company only gives you 15 hours a week if your a cashier, unless it's holidays. Customers move everything around so the employees don't have enough time to put back. The store always looks like a mess. Their are no location stickers to see where products belong."
good,"Dollar Tree isn't a bad place to work at when you have fair management. I started off as a cashier with part time hours a couple days a week. The schedule would shift so that you weren't stuck with the same shift each week, the work load wasn't heavy and it was very easy to learn. The management in my store wasn't the best but not all stores are the same, what I liked most about Dollar Tree was the opportunity to move up. I was promoted to part-time assistant store manager after only 8 months working there then full-time assistant store manager 3 months after that. I learned a lot of management skills and tasks while working here. The hardest part of my job was juggling multiple responsibilities at once with very little help. But overall, after my promotion, I was making good pay, I didn't work all hours of the night and the work was manageable when you have the help you need."
good,Work life at dollar tree is a up and down cycle the hours go up and dow no set hours and days and the management is ok but we need more sucurity and hours
good,The asset protection department are a set of wanna be cops and they are over zealous and always trying to get staff fired especially the regional manager
good,"Their pay wasn't great. Management was terrible and the work environment was not welcoming. I did not look forward to going into work. Scheduling was all over the place, and they would not work with you if you had school or something important to do."
good,"The work environment is okay. The customers are awesome never had any problems with the store I work at. The employees and the management their are not the best, make me feel unwelcome cause their is a huge age gap between others that work their and myself, I believe that has a lot to do with it. Other than that job is easy"
good,"Each store is under staffed , they need more help. I did learn a lot working there and meet some wonderful people . It was hard keeping anyone with lows hours they offer to employees."
good,great starter job but looking for advancement in my career. my experience here hasnt been the worst not a horrible place to work. horrible pay and hours though.
good,It was good I got to meet people and have conversations with customers but the department manager was rude and had a horrible attitude and started to cut my hours I was only working 2 days a week
good,The people are nice. Mostly older with actual jobs that pay the bills. Truck is awful 100% wouldn’t recommend doing that. Only 3 shifts a day and not enough management
good,My day would start by going in and clocking in first. I would then turn my light on and help who ever was next in line. In between customers I would stock up all lines with candy or gum or both. Just what ever was there to stock.
good,"The corporation says they care about their employees but there is no evidence of it. All employees are treated with no respect. "
good,"Decent place to work at, while still looking for another job. Dollar Tree does NOT offer full time hours and you only receive minimum wage per hour, unless you are in management."
good,I liked working there at first going to work helping customer's working at the cashier register stocking shelves in my free time but after awhile my manager was never there to give us change for our tills or to break bills and the assistant manager took alot of breaks it became hard for me to do multiple task at once there was no teamwork no one was helping me so I decided to leave iwasn'
good,Okay place to work for about a month until you start losing your mind dealing with mean and rude customers and Corporate doesn’t care. They’re more concerned about YOU stealing from them then there own customers.
good,"There were too many unanswered questions after I left. Why I was black balled from employment from ur company , the District Manager's additude with the new manager.  I was the last hired with the old manager and first to be let go with the new manager."
good,Dollar Tree isn't a good place to work there pay really sucks as I started out at $7.35hr and I've been working here for 2yrs now and only making $7.50 hr. I only work 4 hours a day and get one 10min break. There are now benefits unless your a manger. And the mangment really sucks one of my mangers is always on the phone . I won't  not recommended this job to anyone!!!!
good,Dollar Tree does not hire-on full-time employees. This would be good if you are looking for part-time work only. The pay did not compensate for the job tasks.
good,Its great if you have other income. I would never suggest working there full time because you'll sink your life into it and they never give you anything in return
good,"I was fortunate at Dollar Tree to have an excellent DM. Of course neither she nor I are any longer there. My experience there is they consistently under staff, and the store are micro managed as if they are cookie cutter. They train for a store model scenario that is rarely used as the sales necessary to support labor costs are generally unattainable due to wildly varying store sizes and floor plans. Great part time work, but not a job with a promising career or future."
good,It was a real slow pace job were we only worked 5 hours a day Thursday-Saturday from 12am-5am are 5am-10am wit a real low pay check every 2 weeks and it wasn’t enough
good,"The managers talked about everyone to everyone behind their backs including some employees. The work their hands down easy but to have to think every day someone is saying something and everyone knows except for me, and if it was even true was not healthy."
good,I think it was just my store i was hired in the summer and i was only their for a short three months but in my time there we had 3 different  managers all of whom where not good and very rude
good,Great experience learned a lot loved my co workers and customers I just wish they gave more hours and paid more manager was a little rude he would talk about what your not doing right instead of helping you
good,its an ok place if you are looking for quick money. ok if you know what you are doing. not enough time to get things done.changes everyday you never know what you are going to do. i can say they will work around the hours you need.
good,I only work there for three or four weeks but the store managers never there but in the morning for a bit. Also doesn't call me to tell me know if she let me go for any reason at all. I tried to call even told one of the managers to leave her a note to call me because I could never get a hold of her to see if I had a job or not. 😕
good,It was a great opportunity for me to get the training but that placing wasn’t a good place to work.they want you to work yourself to death but doesn’t give get pay.
good,Dollar Tree has some of the greatest prices and it's very affordable too many people around the nation and they're very very convenient store to shop at.
good,"I worked there for almost a year,the pay per hour could have been more due to the stress of management, and some co workers.This job is good for someone that doesnt really have a life outside of work."
good,"Really easy work, very slow paced, very few employees who were not expected to do much. Most of the employees had other jobs, As a manager I averaged 22 hours a week, regular associates were scheduled 4 hour shifts"
good,No matter how much of a good worker you are you will always be treated like a slave. They will literally fire you for two dollars and six cents. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
good,"I started working at dollar tree 6 months ago they quickly bumped me up to assistant manager about 2 months after I started working there. They only trained me for a few days, after that it was all up to me to figure it out. Working as just a sale's associate was so much better because you can just come in do your job and leave but as an assistant manager I feel that the store manager puts way to much pressure on you. I felt like they wanted me to dedicate all my time and energy to this job that only paid me .50 cents more then minimum wage. The store manager at the store I worked at would constantly call me on my days off and want to talk to me about work and I only would get 1 day off a week. I had a very sick family member that I needed to take care of for 2 days and the store manager almost refused to let me call in and made a big deal about it even tho I did have sick time that I wanted to use I just felt that they wanted to much from me. I worked about 40 hours a week with no benefits and only made .50 cents more then minimum wage but had way more responsibility then a sales associate it just didnt seem fair. So if you want to get a job at the dollar tree I dont recommend becoming part of the management team it's really not worth it."
good,It’s not really somewhere i would suggest somebody to work at. Atleast not the one i work at. They have very poor management They don’t treat me right there. They continue to Cut my hours weekly. I’m just ready to find a new place to work.
good,The Dollar Tree is a good job.  A lot is expected of employees that only earn minimum wage and that plays a huge role in the disgruntlement that is throughout the store.  I am lucky enough to have enough experience to stay above all the gossip and just keep doing my job.  The hardest part of working here is the lack of appreciation from upper management to recognize what is being accomplished on a daily basis.  Employees play a huge role in the public's impression of the store and it would be great if they were appreciated.
good,"I left because I was not getting enough hours to help support my family. I have 2 children so working 1-2 days a week was definitely NOT enough. Plus every couple of months our district was getting a new DM, so that took a toll on everyone because things would always change."
good,"It seems that Dollar Tree has an unspoken of formula for their employees. I would call it a revolving door policy. They are concerned more with filling a space than aggressively scouting for exceptional people that would be a positive influence to the work place and the company. There was never a problem with co-workers,but,management was more or less inadequate."
good,Okay experience. I knew I was not going to work at this location for a long time. I left because I had to go to school to further my education and be who I want to become.
good,You can't plan a budget bc you never know how many hours you'll be given. They'll have you come in to work freight overnight out of the blue. You may have 38 hours one week and only 18 the next.
good,"Working at Dollar tree is a good job for an intern and volunteer work. My experience with Dollar tree was good you get to meet friendly people and friendly customers, some are rude but you just have to remember your not there for them your there to make your money"
good,I think y’all should have better security and the pay should be way higher for certain locations because the location I was in was hard and BEYOND stressful to work at!
good,"The job is super simple and if you aren't looking for a lot of responsibility it is perfect, but with that being said it doesn't pay all that great plus its bi-weekly pay."
good,Nice enough place to balance out life but not quiet enough hours. Was fast pase around holidays but over all it was a good job. Need more workers around holidays though
good,Working at the dollar tree was nice. But it was just a temporary job I always planned in getting something better. But my co workers were friendly and horse weren't bad.
good,"The job is easy enough, but there is slim to no growth opportunity. Not a very challenging environment, but the team members are fun to work with, and the shifts are reasonable."
good,"It was good for the time being, wasnt a great place to work, upper management was rude. Benefits were not good what so ever and didnt pay as much as they should of"
good,No statement  I  would  prefer  not  to  add a statement  and  feel  that  it would  be unprofessional  to do so. I'm only filling this out because it is required.
good,"It was a dead end job, we were only allowed to work 15 hours a week so that they did not have to give us any benefits. It was hard work but there were aspects that I did enjoy. It wasn't all bad."
good,"high volume store. Continuous working except for 10 min. break. Fast paced, great working with customers. hardest part of job was inflexibility of working schedule.  Management not particularly interested in workers opinions or problems."
good,"it was good. but they dont give full time job."
good,"Its always busy."
good,The company is beginning to experience problems due to over expansion They send to much products of the same kind at one time which creates OSHA violations in stockrooms
good,It was my first job in retail. I enjoyed the people I worked with. It is a very friendly environment. It was good experience for my first job in retail.
good,work 4 to 5 hour shifts and the store is mostly hectic having to do multiple jobs. Hardest part is having to do multiple duties at once. Most enjoyable part is stocking.
good,A typical day working at a dollar tree includes cleaning up the store. I've identified a few cautions such as cases being stacked too high. I didn't learn anything particularly new except how to use a new computer system. This particular store manager is not friendly and I would not work with her in the future. A lot of older people work there just for something to do outside of retirement. The most enjoyable part is closing.
good,Working at dollar Tree is very stessfull. Your expected to do a lot in a little bit of time and if your not used to that then your in trouble. The  Manager there is horrible you can hardly ever talk to her so if there’s a problem your in your own.
good,They only had one cashier at a time and one person to clean the store and provide backup. All the managers I worked with were fired for not competly doing their job.
good,"Dollar tree is quick paced job, you have to be alert at all times. They create an competitive yet relaxed environment. There are many sale and marketing opportunities granted to its workers. The management however is not the best. Better training programs are needed for the Dollar Trees. Dollar Tree is a very self oriented business, dollar tree lacks the ability to collaborate, lacking in teamwork and communication skills. Dollar tree stores are do not challenge its workers as much as they could."
good,It’s ok you really can’t have a life when working on management they give you too much to do with no hours soooo out of order ... I love my boss but i also need a life
good,"This was my first job and it was not what I was expecting. The training for the job I had received was not very thorough which left me clueless at times, even when I would try to aid a customer. Management was in disarray when I was hired as the manager was on leave for personal reasons. This may have contributed to my lack of training."
good,"Typical work day would to check out customers and stock the shelves mostly. It was an alright part time job to get a little extra cash. I would have stayed if the new manager that came along didn't lie to me about not being able to transfer. Other then that, it was okay."
good,Customers where great! Management team not so good. Store managers were rude and very unprofessional. Hours were given based on personal friendships and not job performance.
good,Fast paced company with great people. Large trucks with minimal hour . Support from corporate is great. Fast growing company with a lot of opportunities. Learned great management skills
good,"a typical day at work sucks idk what to say about it , its a good place too shop but not too work or spend most of ur time there the people are inconsiderated an jugmental"
good,"Low hours. Unclear job duties. Got reprimanded for ""doing to much"" and ""stepping on toes"". Work even on lunches but still had to clock out, because I would get into trouble for ""not taking a lunch"""
good,"If you don't have a family and love to work hard Dollartree is where you want to be. It takes long hours to do what Dollartree wants but it's rewarding to see your hard work pay off. I started with the company as a PT Stocker and worked my way up to a Model Store Training Store Manager. But once I had a child working 50-60 hours a week and more during 4th quarter became to much. Along with long hours the pay isn't enough to support a family on but was good for a single person it's not bad. Overall I learned a lot in my time with Dollartree but I went as far as they would let me. Once it was clear advancement out of store level was not possible because I was not a ""yes"" man, it was time to move on."
good,Good for an additional job or young adults looking for extra cash. Not a career choice for sure. Managers are pretty rude and ignorant. There are not any benefits for part-time employees.
good,"Fun, fast pace work environment. But work hours were set for someone who didn't have a family or a life outside of the job. They couldn't work around my school schedule or when i had my car accident."
good,"Usually an entry-level retail job, Dollar Tree cashiers provide customer service and perform basic tasks at store locations. Primary job duties for Dollar Tree cashiers include greeting customers, ringing up purchases, handling returns, and answering questions about products, policy, and services."
good,"While doing morning shifts as a Key-Holder, the alarm is disabled, tills are turned on then the cashier and I head to the back to count the tills as well as the safe. Once we head upfront, we check the balloons for any orders and blow them up if there is some. A quick sweep and finishing any put-away's away that were left from the previous night. Once the doors are open, stocking being until the cashier is ready for a break, afterwards it continues. "
good,The hours are at maximum 20 no matter position applied for. The opportunity to advance takes longer with the lack of hours. Really wish i could say more good than bad but I honestly did not enjoy the time there.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of some stocking, but mostly face-to-face interaction with customers at the register. While working there, I learned that I cannot allow customers opinions to interfere with my personal reflection of myself or my job. However, I did learn how to effectively resolve customer's problems or concerns. My manager at Dollar Tree during 2016-2018 was very pleasant and personable for the most part. I did think the way he handled some situations were unprofessional and inappropriate, but he would apologize when things were out of hand. My co-workers were friendly and patient and intelligent and were willing to help or trade shifts with everyone if necessary.  Unfortunately, we were a little understaffed but we still were able to preform our job in a professional matter regardless of the burden.  The hardest part about my job was having to juggle my appointments, my children's appointments and schedules, and my schoolwork AND my job. At minimum wage and 25 hours a week, I was not able to provide for my family so I had to give my 2 weeks notice and buckle down and go back to school. Plus, part-time employees hardly have any incentive to stay other than the fact that it is a relatively easy job. The most enjoyable part of my job was the regular customers who appreciated my hard work and dedication. If something ever happened and I needed a job quickly, I know I could call Dollar Tree and still be able to count on them to give me a job if I were in a bind."
good,working at the dollar tree always kept me on my toes because i never knew what to expect when i go in to start my shift. everyday was something different . i was ring up customers then go stock then when shipment came in i would be unloading
good,its good just not a job for me to work at. not enough hours not enough pay i dont wanna work in retail the work hours i dont like the pay is horrible and i m moving and i dont like how i work and no else does
good,"Overall all, it was an ok position to have for a part time job. I started as a regular cashier and after a year i advanced to assistant manager. Because of it's location it had a high volume of customer traffic coming in and out and during holidays the store would be a complete mess at the end of the day. District manager was extremely rude and unprofessional."
good,"Productive place to work as an hourly employee, but no overtime is granted for hourly employees. It is consistently busy and competitive. Management teams are stressful for this area with lack of support. You will not have an normal life with family of husband and kids working as a manager with this company."
good,I enjoyed working there and around the people's we was like one big happy family and  we helped each other it was like team work everyday it every time I went to work or just stopped in to say hello.
good,"All I ever did was stock shelves, I never got that many hours. I also ended up getting fired without any reasoning and was never informed until my mom had to ask the manager herself."
good,I really have no complaints besides management. I really enjoyed the customers and working for the company. It was my first job and gave me great work skills to build from.
good,"I get straight to work when I enter the building, sometimes its slow sometimes it's fast-paced.  Light work is expected when the pace is slow. The best part of the job is talking to customers every day. It's corny but sometimes they really can make or break your day."
good,"Not many hours available. "
good,"Not a bad job overall, but the hours and the pay was inconsistent. The management didn't take their jobs seriously and relied on other employees to get the job done."
good,I would have liked this job more if the manager was nicer and didnt pick favorites. And we were hounded to stock as fast as we could. The back room was terribly unorganized. We could never find what was needed.
good,Very busy store just not enough pay or hours. To many employees and not enough shifts. Paid biweekly and schedule changes every two weeks. no fulltime avaiable for cashiers.
good,"Management poor"
good,"Management at Dollar Tree are all on different pages. Very confusing to work with the 4 different Assistant Managers, Each telling you to do a different job, then the other managers do, so you have 4 jobs you are trying to get done all at once, "
good,Inconsistent work hours will be given to you. Slow-paced work environment. Very high turn-over rate. Do not miss one shift for any reason unless you would like to receive no hours whatsoever
good,I really like stocking and my customers I learned a lot from the warehouse manager  On Thursdays I would help unload the big truck and on Mondays I would unload the frozen truck and stock the fridge and freezer  The worst part is I enjoyed working and didn't get enough hours I enjoy helping customers  but the best part of my day is stocking
good,"Job was okay, but couldn't be late or no call no show which that applies to any job. I learned how to work others & help in any area needed. I learned how to train others, answer phone calls, do returns  & check purchase."
good,You never knew how long u were gonna be there. You could clock in and clock out 10 minutes later. I got 40 hrs only 3 was the time I was there. Only one break in 8 hrs and that's your lunch.
good,"My responsibilities include assisting with the weekly truck delivery unloading, stocking products in aisles while being the back-up cashier and going to the bank for deposits and change and deal with customers. Atmosphere in the store tense due to too much workload and lack of organization from manager"
good,Good for people just coming out of high school and then we need a job good with someone that just wants to work a part-time job pick up a little extra money
good,I like the job it can be tough with all of the crime and dangerous people nothing I cant handle. I learn a new level of patience with people. learning my job was easy .I was taught well by my manager. The culture is out of hand employees are allowed to much rope.The hardest part is confronting thieves they really can become aggressive .I enjoy the customers who have respect.
good,"Only 4 hour shifts,  great customer service, lots of freight deliveries come every tuesday, although it can be a little stressful, great people to work with"
good,For someone who wants a part/full time job this place can be an option for basic stock and cashier work. After six months of employment you are eligible to move to assistant manager if desired. There is definitely room for growth in the company. I think this is a stepping stone and definitely not a lifetime carrier. The work environment can be stressful at times and when accompanied with poor management  can be difficult to enjoy. Overall this is a good company for part time work but the turnover rate is a bit high.
good,"Depending on your shift you can be busy or just steady. It also depenss on the time of the year. Christmas time is very busy and you wont get off the register at all. Non holiday times of the year are just steady. Morning shift people will blow up balloons, fill the soda fridges, put the flowers outside, and maybe stock (depends on if theres anything to do). Mid shift people will be the busiest on cash register and might not have time for anything else but if you do then you will probably recover the store. Night shift people will do the most work. They recover the store, do all the go backs, sweep, mop, count all the money at the end of the night, and if theres time they stock. Not a terrible job, but not something you should do long term."
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree but there were no hours available. I would balance the safe and registers on a daily basis. I enjoyed working with the public.
good,i would come in clock in and get right to the register we had to make sure the front of the store was up to part.i really didn't have to learn much because i ready knew what i was doing . the management has very fun. work culture is ok. nothing hard about the job. the most enjoyable part about work was going to lunch
good,I enjoyed this job at one time but it got old quick. Right after this job is when I started working with auto parts.I have a lpve for cars and always will. This is one retail job that I would never want to work at again.... I hardly even shop in there anymore sue to all the nonsense this job has to offer
good,Not a bad starter job. Very fast paced. Very busy store. Must have alot of patience. It's a good job to have if its you first job or are looking for something part time. There is room for advancement though. Your schedule must be flexible.
good,"Work days are busy. Your stocking shelves, cleaning the store, assisting customers. the hardest part of this job is making sure all your supplies are out . Also trying to keep a clean store in the process."
good,I worked here in college as a cashier and then as assistant manager. I watched over a small mall store while we opened a new larger store. I had little training and it was quite stressful. I quit because I was still young and they wouldn't let me off to see family for Christmas break.
good,"The hours are low, they don't pay well,alot of the employees slack on their work. But it is a good store where everything is literally a dollar. You meet alot if good people."
good,"The job itself was perfectly fine, however management was not good. Managers would often say one thing then do another and you would take the heat for their mistakes. Also they constantly push for production beyond the physical limitations of the equipment, and most equipment is poorly maintained."
good,It was a good job to work as part time but it the work wasn't fair . They didn't know how to properly make schedules or clean . The managers didn't really help you out but overall it was kind of a nice job .
good,"Not much to review on this career choice. Being a cashier at the dollar tree is mostly standing in one spot, checking customers out. When you're not doing that, you're putting items back on shelves and cleaning a relatively small store. All items are priced the same, so there is no need to try and place items in some hyper-specific spot, just on a shelf with similar items."
good,I was seasonal at Christmas time. I already new the people that I was working with so It made it a lot easier on my first day.wanted full time employment but was never offered
good,It's more for people who go to school. They are flexible with you depending if you are good and if they like you. The company does not care for their employees. The most hours is 20 and  when it's slow 10 to 12 hours a week
good,A fast paced and extremely demanding job. It is very demanding and very physically demanding with a low pay scale structure.It can be fun but customers do not value the workers or what we do to keep the stores clean and stocked.
good,I definitely thank the mangers there who gave me my first job and taught me skills as a good worker in general but the Dollar Tree could not guarantee work hours. The job was very taxing because I felt I was not compensated sufficiently.
good,Rotated on hand shelved merchandise ensured quality control and assurance is upheld. I have learned not every job is for me job was not hard enjoyed unloading the truck.
good,"hated working at Dollar Tree the manager wouldn't work with my schedule at the time i was attending college and at the end they stopped working with my schedule they would schedule me days i had class. coworkers were nice and very supportive,got along well with ever person i met"
good,"at first it was great, but as time went on the store manager ended up leaving without any explanation or anything, and then they started to give out horrible hours. That was another reason for me leaving, I went form getting twenty five to thirty some hours to twelve maybe twenty and who could live off of that."
good,I enjoyed working with my assistant manager. I learned a lot from her. It's always good to learn different things. But the work place was a different story.
good,"great employers, love the manager she is always thoughtful ans understanding. my experience working with dollar tree was consumer service. now that was the fun part of the job meeting new people helping the consumers giving them smiling coming in and leaving the store."
good,This was my first job as a student and it has taught me quite a bit. To start off it shows how the world of retail functions and also the basics of hierarchy. Managers are treated like absolute trachand so are the employees. No matter how busy or big the size of the store there will only be a cashier and a manager to run the store which is pathetic. My years of working there we were not allowed to exit the store for our breaks and had to work at time on our breaks. I could go on and on about the downsides of working here. If anyone is looking to apply here for work make sure that you do not get enticed into a managerial position as you will learn the downside the hard way.
good,Was anot assistant  manager for over 2 years pay was only a little above minimum wage. Trucks were never on time would sometimes arrive 2 days late. Hard to plan things outside of work when you never know when you have to be there.
good,I tried and tried to move up and advance while proving I know what I'm doing and the management team wasn't what I would have hoped for..
good,"I have to admit this job was very uneventful most of the time. It did help me organize myself, as a person. Getting to work on time, finding reliable ways to work, every day was a guessing game but this job was great for starting out. Not too abrasive or over bearing."
good,"Great customer experience daily, some good days and some so not.I learned alot with this incredible company as far as beening in management and overall customer service."
good,If I didn't have my 15 years forklift experience I wouldn't be able to last 3 months. My first week working there they had failed the audit. Turret Truck malfunctions everyday. Spilled pallets in a lot of isles. A lot of employee call outs and supervisors getting fired.
good,"Im 18 years old, a senior in highschool and looking for a job. I have never worked anywhere before this is actually the first time im trying to apply to a job."
good,A typical day here would be to come in and see where you are assigned that day whether it be on the register or on the floor. Every once in a while the shifts would be changed to where you could get off early one day. They do work with your schedule while you go to  school and if you have another job.
good,"Clock in then turn register on and sign in wait for customers to come in greet them. Wait for customers to come to register ring up their items and bag them. Ask them cash,credit, or debit tell them to slide their card if using one. Give them there change if using cash. This happens all throughout the day."
good,Disliked the job. No team work or leadership. Hated the hours plus the work load was inconsistent. No structure or routine to everday work
good,The management of Dollar Tree is unfair and they do not support the employees of the company. The pay is little and the hours are not guaranteed.
good,"CEO of company does not pay employees well enough, very unorganized and unprofessional. Dirty environment to work in, little hours and rude management."
good,the manage ment isnt so great lack of supervisors poorly managed an the hard part was getting used too working with alot of people
good,I enjoyed working with the different people. The management wasn't to good. A lot of work for low pay. Hardest part of job was working with upper management
good,Everyone is trying to be in each others business and its too much about popularity. It reminds me of high school. People try to talk down to you and talk behind each others backs. What i have learned is how to stalk shelves and distinguish where the products go.
good,The customers are what made the job great interacting with new people and even sometimes the regulars. The company was very unorganized. Management was always changing. the main issue was the constant company change not that change is bad but at this particular company and location it wasn't good. At times it was difficult because you would have upset customers based on the lack of care by the establishment itself.
good,"My main job was a cashier. I also made sure that the front of the store stayed clean, and helped customers with any of there needs. Sometimes if I worked late shift I returned unwanted items and straightened up around the store. Job wasn't really hard I enjoyed it. The management started off good, but ended not so good. Very rude, and unprofessional."
good,"My manager was a perv (not saying all of them were) and would favor the women more than the men. Once my classes started back, he cut my hours and wouldn't call me with the schedule which would cause me to miss shifts. Not a job I recommend"
good,"The management was hard to talk to when it came to anything work related. The co-workers were great and friendly, they always did their best to make everyone feel welcome."
good,"I trained and obtained my forklift certificate. Here i drove a Reach Truck i did put away's and replenishment . Where i pick up pallets and placed and location. Job was very stressful,unorganized and unsafe. my co-workers made the job hard because they didn't clean up behind them selves.Management sucked to much favortism."
good,"the only positive i have is that you got paid. other than that everything was one sided, leaning in every way towards management. they would force overtime, with no type of pre warning and if you couldnt drop everything and be at work you ran the risk of losing your job. management never told the truth, theyd say one thing in the meeting and itd always turn around to be the total opposite!"
good,Fun place to work. Most people are friendly to work with. communication needs improvement. it is easy place to work. i enjoy the interaction with customers.
good,"Dollar Tree does not provide much room for advancement, there are no benefits and they pay minimum wage."
good,these places were not safe or enjoyable to work at the hours were not steady the people were mean the place was dirty the manager picked favorets .
good,"Dollar tree was a very interesting experience for me, I was a fresh man in college and that was my first job.  It always would have it's rush around 6:00 p .m but it was not that bad. It was a great learning experience for me and I enjoyed doing customer service work."
good,"It is just a starter job for almost everyone to get their job experiences. Because the idea of this Dollar Tree Store, most people don't pay attention about you and what you do .. as long as you work on time and get everything done."
good,A typical day at dollar tree is where you get your till and you go to your register and you let the other person either go home or go to break. I have learned how to make sure to keep the store organized and well maintained with the carts. Management isnt always the best but when they want to help you they do. My co workers are easy to get a long with. Hardest part of the job would be moving the helium tanks.
good,"Always keeps you busy, never run out of things to do!  Most enjoyable part is showing customers what new products we have for just $1!"
good,"I really enjoy my job. I just don't like the hours that are given, it is not enough to live off of. It can be difficult to some people if they do not know how to multi-task."
good,I enjoyed working there for almost four years. I just need more hours and there's not many opportunities for moving up in the company.
good,"Management at my location did a rotten job of communicating scheduling changes, shift switching and store policy. The head manager is also very sexist to her male employees while her female employees are treated extremely well."
good,"Unload tractor trailer, and stocking shelves. Manage a crew of 6 for stocking shelves. When not stocking was working to manage front end of store, such as cashiers."
good,it was a laid back job. My managers were okay and so were all my co-workers.
good,the job honestly is horrible there is no room for advancement and no matter how much the company grows all they want to do is take. I went from getting 40 hours a week to 9... not because of poor work either this is happening to 90% of the employees. Dollar Trees ideal work day is only 4hrs and 45mins they want to keep the pay low and make sure to never work an employee over 8hrs because god forbid if they have to pay overtime. Management is no help and definitely does pick favorites.
good,"Typically, a day at work is fun a warm environment with minor complaints. Management has grown to be a lot more stronger overall  and is only getting better, so are the over-night associates. The hardest part of the job is being short staffed, on the day that the truck is to come. I enjoy the over- night stocking, because a lot more work gets handled and every associate know exactly what they are to do."
good,company does not offer raises or a year review to talk about any possible positions to advance to. There were too many employees and not enough hours to go around. The work environment was somewhat hostile and management was unprofessional and disciplined employees in-front of customers. These were a few flaws that i think could be easily changed by the company. If these few things were changed i would easily go back to working with the company.
good,"Working at dollar tree was a new and fun experience. Costumers were nice but some times could be in a bad mood, i learn to always greet them with a smile.co~workers were always nice to work with,the most enjoyable part of this job was being respected by my boss enough for him to ask about my input about the store. For me it was heard to leave this store."
good,"A typical day would depend on what I was doing, some days I would unload the freight, other days I would cashier, and other days I would stock shelves. If it was a day where I was unloading the freight then it would be a good day because I would be in the back of the store not dealing with problems of the customers. If it was a cashiering day then I would be cleaning my register area and helping customers get there shopping completed. My co-workers were great to work with. Made some great friends along the way. The hardest part of the job would be having to go in at 5am to stock shelves. The most enjoyable part of my job was unloading the freight. I had a lot of different managers at times so it was hard to communicate. One would say do this and the other would say another."
good,"Responsible for meeting and greeting customers as they enter the store.  I am currently a cashier/stocker and I enjoy my job.  I am a people person and believe in making customers happy by keeping the store clean and neat as they enter.  I am responsible for all cashier transactions and interacting with the customers in a professional manner and to the satifaction.  Hardest part of my job would by unloading the truck understaffed.  I do unload the truck with no problem just wish more staff was there to assist with 2,500 to 3,000 piece truck"
good,"I like working with co-workers and the customers. It is convenient because I live walking distance from the job. Also, I like to help others."
good,"Dollar tree was a slow paced easy going work environment"
good,I was an assistant manager at one dollar tree. I loved my employees but the other management picked the ones they liked and gave them more hours. Since I was only part time manager I was ALWAYS made to close and even in some cases I would close one night we closed at 10pm could get out around 1030pm and then made to open the next morning had to be there at 7am by the time I would get home and eat shower it would be midnight then back up by 6am it was one of the worst experiences ive ever had
good,The most enjoyable part was unloading a truck and going home at a reasonable time.
good,"I learned alot of management skills here,but job security....there isnt any"
good,"Very repetitive work, hard to move up, promotions offered almost no pay increase, extremely hard to keep a 40 hour schedule."
good,A day at work would be fun I worked some days as a cashier I would clean my area keep it stocked and assist customers.My manager is always there and willing to help if asked and my co workers are fun to work with we are a good team working together.The hardest will be on my graveyard shirt pulling out freight and merchandising but best of it all was working with customers always meeting new people.
good,"at this dollar tree they will do anything for you to quit your job, if you get sick they complain that you are out off work for to long. if you have doctors appointment and you cant make it to work they complain about it. they scream at anything ."
good,I only worked there for a temporary job to fix the store before the Big Opening
good,"i enjoyed working at dollar tree it has taught me more customer service."
good,"no support from upper management,  The bonus program was great in the beginning, now the percentage rate for the bonus program has been raised to the point, no one is making bonus. Every year something has been taken away from the employee's . Example: no more time and half for holidays, extra .50 an hour!"
good,"Hours are long and seem to drag on forever, management could be better."
good,I enjoy working with and helping people and I did that at this job.
good,"i enjoyed working fior the dollar tree company,  a typical work day at the dollar tree for me was stocking, cleaning & mop\sweping and taking care of costomers at the front till. i always made sure all my tasks were done by the end of my shift. my boss was a very nice lady butwas hard to work with sometimes, but i never let the affect my work ethic. i liked the pepole i worked with they all where nice and easy to get along with, so theirs not much i didnt like about the job,the haredset thing was when i had too quit because my babysitter had to leave because she was moving. i thank you for your time and i hope you accept me for the job opening"
good,"The Dollar Tree is more of a busy place to work as it is continually understaffed.  For our small city size there seems to be a good amount of customers, which is a good thing."
good,"A typical day at work consist of setting up my drive items, making sure my work area was clean at all times, and helping/ greeting customers."
good,"A typical day at work, when working at Dollar Tree, I basically waited on customers. I would ask customers if they would be interested in a certain item that would change from week to week. I learned how to run a cash register, how to stock coolers, and go through the aisles and grab items that belonged in another aisle. Management was alright. Tended to play favorites and only give few hours to part time workers. I maybe worked 10 hours a week at times, and if I was lucky 25. The hardest part of the job, was that it was my first job, and I had to learn how to run a cash register, how to return bottles and to mark damaged items. My co-workers were amazing and hilarious. They were really easy to get along with, but you have to know when to stay out of drama in the work place. What I loved about the job, was how laid back it was at times, and how it was easy to catch on to things."
good,When I worked here it wasn't so much the job i loved but more of the people I worked with. It was a job and they made it worth coming in everyday.
good,Good mgmt......would have stayed working if I could have gotten more hours.....like being a cashier.
good,A typical day was ringing out customers and providing an enjoyable shopping experience. 
good,"Slow paced environment. A typical day at work was cashiering, stocking and cleaning."
good,"Helpped customer find products, stocked shelves, and run cash register"
good,"This was a job I had after highschool steady paced, alot of customers were easy and very pleasible with simple requests got along great with every employee, and manager worked together to get through whatever setbacks we came across"
good,"a typical day at work for me was just going to work everyday and doing what i have to do,joke around with my co workers.the hardest part of the job is waking up at 5am to meet at the store to unload the trucks for hours,but i got use to it,and i learned how to work at a fast pace.and the fun part about it was just to intereact with other people and help the elderly"
good,I was told I was to get personal help from mangers and received none. Second shift hours make it hard to have a life outside of work.
good,Offered me an opportunity. Worked with your schedule. loved the fact you could only work % hours a day. It helped in balancing your life
good,"not enough employee appraisals. The company is profitable, however the company doesn't compensate the employees with any bonuses, nor are they a family oriented company."
good,"I worked with a bunch of great people. The management wasn't always great, I learned a lot about working in the warehouse and about business in general."
good,i was the freight manger for several stores i took the truck inventory off the truck and than i fill the shelfs with the new product i also set up displayeds around the store i did end caps i did asr program i leaded a team of 8 people at a time i ran the front line with cashier and stockers i open and close the store ran midnight crew
good,It was ok. I only worked there as a seasonal. I have nothing negitave nor positive to say. The job was easy and hard at times. Not a bad gig.
good,"I was a cashier PT Seller and my priorities were taking care of the customers that came through my line in a four hour stretch. I learned how to scan items on my registers and how to handle some of the returns. However I found it hard to to my job because the management wasn't always available like they said they would be. My last day working I had an issue with a customer order in which my register just stopped scanning, I called for a manager, and no one showed up. I ended up manually putting in the customer order by hand with a misc. one dollar key. In the end I found that the customer had some items that were fifty cents and I had to call for a manager. I called again for a manager and she showed, but I got written up for it."
good,"I liked the co workers there. everyone was nice. I would show up to work, greet customers, handle the cash register, put away items and clean."
good,"Great people to work for, it's a part-time job with no exceptions and pay starting off is minimum wage. Good for something to do during the day and getting a little pay check for extra spending money."
good,"Hours were horrible, manager showed favortism and allowed stealing to occur without taking care of the problem. Unfair treatment of employees. Managers are rude to employees and customers."
good,"I really didn’t enjoy working here, but it was a job. The upper management is Not very smart, and unloyal to employees who have worked there for long periods of time. This is a job to expand your resume, but not a job to stay at for  anything over a year in my opinion."
good,I had a conflict with my Manager he said some things to me which were very unprofessional & downright degrading that is why I left that job.  Other than that IF you get a good manager it is not a hard job to do at all.
good,"I felt as if Management didn't like the staff they worked with. Calling in sick was difficult to cover and was often made a big deal. The job was easy but I seemed to get yelled at alot over drink coolers and impulse areas, as well as the reading glasses and sunglasses station."
good,"The job is pretty demanding, considering you will most likely be the only cashier whenever you get to work. You feel like you are doing the work of 2.5 people. The hourly pay isn't great. Break times vastly varies."
good,The stocking was confusing but the pay wasn’t much so I couldn’t really do what I want and the hours really want good.But the people was nice and I like working so when I didn’t get and hours it was aggravating
good,"Every store is different! While employed with the company I helped at multiple stores, the people I worked with go over & beyond for the company dismissing the fact corporate always left EVERY STORE I've ever worked in short handed! They allow no overtime yet expect you to get all the frait out. In 3yrs I went from $>.50to$8.95hr. They will allow a store to suffer before letting anyone get overtime. I feel like they take advantage of their staff which is one of the reasons they cant keep staff among many others."
good,Dollar Tree is a very challenging place to work. The days are long and the pay isn't very good. It is a great place for someone looking for part time work and looking to supplement income.
good,"could use a better management team. nice environment and coworkers. pay and hours could be better. customers are friendly and patient. "
good,"Not worth the headache, long hrs seems like all the work is done by one person. No work life balance . Long days sometimes nights, insufficient resources. Decent pay depending on where you work."
good,"Traditionally an entry-level retail job, Dollar Tree cashiers provide customer service and perform basic tasks at store locations. Primary job duties for Dollar Tree cashiers include greeting customers, ringing up purchases, handling returns, and answering questions about products, policy, and services."
good,There were some incidences where the money wasn't counted correctly by managers when closing so we stayed longer than we had to in order to undo their mistake. Customers were friendly and the atmosphere we gave off was very welcoming to those who came in which was enjoyable.
good,Overall the business runs good. I got along with some of my employees. I didn’t like that they randomly cut hours majorly. They are a good company....
good,Working for Dollar tree you was not very good feeling of having a safe secure job was threatened daily bad company if you did not meet your their quota.
good,"Not many hours, mininum wage. Was fun at times and good customer service experience. Overall I would say dollar tree is a good place to build experience."
good,"Good job for a person just out of High School or needing a job for a limited amount of time, but it wears you out physically and emotionally, and work/life balance, their is none.  Thankful for being here 2 years, but after a couple more months here into the new year, I would like a different job if possible."
good,"Somewhat an easy job, scanned objects, took money and returned change and placed objects into the bag. Sometimes worked stock, was not as interactive."
good,"Dollar Tree was an okay place to work when I first started there, the company's baby was named DEALS, I and some other co workers did store Assembly and Grand Opening, The DEALS stores were kicking butt, they were major competition for other stores in the area, especially on 125th street in New York, NY. DEALS prices were anywhere from $.50-$5.00 cheaper than the other stores. Now that it's back to Dollar Tree, it's great that everything is $1.00 Dollar, You can't beats that.waqwa"
good,Its a very simple job that is not hard at all to do & pays the bills. The cash register is the simplest I've ever worked & its learned in a day or two. Stocking is pretty much self explanatory.
good,"I think its a great job but don't really give me enough hours, don't really teach a lot of stuff that you should know some of the managers are ok but need to be better at their jobs. Sometimes the customers can be very rude."
good,"It was a good job, fun people to work with, could be a little stressful with some of the customers but thats every job. I learned alot from working there."
good,Its an okay job but I been there for a year. I am getting sick of it. I want another job but this will do for now. But I am gonna find another job soon.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree,loved the customers that was the best part of working there.. all emplyees worked hard and worked very well together.."
good,"Dollar tree cares about the bottom line. Store managers are responsible for any and everything that is wrong with the store. Which is absolutely ludicrous considering the freight is shipped automatically. If you are understaffed which accounts for most DT in the area, it makes it impossible to keep your store safe and compliant to osha and company policies, leading to write up."
good,"Working part-time (15 hours/week).  Management has been very flexible working with me on scheduled hours.  Hardest part of the job is standing for hours, the best part are the people you get to meet."
good,"Dollar tree is not a bad place but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wants to make money fast. The most you can work in one day is 4-6 hours, that's if no one calls out but if they do, you can take someones shift."
good,I personally wouldn’t recommend it to anyone but if you looking for a good pay and good benefits it is a good place to look at. Working there I never felt safe and bringing things to manager attention never seemed to matter.
good,Good Days and Harder ones just hope and pray for the better ones and keep to yourself work hard and whatever you put in just pray and hope that you get that and more back
good,"There was a very fast-paced and demanding work environment constantly. I always maintained a positive attitude regardless of the customers situation, resolving it promptly."
good,"If you're looking for temporary work or need retail experience then that's the only time I'd recommend this job. Minimum wage, no benefits, management didn't know what they were doing. (I left after we got a new district manager AND store manager)"
good,The job itself started out promising quick advancment for hard work. Little to no training from upper management and almost a year in advancement slows down dramatically was able to recieve training as a store manager but quickly learned it was to help take on those responsibilities without compensation which can impede current responsibility
good,"It’s a good job it’s just the pay and hours are not good at all "
good,"Dollar tree is ok management is not the greatest, there's no employee of the month,you work very minimal hours, even a high schooler couldn't really do anything with the hours they have, and they only have one register open knowing they need two, it's not a great place to work, however if you're a felon they do hire felons. which is good,so"
good,They want you to go above and beyond for little pay. They expect you to be fast paced considering whatever time you come in there is always a line.  So please be mindful of the long lines when coming to this dollar tree.
good,"I would have to say they don't give enough hours for the work they want done in a day. They put a lot of pressure on you to get everything thing done. They hand out write ups like they're candy. "
good,Absolutely 0 company structure with demanding district managers you are expected to unload 1 box every 2 min minimum of 160 a day and let me tell you it’s alot easier said than done when minimum wage is all you get and maybe 5 hours a day 2 or 3 days a week.
good,"A typical day at work was doing cashier and stocking."
good,"I've been working at Dollar Tree for almost two years .I love my co workers  but the customers are the worse ,the pay is awful 7.25 an hour and being paid bi-weekly sucks and all of the employee are part time with the exclusion of managers no paid time off or sick time so if you don't  work you don't get paid. Which is terrible for the people who has family in different states"
good,"i had over all a good experience at dollar tree. the only reason i quit was because there were not enough hours per week. it was a decent job, and still shop there frequently"
good,"A typical day at work was going in, clocking in, and ringing up the customers. I learned how to work at a faster pace but too many people would show up that I didn't have enough time to finish all my tasks. The management wasn't very good because I asked my manager for days off, the assistant manager called me in the day I asked for a day off, and told me I HAD to work, I told her I asked for that day off and to call the main manager to make sure, the main manager told the assistance manager that I did have to work and I turned in a 2-weeks noticed and asked her to look for it, she did and the both realized they were wrong- bad management. the workplace culture wasn't great cause everyone tried to be the same. The hardest part of the job was getting pressured everyday and getting threatened with write ups if I didn't do EVERYTHING they asked, I had to do the register, fill the coke coolers, recover the isles and seasonal, and they only me and 1 other person and expected a lot from just us 2. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i worked longer and got to get a 30 minute lunch break."
good,I enjoy my days at work assisting customers with finding the products that the need. Managing my staff to handle excellent customer service and productivity in a fast paced environment.
good,ok place to work the hours is part time the people that are in charge the show a lot of love to the same race which in return makes it hard to really enjoy working there.
good,"Each week we received a truck of 1200 cases, cases of small merchandise. We never had enough allotted hours to put it all to the floor. The manager is suppose to spent about 60 hours of his to compensate for hours not allowed to other employees. I never felt a sense accomplishment. Also, the company never appreciated my hard work."
good,This job is good for students its part time and they are good at working with your schedule. Be ready to work more than you get paid. Pay is minimum..
good,Everyone is very helpful as a team and they always lend a hand whenever necessary. The customers are patient sometimes and during the rush times like holidays it's very stressful.The manager always supports her employees and makes sure they are doing a good job.
good,My main reason for leaving was they were only scheduling me for about 8 hours a week. They also were under poor management during the time period I was there and no one ever knew what they were doing. I’ve seen other Dollar Tree’s that were run much differently and much more smoothly.
good,"If you are new here, you haven't any experience and need a good place for start, dollar tree store is the place. No benefits for employees and managers depend on the place but usually you can have nice experience."
good,Found something that paid more and they couldn't keep a store manager being there 5 years or so we had at least 7 new store managers I worked for them for 5 almost 6 years and when I was in an accident and had to be off and when i was finally able to come back they dropped my hrs
good,"The company is fine. No problems with the company, the location I was at was ran managed poorly. Communication between management and employers was terrible a lot of favoritism and favors are done for certain people it was just a toxic environment"
good,Ran a great store and  on top of comp sales but it has cost me a lot of my life. District manager is never happy even though my store always looks better then the rest. Really the attitude is do what you have to do but don't get caught. They know they force you to do things that are not policy and turn a blind eye until you show up on a report. Also there is no sort of security or loss prevention so people come in and steal left and right and there is nothing you can do except let them walk out. My store is also in a bad part of LA where sometimes are safety is in danger and the company does nothing to protect us.
good,"Something I learned from working at dollar tree was  patients and helped with communication skills "
good,"My time at the Dollar Tree was short-lived.  I was a temporary hire, though I was not told I was going to be a contract employee at the time of my interview or hire.  Overall it was a standard to somewhat sub-standard employment experience."
good,"The manager was a great person until I left the job"
good,"Work hard,stay on target agenda, work smart ,and safe and courteous, always bout on time,polite to others ,greet customers,show up early, follow rules and regulations"
good,"No room for advancement, but that is made clear form the start. It is strictly a part-time job, your hours never increase and you do not get overtime unless you are a manager. The work is there, but if you are looking to advance and continuously improve, this is not the place to go."
good,"it was an alright place to work. loved the people. hours sucked along with pay. expected to do alot within the short time your at work. they dont inform you that you can only be hired there 3 times including temp employment, some management shouldnt have been management."
good,I was only paid $8.50 for a manager position. Needed more Oder. The heaviest work loads were put on me. Not enough employees. The stock was out of order.
good,I enjoy my management team and working for this company. I do wish I had more hours and better pay for the daily things we as employees go through but I am grateful to be given an opportunity to work after such a hard couple of years of instability.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is a very nice opportunity. And, depending on management, is very a fun and exciting job. The stores are small enough where you can effectively direct customers."
good,"An average day at Dollar Tree consisted on coming in & clocking in & following up with your shift manager he places you on Cashier 2 you collect your money drawer from him count it make sure your 25$ bank is in there then set up your register & start checking people out. Bagging up their inventory/items, collect their total amount either in Cash, Credit/Debit Card, or check.Use your manners always. We also stocked the shelves with inventory."
good,It’s was to far and they wanted to work you to hard they did good by giving us free meals every Friday that made the employees a little happy so I think it was a okay job
good,"Definatlet a work environment thats grown ""comfortable"". You lopk too hard and you can tell the employees/managers work about as well as they're paid i suppose... No real competitve go getter / standard setter . More like Just Get Here and Maintain Standard. I'm not saying going above and beyond wont get an employee noticed , but alot of slack is given. Loose Management? Anyway, the company and concept that is Dollar Tree is wonderful. As a new hire Im pessimistic about the potential of advancement and most definatley need a second job if I ever dream of meeting my income needs (but thats on a personal note)."
good,"Got to learn alot of new things meet some nice people and some not so nice people, the hours were absolutely horrible for anyone not in management this made the turn over rate ridiculous. My 1st three years were good but then upper management changed and it became a very hostile working environment. All in all very disapointed."
good,"Good for part time but horrible if you wanna live on your own. No benefits no raises and no advancement. Manager at the time was great and looked out for employees, but couldn't do anything to support them."
good,"Great first job, very friendly and welcoming environment. Very high pace and many tasks such as cash, filling balloons, sorting go-backs and dealing with customer inquiries must all be balanced by the cashier."
good,I started as a stocker but the store figured out i could run a cash register so i was doing both but only part time.  That worked for a little while but i wanted more hours that i couldn't get so i went somewhere else.
good,It was a pretty good to work for if you are looking for something that is temporary. I would not recommend it for longevity. This retail work is to assist you on your resume and nothing else.
good,"Frieght manager enjoyed making all employees miserable on a daily basis. even talked with district manager and he did nothing, three manager gave notice at the same time because of the g"
good,Great place to work manager is a drunk and no hours for two or three weeks then they want to work you to death manager definitely has favorite as long as you don't mind kissing butt District manager and corporate look down there noses at the little guy trying to make ends meat
good,I do not like my job at dollar Tree management is not good. Over worked not. Do not pay. There is know advancement for my career. I have tried to get promoted.
good,It's a nice productive to work it will keep you busy for the time being.I just didn't get enough hours. It was a vesry nidxce friendly environment to meet people.
good,"From my experiences at Dollar tree, it is relaxing and quick paced at times of work. Which this is expected from the location and popularity of the store but as an employee, I feel that I could have better options for my career. This explains why this job is only my temporary work place, a place for me to get used to working in the sales floor and cashier position."
good,"Was hired as a Grand Opening merchandise stocker with the chance of being hired on full-time. Got along great with management and co-workers. "
good,"middle and upper management where not always available to answer question and give feedback.  (district and regional managers)."
good,"The Job Itself Is Not Bad.Good Crew Of Coworkers.Pretty Flexible Hours And Days.Just Not Enough Hours Or Days To Be Able To Live On.(Only 4 Hours A Day,One Day A Week."
good,overwhelming and very un organized place to work. It was fine when i first started but i then felt I was doing everything and no one offered to help me.
good,The hardest part of the job was setting up the store but I loved working with customers Especially seeing their faces at check out time. I learned that people really appreciate shopping at a store that has a good bargain.
good,It was ok could have been better . I enjoyed some of the workers... manager was nice and quiet . It could have been better by increasing the security and get a few more workers in the store so everything could be smooth and everyone could work properly!
good,"cash register operator"
good,"stressful trying to constantly keep store full, clean, and staffed with hours that barely keep 1 cashier on staff and expecting that cashier to complete more freight that you would expect a stocker to. the company constantly contradicted itself talking customer service and experience but they're only worried about one thing and that's not over spending work hours which constantly led to you losing employees. good employees because you could give steady hours one week then drop them to one 4 hour shift."
good,It was OK very slow but sometimes we pick up a lot of that a lot of the time you’re standing for multiple hours. They pay below minimum wage. Its really worth anyone’s time.
good,I would recommend to someone that doesn’t have a family an just looking for work. The company has free medical for full time employees and but the attendance policy is unfair and u clear
good,A typical day isn't so bad unless your the only cashier and it gets busy. When that happens it's hard for you to get your breaks and then the customers complain and it ruined a lot of my days.
good,Just not a great job. Higher to many drug addicts that try to run the store and if you don't quote what they want they attack you. They falsely accuse who they don't like and have a popularity circle that is irritating. I loved to work but hated who i worked with
good,never looked forward to going to work never wanted to come and when i was there all i ever did was want to go home and not come back or wish i could change my job and store site.
good,"Base on the location of the store I worked at, the work environment was not up to part. The store could of been better, as well as the opportunities for career advancement."
good,This job can get very chaotic at times it was very sociable but it was a nice job teaches you patience and great customer service. it is an okay place to work.
good,"I felt unappreciated, I was demanded to work different shifts all the time and different jobs (stoker, cashier, restorative). My hours were never consistent and the management was poor."
good,"any position here is easy. mostly consists of stocking, registers, and customer service. shifts for non managers are short. shifts for managers are long and mostly nights"
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was an excellent starting job, however, as my personal goals and needs advanced, this job could not keep up. You are limited to only 15 hours MAXIMUM per week, and are barely paid minimum wage. Some days you will be the only cashier available and be required to both run the cash register and stock the store."
good,Dollar Tree was a fast paced working environment that was fun and I enjoyed helping people and learning new things. Great experience but pay was not good or benefits.
good,"Days vary upon arrival, some start friendly with a manager being nice others start with anger and aggravation. Then throughout the day, some managers will get annoyed when you call them for a bill check or other sort of help."
good,"I just think that the managers need to listen to the employees and ""actually"" use some kind of enforcement to the ones that need coaching. There's a certain manager in particular."
good,"Dollar Tree is probably a great company to work for in the right place. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers, and knowing that they appreciate you being apart of Dollar Tree."
good,Work place great but it just a headache i love working with the people they a great time but the pay was not enough to pay my bills and rent they didn't even go up they pay when they was post to
good,"Very short term job, only lasted a week. Overnight restocking and rearranging. Changing one store into the Dollar Tree. Worked from 12-6. Nothing special, no advancement."
good,Not enough pay for the work expected. The trucks are way too big for the size of the store and not enough hours to get the stock out. Management doesn't care.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of looking over 2 to 3 cashiers at a time. Helping them as needed.  Helping customers as needed.  Switched out money drawers, counted and assign.  Count safe at the beginning of my shift and again at the end of my shift.  Stock products to shelves.  Keep store in very clean conditions. Above all, customer service. I was not to fond of the lack of support from management about anything that needed to be addressed. The hardest part of my job was knowing that not every customer is going to be happy when they walk through that door.  It was my job that they were happy while shopping there.  The most enjoyable part was knowing as long as I kept the store presentable I knew that we would keep our customers."
good,I enjoyed working here but it was unfortunately not enough hours to make a decent or livable paycheck. management was great and I enjoyed my co-workers
good,I loved working for dollar tree I just did not like the pay at all . Hours were great I love to stock and want more stocking jobs . But I would like better pay for myself .
good,"It was cool at first, then its started getting annoying. The manager was a bit inconsiderate and she doesn't know how to communicate with people. The nicest thing there was the toy drive for christmas."
good,It was a good place to work. i think it should have better management tho. there are pretty fixed hours i wish they where a bit more flexible although they where easy to maintain.
good,Typical day is usually busy with a few exceptions
good,The job was only temporarily but while I was working we were treated like nothing . Pretty much had to learn and move the store stock shelves on your own with little to no help . If it wasn’t done right then you would have to redo it
good,it was fine managers were too bossy and demanding and did very little you were expected to do even more work than the managers and the customers were very disrespectful
good,nothing to fancy basic cashier position standing for 6 hours or more. rude customers but opportunity for more hours. they definitely cheap when it comes to breaks
good,Days were routine and predictable with very little variety. It was very rewarding to assist customers and sales staff in the everyday operation of the store.
good,"I've worked at Dollar Tree for close to a year now. Thought DT would give me some good experience in retail; in which it greatly did. As a cashier, you're expected to run register, greet customers as they enter and stock shelves. There will also be other tasks, depending if you have to either open or close. I also unload their weekly trucks, which requires quite a bit of heavy lifting. You can't play around during that time either because manager expects you to use half of your shift to stock once it's over. It's busy work, but makes the time fly if anything. Some managers can be better than others; it's shown by the shape of their store and if they actually care. Most shifts are only 4-5 hours long and the pay is minimum wage. Which is why so many people come and go working at this place. Managers and assistant managers are given 5 days work weeks and the rest normally 3-5, depending on how much you're liked. It is possible to earn more hours around holidays or covering shifts for no-shows. With the high turn-over rate, you'll find yourself trying to be called quite often during your days off. If not your store, the others in the region desperately seeking help due to the same reasons. If you're not set up to have mileage covered, don't even waste your time. And once you start going to those other stores, they'll only want you to come back even more. Inventory is a nightmare cause a majority of times their stockroom will be piled with boxes high as the store's walls. There's just not enough hours to get anything done, so the freight just keeps piling up. Customers can be nice."
good,Was an Assistant Manager and was more like a staff memeber than anything. Felt like a glorified cashier most of the time. Worked with minimal staff most days.
good,The majority of the managers at this company is horrible and HR isn't too far from behind. If you decide to work for this company best advice is not to trust no one do your job and go home
good,I would recommend this as a second job for someone. The management that I had working there was not the best. I do not believe the pay was enough for all of the work that you have to do.
good,"A typical day at work includes working at the registers, fronting and facing products, and restocking shelves. The tasks are simple but repetitive. I learned how to work and communicate with other people and how to improvise and think fast when the situation called for it. I also learned accountability and teamwork. The manager was pleasant, but not overly helpful when I was trying to learn how to do what was required. The assistant managers were very helpful and were always patient and willing to teach and explain the how's and why's of the job. The workplace culture was fair. The other employees were pleasant and offered help when needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to complete all the tasks required, as assisting customers at the front often kept me from being able to straighten aisles in the back (especially during rushes). The corporate policy also made things a bit difficult with the unnecessary, inefficient, and time-consuming activities that they required associates to complete each day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with customers of all ages and the simplicity of the tasks assigned."
good,Job was ok I like fast pace I like to keep busy the store didn’t have enough business for employees to have hours I would had like to worked full time with better pay
good,I went into work 4 am everyday got off at 10 my issue with this job was not enough hours . only 5 hours a day was not enough money to provide for my family and pay my bills.
good,"I loved working here. I was just looking for better pay."
good,A lot of physical work unloading trucks and stocking shelves.  Customers made this job worthwhile. Low pay and no benefits.  Good if you just want a part time job.
good,"Come to work under hot & unsafe conditions. Always load a trailer from the bottom side to side level out heavy products on the bottom light products on the top. Poor management not enough leaders in the offices. Good Natured workplace culture & people. When a wave is 70,000 pieces of products & may be assigned two 2,500 piece trucks as a temp. Its never a enjoyable moment on the grounds of dollar tree dc."
good,"My first job. Not a terrible place to work at for your first job. Pay was what you would expect, you get paid every two weeks. Unpaid 10min break. Store was small so it wouldn't really get too crazy with customers. And was easy to clean up after closing."
good,After I completed my interview I was asked to only come in on the days the truck came and needed emptied. And the next day when they product had to make it on shelves. So just a lot of physical-ness easy customers though.
good,The area was a bad area and people always use to steal. There was no security so they use to get away with all and any merchandise. People would come to that store everyday and they would steal anything they could get they hands on
good,relax work place with friendly co workers cool bosses. clean environment and fast paced work. they would always help with the questions you had or needed help with.
good,"Most of the time I worked at the cash register, helped people find things and merchandised.  I learned that it was important to keep things clean and organized for good shopping experiences.  Managers were clear about what needed to be done.  Management was positive.  Work culture was busy since I worked at peak times.  The hardest part was lifting heavy boxes of merchandise to be put on shelves.  Enjoyed the customers and their repeated visits."
good,There isn't  really much to say other than you stand on your feet for 4-5 hours and make sure your customers are satisfied other than that its a great place for College student and Parents who need a second job.
good,It is more than just a company! It is a large family. The owners are fair and kind.They set the bar high. They pay very well but sacrifice is what is going to take if you want to be the best in that building!
good,"Dollar Tree operates an environment of hostility and poor employee relations. They require long hours and little pay. You will be yelled at, cussed at, written up, and required to stay until demanding goals are met. As soon as you met on crazy goal they will require more of you until you are so exhausted you just quit."
good,Stocking was flexible schedule with the availability to work other jobs was possible and positive. The store manager was the easiest to work with and positive.
good,"It wasn't an amazing job, but I did not hate it either. It was fast paced because they only had 2 cashiers available and a lot of people were in line. Usually, the lines wrapped around the store. You can work at any pace you want to. They don't try to rush you, but something about the long line of people for only two cashiers makes me naturally want to work at a fast pace. Only thing I wish happened was that they provided tip cups for the cashiers."
good,Dollar Tree was a fun place to work at. A good start for me to learn some management skills and working skills. There's too much responsibility when it comes to store clean up. I always had a whole list to remind me what needs to be done before closing time. I always did my best to managed to get through. One thing I had trouble with most the time was not having enough workers. So when it got really busy I would never have enough time to get my things done unless I push myself.
good,"Always something to do , never a dull moment,"
good,"Job can be very stressful because of Distract Manager, they micro maneget. Dollar doesnt give you a chance to prove anything before they are hooverin."
good,"Stock shelves, run Point Of Sale positions."
good,"This was typical of a seasonal part-time retail position. No surprises. If you are familiar with seasonal part-time retail jobs, you know what to expect. It is fast pace with lots of customer service."
good,"Productive work place very fun place fast pace environment great people to work with, the store is  very busy all the time. Has a manager your day is full because you are always delegating and directing work flow."
good,Fast pased not enough staff..no communication skills with some of the management team ..tje pay is reasonable..have to b able to multi tasks..always work with ur head up
good,high customer srvice rate multuple customers daily running stock and inventory counting large amounts in cash register cleaning bathrooms and mopping floors
good,A typical day is you are stuck at a register by yourself having to ring up all customer and are expected to stock a certain amount of items on the shelves. The management doe snot care for any employees. All expections from the higher ups are unreasonable and un acheivable
good,"depending on the dollar tree you work at will determine the experience you receive. the one i worked at was very unorganized, unprofessional. For 7.25 i was doing a lot more than i feel should be done, it became stressful and sometimes it felt i was the only worker there when it was multiple."
good,The leadership at the home office is well diverse and focused on getting you what you need to survive.  The mid level team needs better methods on communicating vision.
good,It's a ok place to work but having to clock out for a min break it makes no sense... I like fast pace but keeping track of your boxes and time takes up to much time.
good,really fast paced often little to no hours and huge lines tooo much work for just one person the truck was extremely stressful and rather heavy process
good,"The customers are always a joy to see and to help them out."
good,"I enjoy going to work each shift.  I enjoyed getting a raise without knowing about it.  They worked around my school schedule which was fantastic.  Typical day, cashiering and customer service.."
good,I loved working there with my co workers and seeing a smile on the customers face was a blessing nthe only thing I can say it that te manger was no so nice
good,typical was non stop from the time I walked in the door I had to do what ever had to be done to get the store up and going to open on time. Sometimes I had to con in and clean the store to open it up for the day
good,Company OK.  Manager sucks.  Would be better if the new store manager had a brain in her head and cared about her employees.  Has no people skills and feels that she has to be a witch to everyone to get the job done.
good,bad manager she was horrible at scheduling and would never clean the store or help you if you needed.but she left and we got a new manager that was really nice and taught me a lot it was sad to leave
good,Fast paste work environment with few rewards. The work involved to sustain the store does not match the amount of workers or hours to do so. Hours are constantly cut and you are expected to do twice the amount of work for not enough pay.
good,"iam retired ,but still like working.Dollar Tree was nice to at because I have family in the area. the customers was very nice and friendly too. I would have still been working there,but it was a seasonal job"
good,it was the type of job you work to learn about different things the days was not long cause you was constantly moving around completing tasks and making sure your work area stay clean for customers to be able to walk without stepping over things and tripping over things
good,"it helped pay the bills for a time.  Not a terrible place to work but, not my true skill set.  The people were nice.  Sales and cashiering, stock, customer service.  It was an interesting job experience."
good,"The cashier job i had at dollar tree was pretty good in the beinging then it started to get real stressful. I started to notice i was really the only cashier they had scheduled, now unless i got real busy then the manger would jump on another register.... Most of the time, every time I went in for my shift i would be the only cashier. I would only work about four hours per shift and if i was lucky three to four days out the week. I did not even have time to properly clean my area and do my side work because i would be that busy on the cash register without any help."
good,Overall the years I work at dollar tree I learned how to communicate better with difficult customers . The hardest part of the job was maintaining the truck but I got threw it an had sales going up
good,It a loving place to be cause i love meeting new people and helping people. It help me for being shy at dollar tree. It help people talk more when u working around people.
good,store had no hours and store was low on staff. to much theft not alot of days to work. managers are always goofing around. and staff workers were always stealing.
good,Suffice it to say that I would not recommend this company to anyone.  The culture does not allow for promotion or advancement in the corporate office.
good,typical day at work would be you either running the register as main cashier or on the floor doing go backs. i learned nothing its a basic job as long as u can count you should be fine. Management is alright depends who the managers is.
good,"district manager is not willing to hire within the company, some of the store managers are extremely rude, stores are very dirty, a lot of damaged product"
good,Can be a great work place Depending on the location and managers. Some managers dont care and won't answer calls or even district managers. But they don't work around your schedule.
good,It was a very fast paced environment. Only pays minimum wage. All employees are expected to work all days and all shifts regardless of other obligations.
good,The work place is very smooth and easy. The hours that are given between the cashiers are horrible. Sometimes the managers are inconsiderate about the workers.
good,I enjoy working with the public. But don't enjoy the favoritism being shown throughout the company. I work very hard for little pay. It's a part time job I need more money to survive. I'm a single mother raising a great young man. Management should show examples for their employees to follow and if they are slacking the others will do the same.
good,they are an ok company to work for . working at a fast paced all day unless your on the register. Unloading the truck was a pain everything else was wonderful.
good,overworked and underpaided and not appreciated. managers are lazy and indecisive. Expect you to do a ton of work in little hours. 4 hour shifts per day
good,"Management seemed in experienced, and often times did not have solutions to basic problems. Such as trucks coming in a bit later than they should. Did not hire enough people to properly unload trucks. Often times customers were upset at how few cashiers there were. Our store had a lot of foot traffic, which created long lines, due to not having enough cashiers."
good,Work the opening shift as a cashier on feet 5 hours and get a 10 minute break company and manager seem more concerned about theft and infraction of rules then about employees themselves company as a whole is VERY CHEAP no raises whatsoever aynd only pay $1.50 an hour extra on holidays instead of time and a half
good,Not a place to make a career. Great for students in high school or college. Flexible work hours and they work with your outside schedule. Easy work load.
good,"For the purpose of this sirbey, i shall write/submit a brief thank you messehe. Thank you in advance for the opportunity to share my input about this company."
good,"managers only make a dollar more than cashiers, cashiers are expected to clean the store, stock the shelves, help customers, sell the item of the month and the day, AND work the cash register all at the same time, because they are too cheap too hire employees, yet if you're lucky you get a 3 hour shift three days a week."
good,Not the best company to work for. The associates are all good people but the management is pretty spotty. They play a lot of favoritism at this company.
good,"-work at 4 in the morning till 8"
good,"I worked for Dollar Tree in 2014, it had ups and downs like any other job does, enjoyed working there, it is a very productive work place,  always busy."
good,"I was the freight Manager. I was responsible for ordering for the store, making the store schedule and preparing my team for deliveries to the store. I would unload the truck and arrange pallets for different departments as well as helped unload and stock the shelves. I was trained on the cash register as well as closing manager which involved cash deposits ,closing the store, cleaning and designating jobs to other associates."
good,Me personally I don't think dollar tree pay enough. Your in a dollar store where its toys and other supplies. Know me I was a cashier so I seen who was coming in and who was coming out. They'll just let they kids run around and tear the store up. After they tear it up guess who is on cleaning duty? They have you to break your back when your getting paid lower then minimum wage.
good,"While working at Dollar Tree in Forsyth Ga, I was underpaid and had to do tasks that managers didn't want to do. The managers helped people of other races excel in the company, and others of different race were fired for ""unexplained"" reasons."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree was tolerable, in a nutshell. The environment was clean, fairly organized, and task-oriented. The supervisor was thorough and kind with instruction and work assignments. However, the co-workers there with me had a bit of conflict and were fairly opinionated of one another. Also, my reasoning for leaving dollar tree was the lack of tasks and availability of hours to work. I learned how to cashier and count up and down the assigned drawer at the beginning and end of shift and how (no matter the person) work well with others and maintain peace in the environment while on the clock."
good,Typical job at a retail store. The pros are that there is schedule flexibility and are able to request days off when needed. There are very little to no advancements in job positions and no employee benefits. Would recommend as a beginner job.
good,It's a good place to work if you know the right people an do the right things my experience with Dollar tree was ok for the most part I enjoyed the trucks an stocking shelves overnight but some of the management just didn't get along with there employees an treated them differently
good,"its an okey place, the mangers are always changing. sandy was my boss at the time and she was great she worked around my school schedule. the bad thing was you have to stock so much stuff in so little time and wasn't ideal for me."
good,I worked for the  Store startup. there was no guarantee of permanent employment. After the store was up and running they stopped scheduling me and other's without a formal notice of layoff.
good,"My coworkers were great, the hours were flexible. Work flow wasn't too much. There was no stability, though. Time management skills were hard to identify, I never knew when my clock out time was generally set for. Overall, Good workplace-atmosphere wise. Manager was sloppy and slightly unprofessional."
good,It was a good place to work. They don't have benefits. Sometimes didn't get paid on time we would get it the day after payday. Coworkers that have a higher position can be rude and disrespectful.
good,Its an active workplace. Management isn't always the best. But its not a horrible job. The scheduling is always unpredictable and is sometimes changed daily.
good,"It was my very first job and although i love everyone i have came to meet i did not really think the higher management and offices really took the time to get to know their employees running the stores and what it really took to make sure sales , freight and the store it self was handled and ran properly. "
good,"Minimum wages, never full-time so company doesn't have to legally provide benefits, minimum raises, minimal advancement, easy work, some managers are good, I resigned after a year because of mine. Side job, not livable."
good,"A good place to work if you are high-energy and self-motivated to solve problems. Not many of the employees were highly motivated, so being a team-leader was difficult but rewarding when the team came together."
good,"Good place to work if you have no family obligation. Typical day at work for the manager is 12 to 18 hours depending on location. Culture is rough. You must be able to work physically hard every day. Manager is involved in every aspect of all daily operations including hand offloading trucks, merchandising and operations."
good,As soon as you clock in they will put you any where when unloading a truck. They want you to do at least 32 cases an hour but as your doing that off the two uboats u have on the floor they bring more out. It's difficult working an area and you set it like it's suppose to but then they will put a new person over there without proper training now your getting blamed for being behind because you had to organize your isle. The customers are the best part of the job and helping them find what items they need.
good,I believe dollar tree is a great place to work especially is if its your first job.Dollar tree has good schedules to work as well as very flexible..
good,A typical day at Dollar Tree is when your the only one cashier there and you get know help. That dollar all about money and not about the people that work for them. Management is know big help. the co workers are ok but some are very lazy. The hardest part of the job is having know help.
good,this job is awesome and their willing to be as flexible as you are i really appreciate their employment. i have nothing else to say about it other than they pay minimum wage and the manager position pays 11.00
good,"Days were usually slow to start, but would pick up after a few hours. We would normally start with our opening routines and move on to stocking. Generally we would get at least ten boats of boxes out to the floor and stocked, sometimes more or less depending on how many people we had on hand and how busy the day got. If we became busy, one or more stockers would have to backup cashier. Most days it was one cashier, one assistant manager, and one to two stockers on the floor at a given time. Any messes made from stocking would be cleaned up before moving onto the next isle or task. For morning and mid shift this is how it normally went, closing was a little different. weekdays had two closers and weekends had three. The closing manager and the cashier were in charge of cleaning and front facing isles, recovery. If there was a third person on hand they would assist the cashier in recovery. The cashier would have the front half of the store and the manager would have the back half plus vacuuming."
good,Worked as a cashier and became assistant manager - did inventory and cashiering and stocking shelves - also did bank deposits and also counting at the end of the night to make sure all  registers were on point as well as the safe money and bank deposits -
good,i dont want to be nasty here as that is not the kind of person i am but i will say this was not an enjoyable job to work at. Although my stock manager was great it seemed as though the company cared more about there pockets then there employees. The pay was bad with no benefits. They always had a lack of hours or had so many employees that they did not have the hours to match the employee volume. All and all this is more of a job to get you by until you can find something better.
good,"This was an ok place to work. Everyday was different some days was busy others was not. Management was okay, had quite a few different co workers some would stay others found better job oppertunities."
good,"It was really my first job so everything was ok I learned a lot of things. I learned to unload trucks, stock did inventory, and cash handling talking with costumers"
good,"I worked the night shift, so i would come in and immediately be put on a register. The dollar tree here in palm coast is extremely busy and fast paced. After the first two and a half hours I would get a ten minute break then work on the register for another two hours. Before I left I would stock the coolers and take out the trash from all of the registers. Wipe down the counters, sweep and or vaccuum. Then close down my register and leave."
good,"They expect one person to do the work of many people. They expect you to cashier as well as do other things far away from the register. It doesn't make any sense. Usually I'd stay by the register because it's usually busy. Then I'd get yelled at because I've only gotten so much done. I think that helping out the customers right away is more important than getting other things done. Dollar Tree managers put freight and stocking first, customers last. When I worked there, I'd do my best and all I'd hear about is what I DIDN'T get done or things I did wrong. I felt like nothing I ever did was good enough or done quickly enough.They don't give raises, just ten cent raises a year."
good,"fast pace job. I found that I did prefer stock to being a cashier but either job was good. My assistant manager was giving me tons of hours. My store manager decided pretty quick that he didn't like me and after a while tried to freeze me out. Our personalities maybe clashed, and he counted every small imperfection against me. Didn't get along with the two younger male coworkers. Other than that everybody seemed nice."
good,"Dollar Tree was a great job but had a lot of working to do far as management, security and pay. The pay was not enough to support myself and the thing I need and wanted. I had a lot of bills to pay in which included me to work a second job. I would not recommend nobody to work here at this company."
good,The hrs are too few. Schedule often changes without notice. Too much merchandise comes into store and not enough people to put out. No help from upper mgmt. In store.
good,the lack of hours is and the mangers never let you work in peace their always taking you away from one task to  another task.
good,"The job is fairly easy. I just wish it paid more and held managers more accountable. Also, you rarely get off time and there are rarely any hours to give to employees."
good,Lots of hours and poor salary. Culture needs serious overhaul. Massive supply chain issues. Not a great place to work. lots of turnover.
good,needs new management. workers need to be on the same page. needs train employees better .needs to keep stock room more organized.
good,"I would work for this company again, it wasn't the company it was the management teams that would get advanced and get big heads and think that family life had no matter at all, but their own.  I was actually told by my DM that my sons last Christmas concert for elementary was not important and that the store was more important then even my ailing mother who has now passed and the reason I left this company after 10 years of loyal service!!!"
good,"Like all places you work there are ups and downs, being an assistant manager you would think you would at least be making $9 an hour with all of the responsibilities and hours you have to work, right? I only made $8.90 and hour after my second raise as part of the management team. The Management team is set up as a group of people who are capable of running the store, the highest up is the Store Manager; they're the ones who have all final say of that specific store, it is said its ""their store"". Then there are 3 assistant managers, one being a full time assistant and the other two part timers.  The full time manager was said to have more duties and responsibilities than the part time assistants however at this particular store the full time manager was lacking in that department, so us part time assistants had to pick up a lot of their slack. The only problem with this is that when the store is fully stocked and looking nice the sales go up, and when the sales go up the store manager and full time assistant receive monthly bonuses. And being that the part time assistants did more work than the full time assistant we didn't see that being fair. But, I did learn a lot of good management skills and I enjoyed interacting with customers and being able to do busy work and work on things in my own way."
good,"a very slow company with a high turnover rate that did not allow for consistent training, and or work ethics, management team not on the same page or even the same book"
good,The team was full of nice people. A basic cash register working job but it was still fun interacting with customers. The corporate aspect was too strong on the amount of rules and how harsh the rules were.
good,"from fraght to cashiering an added cleaning that comes with most jobs making sure the shaves are stocked ,clean , an presentable an ready to greet the first customer who walks thrue the door with a wide smile on my face you got to know what people want an where they can find it . I learned that with this compony you have to ready for anything to a mad customer to 100ct bloons for a party for a customer who didn't prearrange . the co-workers very got to be open minded, the management is set in there ways but other wise is workable."
good,I learned that I am a people person. I found that being polite and gave the customers the respect they deserve made my day much better.
good,I enjoyed working at The Dollar Tree until the managers started hiring people with no cash handling skills or customer service skills. They do not offer benefits. It is almost impossible to advance to management.
good,"The company itself often forgets that the employees have outside lives and expect them to focus solely on the company. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with while there. The company could get better with offering benefits and pay.They cut most employees hours down so they would need a second job, causing more stress than the employees really need."
good,very cheaps products at great value. I really enjoyed helping the customers save money. I also shopped there and asaved me money as well. I just wish more hours were provided.
good,"Loved the extra hours and flexible schedule, pay was just to little for the amount of work that was done. Wanted to feel appreciated in  everyway just have to have the right team to succeed and make it healthy."
good,"I wasn't  there long, but it wasn't too bad.  I liked the hours I worked.  I would've like to stay there longer, but the job wasn't for me."
good,"Dollar tree was a great place for me to work as one of my first jobs. But as I got older and had more responsibilities, it was just not enough to support myself. I worked long days and almost everyday and only got paid minimum wage, There was no advancement opportunities and no benefits. My coworkers were great and it was a fun place to work."
good,"i loved working there.. i love dealing with people. i stocked shelves.ran the register.,,."
good,"Responsible for vehicle ordering of 300 plus company fleet vehicles. Reporting fuel sold,  and maintained reports for the vehicles in service  and out of service reporting of each vehicle as well as confidential and sensitive documents.  Delivered excellent communication and customer service to the field fleet drivers while promptly answering incoming calls and providing assistance to the drivers.  Assisted with vehicle insurance renewals and registration renewals in different states."
good,"This place is okay to work in. Customer service is good, although lines can be long at the cash register"
good,I like the manager I am working with but was promised movement with the company and this did not happen and my position was cut from FT to PT which caused me to loose my healthcare benefits and bonus
good,I noticed that the people that worked for the company received the majority of the hours on schedule. There was not any hours given to the new seasonal workers that had been hired on full time.
good,"some days go by quick and others drag on "
good,Not bad at first but the longer you stay the worse you are treated. No chance for advancement.
good,The hours weren't enough the job is a good start for someone who is just starting the work force.
good,Assistant managers duties involve more stocking of merchandise than management. Very little guidance and support.  Company does not look out for employees. No feedback or reviews by supervision or upper management unless negative feedback is warranted. One of the hardest parts of the job is complete unreasonable amount of tasks in time frame allotted. HR support horrible at best.
good,"You must put new freight out, pay attention to everything around you and be a proficient multi-tasker"
good,good company to work for. not a lot of hours and you can not get more than part time. Wages do not go up too fast. nowhere to advance to.
good,"Part time, okay."
good,i had trouble from start dm put mi in one of the busiest stores with little pay changed my evaluation date 3 times so i never got any back pay had to have surgery dm moved me to gresham because he wanted to get rid of another asst loved gresham but mgr started having health problems changed employees dissatisfied tried to help but couldnt
good,"Being able to help everyone who needs the help. The hardest part was being able to stand though wasn't a full time job, just a seasonal one. I enjoyed myself."
good,Interacting with various cultures made the job exciting. There was never a dull day!
good,"I had to deal with management who didn't know how to run the store, who took credit for everything good and passed the blame for anything bad. Co-workers who would listen and follow instructions and others who would undermine it. I would be called almost on a daily basis to help other mangers with problems because of how close I lived to the store. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the upper management. The most enjoyable part of the was dealing with the customers, moving freight, and working with co workers who took there job seriously."
good,was not real happy at this job but was reliable and did my work.
good,I could work at my own pace and work in almost any area I saw fit.  So I could use my own creativity and design skills throughtout the layout of the store and its merchandise.
good,I learned customer service skills and how to handle cash frequently.
good,"My job was very interesting and difficult."
good,"A typical day on the job involved organizing, refilling stock, helping customers, and communication with the other staff members.  While recovering the store, I learned that I would never leave another item out of its place, anywhere, ever again.  I now know how it feels to have to be that person, to pick it up.  The management needed work.  There were members of management that I do not believe should have had the title given.  I believe it might have went to their heads.  As they were lazy, and when in charge, and did little to nothing, even when the store was very busy.  The co workers in general were wonderful.  Very small group of 11.  I was impressed at the fact that everyone got along. It was nice to be somewhere, that no one was putting others in awkward positions, by speaking rude about another person who was not present. There wasn't really a part of the job that was difficult. It was pretty straight forward.  The part of the job I enjoyed the most was being around people, and also the staff.  They are good people"
good,"Busy and very enjoyable very nice coworkers and customers    "
good,"great place for a tight budget, all tour home necessities, they even have food for a buck"
good,"Dollar Tree is an awesome company. Unbelieve items for the price, however management at the store I worked for was difficult and bias. turn overs we'r high and still are because of that. "
good,"stocking"
good,This job was fast pasted on holidays but a typical store on regular ones
good,"This job was fun, and I enjoyed my co-workers. Each day was different. I learned alot of customer service. And how to deal with ""the Public"". The management could be a little aloof at times. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with managers, or co-workers that were condescending or rude at any given time. The most enjoyable part of this job was my customers, A happy customer is a Loyal customer!"
good,"This job was not bad. You would work from 4Pm-2Am five times out of the week unless you were on mandatory overtime. You had a headset that you listened to while operating an electric pallet jack. You had to pick 150 boxes per hour and built pallets of boxes, then saran wrapped it, and dropped the pallet off at the loading docks. It was too much walking for me and i was always tired. It messed up my sleeping schedual"
good,"When hired, it was nice, everyone was friendly and helpful but after the store manger left things got stressful and unbearable. I was able to gain great experience and learning new skills. Some of the co-workers were great and easy to work with but others were not so easy to work with or friendly. Management was unethical and caused me to leave. The toughest part of the job was having to deal with unethical practices and not enough employees at times as well as some very rude customers. The best part of the job was gaining experience but I would never work for this company again nor work in that part of town again."
good,Dollar Tree Stores was definitely a company where you have to make the most of the company.
good,Fast/Slow paced depending on day or seasons.
good,I can't say that this Dollar Tree was a pleasant one to work at. What is expected of an employee should be explained very well. There should be better managers who actually care about their employees. Some of the co-workers are great to work with while others are lazy. The hardest part of the job is working with the managers. It's always busy!! That's a plus!!! I learned not to take everything so personal!!!
good,"at this work place i learned many things, one important thing i learned was to always put newer food products at the back of the older ones."
good,"A typical day at work includes, clocking in and just ""finding"" something to do until my manager calls me to her office after 30 mins. I have not learned much except for how to do inventory."
good,love interacting and helping customers.. very nice atompshere
good,some managers are better than others - work was usually just wanting to get through it so we wouldn't have to put up with the managements pressuring from them being pressured by district management...
good,"When working day shift I would go to the office and set up the computer and turn the registers on. Then I would count the safe, and set up the register tills. I’d make corrections to the employee time clock on the computer. Go over the previous day’s notes and any emailed information in order to assign employee tasks for the day. When the store opens and the cashier is working the register throughout the day it would be my job to get them change and do management required adjustments to the sales that required them. Such as returns, voids and picking up excess money from the registers. At the cashiers shift change I would be responsible for counting out each drawer and going over the shift with the departing cashier. Throughout the day I would keep busy stocking shelves or setting up new displays."
good,"Sign in, count my drawer, get my daily job duties list and start in on them until we open, then cashier and finish duties in between customers. I stock, do resets per asr or schematics. I love all my regular customers and they miss me when im not there."
good,"I worked for Dollartree for 6 years.Loved my store,made and exceeded sales,cotroled shrink.Did.District managers are idiots.Its there word over yours.Every year they realigned..DM didnt like me and was known through out the district and out of district as well.HR was well aware of sittuation,Dm terminated me because she says I threw items away.I did not even do it. So yes they will be hearing from my Lawyers...My assistant even told her it wasn't me that it was her that accidentally threw them out.But she wanted me out and thats what they did......."
good,This job is the most basic job that would most prominantly used to get another job.
good,"Most days you are assigned to a certain position but during the course of the day you will be moved around often without notice, you will be told to re do a lot of things by different manager's throughout the day. Most days you will go with out any breaks or at least just one ten minute break only."
good,the work environment at the location i worked at could be better i felt that the training was not good and that they need to train people better and give them some help it is not possible to work like that and you are the only cashier that is why i no longer work here
good,"The job is not bad, but the other employees are not quite up to par. The company does not allow the stores the proper number of hours to operate. Leaving the cashiers with approximately 10-13 hrs per week."
good,"I worked there for almost a year. I did everything from stocking to cashier and truck. If someone got fired, quit, or was sick I was their go to person. We later was under new management and I was later fired for being sick even though I gave them the heads up. The store looks worse than ever and with this management I'm sure the store will be shut down"
good,The mangement is bad.if you are not in their curlce then.thwn sooner or later you will be gone.i had gotten my nose done and for 3 weeks nithi g was saif to me.until the real manger came back from leave tgey acted lile the told me
good,It’s a dollar store and about what you would expect. It was easy to work there and very simple work. No discounts or benefits to speak of though and that’s troubling and the pay could be better.
good,The job is easy it's just repetition. Management is okay. Everybody gets along with one another makes the job easier. The pay isn't good that's the only problem.
good,as being an employe at dollar tree i have very friendly customers i try to be fast pace because the dollar tree i was going to is very busy what i have learned at dollar tree is take your time make sure you take the time to do your job because then it comes out very nice then i make sure cashiers are doing there dutys to have the store always looking nice the hardest part about my job is just making sure vendors are coming on time making sure your employes are clocked in right making sure there till is at a certain amount making sure the office was originized making sure the safe is correct every single day the most enjoyable are my customers and my employes very time i did have a difficult time they were there to support me in my work and that is what is important is working as a team
good,I loved the job but they do no training on fake bills or what to do if u get bigger bills than a $20.00.i loved all my coworkers / managers i really miss the job
good,"Very fast paced job with clear deadlines, customer service expected at all times. This company gives the very minimum amount of payroll for small stores and provides no security for employees. Salary assigned to store managers and a big welcome to work for more than 10 hours per day. Good opportunities to earn bonuses through sales goals. The most enjoyable part of this position is training and promoting emerging leaders. Dollar Tree is very well known for opening new stores and giving employees the opportunity to grow within the company."
good,Don't stay at this company too long unless you plan on moving up the corporate ladder. You'll be overworked and underpaid. You'll barely get any hours to work. You won't feel appreciated. It's a good job for someone going to school who needs a part-time job cashiering.
good,"I am a cashier at Dollar Tree. It's a pretty easy job. It can be frustrating sometimes, but it's retail so it's to be expected. I have a good work/life balance. The store manager is really good about working with my scheduling needs. It's a good place to work of you only need part time work or a second job. It's not something you go into expecting to make a living. My biggest problem with Dollar Tree is their policies. Corporate has zero trust in it's employees and some of their policies should be changed. I understand that there has been a problems with counterfeit bills, but it isn't practical to call for management for a bill check when there are long lines of customers. Also, starting the tils at $75 isn't adequate. We often get $20's right off the bat and run out of change quickly. Having to zip-tie lockers is ridiculous as well. The policy about voids is a terrible one. People mess up, and customers change their mind all the time. I had a customer who didn't have enough money for all if their items and I had to do 4 voids on one transaction. I got written up for having too many voids, even though my register was right on. I had other people in line, and it was faster to void the items than to cash out for a post void and re-ring the other items. If anything, post voids should be considered for suspicious because management could be dishonest and post void a real transaction and pocket the money. A line void is simply taking the item out without getting money for it. One more thing, there should be a cashier that is allowed to make change and do other small things in case"
good,That's the inlr real problem I have with Dollar Tree is the fact that I've been employed for almost a year and still haven't had a raise. And you think I should of had 2 raises by now.
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work for people just starting work. They do give you good working hours and a good environment of people. Overall it was a great learning experience and really taught me a lot about responsibilities and wanting more for myself.
good,The job is ok I like the work i love to work n e ways I like the hours because I like the morning shift but I will work whenever I can the pay isn't good at all for the stuff that I have to do one manager is good but the other two suck but I still get along with them and I like to try to keep the work place happy she everybiby smiling.
good,"Very busy, sometimes a little crazy, depends on what day or month it is, I have learned that the customer is always right, regardless, very poor management, very mean, lazy, don't like to help get the lines down, one of the managers is the best, always no matter what shift she comes in, I like the environment because I am a very pleasant person to be around and interact with, the hardest part of the job was, dealing with 2 of the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is waiting on the customers and making them happy."
good,I just like working hard so I can succeed in life anale sure is okso I hope it's a good feeling working at Dollar tree was good at 1st but me idk me it's hard
good,"Flexible hours, family friendly environment. Store remained stocked, fairly neat and clean. Can sometimes be unprofessional with employee behavior, but overall friendly."
good,Good place to work as long as u get a good manager.cause with out one your job is going to suck.and get real hard.some people r haters in this store....
good,"I was hired as a cashier yet was expected to do every type of work in the store. I had to stock, clean the aisles, pull each item and organize, get carts outside, file bags, fill pop machines plus be at the register when lines were very long. All for $7.25 an hour which is barely enough for groceries let alone paying bills. Way too many tasks expected for such horrible pay."
good,"Busy days made the work go by fast, but customers didn't like the lines. Usually understaffed and blamed for all the problems like lack of merchandise on the floor."
good,"The beginning of my employment at dollar tree was very good. However about no more than two weeks ago I was forced to call out of work and go on a two week roller coaster consisted of doctor's visits, x Ray's, 5 different medicines, an enema, and 2 trips to Shelby Hospital. I ended up coming back to work with a diagnosis of IBS and a bunch of doctors excuses however my manager put me on a 30 day probation for excessive absences. My manager since then has given me the minimum amount of hours and has been very rude and irritable towards me. I always go into work with an open mind and I hard working attitude, I strive to do good at every aspect of my job and feel my services at Dollar Tree are not only no longer needed, but no longer wanted."
good,"Low pay, management was ok.  All depends on location. I worked at 2 different one.  All store pretty much only have 1 cashier at a time tho. Cashier basically run the store"
good,"a day there, is counting money, making change, sales, unloading truck once a week and adding products to shelves and light cleaning. dealing with returns, and watching for theft. no full time there unless management. no holidays or sick pay."
good,When I first began I learned the register & how to properly treat customers. Now I am very knowledgeable when it comes to helping customers out and making sure the store meets certain sales.
good,The business was over staffed due to its new opening. Also needs more space for items to properly get placed on shelves. But overall its a great and warming place of work with amazing employees.
good,"As cashier it was nice at first few hours here and there to make money, but then you see how some employees get special privileges over others and when in need of employees, since they barely higher anyone your stuck at work forced to stay until someone else comes in or forced to stay until they feel the need of letting you leave your shift"
good,Its ok but I really can't live off dollar tree so it would be best for me to find something more suitable. So that I  can  live more comfortable so I want be there to long
good,"My work day as the Merchandise manager consisted of stocking the shelves taking in the inventory that came on the truck deliveries, conducting interviews when necessary, opening and closing the store. taking care of the deposits for the bank ect."
good,Dollar tree is a slow-paced faculty with almost little to no hours. Depending on the situation of the time being employers were able to work around you schedule and make flexible hours for everyone.
good,Management Sucks and next to nothing Hours.. they're just trying to save as much hours they can.... they want the work to be done in the shortest amount of time.. so they will gain while you lose
good,"worked to many hours had a stroke working there, came back and they worked me until I quit couldn't do the long hours they gave me because of the stroke I had"
good,"Corporate run, not genuinely looking out for employees. Everyone is dispensable!"
good,They are all right.  It is mainly stepping stone for better job opportunities.  Fun work environment.  They do not pay that much.  So it is kind of a learning opportunity.
good,"I like my job but I have alot of bills and am unable to pay them all because I'm not given enough hours with which to do so. "
good,"It's a thankless job with a manager who keeps going to other stores even though her own store needs her. Nothing is never god enough for her, not matter how hard you try."
good,The management is really hard to work for. Co workers amazing. Customers are amazing! Love doing stock. Love working with my co-workers. Enjoyed working there during Christmas time
good,Loved the customers and meet some great people working there but the store managers I had were lazy and didn’t care for the store are the employees and they over worked me for little pay I would not recommend been a manager there from personal experience
good,Dollar tree is an actually wonderful company to work for and you have the right proper manager and assistant manager who is helping you learn and to help you gain experience and to train you!
good,"I love working at the Dollartree but If you have problems, Managment just laughs It off and turns it all on them, talking about their problems.  The manager refuses to cover if you have to leave for any reason, and you can't get full time.  I would recommend   working there, however try to advance fast because than you can get the benefits."
good,"Clock in and sign into your register. Then as the customer walks to the register, check them out then proceed with great customer service. Stock shelves as needed."
good,"Work was easy, nothing hard.  Enjoyed most of the employees.  You only work 4-5 hrs a day unless your a managers buddy then you get more.  Cant stop people if you see them stealing.  There isnt any Lost Prevention.  Might as well hold the door open and hand them a bag.  To much backstabbing and racism from upper management. All the company cares about is money not employees"
good,we did a lot of extra work and managers would work off the clock just cause they are not allowed over time. the corporate is very skewed and we do much more then we should for the little we are paid.
good,Its a job for now..... not much opportunity for growth or advancement... the hours are low and the compensation it minimum wage... not enough really to support my self
good,"There are no benefits; it's a part-time work atmosphere and you're unlikely to get more than 12 hours a week if your store is fully staffed. My coworkers are excellent. My customers are excellent. My original manager was excellent - but the District Manager for the region I live in has either never been a part-time associate or hasn't been one in so long that she doesn't understand the amount of effort that it takes to get everything she wants done completed in the time period she wants it done for."
good,"A lot of the time I feel like they want us to out out too much freight the we get chewed out for not getting it done."
good,"Co workers were very nice, it’s definitely a job for a teen in the summer. The pay is ridiculous for someone to live off. And the higher managers than what I was didn’t give good hours if you were on they’re bad side."
good,"Overall good experience, Friendly/ helpful staff, Learned how to use a cash register, how to cater to customers, wide variety of responsibilities/ different tasks"
good,Poor management from a big city and treated customers the same. Rude to employees and the manager was selfish and only cared about how she looked. Stole from other stores and this store.  She is not good at teamwork and swears and smokes too much.
good,"As long as you enjoy working with the public and the multiple type of personalities you will encounter, then you are in the right spot. In addition, you will learn about store schematics and management."
good,"Stocking, cleaning, customers service. Helping the disabled, and sometimes even begin a listening ear. Begin able to deal with the ups and downs of sells is something you learn along the way."
good,"I had originally worked for family dollar and I loved it, but then when dollar tree and family dollar merged my store was changed to a Dollar Tree. My hours went from full time to part time with only 4 hour shifts, I wasn't allowed to stay longer unless someone called out, it literally sucked. It's only good if your a student or maybe even as a second job"
good,The job In Oklahoma city I work doing Christmas Holliday part time did not pay enough but OK job I Just want something part time like companion or sitter I am retired
good,The employees were wonderful to work with however the work itself was boring and almost felt meaningless due to the pay. The managers were alright but they seemed to want to compete with each other on everything. Only worth while thing was interacting with the customers.
good,"Too many chiefs not enough indians. "
good,great expectations with no support...pay doesn't compete with job requirements....district managers care more about numbers than employees....need to come up with a new system for truck days and allow managers more power to make the system work
good,"My specific manager was great, however the amount of work needed to do for the amount getting paid is totally not worth it. It's a great job for people looking for experience to start off as a cashier or stocker. However, would not recommend staying more than a year or two."
good,Dollar Tree is one of the worst customer service jobs I've ever experienced. Neither the District manager or store has a clear vision for store operations. They constantly cut hours and and overwork lower management. They allow the customers to repeatedly disrespect and threaten their employees without any regards to how that employee may feel because they allow those same customers to return and cause problems.
good,"Typical retailer, you work long hours, poor work life balance. Be wary of location a you will get zero support if you are in a location with high crime. Work at your own risk!!"
good,Assistant manager was great but the store manager has a attitude every day and is always smoking cigarettes in the back rather than working. My coworkers are great but store is poorly ran and there's always an issue with the schedule and truck days
good,"When some doesn’t have anything to say about a company, they should not be made/forced to Erie a review about that company. I loved being a cashier, but when I went into management, we’ll lets just say some people don’t play well with others, I can say my cashiers live there job!"
good,If your looking for a first time job then Dollar Tree is a great place to work. The register is easy to learn an you can learn it within minutes. Dollar Tree itself is a great place to work for starting out but make sure your familiar with management first before applying.
good,"No benefit's, and big turn around rate. If the employers were paid better, and felt like this job could advance into a career, this wouldn't happen!!!"
good,It's a job but it works u hard for minium wage no real break time managers are unreasonable with licks on the bathrooms just wasn't enough money for the headache
good,Dollar Tree is a nice place to shop at and get things for cheap then you would anywhere else. The customers are rude and not well mannered. Most of the managers are lazy and I'm often doing there work. They Barely give hours.there pay isn't. Very good
good,Fast pace work place I just didn’t like management . I find like that they are to slow for me it seems to me that they don’t know what they are doing. Are not fair with employees don’t even know how to treat there employees with a correct manner .
good,"working there was comfortable. The hours were not balance, the hours varied from week to week.  This location was very close to home. The management team were not very professional and very unorganized."
good,"The backup managers were cool, main manager was a real pain in the a**"
good,It was a fast work place . I learned stocking experience. This job helped me to not always react to certain situations helped me with more customer service experience.
good,"Liked working with my co-workers, enjoyed Learning how a store is born from start to finish and loved meeting people.  I have always been a people person."
good,You start out working 36 hours per week. Then overtime is needed. They take your days off for that. Unless you want to work a lot and not have  any time for your children and other loved ones this is not the place you want to work.
good,"the schedule is unorganized and the manager was not a benefit to the employees, If not management you only get 20 hours or less. closing shift is treated like maids having to clean up after the day shift taking their empty boxes and u boats of the floor while doing walk thru and go back baskets and cashiering."
good,"Help Store Promote Mothers Day And Memorial Day, Known as Holiday Sales. Customers Leaves The Extra Cost In The Drawers. Seeing The Same Customers Come In Everyday."
good,"Overall I loved dollar tree..easy fast paced...great customers,managment so so...but stayed busy which made time go by...loved stocking had fun!  I do suggest working there..."
good,"Great job to have as a 2nd PT job for extra money in your pocket each month. There are "
good,"My workplace at dollar tree was not well managed at a store or corporate level. this may be different at different stores, but this was a particularly difficult place to work at."
good,Fun to work if it was going  to be a first  job or a hobby to get extra  money.  But to care for your  family  and pay Bill's forget it. Most every one was nice tell they retired  most of the manager s and a new guy came. I did like it but  not worth the pay.
good,It was a fast pace environment.Sometime it was hard to deal with angry customers. it was very stressful when my employers didn't show up for work. I got along with all my workers.
good,"The people were great, just didn't compensate well. Overall its good to have for a part time. Everyone was nice and you feel welcomed. Good for young adults."
good,"Overall it was laid back with some hectic moments but only during holidays, and sometimes weekends, although the hours have been pretty bad and I haven’t been called in in almost a month."
good,the company has no personal connection with the employees. everyone is replaceable. They are not compensating for work injuries either i had to take them to court to make them pay my medical bills for an injury that was on film and had an incident report filed.
good,Will not hire under 18 but they will not allow adults to work enough to live. Might as well be a high school job. I love the people I work with and my customers but I can not live on the amount I bring home.
good,The store is only been open for a few months it's very on organize shelves are empty. They don't give hours to the people that want to work they just hire more people
good,"a typical day at work for me would mean 1 cashier and 1 manager on shift. The cashier is responsible for handling most customers that come in. As well as stocking in between customers,recovering the store,emptying trash bins,and cleaning restrooms."
good,Typical day at work is your constantly moving. Management is pretty good. The hardest part would be the trucks you have to unload but don’t have room for.
good,"Salaried store Manager, only salaried position in the store."
good,I learned how to use the cash register and how to stock shelves and work in a fast paced environment. The work environment was very friendly and i got to learn how to communicate with customers.
good,The store was poorly managed and lack of employees. The store was unsanitary.  Lack of enough cashiers. The store was not properly stocked as needed. The manager was very loud at times and not friendly.
good,"they hired people they knew was on drugs , it was messy had boxes everywhere customers would complain . The manager now ( ms.C ) she will NOT help you once she goes on break even if the customers complain and the line is in the back of the store . she would have you doing her job when other things needed to be done ."
good,it was a decent place to work nothing too great about it. but short break period. no basic benefits. hardly anywhere to sit . really long lines sometimes
good,"It was easy to work at dollar tree. Your job is well explained, and your responsibilities rarely change. Customers almost never complain, because everything's only a dollar. It was a little boring to work here."
good,"not good if your starting a family life"
good,"store is very busy, you can only work part time there.. the only full time position is management, the pay is minimum wage, your hours fluctuate from day to week. "
good,If you have any expectations of a balanced life you can forget it. As a store manager your life is tied to the building. If you need to get things done you have to pick up everyone’s slack. You work minimum 60 hrs a week on average. More during the holidays. You’re support depends on your district manager. My first district manager was supportive and understood the nuances of the job and would get help when possible. But most stores are in the same boat because they company doesn’t like to lend people to a problem they expect you to give your time. When they retired the new person was the total opposite the get it done or else mentality . It’s a decent job if you enjoy living your job. But it’s not a job for someone with a family and isn’t a very hands on a driven person. The pay is a little below average but decent.  It’s hard to explain your volume to the rest of the industry because everything is a dollar. It’s a company where it’s easy to move up at store level because of high turnover so you can get that experience to use for a resume
good,I worked here as a teenager. It was a good job to start off with but I wanted something better for myself. The staff was great and I got some work experience.
good,Dollar Tree offers no benefit package to employees that are part time. Full time positions are very few and difficult to get hours to work. Manager was nice.
good,"You can definitely advance quickly to management. Cashier pay is minimum wage and mangers get paid pretty good. If your managment you will work like a dog especially since there's never any payroll which is why there's always long lines and cluttered stores! Benefits were nonexistent and I personally didn't get my maternity leave. They tax everything even your bonus IF you get one because that's a promise they dangle in front of you always and it rarely comes through. Stores are hot as heck in the summer and freezing during the winter. No break rooms just a tiny corner with a table, a chair , and a microwave in the back of the overstocked back room."
good,A typical day would be coming in logging on your register and going from there. Whenever you don't have customers you go around the store and clean up. i didn't learn to much there. management was alright. no hard parts of the job or enjoyable parts.
good,"I had absolutely NO time for my personal life working at Dollar Tree.  When I went to my DM with issues, he never truly addressed him.  There were major issues in the store and nothing was done about it.  The camera system was down the entire time I worked there. The hourly employees are severely underpaid for the job duties performed.  The environment was toxic.  The company didn’t do repairs in a timely manner."
good,"For the first 15 years of employment there, it was a very good environment with a family oriented company. I learned a lot about Accounting jobs and Banking jobs which is useful and a good experience. The last one and half years of working there was tough due to the management issue."
good,"A typical day at work would be "
good,"they don't really value their employees. They can treat you anyway they want because there are plenty of people who need jobs, and are willing to put up with the shift cancellations"
good,A typical day at work is being happy to help a customer with what they are needing. I learned how to register and stock at dollar tree so I would give a thumbs up on their training. Management was ok or fair as far as keeping a civilized place of business. Dollar Tree's workplace culture was ok in my opinion but they could also pay more. There was no real hard part about working at dollar tree but I needed more hours and more pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the customers enjoy and appreciate the way that I did my job.
good,"This place was nasty and the most unorganized company that I have ever worked for. They have no respect for you what so ever and the managers are rude. You ask for more hours and they don't want to give them to you unless they want to travel. Then they call you in even if your out of town they demand you to get back or your fired. The district manager comes in looking for unnecessary things and demands a lot out of you especially as a cashier. They expect you to process all sales transactions, stock shelves, clean the bathroom, vaccuum, count down your drawers, blow up balloons etc. all for minimum wage and under 20 hours a week. NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK!"
good,Good place to work if you have a good management team and they train you the correct way. The job can ne very stressful if in management. But if you just want to stock or cashier the job is perfect
good,"Great manager, great people , company doesnt care about its employees though, screws you for your raise and your holiday pay. Would recommend to work there unless you in a management position"
good,"manager was all was late, schedules never did until the day before, you would have to call sometimes the next morning to find out of your work or not, sometimes you show up to work an they have to many people schedule they would send you home, if the truck for shipment wasn't there you would have to go back home and come back around 1 pm and stay until 5 pm which was a problem because I have to be to my first job at 4 pm."
good,"Slow paced,  no chance for advancement.  Very low pay.  Inconsistent management.  No flexibility at all.  I would not recommend this job to anyone.  Not a good workplace."
good,a typical day was filled with the usual tasks of attending to the store and seeing to the customer's needs. Management was fine most of the time. The people i worked with were by far the best part of the job and the hardest part  was keeping up with store maintenance.
good,"customers were generally nice, easy-going atmosphere. managers were nice and very flexible to employeee concerns. some weekend shifts were hectic at times (particulalry saturdays) but overall a nice experiennce during my time there"
good,As the operations assistant manager my typical day consisted of making sure I had employees there on time the freezers were well stocked management sometimes wanted to do things her way as well as the employees there the hardest part was trying to get people to follow procedures
good,I did enjoy working there at first. And the customers are great. However only one of the managers really was respectful and nice. The others spend most of the time talking about other staff and personal matters. They mix home with work way to much. Not enough recognition when employers work above and beyond. They expect you to do things far above the pay grade. The salary is the cheapest in the town. Just to much drama and no consistency.
good,I like the manager  but other assistance manager weren't  that great. The knowledge  I  bought was able to use. Most of the time though i was put on register.
good,"I enjoyed working there but had major issues with management. The specific store I was employed at, they were very unprofessional. There was no structure or consistency with any members of management. Felt like I had to be fake to make it."
good,it was ok don't like ow they did me.. just cuz I was black and they was mex made me feel out of place.. but I love te comust I like help I would go back
good,"Its an OK place to work, but they definitely don't give enough hrs, unless u are a manager, I was working there for 2yrs & didn't once see a decent check, my highest check was about 297.00 dollars.... No one could possibly make a living off that"
good,I learned how to stock and be a good cashier. Too many days it’s only me working the cash register while the managers don’t do no work. Non-production only 2 or 3 works none of the managers.
good,"A typical day at work consists of working different job positions depending on the day. A working shift also consists of short working hours, however the hours and shifts are flexible."
good,"The management allowed boxes to often be in the aisles because a lack of good management allowed the back room to become too full and too messy for them to go there. On top of the hours were sometimes 1 shift a week, sometimes 6, very inconsistent regardless of talking to management about it"
good,"Dollar Tree is fairly not a good job, it’s not a good job for someone who is 18 or older because the pay is horrible. I think you should be making around 9.00$ to be able to call yourself a good job."
good,"some people who work really hard don't get treated fair"
good,The company is a busy company always trying to provide customers with the best customer service and low cost items for the customers with fast service.
good,Dollar Tree had a good manager. There is no structure hours vary every week. I love the customer's. Did not get raise in the year I've been there. No paid time off for vocations or sick time.
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to start and get the experienced. You will be well balance when you left there, its an experience and you meet all different of customers."
good,"One of the best jobs I possibly could of had, its just the pay is horrible I would go back to the job if I could.You could advance good in the job if you would like like for example if I wanted to be a assistant manager and I’ve only been there for two months or three months if the position is open and out you know M available to take the position then they will allow me and promote me to assistant manager"
good,"Dollar Tree is a good place to get promoted fast, but the wage raise when promoted isn't very good. Not enough hours and never get a raise as a sales associate even those that have been within the company for years."
good,"The company was understaffed, so many of the associates had to work double shifts. The pay was not worth how many people would look down on the cashiers. The workplace was stressful and the break-room was small. A typical day consisted of standing for at least 5 hours with customers always in a rush."
good,"My hours and days would be changed without notice so I would miss some shifts,and the pay is low. You get 1 ten minute break,  management is not on the same page."
good,Very great work place only thing is that they don’t pay well but it would b perfect for a teen first job. Can go up and get raise but it takes times. But friendly easy job.
good,"Started out as great job with room for advancement. every coupe of years, areas changed along with supervisors, making it difficult to have consistency in expectations."
good,Great job experience. Schedules a lil off and rocky but other than that easy cool job. Takes a lot of people skills & you have to be ready for anything
good,Its a perfect job if you need something part time. Nothing to hard but do need to be able to lift at least 50lb and you are on your feet the whole time you are at work.
good,"I loved Dollar Tree when I first started working back at home but when I came to this Dollar Tree it wasn’t the same. We had people quiting or not showing up for shifts all the time. When we got a new GM I almost wasn’t allowed to go back home for break, mind you I’m a college student living in a dorm and we had to pay to stay in the dorms over breaks. And that’s EXPENSIVE. When I changed my major to art my classes got longer so my schedule conflicted with my work schedule/they didn’t look at my availability right and then out of nowhere they stopped putting me on the schedule without telling me."
good,"I was overworked, under paid, and not heard. They did not listen to or pay attention to the managers they are over working all of the managers! I was enjoying my job very much until they would not let me have my very much deserved pto."
good,"Entry Level Job with flexible hours. Great for students wanting part time employment for a little extra money. Stock shelves, Clean isles, and run cash register"
good,They don't pay you enough for the amount of work they think you should do within a certain time frame. They also don't offer full time. The company doesn't offer vision and dental to part time employess.
good,"Lots of retail and customer service don't get paid enough per hour for management, working for the dollar tree has been an experience working with people and merchandise"
good,When getting to work there was cashiering to be done first then answer customers questions. There was always stocking to do. The shelves had to remain full for the customers.
good,"Working at dollar tree was good in the beginning but as time went on we kept losing store managers, were understaffed & the store was always dirty. Dollar tree needs better ways to improve"
good,"If you just need a job. this is the place for you. Not great pay, no real chance for advancement, Extremely fast paced and stressful, with very few rewards"
good,"It was difficult to work on that place, but by the time you get use to it. Very low hours a week. Sometimes the clients are very rude, but you just can’t let it get to you."
good,"Dollar Tree is not a difficult place to work. Anyone with a little common sense and some register experience can do well there. Unfortunately the compensation is not ideal. they pay you just a little above minimum wage to do work that you should be paid at least 10.00 an hour to do. "
good,"As a cashier at Dollar Tree you must learn how to multitask, and fast. You are encouraged to make rounds throughout the store making sure everything is where it should be whenever you have downtime at your register. You must also be very efficient on the register due to there usually only one register open at a time to prevent massive lines"
good,"While the pay is not the greatest the items there is only a dollar so it make up for it, but everything else is up to the individual who works at dollar tree."
good,It was an ok starter job and really wasn't that bad. For the most part. But it became a bit too much of headache and I couldn't really deal with it anymore.
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to work for a young college student or someone still in high school. If you have a child or chilren, then it is going to be really hard to make ends meet with the pay."
good,Standing at a register the whole day with no break from lack of many hours. Management was kind of all over the place. The hardest part was just getting enough hours to make ends meet.
good,"I really liked the management at the store, corporate people were super picky and kept changing things making things more stressful and didn't want to pay the associates what they were worth."
good,"It's an okay place to work,  corporate doesn't care about is employees or about theft. People come in all day and fill up their bags and walk out like it's a normal thing to do. We are not aloud to say anything or do anything about it. Corporate just says to not do anything."
good,If you are looking to support your family of five and want extra money for your clothes this job alone will never come close to doing that for you.  Pay rate for cashiers is a big $7.25.  All employees except management receive a whopping 12 to 30 hour weekly schedule yearly.  This is a great job if you have another job.  You can easily use this job as an additional source of income but never can this job alone support ANY human being.  The assistant managers are paid very low for all that they do and they do A LOT.  Do not bother applying if you think you are going to start out as a manager at a whopping $18 a hour.  Not going to happen!
good,"There is good and bad here, but overall not the worst for sure. Due to the recent merger there is a lot of shaky ground to get everything to flow- right now it is more like driving down the interstate hitting potholes every mile vs slight bumps now and again like other places I have worked for have. Management does not seem to have or give clear direction on many things. Corporate is centrally located in Chesapeake and the new building is almost complete.  I would like to see their software become as state-of-the-art as this building looks...1990 called! Guess what they don't want back!"
good,Good work experience. The management was really nice. My coworkers were helpful and polite and made the work environment enjoyable to be in. The customers polite as well.
good,Glad I’m working and have an income!! The Dollar tree I work at is a wonderful place to work. I’m looking for more hours so I can support my family...
good,"worked at Dollar Tree full-time"
good,Could not get stock put away because I had to cashier also I could not get enough hours to help me with technical college. They would not give hours to all of their employees and the store manager would work from open to close every day.
good,My manager was just really childish and disrespectful to our guess and employees. But working was good in certain ways it ws manageable and also easy to do.
good,"A Typical day at work could consist of providing great customer service and to motivate the associates and this includes the Store Manager as well, provide product, increase sales for the customers."
good,My time hete helped prepare me for my current position. The position required spending a lot of time at the store. System of promtion was scattered in its approach.
good,its a great place to work only if your looking for 10 or 15 hours a week but they require to much out of the cashier while only making 7.25 an hour with no paid vacations
good,when I started working there it was okay but after they saw that do a good job the other co-workers stop trying to do their job and I had to pick up their slack.
good,"The job can be fun but also stressful to family life and personal time off is not always as promised.  "
good,- Good Company to work for.
good,They want to work like you are for people bill in one person they never give you credit for the work you've done they only listen to the store manager they don't take anybody else's opinion and value no matter what the individual has done for the company or for the store that they work for
good,"cashier mostly i learned alot and how to deal with customers, they dont give out many shifts so the salary and pay day is very low looking for a new job"
good,"Typical day consists of cashing, helping customers to fullest of your ability, loading and unloading of freight trucks, cleaning stations to make sure no traffic is caused or accidents."
good,"I love my job, its just people expect for people to do to much for the pay...But my customers are great they always make my day. If they would pay more money it wouldn't be so bad.."
good,"Typical day at work is coming in counting the unds running to the storage room and stocking for an hour or so if uninterrupted.Then you take a buggy and walk around the store for like another hour picking up stuff that doesn't belong and placing it in the front area of the store in categorized bins and having a cashier work on putting it all back when it isn't busy. Then for the rest of the night you pretty much go down each aisle and make it look full and neat. By closing time you sweep the floor and break tills down and count them. Then finish things you haven't finished because there is always something that needs to get done. Then you close up the store when its time to clock out. Sometimes taking a deposit to the bank with you on your way out. Management is okay but they are always taking any day they want off. and also never close the store. They leave it to the same manager every night to close up. Except on his day off. Hardest part of the job is probably trying to get absolutely everything they want done in one night, because it is actually impossible. The most enjoyable part is when there isn't anything that goes wrong and you can get as much work done as you can without any interruptions."
good,As soon as the doors open customers are pouring in. They take their shopping cart and fill it to the max. You will meet a lot of people working at dollar tree. Its an experience.
good,A typically day of work is filled with cleaning the store and helping customers. Generally I have learned how to work as a team with other employees. Management is easy-going and willing to help when you need it. The hardest part of this job is managing productivity between cleaning the store and trying to maintain the lines of customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is making customers happy.
good,It's a Dollar store! Get people in and get them out as fast as you can! That's their main thing follow your breaks! Count the cash proper like and just go with the flow!
good,A typical  day in the life of a cashier and stock-person is to come in greet customers.  Daily activities could include ringing up customers and standing in one position for extended periods of time.  Job is exhausting and repetitive.
good,"Nice Managers, not many hours, low-pay.  It has mostly nice customers. Great summer job, but not for the long run, gets boring after one month. Its ok"
good,The Dollar Tree in Uhrichsville is an alright place to work. The cons of the place are the managers do pick favorites which is very unfair to the other employees. Their favorites usually get the most hours here.
good,"Great experience. Horrible turn over rate. Fast pace. Great part time job, or second job. Great workout. Definitely will keep you moving and on your feet."
good,"I was never properly let go. corporate never got back to me and when i did call i just got attitude, so i stopped trying and found a new job. the store needs to invest in cameras and find new management."
good,Other employees were great to work with. Management didn’t have a clue as to what they were doing. They say they promote from with in first but that’s not true
good,not really a place to make a career out of unless you're looking for a management position. Its a good place for a first job as you'll learn the ropes and get a general idea of how retail works but for more experienced looking for something more look elsewhere.
good,"is a job with limited opportunities for growth.  Scheduling is inconsistent, lack of employment one is over worked then recommending because of hourly overtime.  Mangers are in the store average 65 hours weekly because of lack of employee hours allowed"
good,alright job they want you to profile people coming in the store because the store loses alot of money to store thefts. besides that it was an alright job.
good,"Don't let the title fool you. Dollar Tree was probably the first job I could truly say I didn't mind going to-- for the twleve to fifteen hours or so a week I got. My fellow associates were (for the most part) genuinely nice to work with; even the managers, who had their miscommunications and disagreements, proved to be friendly and personable people."
good,Would have been a great place to work if I would have been getting giving a better chance I was asked to help numerous employees and their positions and then terminated for lack of work effort.
good,I did not mind working here but it got very busy at times and I felt I was underpaid for everything I had to do and felt like I should have gotten more than 15-20 hours per week. But it was only a seasonal job so I toughed it out. Coworkers were nice and friendly and most customers were too.
good,it was a stressful place to work the customers were rude the store by the end of the day was always trashed no room to go forward in advancing your career
good,"Great co-workers, and the customers are also very friendly and LOVE our store.  I mostly work on  checking out customers and helping  put stock out.  The Asst managers are awesome, great gals to work for and with.  The hardest part of my job is having to work a lot of night, closing shifts."
good,"Working at dollar tree is not for those looking for something easy, you're constantly manning the register while working to finish all additional projects put in place by management."
good,I was promised in the hiring interview that I would get 25+ hours but then was only scheduled 15-20 hours on average. I watched someone who I helped train get promoted over me after working with them more than 6 months. I left after over a year of working with them because of them lying about the hours and then not having enough money to pay my bills.
good,"Dollartree is a wonderful place for customers to purchase items at discounted prices.  Typical workday is counting and managing money in register, be courteous and pleasant to provide excellent customer service.  The hardest part of this job is being on your feet for long hours the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist the customers."
good,Pay is rediculously low. The environment was decent. People stole alot. Co-workers were kind of friendly and we're able to be worked with. The only way I would ever work there again is if I was severely desperate.
good,Working there the first 3 years loved my job. After the new manager arrived I left shortly afterwards. Overall fun place to work with the right management.
good,"It was an okay experience. A little boring. Great for gaining cashier, stocking, and customer service experience. Would recommend for a part time high school job."
good,At Dollar Tree I was a floating store manager bouncing from store to store and continuously being promised t get my own store. yet after almost a year it never happened.
good,"Count my drawer, get my loaded floor cart from the back, make sure my register and surrounding area is clean. Get ready for lots of familiar faces cause I saw most of them every day in the store. I learned a lot of different charities got a lot of their supplies for gift bags, baskets and things like that from our store. I learned how to set up proper display items for holidays and our items of the week. My store manager and assist manager were great people. they helped me get Christmas gifts out of lay-a-way for my kids because we didn't get paid till after I had to have my items out. Going home was hard because I love the dollar tree and packing new products and putting them on the shelves. I miss those familiar customer faces the most."
good,company will leave you high and dry in a time of need. expect overtime. do not pay enough for the work you do. lots of advancement only because high turn over rate.
good,They were flexible when I need off but difficult get hours when you needed some. Barely working when there was not holidays. You were a stocker or cashier ....rarely a manger. Working for minimum wage
good,It is a great place to work depending on who is manager. Some managers can be rude and have anger issues that harm the environment. Over all very easy and fun to work at dollar tree.
good,The Company is ok. The people I worked with were great. The customers left a lot to be desired but I believe that was because of the location of that particular store. It was in the Ghetto. I'm sure all Dollar Tree stores don't have those type of customers.
good,This company those not pay enough and not enough benefits and they will work you real hard.   ......... the manager there is always power driven and lazy
good,"working there wasn't really captivating. When you consider that you cant really advance yourself no matter how hard or how long you work there, it gets you unmotivated to want to continue working there."
good,"I worked seasonally, it was only a few hour per day but very busy. I enjoyed helping customers find items needed for their day to day life. Store itself was unorganized."
good,"greet customers and assist them in finding merchandise"
good,"When I worked this job, I was only able to work 15 hours per week. It did not allow any more than that unless you were full time. I did not learn anything from this job other than some basic front and face policy. The management was terrible and fired me over some coupons. The workplace culture was on the ""annoyed"" side of apathetic and typically didn't care about doing anything whatsoever. There was not hard side to this job. The most enjoyable part was simply talking to others as we mozied about our business."
good,"I have learned how to be patient and understanding with customers, I have learned to merchandise the store during seasonal times such as Christmas, back to school, 4th of July, Valentines Day and other major holidays that occur throughout the year."
good,It is close to my house so it's easy for me to commute. The hours were pretty lame and there wasn't any overtime. I didn't get paid enough for doing the work I was doing there. I need a full time job!
good,I never had a problem working that here. It was mostly the standing and just complete boredom for 6 hours. It's definitely not a job I miss I cannot live working at a place getting paid bi-weekly. I just can't do it.
good,"This was a good place to work while I was in school, unfortunately the pay was very low which left me filled with anxiety, lots of work but no compensation."
good,"Great starting point in retail. Very busy place.  I learned how to follow a planogram.  Blow up many,many balloons.  I enjoyed the job very much untill I got my 1 year raise for 10 cents.  After being top sales in daily push items we have to sell daily at the registers. You only get an 11 min. break that you have to punch in and out for."
good,Dollar Tree was the job to have for a student thats still in school needed a little extra cash in the pocket. Since my home town was small I knew everyone I worked with. I gain a lot of customer service experience in the process while working here.
good,Employees are generally overworked and underpaid.  If you have a good store manager then the job is enjoyable. If you are looking to make money - this is definitely not the job for you.
good,"I really had a good boss that worked with my schedule for me, My day started with counting my drawer and I received a list of tasks to be completed during my shift, As assistant manager I was responsible  for count the safe, checking the sales for the day and promotional items to be displayed. Also reviewing the schedule to know the layout for the day. If openong or closing the store, all the money was to be verified in the safe by two people always."
good,Break time is short no time to eat & no time for bathroom. What I did like was that we all work together. Working together help a lot to finish on time to get out on time.
good,"It provide some sort of income for me at the time, but honestly I personally did not like working there too much. Only one manager acted like a professional and the other two would have cat fights here and there. There's actually a good amount work and multi-tasking involved with this job. Tasks included are: cashier, opening boxes, restocking, helping customers, filling balloons, cleaning windows, sweeping, gathering misplaced items and putting them back, and counting your register before and after shift. Overall I wasn't getting paid enough for this job."
good,"running the registrar stalking cleaning "
good,"This company doesn't offer competitive wages, and expects more from the employees with very little return. Upper management has a lack of support for there team members and there is very little room for advancement"
good,"Company did not offer enough pay for the work done. Also, not good at having enough people on the registers which caused super long lines."
good,"It was over all a good, I was always busy and I like that."
good,Steady work and comfortable atmosphere. Like helping customers and the great team work. Management is great there as well. They also help out to get the job done.
good,"Although it i an easy job, Dollar tree does not provide the pay or hours needed to make a decent living. Pay checks are vert smalll as you work no more than 20 hours a week and at minimum wage."
good,Working for Dollar Tree was not the best place to be even though everything is a dollar people would still complain and they would think the quality would be better.
good,"It was pretty much fast paced,weather we're unloading or stocking.I learned how to work in all areas of the store,Some managers were OK  to work with.co workers helped each other.There was always a time limit on every area of work,but clocking out to go home was always good to know.I didn't see much advancement in that company, just more work shifts & a few more hours."
good,"be prepared to work in the store with just 1-2 other associates most days..and be expected to accomplish the work of 5 people"
good,"Nice work environment, store mangers and everyone above her have no concern for their employees. They only hire part time and usually only schedule 12 hours  a week."
good,"Cashier, doing what I was requested. I was considered several times for management but nothing went beyond talks. I decided to leave after several situation within the staff of the store I worked at."
good,Liked my job didnt get along with some of the employeesthe manger wasnt a good manger she would talk about other employees to employees i felt it was wrong and between that employee and the manger and not everyone in the place of employment
good,"I would open and close the store . Put out stock. Help the customer find the items they want. Do all the office work,  make the schedule for the store, maintain all the paper for the store. Make bank deposit."
good,"this workforce is a great place to be hired for after school positions or a weekend job for students. not a career company to work for. Assistant managers get payed $1 more an hour than cashiers. I was responsible for bank depositing, hiring, unloading truck, merchandising ect."
good,"I feel like Dollar tree is an okay place to work. It was fine during school and I was able to focus on my work, but there's no way you can work there and pay the bills."
good,Alot of work for very little pay. Will have you stock and run cashier and answer questions customers have for extremely low pay.It was a simply a job i went to to try and earn money i worked there for years and only received a very low pay.
good,Some of the girls here were very unprofessional especially when talking to others. Not a place I recommend to work. There were also a few times that they did not put all of my hours on my check
good,"If you like a job that is laid back, than dollar tree is for you. Everyone is mostly lax. There were not many stressful moments when I worked there. Its a nice calm place to work."
good,"It is a nice place to start to work, but there are not many reason to stay long term. the pay if hard to live off of, new employees leave the store as soon as they come in. are arms will be tried more often then not."
good,I started as a cashier only for two months worked hard became a asst.manager-store manager. the changes was a little to much for me. My district manager didn't like that I was a strong Black African American Woman .(Right is right and wrong is wrong  )The pay wasn't all that but above all of my co-worker made it worth it .We worked to together to get the job done. Great team work
good,I enjoyed working at dollar tree meeting new people and helping others find what they need very fast paced coworkers have been very nice along with customers.
good,My coworkers were mostly great and a couple of the supervisors were awesome.  That's it.  That's the extent of the good.  You typically work way too many hours and far too hard for what you get back from this company.
good,I did not really have a set schedule and wasnt being paid for most of the hours i worked. It wasnt always so bad. I mean i had fun and got along with my co-workers but me and the management wasnt really on the same page
good,this is a great job for someone who is in high school or just coming out of it. it is a great way to start on a career path and build up great work ethics. Its a lot of standing around and/or restocking.
good,"Part time cashier with outstanding customer service, also was given the opportunity to help stock merchandise throughout the store. Deposit runs for the store."
good,its more of job u do if u live at home with family and you don't have to pay rent !! Its not a job that pays well and a normal shift is only 4 hours long.
good,Worked there for 4 years and liked it for a retail dollar store. Job duties were clear and people were held accountable for their actions. Love the store shop there all the time..................
good,"This job is great for someone just looking for work and money. However, it is very hard and I don't feel you make enough for how hard and dangerous the work can be."
good,"Was an average minimum wage job, nothing super special, nor horribly bad, Good place to start as a teenager wanting to get job experience in the retail field."
good,"Wasn't trained properly by managers, and got rushed to do things I wasn't taught to do. Also, I was not given a run-down of rules and regulations or anything of the sort. Only one manager helped me overall."
good,It all depends in the area located. Good place to work at. Offers opportunities to help you grow in the industry. Employees Always helpful and great vibes.
good,"Not a good place to work, no benefits and can only receive part time.hpurs unless you are management. It did have a fun work environment, however a lot of the times the environment lacked safety for the employees and customers as well."
good,"I worked at dollar tree as a cashier. I really enjoyed assisting  customers, however, there was a change in management every 3 months which is difficult for an employee."
good,Decent place to work but very high turnover rate. Hard to manage with new faces every day. A lot of temporary associates to handle. Management is all over the place with no clear cut goals.
good,"It always started off busy, but it made time go by fast because i was always busy. Believed I took the job more serious than others at times.Lunches were a nice break ."
good,"We don't get paid enough to clean bathrooms, wash this, wash the floor, clean windows, do cashier, stock......either have us work on register or stocking. Needs better pay."
good,This was normal retail job. It was only part time and no room for advancement. This job would be ideal for a second job or first time job for high schooler.
good,Fast paced work enviroment gained knowledge of people skills and products . worked with good management personal and coworkers as well as regular customers
good,I liked the work environment and the coworkers. It was a nice atmosphere. And very good employers and supervisors. I enjoyed working with the customers as well.
good,I had to work side by side with my manger.It was hard for me because she wasn't willing to work on register. So the average work day was me on register then stoking when i could and then doing truck when needed.My job was most enjoyable was the customers.
good,"Stocking, cashier, management. all are available positions. no experience needed. decent hours. not much more to say. can't submit review untill the required about of words in this summery are present. ok this should be enough."
good,"The people who I met at dollar tree were interesting but every company has setbacks and it's own worries, I met cool people and the workload is tough like any other stocking job. However I have met managers once again who you have to adjust to, everyone is different. But its not so difficult, unlike publix requiring everything finished before you leave, at dollar tree you get finished with what you can before your shift is over. But great people though."
good,Some of the people that was there when I was is still there. Management keeps changing. And corporate is not nice to their employees.
good,"A typical day is full of stocking products.  Seasonal wares and tie in products help to generate sales from the customers, as do bulk sales, niche items, and continuity of placement for easy retrieval.  "
good,"Typically Dollar tree only gives cashiers about 15-25 hours per week depending on how busy the store has been. Its very inconsistent, I would like a more consistent job, but also one where I feel I'm actually doing something important."
good,Short work days but very big on number of scans and accuracy.  Its a great part time for someone looking to supplement time and add additional house income.
good,"I enjoyed working at dollar tree, even if it was a temporary job. the assistant manager was rude with customers and also with me."
good,Over last three years after takeover of Family Dollar really went down hill. Minimum pay for employees. Health care cheaper for Family Dollar employees by half even though same company. Had to work every day for over two months with no days off. Not a family oriented company anymore.  They don't care about employees. Very high turnover rate for all positions including management.
good,Hard work and slavery at its best. Hardest warehouse I ever worked for. A lot of heavy lifting. Nobody wants to do the hard work. Mandatory overtime. Too many lazy people
good,"Open, close assist store manager stocking, prepare register for employees, daily store manager operations in absent of store manager. Hardest part was reliable employees, Store Manager and District Manager"
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work.. Flexable schedule good management and easy work. Good customer service required pay is good as well. Only thing is need more hours to work
good,You must be willing to sacrifice your time with family. You must be ready for a large amount of manual labor. Set time for seasonal changes are very short with limited payroll to bring in additional associates to help.
good,Loved working for this company as a whole. i have been working with dollar tree since 2006 as a cashier and worked my way up to an assistant manager. Then also worked my way to be a freight flow manager who was in charge of the freight in the backroom.
good,I've worked for Dollar Tree for six years now. I started with the company while they were actually setting up the store. I got hired as a cashier now full time manager. Very demanding. Have to be always on the go. Very little time for an actual life since it's never a set schedule. I enjoyed it up until now. Looking for something more rewarding.
good,Employees are under paid and benefits are provided to part-time employees. This job is good for teenagers for beginner job experience only. However I did enjoy the customer service experience.
good,"I was a cashier and responsible to help all customers, making sure the front of the store was fully stocked and presentable. I helped with balloon assistance."
good,"I have learned a lot in the retail business at Dollar Tree: I learned how to handle customers, how to multitask and get things done in a timely manner. Being a manager can be as easy or as hard as you make it, my coworkers there are awesome making my job not as stressful. The hardest part about my job would be dealing with the store manager, sometimes the root of the problem can come from high above (ranking job title) than what some perceive the problem may be. No health benefits and no employee discounts."
good,well the assistant manager was a very understanding lady. the main manager was very awful he was rude to people that I witnessed. I learned some new things about stocking that I didn't know that people did. the hardest part was dealing with the manager. and the best part was working for my assistant manager.
good,"Mostly boring, but I try to do my job well. One of my managers doesn't seem to take any pride in their work and it damages morale, but the manager I work closest with does a very good job and sets a great example. The customers often open products before checkout, but they usually pay for them. All in all it REALLY isn't a bad job and I would work full time if they would allow it. I am currently looking to move up into a full time retail position."
good,Daily plan. Plan the scheduling for staff give them task and direction. Make sure order are in the systeme or submit store order. Listen to client or guide them trought the store. Huddle in the morning and afternoon for the next shift
good,Great manager at the time that I worked there. Pay is way under for the amount of work that was asked of employees. I guess it would be a good job for a retired person.
good,I updated my skills on working on the register. Overall stocking and inventory.Dealt with the customers and improved my customer services skills.
good,It could of been better.. It was my first job and a big learning experience for me.. It showed me how the retail businesse is.. It was a growing experience.. You some employees enjoyed and learn and had great leadership
good,"This store location is now closed. Typical retail environment, mostly part-time work. Some room for advancement, the manager was nice."
good,they are very flexible but the work is hard due to how busy the place can get. expect to work very late if you are closing. good first job though.
good,"The company is a great one to work for, but this specific store is sinking. Under the correct management, I would go back. A typical day at work began with picking up the slack from the previous shift, stocking the freezer, and putting up freight until 4pm. Then the manager and cashier should begin cleaning and fronting the store. Often times, employees did not show, which made it difficult on those who did."
good,I was going to be going to college so when I got the job at Dollar tree I made it clear to Manager/supervisor of that. At first the hours worked great but then I was scheduled when I couldnt work and also my hours would get cut to maybe 16 a week. I loved the people I worked with. I enjoyed the job. I learned alot.
good,"My review is its nice place to work if your a teen or mom just looking for side part time job learned to bagg properly.. management in seting up truck delivery.. co workers were very helpful when needed..Trying to tend 3 or 4 people at time when holidays came around..and the most enjoyable time of the job is when everthing Is in"
good,"Walk in the store and its clean (Quite) but clean, ive worked at dollar tree since it open in Strathmore in November 2014. i worked myself up to assistant manger and store manger for 4 Week. ive learned to love the warehouse cleaning, organizing it and unloading trucks. best part was he co-workers i had. Always bought each others coffee."
good,Hardly any hours was given. Me & about 5 others who worked the store only got 10 hrs per week. Which made it hard to continue to work for dollar tree. A lot of reliable workers switched jobs within a month or two.
good,When working here you have to keep to yourself and work till your off.  This is a good workplace to start at until you find something better
good,"Dollar Tree is an easy going, relaxed place to be. Most enjoyable part about the job is seeing the new product we get in and the hunt for an item. We will get customers in looking for something in particular, sometimes we have it and sometimes we don't but usually able to provide with other options that may work for them. Always interesting how creative people are."
good,if your looking for a perdictable pay forget it and if your looking to get paid for hours you work forget it. if the person covering you does not come in on time your not leaving and not getting paid for them hours.
good,"Management gets fired a lot, not on top if you tell them part time work. People that are near management treat others poorly. Helped to open up more so to strangers. learned to multitask well and faster."
good,it's an OK job. pay isn't the best even for management. Lots of sacrifices are expected of you to make but you get so little in return.
good,You worked with less people and you were able to take charge of projects on your own. I always made it a mission to create the best wow table in our area with our seasonal products. Stocking products were easy while managing a register at the same time. The management gave your more responsibility which made you feel important.
good,my manager was always rushing me to get things done right off the bat without training and expected me to automatically understand and catch on how the job needed to be done. the fellow co workers made it easier to handle the harder things about this job and were very helpful
good,"a typical day was running the store, helping people find things. stocking, and checking people out. management was ok. some co workers was great to work with and others not so much."
good,"I would walk the store everyday and follow all store protocol and daily requirements."
good,mangement team was still learning their job which was hardest part of the job. the registers are extremely simple to learn. co workers were very good. and loved the customers and products
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelfs, and maintaining the store. On certain days, you would help off load the delivery truck."
good,"very easy work environment, non-stressful. A lot of hands on training is provided as well as the opportunity to do other jobs within the store. Opportunity for advancement is very low, but the work environment is like that of a family"
good,"A lot of the employees are careless, the store is always a mess because nobody really bothers to clean it up.  The customers here are easy to get along with, and are usually what made the day a little easier. One of the assistant managers is wonderful... professional, doesn't discuss workers to other employers, and actually cares about her team. It's a decent job, the pay is okay, and they are not greedy with hours!"
good,"The processes are in dire need of updates so much of the work takes longer than it should. The hardest part of the job is staffing and training because the pay is low and there are no raises given and no profit sharing program for associates. The most enjoyable part is getting to run your own store and merchandising as you please, so long as it's seasonably correct."
good,Most of the days it was a joy to work but merely two complaints from    the same disgruntled customer for not leaving the register( as I was alone in the store-against policy) put blame the on me for inadequacy.
good,working as a cashier here was literally brain draining . i would get off of work and l just had no mental function left. its super repetitive and fast pace the whole shift.
good,tiny space so everything was easy to do. this was my first job so i learned how to do register and clean the floor when needed. in dollar tree theres always just one of you and your manager but even then the manager was there when you needed him/her. hardest part was well theres only 2 of you so its hard to clean at night with such very short staff. i was always very comfortable i never had issues with anythiing.
good,"Starting as a new manager in training I expected to learn tons of things in regards of running a store. I expected it to be a critical learning experience with me being overwhelmed. In fact, it was the complete opposite and  I enjoyed working with the associates there. I made relationships with coworkers and gained a lot of respect from being young and mature. The only part of the job I dislike was the communication between the managers. Some days were harder too handle due to lack of communication between schedule switch other than that the job is pretty well manageable and relaxed."
good,"This is OK as just like a first job or a temporary job. There isn't really room for advancement. The management was OK, there were a couple managers who were awesome but one of the managers was horrible and always seemed angry.The pay is average for cashier work."
good,It is a good place to work. They just don't pay enough. You just use the cash register & put items on the shelf around the register area.
good,hard work but kinda fun just make sure you bust your hind or they will find a reason to can you. dont get hurt or they will can you. in fact they may even laugh at you. just saying.
good,"Dollar Tree, Inc. is a face pace job. Before you know it, its time to end your shift. I enjoy meeting the customers and having a conversion with them."
good,Managers seemed to want to hand off work to all the stockers and cashiers. It seemed to me the managers only worked on something when they were expecting somebody from corporate.
good,"easy work but need thick skin to deal with the belittlement caused by the managers and higher ups, they treat you as no more than a number and will accuse you of things you didnt do due to lack of cameras in stores"
good,I have very fun and good coworkers but the environment and the safety is my biggest issue. We frequently get robbed and I would like to change to a job that is much safer.
good,"A typical day at Dollar tree will be as usual slow. During certain hours it'll get somewhat a little busy but with little to no help coming from other staff members, the only staff that's on the floor (mostly the cashier) will be the only one to take care of customers that are waiting to be checked out. There is no security at all in the store, so customers are likely to steal everyday. Cashier drawers and registers are in need of  a update due to errors that are always made with them. Management is highly poor and cares less about customers concerns, complaints and questions. The hardest part of the job was stock and the most enjoyable was greeting and helping customers."
good,No order at all. Workers did as they please. No type of management structure. Stock room was in ruin. Someone needs to go in there and get it together.
good,"Team oriented environment, associates very dedicated to work hard. Pay incentives, good benefits for the associates (Not Management). Managers are treated poorly, unfair, and inconsistent with accountability."
good,"I was blessed with a Great Assistant manager who went on to be a store manager and a few really good co-workers.  But, the pay and expectations are horrible.  You are expected to do so much and they are more than willing to let you do plenty outside your job description.  However, when it comes to recognizing you for it or giving a favorable evaluation that tells the truth about all you really do-don't hold your breath.  You have to work at this company forever to get a decent pay and that is only if you become store manager-anything less than this position you are astronomically screwed."
good,wasnt what i expected and then i tried to do my best and they let me go without telling me. its a very nice place to start working but dont make it a career its not worth the headache
good,Nice People to work with. However the hours are not enough to make a living.
good,"am able to provide service to public, flexible shifts, close to my home, ability to earn a little extra money as I only am working parttime at xray"
good,"very high volume store, constant stocking of merchandise, ringing register attending to customers needs keeping store clean floor free of possible accidents, I have worked in sales before only thing different is the systems ie cash registers, most enjoyable part is assisting customers and giving the beast customer service seeing a customer satisfied is the best part"
good,The  customers where very well pleased with my performance as an Assistant Manager and a few coworkers as well.
good,The day varies. Its a learning experience about management still. Generally have co-workers that are easy to get along with. The hardest part is being understaffed on days when we are busy. The fact that I'm close to my house is the biggest perk.
good,"A typical work day was working the cash register, and maintain the front half of the store by vacuuming and restock shelves and removing misplaced items"
good,"Typical day started at 5 in the morning loading carts full of boxes from the stock room to be stocked on the shelves. I learned a lot about organization. My manager was great, very friendly, understanding, and helpful. My co-workers were also friendly. The hardest part of the job was getting myself to not spend as much time organizing as I wanted to. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,There's little to be said. I've not had a great experience at my location.. I joined the team (if you want to call it that) as a seasonal associate and became a member of management five months later. It's been slow and go from there with little recognition or involvement from upper management.... Working at Dollar Tree has definitely increased my resilience and patience as well as provided me with further motivation towards my work and life.
good,"Clock in "
good,The manajers would argue a lot and not agree on a lot of things.
good,"A typical day at my job is pretty fun, but sometimes there is so much goofing around and not enough work. I have learned that personal matters should stay home and some things are better left unsaid. I get along with everybody, so I love my co-workers. Hardest part my job is dealing with attitudes and the best part of my job is knowing I help those in need."
good,Sometimes the other workers wouldn't do their jobs leaving you to do them. It was a typical fast food job.
good,A typical work day is busy.  The benefits are great.  There's no room for advancement.
good,"There is never any hidden agendas, you follow your schedule,go to work and it is what it is."
good,"Cashiering "
good,"there is lots of pressure to do things the ""company"" way and be able to keep up with the demands to change at a rapid pace. The people were great as were the customers the best thing was helping a customer become a repeat customer,"
good,"Busy, some customers are nice others rude. I learned to multi-task by doing the cashiers, greeting customers, cleaning, organizing items, and dealing with customers issues. The manager and my co-workers were nice, polite and easy to work with. Hardest part of the job is cleaning once i cleaned an aisle a few seconds later its all disorganized items on the floor. Most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction on a customers face."
good,Working at Dollar Tree was not the best job I ever had. Since my passion is in the kitchen it was hard for myself to enjoy the job. While working at Dollar Tree I had learn things that I ever knew were that important to a store for example I never knew that items had a place where they had to go on the shelves. I just thought that you put the like things together. I also learned about time management we had so many hours to get out boxes and have them on the shelves in the correct spots. My schedule was always changing and I never got the same hours every week that made it hard to pay my bills and get the things i needed to get. Overall Dollar Tree was not a bad workplace its just not where my heart is.
good,Good company to work for.  There is limited room for career advancement.
good,Moving up in management was very hard to do. Manager was not always honest. Felt taken advantage of for the rate of pay I was receiving.
good,"Great place to work.A typical day is very busy, I enjoy helping the shopper find desired items . There is nothing like the team work of co-workers rallying together to make through a rush .One of the hardiest part of the is dealing with a up set shopper."
good,Would help customers ring up their items and help them find things they were looking for. My co-workers were pretty cool and so were my managers. The job for the most part was pretty easy and the customers were all so friendly.
good,i enjoy working at dollar tree. i got along with my co-workers.
good,working as a assistant manager was fun. i got to interact more with employees and help them with all with whatever probolems they had.
good,I am always grateful for extra income during the Christmas season.
good,its a first step job. its pretty fast paced. wszwjhdgxcjhwsxuytfgshjskxudcytfgvqahjwsudghqjwusbwudtgwu2yghw2juwwbhqjwuedvbswj2u3eythj3uew
good,A typical day is waiting on customers and processing their merchandise.  I learned that I could do anything once I put my mind to it.  My co-workers I still talk to and keep in touch with.  The hardest part of my job was making sure all the aisles were zoned perfectly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the customers.
good,"This was my first job and it has gotten me into the door at may different companies because of my retail experience. Co-workers were cool, tight family like bonds are formed due to the fact that everyone is in the same boat. Management was weak in some areas but overall it was good. I learned that from gaining experience with them, you can get further greater opportunities elsewhere."
good,"This was only a seasonal job for 1 month, it consisted of basic unskilled work such as stocking shelves and retrieving misplaced products."
good,this is a temporary job and I have only with the co for 3 wks. I would stay with them if offered a position
good,"I welcomingly greet all customers, assist them in locating merchandise and finalize their purchases with the final sale. The associates were okay to work with, the management was fun and vibrant to work with. The hardest part of the job was to continously keep the store clean and recovered. Its a retail kind of job to it was a learning experience."
good,its a pretty easy job just don't give you enough hours or days.
good,"I am always busy and that is what I like in a job. The management is good at both companies, but they are limited on how many hours they can give, so it is very difficult to coordinate the two jobs and get enough hours to support myself.  Also the two places are several miles apart, so this also makes it difficult. Typically I am at Big Lots early in the am to unload the truck, organize the warehouse, stock shelves and prepare for opening. I do cashier when needed.  I have learned all the skill necessary to work in the various departments.  I find it easy to fit in and get along well with co workers.  Manual labor is the hardest part of the job, but I am fine with that.  Keeping busy is the best part of the job."
good,Alot of the times jobs were not being completed during shift changes
good,"Management gets changed every month, the co-workers are very nice and helpful when needed,  great flexible hours to balance school and a job."
good,"the store manager was down to earth , the district manager needed to relax and let the store manager do her job "
good,A typical day at work consists of me cashiering and cleaning the store efficiently. I learned how to cashier without any mistakes and how to count down a cash register. My co-workers are very friendly but sometimes are not helpful. Things that are hard at work would be keeping up with the whole store alone and not having much help. I enjoy the customers I interact with daily.
good,"The typical day at work is just like any other retail store. As a sales associate, I learned the work of the cashier, stocker and trucking. The management is fair. "
good,"I was on the move constantly. I trained, helped open stores, and it was very busy so the day went extremely fast."
good,"Dealing with customers was probably the best experience I had with this employer.  Not everyone is pleasant, but they always left with a smile on their face when dealing with me.  To be honest, didn't really feel like I left with anything special with this employer, it was average work, and I've done this type of thing before.  Management was pretty fair on a good day, but would often make the day unpleasant when having an off-day.  Co-workers were great, very easy to talk to and work with, very helpful.  I can honestly say that I found no difficult parts to this job.  Definitely the most enjoyable part were the customers."
good,For the time i worked there i enjoyed it. I wasn't there long enough to actually aquire any knowledge. The only hard part about the job was being short cashiers. I enjoyed the people i worked with.
good,"It was a very business place there was never really a bull moment, I learned patience here. My Supervisor an Coworkers were very nice an easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job was the large amounts of money and the fact that i had to take it too the Bank myself. the best part about working here was the fact that people actually said Please and Thank you. Rarely having to deal with a rude customers was a great change for me."
good,a typical day at work would be to open the store and verify the nightly deposit and set up all the paper work and the cash for the day. after that i would review the daily action plan and see what the cashier and i would be doing for the day and create duty sheets for us. than i would load a u boat of dollar tree products and follow the dollar tree planner and stock the store while at the same time being back up cashier and assist customers.
good,"a monkey can do this job. detailing, register, and customer service are the only things your responsible for."
good,they well hire u and tell u u can get up to 34 to 40 hours a week but u only get 15 hour per week not enough hours for me
good,Stock store up.. Not much to learn. Management was up and down.. Co-workers was real good people. Hardest thing was dealing with the management ..The most enjoyable was time I was getting off... Lol
good,very clean well manged area
good,i am a stocker in a cashier. i stock the shelves with new merchandise weekly.i also handle money and showing the customers excellent customer service.
good,Dollar Tree is a great store and was a fun envirnoment. All of the assistant managers were great to work with. The downfall to the place was the manager.
good,dont have a certain day I would work there are some weeks i only work 1 or 2 days i learned how to cashier the co-workers are fun but there is a lot of drama and the lunch is only 10 min for part time workers the hardest thing about the job is recovering the store and cashiering when a load of people come in.
good,Easy and simple.
good,"Although I work there only 5 years, it was a fun place to work for except when I got pregnant at the wrong quarter. Then, my fellow co-workers treated me badly and I left."
good,Not the best place to work if you have a family. Especially in any management positions.
good,"Process Freight, plan schedules, build relationships"
good,"This job required you to process customer orders, stock shelves, upkeep the store, and to make sure everything was in its rightful place."
good,"Dollar Tree was a fun company to work for! I had a great time as an Assistant and Store Manager, but I had no life. I worked everyday, my employees were wonderful, but management above me was not."
good,Working for Dollar Tree Stores is great when you need to have job while you're in school.
good,Absolutely no job security. The HR Dept is very sneaky. They will give you a half day off then call you and t ell you your fired without reason then bar you fr p m the premises and mail you your belongings. The lower management is awesome but upper management is terrible. The temp employees are not people you want to work with .
good,"Within the time working at this establishment was a mixed experience, I've dealt with meeting good people as well as people causing problems within the store. developed friendships with a few co-workers and assistant managers, The downside for this place was standing in one location ringing up customers the whole shift and not leaving on time when needed and also the pay was very low."
good,"I liked working at dollar tree but then I felt like I wasn’t getting paid enough for my hard work. And I loved working with the customers everybody I’ve rung up was every nice, and said I have every good customer service."
good,Be aware of your suroundings and be fast and smart on the timing you get things done and dont take to long on one thing and not finish the rest of the list
good,"The worker did not do any work at the job. The store was never clean. Everybody can in late , so other employees had to put the slack . The job didn’t pay well"
good,As a first time job it was fun and eye opening most managers helped when others seemed annoyed at even the simplest of questions. Other than that friendly people and helpful coworkers
good,They didn’t give out a lot of hours and there wasn’t a lot of room to advance. I didn’t work there long. I got stuck at the register for practically all of it. It’s good if you’re into retail. Starting pay wasn’t all that great.
good,"Easy work"
good,"Cashiering"
good,It is a hard job that you need to be physically ready for it because it get really hot in the summer time it feels like a sweat shop and in the winter time it os a freezer.
good,I love working for them but I did like how may he they were giving me 10hr a week and need more hourer I have a family to take care of so 10hr was not cutting it so I found a other job at Cafe
good,"Love to deal with customers"
good,"I go in for my shift. work my shift, then go home. Didn't get along with other employees or managers because they were rude to me in front of customers and rude to the customers. Most enjoyable park of my job was when i got to stock the shelf's and go home. Its a boring job just standing at the register all day and having rude comments said to you.  Its not a bad job, just not the right people in the right positions."
good,A typical day at this job can be fun because coworkers are nice and friendly but most of the time it's stressful because you are left alone in the register with a lot of customers.
good,It's okay for a temporary job. Nothing long term shabby especially with the pay. The woman that owns the store is kind of hypocritical. But you learn to just do you and keep on. Management is great. Usually busy from 10 am to 5 pm. The hardest thing to learn was patience. You kinda just gotta let things roll and accept that nothings gonna change. It is a minimum wage job after all. Good for full time college students or those looking to get a little retail action under their belt.
good,The works and the managers where nice and they were serious about work. The workers new when it was time to have fun and also when it was time to get serious.
good,"At first I like working there, then u notice the younger people don’t have the understanding of work ethic!!! Have recently retired from a hospital for 32 years & worked w great people but theses young people, not all but most take advantage of the work involved & work w there phones in hand. To me that should not be aloud!!!! There is a time & place for that."
good,Upon arrival I clocked in and then the entire team did stretching exercise. We were updated on the production from the previous day and then get your expectations for the current day. You were to report to your line and begin picking.
good,"It went from bad to worse,  when as a manager you aren't even allowed to hire or interview my own asst.  The district manager thought his choices wherebetter.  An alcholic and a drug addict."
good,The warehouse was a very unsafe place to be the store manager but simply boxes in the middle of the row behind the yellow lines instead of destroying the boxes that have food he would just sit them in the back that's a theft problem
good,"Fun place to work,  but just wish it paid more and the manager would've worked around my schedule. Seeing new products come in during the holidays was fun. You really need to have good customer service skills."
good,The energy at Dollar Tree was actually good  things were either easy to learn or self-explanatory. I would still be working there if the pay was better or if I didn’t get screwed over when I had my car accident
good,It was ok at first because I needsed a job because I just had a baby but I need more hours I applied for shift lead sadly I missed it by few answers 85% was what I got so I let my GM know that I was going to pick up second honestly think she was upset she told she was letting me go but never did it was a lie so I left after I found better job because I didn't wanna deal with that type work environment
good,"My typical day of work here included assisting customers to find what they need, and handling payment transactions. I was also responsible for keeping my area neat and clean."
good,"Pretty average retail job as far as work load goes. Only difference is there's no chance for PTO, no bonuses, and no raises. I make minimum wage, have been working there for a year and a half. Another employee that's been working there for 4 years makes the same amount. A new employee makes the same amount. This is NOT a job you can sustain off of; this is purely for people who need a little extra income from a small 15-20 hours a week side gig."
good,The pay is ridiculous which is why it's so hard to keep anyone along with the fact that the big managers lie a lot when it comes to pay increase. You're over worked & underpaid especially in promotions.
good,"Each store & manger is different and advancement in my store wasn't a option., but if you can move or travel there maybe opportunity to advance. the pay is based on each state minimum wage not cost of living."
good,Lack of support from upper management. Low payroll hours and tough area where theft was very much a cultural thing . No work life balance. Many days had to come on days off
good,"You are micro managed everyday by the GM and he micromanages the Operations managers. It is difficult to get anything done there when it is not being done ""his"" way and it's not being done fast enough. Turnover for both hourly and salary is outrageous and it's primarily because they want you to work 60+ hours a week and when you don't, they run you out the door. It's a shame because there are times in DollarTree where it's really not a bad gig to have, it's just ruined by the upper management trying to make everyone there do more than humanly possible. Then when daily numbers are not met, they pile on the mandatory overtime and don't care about your life outside of the job. You have to learn how to do your job pretty much on your own. There is no one there that can teach you anything but the basics. You are constantly training new people as people quit or don't show up for work daily. It's a struggle to stay motivated and show up for your shift."
good,"10 hour work days. Longer during the holiday season. "
good,"I do actually like what I do for the company. The only complaints are that communication is inconsistent and at times goes completely unanswered, policies and procedures are difficult to enforce due to the lack of them and I have been told on multiple occasions that I was either going to get things for my store or have things happen in my store and none of those ""promises"" have been fulfilled."
good,Poor management and bad team work. It was a bad environment for me management at the time was not doing a good job with the store and always was in a rush for us to work and he would hide and listen to our conversations.
good,It depends on what kind of store manager you have. It all depends on how you work together. My experience in Chicago store was I had a great manager. My experience in Michigan has been much harder. My manager can be sneaky and vindictive depending on the situation. If I'm not up front and straight to the point with her. sh Know she is in the wrong she will take advantage over you
good,"I typically close the store on my shifts. Management is ok at times, but actions are inaffective at times. Some issues don’t get dealt with soon enough or are not productive enough. The work culture is retail, constant cleaning of the isles due to some customers inconsiderate action or behavior. The hardest part of the job is having other coworkers that are constantly targeting you or bad mouthing you behind your back, defamation of character, demeaning and slander.... waiting to see what the regional manager will do at moment.. the most enjoyable part is having happy customers and getting praise by customers that your store is the cleanest store they have been in."
good,The job is great for a starter job and it's easy when people actually work together. They don't give benefits or discounts. 6 months is the minimum to work there to become manager. The pay stays the same and you get a 10 cent raise after working there for over a year.
good,it is not easy to get fulll time.you dont get any benefits as a part time.you have unloads truck by hand every week..and work holidays and night shift..
good,Being professional in front of workers and customers i like it not to demanded and flexibility for my other job and getting all the hours i need is helpful
good,When I was employed at Dallor Tree I can honestly say that for the first time in my life I felt really good about myself.As a employee of Dallor Tree I was pretty devoted to my job and tought me a lot and for the first time in all my years of being employed I had confeadence in my self.
good,"Unorganized, lack of processes, no work life balance. No raise till after a year, not competitive. No lack in hours and offered healthcare is ok. No climate control, lighter boxes."
good,I learned alot at this company! I loved the fast-paced environment. I loved interacting w/ the customers. I loved the diversity. I would recommend this to friends
good,"Dollar tree is a great job first job to have. They teach you cashiering, stocking, audit's, money handling, etc. The starting pay is only minimum wage and part time for all employees. If you're looking for something easy, and flexible to your schedule Dollar Tree would be a good place to look at."
good,"The new Management started to get really mean to me when I got pregnant and I couldn’t lift and climb ladders! Other than that it was a really great job, I loved coming in to my co-workers and all the costumers!"
good,I would recommend anyone applying for a job at dollar tree it is a great starter job with opportunity to advance the management is paid back and interviewing was very easy
good,Was very busy and sometimes not enough worker's .shifts was short nit enough hours for me as a single parent also would have liked to have benefits overall friendly coworkers
good,I love retail and know that all Companies have their pros and cons.  Upper Management talks a lot but know action.  Not enough payroll hours to perform up to your ability and show how you can excel.  Turnover rate for employees is high so there is constant training.
good,"I liked the kind of work. I went in, did my job, and leave."
good,Every thing seemed OK at first until you started talking about family like picking up your child\children then it becomes a problem not enough hours for the company
good,Thankful for the job I was happy for a while but I haven’t been so much lately. I very much like the people with who I had worked with. I only wish them all the very best.
good,"Management was terrible, especially more frustrating when I myself became a manager. Upper management was desperate to hire anyone that would say yes. Coworkers were pleasant. 90% of the job is stocking. There is no dedicated planogram to the layout of the aisles. Very relaxed cleaning regimen. Stock room is utter chaos. Yes every section has a dedicated area, but that is the only organization. Regional reps are completely disconnected from the store. There is no genuine out reach from anyone in the company. Pay was terrible - started off min wage. Only got a $0.50 raise when given a manger role."
good,"I loved my co workers and the regular customers, the whole atmosphere of the store made my day or night a lot less stressful on a day to day basis...."
good,"Constant schedule changes , constant call-outs, being left on the floor all by yourself while manager sits in office with a full store of customers and minimum wage with not enough hours"
good,"Dollar Tree Tigard Oregon. May 2018 to Nov 2018. No break room, 10 minute break isn't enough time. Having no place to relax during break hour was the deal breaker! The manager was simply real good and listened to other's needs. Always had set hour's which was a plus."
good,Would never work here ever again. First week on the job and they left me all alone to man the registers for the longest line of people ever. Really flakey when it came to scheduling and communication was nonexistent.
good,Dollar Tree is a fast-paced work environment. I work long 12-hour days three sometimes four days out of the week. The employees are friendly most of the management are knowledgeable and fair with the employees. The hardest part of the job is picking up heavy Freight and extreme heat in the warehouse.
good,"Stocking the shelves was easy ( party , toys, stationary and craft those were my stations) as long you make it well organized. Too much physical work everyday. Low pay . Break room was hot and sticky , too many flies and bugs. Hours Short. I recommend this job if you're a highschool or college student or retire should work here part-time."
good,"The management is horrible and biased. But if you love a busy day work there. Your day would go by quick because of how busy it is. Dollar Tree is a great place to work but if you have bad, mean and VERY rude managers, it makes it harder on you and it ruins your day all the time. It’ll make you not want to show up to work as much."
good,"High-stress environment no payroll managers are required to work 6.10 hour shifts per week only being compensated for 45 hours very low salary $40,000 or less per year"
good,When I began on the register I learned everything I could and was asked to be an ASM within 2 months. I would work overnight and come bk to run the store the next day. I began to love the job. I would be transferred every 3 months to help build teams. I finally moved out of stayed and went to their biggest store to help build but I wasn’t welcomed and continued to stay. I took all the punches until it came to my kid. Had to do what’s best. Must admit a yr later I miss my job. I loved Dollar Tree
good,"Not enough hours given to work, and  getting paid only 4 days in an 2 week period is not enough. The only enjoyable thing is the customers at times, and it's trying at times."
good,Can be fun with great people just not a job to have if need money or have to support a family.  Holidays are the busiest and you will make more money but once their over it is slow.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree, I enjoyed the fast pace, meeting new people and developing new relationships with my customers. I had a better opportunity arise which is why I left."
good,"breaks can be 15 minutes not 10 minutes.   You get 30 minute if you work more 6 hrs.  Part time only.  "
good,"Dollar tree is fun to work for,  it just doesn't have any job security or benefits. The place I worked at even had a high theft rate.  Needs stronger security."
good,Deal with a lot of thieves and no security this is a very unsafe place to work at and also we do our best to control shrink but it takes all the good energy off of me
good,"No full time hours"
good,Can be fun but stressful at times but overall a job for people right out of high school no benefits or vacation time paid sick leave or anything else hard to get fulltime hours
good,"I currently work at a Dollar Tree. Working for the company is not the issue, but the pay is. Dollar Tree only pays minimum wage, 7.35, at least in my area. The area in which my Dollar tree is located is high trafficked which means we are CONSTANTLY busy. We are always understaffed and have a hard time getting stock out in a timely fashion. It needs to be bumped up to at least $9 or $10.  just so we can survive"
good,It’s a fun workplace for first time job lookers The job is not very stressful you get to do what you want when you want you have set goals to meet hourly very friendly environment the customers are great
good,With retail jobs in general it can be slightly stressful but with the co workers at this establishment they made it very enjoyable for the most part. There was rarely a day you weren’t laughing.
good,"The Dollar Tree in Calais, ME was built in 2017. I believe it was rushed. There we're cracks in the floor.  The hired workers had to put up the shelves,  put up the inventory before the grand opening, and had to clean the store before the grand opening.  It was a little hectic. Working there was good for the first 2 months but then it got very stressful.  It was poorly managed. Minimum wage sucked. Hours sucked. They didn't program the computers at the registers for the exchange rates, so we had to follow a paper chart and try to figure it out with a calculator and hope it was right.  I wouldn't work there again if they begged me. Most of the original workers quit and some of the best got fired for stupid reasons."
good,Improve management and working hours for your employees. Keep the store more organized. Hire more people to work there. Keep more people at the register.
good,"When I to go to work I feel happy and loved, I know you are wondering why? The customers & store manger  make me feel very happy and good vibes. They are always asking if I'm okay or not. "
good,"Didn't much care about my personal life or what I needed to do. Took me in as a best case candidate out of their available hires. Enjoyed the customers more than the management."
good,"drama filled  and never consistent--hard retail, constant badgering for more work completed--favoritism--never the same day--not a fun place to work at all"
good,"I ain’t really much to say I trained me to use register but I still got confused and was stressing I have always messed up couldn’t do it but tried , that was it"
good,"- fast-paced environment that gives you early work experience in the retailing industry"
good,"I loved working at dollar tree. It was fast-paced, it let me assist customers and really open more doors for me. It was the endless Micro-managing and work load that really throws people off. As an Assistant Store Manager, the only thing I managed to do was pull the trucks and stock freight all day. We were required to do a high stock count after pulling said truck. While that's not impossible, it's taxing. Expecting 110% after giving 110% to meet the truck unload deadline was not only physically exhausting, but mental too. You get so stressed out about meeting box count and truck unload, you burn out. Burn outs in Dollar Tree are not acceptable."
good,I have been with Dollar Tree for threeyears. This was my first job and I love it. It was easy work with this easy work the pay is not so great. Its minimum wage as I got into management I had a raise of one dollar and thirty cents which is not great at all for how much more responsibly you have. I have worked multiply locations so I know the ins and outs. Dollar tree is great for a beginning job and also for someone who needs a second job. The hours are flexible there which is a plus! The online ordering system is not good I have had many complain to me about it. If your strictly stocking and your location as a stocking program I would recommend doing that if that is what you like doing.
good,"It is a fun place to work, but the pay is poor. Not much growth oppu"
good,clock in greet every customer with a smile. get every customer through the line as quickly as possible. stock when I didn't have a line. management was poor. the culture was very one minded.
good,I have worked at Dollar Tree 2 years and am an assistant manager. I currently make less than $9 an hour which with the amount of responsibilities required is not fair compensation. Our store is extremely busy which makes time go by fast.
good,It has great benefits but they will work the you slap tired out you management is constantly changing the pay isn’t good at all they should be getting paid like 15 work is hard
good,"A typical work day was very relaxed with one or two fast paced rushes, but mostly slow. While working there I learned stocking and putting together displays and the manager is very laid back and will try to work with you if you run into problems. The hardest part of the day was dealing with the boredom that comes with an extremely slow day."
good,"Working at dollar tree, don't count on full time hours.  Only full time hours are granted to the manager and one assistant manager, everyone else gets 20 hours or less per week, and that is if you are lucky.  Dollar tree is a great place to work if your working with great people.  That and the flexible schedule are the only reasons to work here."
good,"Very fast-paced  and peak times    Wiping down cash register’s during slow hours.  Most supervisors are awesome to work with some or not "
good,"Its a high paced environment during the holidays but slows down during the rest of the year. "
good,I worked here when managers actually cared. When I was hired for the manager position I wasn't given benefits of any sorts. The people i worked with were somewhat generous and very forgiving.
good,Get the job done. I learn that you work on your own. Sometime you do extra work. Making sure you help customer. Check for damage item. This company is great for working as part time while you go to school in the morning.
good,"Not a very organized company, lots of work for little pay. Will start at minimum wage, management is lazy and babysitters. Training is poor and inadequate."
good,I didn't feel safe working there. More than once there were threats from the outside. Once there was someone that stated they would shoot up the entire store.
good,"Job is fun and easy. But hours are awful and it's not my bosses fault they hire to many people and expect everyone to be happy with 13 hours a week, it was more but they have cut way back.. I need more hours to support my family"
good,There just wasn't enough hours. A lot of favortisim in the work place. The co-workers were friendly and kind. I enjoyed meeting the different forms of customers that entered the store.
good,"Dollar tree was very busy, as a cashier you stay very busy standing in one spot, stocking was fast pace able to move around freely. Dollar tree would be a means of just an extra income, but not a main source of income."
good,"Dollar Tree is somewhere between a convenience store and a grocery store. Holidays are crazy busy, but the rest of the year is slow. Not a bad job, just boring at times."
good,"Dollar Tree is simultaneously easy to work and difficult at the same time.  With no planograms to set you must use your intellect to decide the best way to merchandise product on the spot.  However, you will always be shorthanded and overworked making the job more difficult than needs be.  Most stores are run down from lack of maintenance.  The people you work with, few though they may be, are what will make or break you with the company.  If you enjoy a high energy environment and wish to stay busy every minute you are working while only working a few hours a week, this is the job for you.  Most managers are extremely under trained for the job and the higher ups do not take the time to monitor the stores like needed.  Raises are almost nonexistent. However, you will enjoy many of your customers as they WILL come back on a daily basis and you get to know them. Over all, not a bad job, but one you need to be prepared for before starting."
good,Good for a high-schooler or as a second job. Hours were very inconsistent. Coworkers were friendly. Compensation was low. My specific manager was inattentive but has since left the company I believe.
good,working at dollar tree is very busy and lots of interaction with customers. fast paced almost chaotic environment at times. would not recommend working their as a seasonal employee
good,Assistant Managers need a better pay scale for the responsibilities they carry. Hours of operations are decent but difficult when employees call off work or don't show up.
good,"If you're in high school or college, this is a great place to work for some cash. It's fast-paced and you must be kind to the customers and help them with whatever they need. Hours aren't too long, but enough to get a younger person by."
good,Pay very low for the amount of profit they are making need To pay there employee more per hour than they do. People cannot make on thèse low wafer that they are paying
good,"Working at Dollar Tree has been fun but busy. As working as a cashier there I like to interact with the customers. The environment at the store is a little unorganized. I think the company needs to have more employees for each shift, it seems to me there is more work to be done, but not enough people to do the work."
good,Helping customers with there orders an helping find anything in the store organizing the shelves when needed management was great there been apart of the team was great it was always a geat day there great people.
good,"-started out as a regular employee"
good,A typical day at Dollar Tree is standing at a register and providing services to customers until the shift was over. I would also help people that were in need of knowing if we had a product in stock.
good,"Walk into the store, clock in and notify a manager. They would login you into the register and then if there were no clientele to cash out you'd ""run lanes"". Running lanes consists of returning unwanted items reorganzing stock as well as restocking. On days with truck deliveries you may be asked to work the truck and then man a register after. The only breaks were mandated 15 min breaks."
good,"Great place to work, hours are flexible. Just hope you have a good manager. I'm had a manager who was not good with people, customers would stay in my line because I was friendly, which the manager was rude, mean, and acted like they were bothering him.the day after we had a meeting I brought this up to the manager,how he was to customers and the next day my till was $5. Over and I was let go."
good,"Dollar Tree is an easy place to work, but don't expect to be able to make enough to live on or pay bills. The stores have a limited amount of hours based on sales, to be allocated among their work force however management sees fit. This keeps new hires low, and promotes favoritism as to who gets to work the hours. Management may make a reasonable amount of income, but I suspect it would still be extremely difficult to scrape by on unless you are a regional manager or something higher."
good,It's a really busy place to work. The pay rate is low. Not alot of hours. But overall it's not a bad place to work. I work overnight so I'm responsible for keeping the store stocked and cleaned. If I was a store manager I would be able to run the store with no problem. To be quite frank I love Dollar Tree as franchise but I personally see Dollar Tree from a different aspect because im now on the inside looking out.
good,I really enjoyed working at the dollar tree it was a fast paste environment. I was always doing something or at least there was always something to do which I didn't mind because it helped make the day go by smooth and fast.
good,It was fun but I really wasn’t feeling it nomore cause I was moving back to Chicago so I had to quit my job in Ohio but dollar tree is a fun job and easy.
good,It wasnt bad. I did some stuff I wasnt supposed to do in my job position to help others. The people were nice and friendly. The manager was a good man he was very friendly. They changed my schedule without informing me me a few times and i needed the money. I had no idea they had switched my days when im off work.
good,"a typical work day for me was as cashier I cashed out customers at the register and kept the registers and front area of the store clean and organized. I learned how to work the register, and how to close out tills with supervision of manager. the hardest part of the job is having a difficult or rude customer."
good,"I loved working for Dollar Tree because the customers where always nice and a lot of them were usual's. I was usually if not most likely register 1 (closest to the door). I would see every customer come in and greet them. It was nice catching up with regulars and and seeing them smile when they came in. As for duties, Checking customers out, bagging items and keeping the front face tidy was easy and satisfactory for me."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree started off good. However, they promised me hours but they didn't deliver on it. Overall, I was able to meet good people and service the community."
good,"I learned a lot about how important customer service is. I treated all of my customers with respect and dignity, including the customers that was in a bad mood for whatever reason. The hardest part of the job was when we didn't have what we needed to check our customers out properly such as, no bags, register tape, or helium for our balloon section."
good,great part time job for college students and retired personal.  Not a sufficient source of income as you will be started off at minimum wage if your are applying for a store associate.
good,"Basic an easy job, unloaded an organized boxes from the freight truck. The inventory room was a mess. Did not receive very many hours, usually got sent home early due to amount of employees. The hardest part of my job was not getting frustrated with the limited inventory space that the store had. Most enjoyable part of the job was that I got off work around 12 on a full shift."
good,"It’s a fun place to work, if you just want something to get you out of the house.  I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re a single mom trying to survive .  The hours aren’t to bad"
good,The big problem I had with the company was the lack of potential for growth and lack of hours. I was only really allowed to work 4 hours at a time and only 2-3 days a week.
good,"Everyone in this company work together well and positive. It was a comfortable and stress free place to work at, even when it was extremely busy. I would recommend this job to others if they want to work part-time."
good,The stress levels within the store is due to lack of employees. The pay isn't suitable for the cost of living. The people employed their are fun to be around though
good,"The first thing that I would do on the days that weren't truck day was vacuum the store. After that I would make sure all my inventory for my work station was loaded on to my cart for stocking. Then I would pull and rotate from oldest to new while stocking."
good,It has been too long ago to remember clearly so I unfortunately am unable to help you in this review. I can tell you the managers I had were like family and so were the cashiers.
good,"I like the job but they work you eat too hard for minimum pay.. "
good,It was an easy job and met some nice people with whom have gained friendship with. Pay was fair and hours were decent. I would more than likely recommend as high school job though.
good,"Job isnt too bad, just felt I never got recognized for the hard work I did. Only seemed to be reprimanded for what I didn't do. Also tends to be a bit hypocritical and will reprimand you for not putting a reciept on a product you buy before eating it then turning around and not putting a receipt on what they bought. just doesnt make sense."
good,working there was fun. they people that i worked with really cared for their job and i loved working with them. the management part of dollar tree was okay. they changed rules very frequently and not really a good set up for power placement.
good,Hardest part of the job is not having enough staff and help at times. The wonderful part of the job is customers and some staff members. Depending in which Dollar Tree you work at some Managers can be very selfish.
good,I had alot of troubles with the manager there. She was rude and harsh to a few of the employees (other than myself) there. I started with 5 shifts a week and suddenly went down to one or two shifts a week. While newer employees were making more hours and advancing to management positions.
good,They tend to have a very high turn over rate.  Not good to get too comfortable working there as they can terminate you for any reason. The employees were very to themselves and anti social.
good,"The pay is lousy, the hours are long for management, and they dropped the ball when asked to keep my job and transfer home. I enjoyed my job but the money isn't there to keep great help. They seem very uninterested in long term employee."
good,"They used to be family oriented and the workload used to be manageable week to week. Now they mandate even when you can take paid vacation, and the workload cant be kept up with-you have to prioritize what can wait amd what can't. Upper mgmt emails are negative and demanding with threats of write up etc. Pay is minimum wage to start and the once a year raises are limited to 20 to 30 cents per hour."
good,The manager talked down on customers and employees everyday. Not many people liked her including the customers. Everyday she would pick fights with empmoyees.
good,It was ok at first started as a cashier and within a couple of months became part time manager learned enough to get by due to improper training then not to long after that I became Assistant Manager and still they didnt train me for all the duties that came with that role they never followed the rules and only did so when it suited them but I am glad to have had the opportunity to be with the company and learn everything that i did while with them
good,"Im a asst manager and was promoted just for the Christmas season for 2017 and was never demoted  back down to a cashier, I currently help run shifts in 2 stores and  i have filled in  several other. I've learned  how to open and close down the store, complete all closing  and opening procedures and  unload  the stores, frozen truck, and do the  ordering and unload the other  truck. the one store i work for  has a great store manager , the store I'm assigned to  currently has no store manager. The part of the job i hate is knowing i do more  work then the part time asst manager in one of the store and I'm  under  paid . Between both store i work  almost  38- 40 hour.The best part of the job i love is meeting new people ,working with the public, and seeing the kids  come in . i love retail, i love being around people. I love to interact with people."
good,It was very unorganized but there was a lot of work that was able to get done. The managers weren't really trained to deal with certain things. I learned every department
good,In order for DT to prevent unnessessary turnover they need to go up on pay to those who work and give more hrs to associates especially stockers to get freight out
good,"Cashiers are very very busy, most of the time is spent checking out customers, we are supposed to put out stock as well but most of the time that Is not possible everyday due to customer volume."
good,"management dropped me from the computer when i was on medical leave and refused to let me have any hours once the doctor let me go back to work. i didnt get hurt at work i had to have surgery,being that it is just dollartree noone would help me with this so its time to find a new job.before my medical leave they offered me management training.never actually made me a manager even tho i was doing the managers work."
good,"It was a descent place to work, more for teens who just need extra cash. It is not for someone trying to make a living for their family, but it was a descent job."
good,"While I am cognoscente my experience with Dollar Tree was mildly unique, the store I worked for lacked floor space to effectively function. This disadvantage trickled down blame unto the stockers."
good,"I worked for dollar tree for 2 years, at first they gave me almost 40 hours a week. It was great the managers liked me, I did my job, I showed up when no one else would. About a year and a half into working here my manager transferred to another store to help turn it around and the new manager only gave me 4-12 hours a week. It was not enough for me to live on. I don't know why the new manager cut my hours. They hired a bunch of new people and gave them the hours instead."
good,"Dollar tree is a starting experience opportunity, they could be more than just a numbers company one person means more than various numbers of employees, these values lead to more than can be imagined, and fewer lost then they plan or expect for. companies these days fail to have a crew who looks for those diamonds in a rough that nobody really looks for or recognizes and not taking them serious automatically loses that person will to love the company as thier own, imagine wawa it's to a point where you have to know somebody to get in, and people are fighting to get in with incentives they offer that other companies barley offer to higher management, thus you can grab 5 great people instead of 1 in a million, they are quick to point a finger at the lowest level employee because the higher ups are to busy pushing a dream which can make a company beautiful and great throughout time but while writing and assuming they are being followed without the hours and manpower needed for it to carry thru the correct way they forget to show it and give it to the people with a why and a explanation on why it's something that gives all a benefit even if for just the company he who values his job will except with open arms. why is it worth saving your job or losing a invaluable person to prove a point that higher positions dont have ties nor experience with those who actually create their ideas and make them possible those same ideas that those employees probably already created and enforced but will get no credit nor be excepted if that higher up has something to lose, who can do it better"
good,"There were days it was fast and days slow, I worked with good, kind,selfish and spontaneous employees. I've learned to work with prejudiced and to bite my tongue. I just do my best as I could. The hardest part of the job was not working enough hours."
good,"Working at dollar tree was difficult sometimes because of flexibility with hours and other employees quitting, managers calling last minute to ask if you can come in and work."
good,"I like the employees and the customers in that area. By the store has went down and hours are not good anymore im trying to find a second job now because this job is not enough for my living situation although i am blessed to have a job ,but need a better opportunity."
good,When the time comes to unload the truck we are not allowed to clock in until the first box role out the truck. We still get there and set up before that so it is not fair. We are waisting our time amd we are working off the clock until the first box comes out!
good,"I loved working for the Dollar Tree company. The store I worked for was full of friendly faces and hard workers. I do feel as though the company itself has a hard time holding onto the good help at some of the locations I have visited. Some of the locations I have visited I have found my experience with the cashiers and management VERY unpleasant. I do think the company and management should really focus on making sure the associates they hire are being helpful, respectful and fulfilling their job requirements. "
good,"The Job is easy and managers are understanding. No Room to advance tho."
good,Very stressful work environment and the pay was very minimal. Every night only the bare minimum of employees were scheduled so you were expected to do the job that normally would take three bodies to do.
good,"Great for a high school student, not enough for living off of at all. Management was good but it's very annoying shilling things to customers and having to stock and cashier at the same time at all times"
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is usually run your aisle, take care of your customers, and clean the store. What I've learned while being at Dollar Tree is how to work a cash register faster, how to count and weigh money. The management is... difficult. She's a tough one to work with. The work place culture is open, and the hardest part of the job is when the story is busy and you feel as though you have to do everything at once. The most enjoyable part?? Short hours and several days off, except that blows when bills are due and you are broke."
good,Too many managers giving conflicting directions (at all levels.)  Terrible retention rates.  Little training.  Great customers.  Close to home.  Not a career oportunity.
good,had a great time with the company enjoyed my job.great leader ship easy place to work just not easy as I thought to advance in the company as a cashier.
good,Well stocked and good variety. People are good to work with. Time goes fast as you stay constamtly busy amd there is always something to do to keep you busy
good,If you want a part time job or to just be a assistant Manager then that's great. However if you want to advance in the big picture be warned.
good,"Greeting customers "
good,"It isn't the best place to work, but it isn't the worst either. I didn't like all of the management that worked there or in the district, but then again where do you work that you like everyone? Anyway, it was a stepping stone in my work history."
good,Retail is a very busy. I enjoyed being able to assist customers and helping out my employees. Greeting customers to walking them to items that they were inquiring about. Answering questions or helping with any concerns that customers/employees might have to make sure that they all felt important. I enjoyed assisting my employees with work tasks to help create a friendly work place and to show that I am here to support them.
good,They usually have 1 employee running back and forth between managing inventory and cashiering. It was more hectic compared to working in other stores.
good,"At dollar tree I was a cashier, I would cash people out clean up around the front, put things back in the right aisles, wipe down the cash registers, filled up balloons, sweeping the whole store when closing."
good,Was a fun place to work. Only good to work at if you just want part time. Not aloud anymore than 20 hours or less a week. Good place to be your first job. Teaches you a lot about working with the public.
good,"I am the night assistant Manager at the Dollar Tree.  I manage the day to day operations. Managing associates, handle money, do the deposit.  Do all recovery and go backs, sweep and mop.  I maintain damage's, mark downs and mark ups on items. Cashout the associates.  Do till audits and deposits before I close the store at 9:30pm."
good,"The work isn't terrible, but you won't be getting more than 15 hours unless you are salary (manager) and the extra work isn't worth the pay. Good as a part time job but not for long term growth or improvement."
good,It was a easy relaxing job but thee pay wasnt not enough to take care of home. Rhe store wasnt organized and the schedule wasnt that great. But. I loved my co workers
good,Dollar tree is not the best company to work for but you make the best of it. Very high turn over rate and lots of drama. Do not recommend for someone looking for a nice easy going job.
good,I got along with all of my co-workers and enjoyed working there. The only thing is the money is not enough and they do no want you working full time. The scheduling was also off.
good,"Dollar Tree is a job for a high school student, or someone retired. The hours are assigned according to the sales of the store. Cooperate send an email about how much money is in the payroll account. That is how the manager delegates work hours to the employees. In in my opinion the store on Wayne Ave, in Dayton, Ohio The manager shows a lot of favoritism."
good,"This job is ok for student, young teens and people looking to do something in their spare time. If you are looking for overtime or more money, this isn't the job for you."
good,"Built more experience in scheduling shifts,deposits,daily reports,manage inventory, problem solving and direct orders.Hardest part was truck delivery."
good,"Dollar tree is short staffed always, that is how the prices are kept low. Long lines during busy hours because of short staffing. The positive is that customers do get great bargains based on a dollar."
good,"The scheduled hours are wacky"
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of me working the register, and occassionaly stock the shelves. Some days were the opposite. I learned how to use a register, how to count a register and a safe, how to close up retail, and how to stock retail. The management was well trained, easy to talk to, and had excellent customer service. The job wasnt too difficult, the hardest part was probaly just the stadnig on your feet all day."
good,"I like the work but I need more pay. Being a 20yr old with my own place I cannot survive on minimum wage. Other than that. The people are nice, it's easy and relaxing work."
good,"I enjoyed my assistant manager position relocated to a new store with a new manager, with the best team, cleanest store I was proud to work there.  Very fast paced and always on the go made the day or night go by. Loved my job."
good,"There is only one person at register at a time. You have to stock shelves when you're not checking people out at the register. It's fast paced and gets very busy, but only one employee on the floor besides a manager."
good,"Depending on the location where you work, the work environment is fast-paced and friendly. This job is great at developing customer service experience and learning how to multi-task."
good,The job had many opportunities to meet and work with people. it was a fast pace to get the trucks unloaded and out on the sales floor for customers. You had to greet customers and treat them with respect. You have to balance your duties along with helping others. Being able to count money back and how to handle and respond to certain customers needs. It was an over all good place to work.
good,Fast paced environment. Diverse company. Hard for advancement. Pay is minimal. Hours are flexible . Depending on location hours also may vary. Good company to start work with. Gives you an opening into retail world
good,"It was a decent place to work the people were easy to get along with ,Didn't learn much,already knew how to run the register. The managers were easy to work with. nothing was hard about the job to me and I liked fixing the shelves with the new merchandise that came in."
good,"OK working environment. Very stressful operations. Very hard to find a good solid worker for 7.25 hr. Way too much freight gets delivered every week, and very few hours to work with."
good,A lot of work for the amount of employees they have on a shift at one time. Management was not that great & the breaks you receive were basically nonexistent
good,I really enjoyed working at the location i worked. The managment is on top of everything. If i ever needed help they were always quick to help out and teach me everything i needed to know to have a smooth work day.
good,"come into work , clock in , start ringing customers up , very nice and respectful , manager comes with her attitude shes disrespectful to customers and her employees"
good,"if you're young and looking for a first time job, this is it. cashier, light stock, some cleaning, laid back atmosphere. the hours were short each day, closes pretty early. perfect for high schooler or retiree looking for extra money."
good,Poorly managed facility. Could be a fun place to work if management took more control. Having to do other employees work was not exactly what I signed up for.
good,This is by far the worst pay for what you are responsible for. Ran the store for 10 months while they were hiring a new store manager and got ZERO compensation!!
good,"Barely any hours, not a whole lot of customers to wait on. break room is very small. backroom is not organized. registers are slow or the buttons are hard to use."
good,"Starting at minimum wage and only getting a 7% increase once per year means that no one is going to make much money at dollar tree, but the job is not difficult at all and the hours can be flexible."
good,Has its slow times and fast paced spurts. Being a cashier and on freight crew I tended to stay pretty busy. Just wasn't enough money or hours for what I needed.
good,"This job is if you are looking for a part time job; if you are already employed full time somewhere else, A student, or just a senior wanting extra hours. The most hours you get a day is 5 hours. The job was easy you have to be fast at the register."
good,"you show yourself what you can achieve by self motivation."
good,"The work place was very normal, regular and new customers on a daily basis. Some decent co-workers some very lazy. Management was horrible though, no doubt. The job was not hard at all easy to adapt to, but the craziness gets old after awhile."
good,"There's not enough hours each week to really do anything with! But, it's a good job for those needing a second income or for someone who's married and has help with their bills. When I first started I got 21 hours a week in, not the case anymore. "
good,"this company is a good place to work for but it lacks training , disorganized , dirty, and the pay is very low ....no recongnitioin for your good work ."
good,"management was poor, not the hardest job to do as long as you show up to work and do the manger duties ask of you. i enjoyed having the customers and some employees."
good,"working at dollar tree, is different...the people u meet can make ur day or mess ur day up. I learned how to dill with different people on a day to day. management is cool, but its hard to find a manager to stay. the hardiest part of the job is unloading the truck at 3:30am in the morning. the enjoyment of the job is to see people happy."
good,"Dollar tree is a laid back store, you do not get many hours, no overtime, no vacation, health or any other benefits unless you are the store manager. this is an easy job, lots of standing. I think if they  gave more pay and hours they would not have such a big turn over. I love working there but the pay is so low I cant afford to live off what I make."
good,I believe that if they had less part time hours they would get more people that want to be a team player. In having part time hours people do not wish to do the job as they are supposed to. I work part time and do full time work and don't believe that is fair for me to be working my butt off and only get 25 hours a week. I like the job because I am always busy doing something.
good,"I liked working at the dollar tree. My manager was the best. The customers were nice,and they would always say how clean our store was. It sometimes was difficult to go and stock product and then stop what your doing to run to the register to check out customers. I guess I rather just  stocked all day or run the register. And you only got one break during your shift,it was  only ten minutes. Very unfair in my eyes."
good,I loved working there because of the different customers I served. The hardest part was Holidays. So many customers. You have to be a people person to work there.The managers are readily available to help the cashiers needs.
good,Very busy store. Needs more workers. Like working at this store. Only hire for part-time employees. Overtime is always giving to employees. Must work fast.
good,"promising company"
good,Dollar tree is a fun experience when working with other co workers. The pay is the worst part about the job. $8.45 is not helping to pay bills at all for college students. The dollar tree i worked in was very unorganized and was not really that flexible. You also do not receive any sort of discount considering you are working at a dollar store.
good,"Everyone is nice and relaxed but the pay isn't good enough for someone who is trying to pay for college and the day always goes by slow especially when it's during the week but it gets busy at random times of the day, most enjoyable part was the customers because they were usually really sweet and stocking because you were organizing but the hardest part was standing for long periods of time"
good,Cool place to work pay not good but nice place to work they work with your schedule job real easy moderate speed customers and nice management are alright
good,The first year and a half I loved my job. The crew was amazing and everyone put in their fair share of work then new management took over and everything fell apart.
good,"It's an okay job, good for young people. They don't pay enough. I was just thrown in the register, no help. My managers weren't helpful. I had to figure it out in my own."
good,need more than 14 hours a week but they are friendly to work for plenty of business big big frozen food se ction need better training on the registers
good,"this was my second job at that time, and it was fun in the beginning. it was fast paced. but I did enjoy it. I like speaking to all types of people even though its for a short period of time. but I did have fun while I was there."
good,I love my job and what I do....I just wish dollar tree paid their employees better and showed they cared about employees better. Longer shifts instead of just 5 hour shifts.
good,"The store that i work at does very well. We are always super busy and have to move fast. I don't mind that. Overall, I would say it's a relatively simple job. I cashier for the most part, but sometimes will stock and recover the store."
good,I began to dislike the managers because they seemed to talk disrespectful in Spanish and continued to neglect their dutys. They put themselves on a higher pedi stole.
good,I typical day at work would be to get the task done of what is asked to be done. I have learned a lot on stocking shelves and running registrar. The management is good they know what is to be done in the store at all times. The hardest part of the job is when you get very upset customers and you have to calmly talk with them and help with their issue that they may have. the most enjoyable day is knowing most of your customers and them being regular customers that come in.
good,Great place to work and everything is a dollar. It can get pretty busy so work on production of bagging. Unless your retired or 16 years old you cannot make a decent salary
good,"Most of the management is great, but the pay sucks."
good,Dollar tree is a great area to start as your first job. It was a solid job to maintain as long as you did the work correctly and succeeded in sales. It was fun
good,The hours can be awfully inconsistent at times. I've learned how to hold on to a job and have been thankful for being kept at a job. I now know what it feels like to hold onto a job. The management (specifically the store manger) can be very forgetful at times.
good,it was an ok place to work. the crew I worked with was nice. Management wasn't I\the best. but it was an ok  job. I would work there again. just a diffren one
good,"It's hard work for little money! It makes me want to quit.  But Im staying around for the little money,  but I kno I can get a better paying job! I would recommend dollar tree to anyone"
good,Management is excellent. Store is clean. Employees worlk well as a team and individually. Employees priority is the customer. Each employment is treated equally.
good,I enjoy working on Mondays when I am able to work closely with our special needs employee. I love seeing her work and enjoy my conversations with her.
good,"worked four to five hours a day three to four times a week. i learned how to be a cashier vacuum clean stock and friendly customer  service. The manager was nice but he would hire more people instead of giving the employees he already have more hours They hire all kinds of cultures. The hardest part of the job is not enough hours. the most enjoyable part is the staff, and customers.."
good,"I enjoyed working here on most days.  My co workers and managers were awesome, but everyone was underpaid and underappreciated by the higher ups.  The customers left the place in shambles and we were not appreciated for the work we did to keep the place as clean as possible for customers."
good,"Estar pendiente a los demás empleados y sacar mercancía a la venta y darle un buen servicio al cliente"
good,Every location is different but for me the experience I got with working with Dollar tree I would say its a learning experience. The hours were never guaranteed and the starting rate of pay was horrible.
good,Its a fun place to work if you want it as a second job or to have something to do. It doesn't pay enough to pay bills or anything. You deal with a lot of rude customers and have to know a lot for such little pay.
good,Being unable to work more hours is extremely frustrating and because I am not in a full-time position they cannot offer me benefits or any type of healthcare coverage. My body aches at the end of the day and I do not feel compensated for a job very well done!
good,"A work day could range from 4 to 5 hours in one shift, in total; 15 to 20 hours a week, depending if shipment is fully stocked. Within those 4 to 5 hour shift, employees have 1 to 4 full u-boats of merchandise to stock shelves. I usually packed away 100 boxes, depending how stocked my section was. Not only do I pack away merchandise, but stocking shelves require quick thinking to organize and maintain safety as well as keeping the floor and the backroom clean. So, I learned different ways to organize, built positive, professional relationships, maintained a safe and clean environment, provided excellent customer service, and completed multiple tasks in a timely fashion. The environment of Dollar Tree was a friendly/professional manner. Other employees and customers were kind. Management did their best to keep a friendly, yet professional environment while still providing employees with decent service and excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bailer. The bailer requires a lot time where I only have 4 to 5 hours to pack away 2 to 3 u-boats, clean, and finish the bailer. However, I learned to complete all these tasks in a timely fashion with little to no problems. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my pallet barely has any merchandise, that way I know I was working extremely hard to make sure most of the packages are stocked on the shelves."
good,"The management team lacked in skills to help the rest of the team in everyday tasks, such as inventory, stocking shelves. Etc.I loved the job, just the manager wasn't a very organized and respectable person to work for. The company overall wasn't for me. I would like to have job security and benefits for me and my family."
good,"To keep it simple, I would've loved to grow with a company i grew up on. However, the company within itself is just too much in flux. I could not commit being that I felt I was not being committed to. The constant flow of customers needs to be met with the proper amount of associates."
good,"-On register all day"
good,Dollar tree is a stressful job that will take a tole on your life.  It's a job for someone who doesn't have kids and can work any hours.  Bein part of the manager team was very stressful and long hours.  U have to b able to work hours when someone calls in or stay over whenever someone calls out
good,"Working at dollar tree can be whatever you make of it. One task every day, slow work with little to no advancement opportunities. the hardest part of the job is dealing with in-the-way customers."
good,"It's a fair work environment, however, with and $8.50 wage and less than 20 hours per week, you don't really make much. So, it's just kind of so so in terms of job quality."
good,"its a relaxed place to work, work life balance, good for students who want to work a part time job the managers are nice and make you feel comfortable."
good,"Balloon orders, working freight daily, getting ready for seasonal sets, basic customer service. Hardest part of the job was unloading truck, sometimes only had 2 people unloading."
good,"Typical day at work, visiting 2.5 stores a day. Following up on daily operations task for execution and coaching/planning for upcoming events. I learn that a stores  with out seasonal team can willy create a lot of opportunities that will required your hands on attention immediately. Management team that work inside the store are challenge each day to complete 90% of the task, This could be a stretch major the time. Considering the resources that budget for the store each day. Workplace culture: Associates or typically frustrate do to abundant of tasks to be complete within there assign duties or lack of resources. Hardest part of the job: Hiring talent individuals to come on board considering the daily challenges  vs rate of pay that was offer to candidates that was approving to be successful  at what they do from previous employment (You get what you pay for). The enjoyable part of the job. If you enjoy helping people to move forward to do more with less. Then you will enjoy this challenge."
good,while my immediate higher above me in the logistics department was a very nice and level headed man the overall store manager however had some sort of issue with the logistics department. we would come in early to clean the entire back room organize the surplus of products and stack them neatly and as far back as possible while making them accessible and as soon as the store manager would get in she would head directly to the store room and knock as much stuff as she could over and make a huge mess and say it was on us to clean it up.
good,I started with the company with a guarantee for advancement.  Unfortunately that never happened.  Long days and undertrained management make for a very hard company to work for.
good,it can be stressful and busy. there are days  it gets rough when hours get cut and then you don't have the staff you need when it gets busy. long hours with no over time.
good,Management is very unpleasant and enjoys tormenting the hourly workforce. Operations does not care about their employees nor do they care about improving the working environment. Very disappointed with my experience at the dollar tree.
good,Normal and basic warehouse work. Fast pace and up and down work loads. Out dated tools and system for everyday job duties indivually and building wide. Up and comming company for sure.
good,"Greet our customers in a respectful manner as they enter our store."
good,"This was my job when I was in high school. I enjoyed my assistant mangers more over my store manager. I worked for this company for 5 years and had 6 different store managers. I was in charged of counting tills, opening the store and closing the store with my manager. This includes: recovery of store, counting all tills, and cleaning the regestiers. Management was poor and people didn't take their job seriously. Unfortunately I would have to pick up the slack of other coworkers. And the pay raises were not fairly distributed."
good,"Little pay,no advancement,company is greedy they make easily 5,000 dollars a day and only pay there hard working employees 7.25/hr plus they want you to unload a truck and they keep all of thier workers under 20 hours a week"
good,"started off good, given the hours I wanted and then hours were cut and hired new employees. didn't make sense because I was told what a great job I was doing and I was the only cashier doing my job and extra. I do miss a few of my co-workers, fun people to work with."
good,Dollar tree was a great job to start off with! It isn't as stressful as most but still has its moments. I loved the managers I worked with and all of our customers!
good,"A typical day includes: Loading and unloading boxes from trucks, stocking merchandise, and interacting with customers."
good,I worked here for the Christmas holiday and I never knew that in a dollar store that you could spend as much money as people did. I learned a dollar can go a long way depending on the store. Management acted very nonchalantly when it came to business. They didn't seem to care but I didn't have that effect my work I picked up the slack and kept it pushing. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck every Saturday by myself. Most enjoyable part was the dollar candy that we had that is $3.50 in the movie theathers
good,"A typical day at work depending if i would come in the morning, noon, or night. the morning was my favorite time to come in because   we are just opening up and it's not too busy where you cant do your required work. I would count a register start cleaning the windows and around the register area. Iv'e learned to do inventory, about freight, how to set up isles and arrange the placement of stock. The workplace was nice. it would be pretty slow at times which tends to get boring but all in all was a great workplace environment. Management at the time was all over the place. We kept getting new managers. The hardest part of the job was just trying to maintain the Stock. keep it clean I would clean up and by the next hour it would be messy."
good,"the store where im located has a very high turn-over right now-it's only been up for one year and a month. due to this factor, there isn't a balance between life and work at this time. it's easy to move up, but you have to be ready to really work. the people in position makes the job ""look"" easy. a typical day is too much to type. low pay"
good,If anyone is looking for a not so demanding part time job this is it. Easy to advance to assistant manger or relocate. The company is smaller than the larger retailers so hours depend on sales. Job overall was easy and not bad at all.
good,"Overall a good company . Very quick paced environment. Must be an extremely fast  , organized and self motivated person to work here. Definitely not enough hours in a day to accomplish thing that need to be taken care of...must be people friendly and able to adjust to many different walks of life..."
good,A typical day on the job requires a lot of stock. It's almost non stop. You're also required to run the register while pushing freight in most cases. I have learned some things. I've learned how to be a better leader. I've also learned how to approach employee misconduct in a better manner. The management team at my particular store are all fairly new to the company. The hardest part about my job is trying to control shrink (theft). What i do like about my job is the experience I'm getting. This is actually my first retail job and i was hired in as management.
good,typical day is normally not a busy day. I've learned to better stock shelves on the safety of others. Management needs to be worked on. The hardest part of my job not being able to get enough hours!
good,"I learned a lot of retail experience, i  had the opportunity to do 3 store sets from a empty room to a fully working store in  a week, The work place was extremely toxic and they did not follow proper workplace rules"
good,"I enjoyed working with public,some days see same faces &others new ones.Staff& management worked together as a team.there was always something to do &keep busy"
good,"Not a lot of direction.  Just basically tell you what you are expected to do and let you figure the rest out.  There is training when you begin, but none of the management sticks to it."
good,"Good for a first time job, not much else. Minimum wage for cashiers. My experience has been OK, but it is just a temporary job. High turnover rate. Sometimes people just don't show up to work."
good,"it was a very fast paced job always had something to do. I had lots of hours. Had a lot of familys coming in and you could relate with their needs and help them, they gave you tips to living and you gave them tips and recipes."
good,This company is a fun place to start out just nothing to try to grow into or start a life on i feel as if the pay is small and they are really harsh on the hours your allowed to work.
good,Worked here wile going to college. The shifts are 5 hours long. You will meet a lot of amazing people and become friends. Store is open every holiday except Christmas.
good,Not many hours but good enough place to work if necsarry to have employment...I would not recommend this job placement for long term employment no benifits
good,"everything is always chaos, nothing every makes sense. upper management sucks so much and never know what they are doing. nothing is organized and everything is just shoved places"
good,"Management is nice at first, but doesn't seem to be very understanding when someone is sick, or have a health issue come up. Otherwise, it's a fast paced job, if you're a people person it's fine."
good,I will forever be grateful for my job at Dollar Tree. It gave me the confidence to manage people and to really hone my customer service skills.
good,"Scheduling is fairly rigid, but the hours are good (if you're only looking for a temporary job) The pay is decent. The work is tough. You will lose weight at this job. The job culture is a bit foreboding; the general atmosphere is that of a mill that pumps in large numbers of new employees to replace the recently burned-out ones."
good,Good environment to work in it is always busy so time goes by fast. What I learned from this job was responsibility especially if this is your first job.
good,"its usually pretty busy as a cashier. when not busy, i clean the front, put things away and make sure the front end is stocked. the hardest part of the job is dealing with certain customers."
good,I just clocked in worked and clocked out part time job wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing I guess these kind of jobs are what you make them
good,I enjoyed working there just kinda needed the extra hours. But it is a good side job for the especially around the holidays.
good,Some managers get hired because they know someone and they feel they have upper hand.  I think to get a manager position you should be experienced and educated in that position first.
good,"Pace of job is great. Management is helpful, mostly. Co-workers are fine people. Right before Christmas, expect hours and to be busy! After Christmas, hours are lousy. Pay is slightly above minimum wage for cashiers. Do not depend on promises made!"
good,"A typical day at dollar tree includes cashiering, light cleaning such as sweeping, dusting and bathroom cleaning. I also recovered the store and cleaned windows"
good,i've been with the company so long that i notice dramatic changes. this company has its ups and down but lately its been more downs. the people there have no boundaries on leaving personal problems home and regardless how much work you do the glory and praise goes to someone over you
good,"This was my second foray into retail.  I always knew what the job expectations were and strove to meet those expectations.  I also knew that there would be no place for upward movement in this company, but didn't mind because it was a paycheck and a chance to work with the public."
good,The employees were easy to get along with. Not much room for advancement unless you were to stay for years. The boss was nice and understanding. Fairly decent place to work if you enjoy reorganizing.
good,"- During the holidays we were usually busy. Steady during other days."
good,"1. Location is everything- If you are working at an older store that has fallen between the cracks, GOOD LUCK.... corporate will forget you exist"
good,"Dollar Tree was my first job and I didnt enjoy it as much. My manager didnt have me on a fit schedule and I had to quit because at the time, my transportation was not guaranteed. But Dollar Tree is an awesome store. They had everything well organized. The customer service is kind, generous and helpful. They assist does who need assistance."
good,My coworkers were nice and my manager would drop me off at home at night. I wish that they'd have more than two people closing at night and some security.
good,The job was great however the manager was doing some unethical stuff that I did not approve of.  Needless to say that manager is no longer employees with Dollar Tree.
good,"They are a nasty company well at least where I've work the manager is a pervert ,he tries to be sneaky with scheduling you,he doesn't keep the place clean , everything be expired"
good,good job I only worked there for seasonal work I enjoyed the work environment and the management  I enjoyed working with people in person and using my in person customer service experience
good,Depending on which store your at and how your store manager is this can make or break your experience with this company. Some managers take care of their people while others just run them in the ground. The politics is horrible and you either are liked and move up then get stuck as an assistant manager with no room for growth or pay raises or you get stuck as a cashier expected to give your life to the company. No work/life balance with this company. They only care about making their money.
good,Due to the starting wages to work for this company; it is extremely difficult to get dependable employees that care.  The company is very lax on the type of workforce that they hire to work in their stores.  If the starting pay was competitive with other retail stores; it would definitely increase job productivity and sales.
good,"i would do over night shift , and day shift. i learned that the stocker room can get very crowed quickly and some of my team members can be a big help or not buts its all just a really easy job"
good,"During my time there I was continuously understaffed, being given a number of tasks that I was glad to undertake. My subordinates were excited when they worked with me, because they knew I would ""Get the job done right"". I loved being able to manage over people who appreciated my dedication. The one thing that I could not approve of, is the unfair treatment of myself as well as a few other employees as well as the inability of management to provide us the essential requirements to properly perform our duties."
good,"Dollar tree offers no benefits, a lot of work for little pay, no hours given,  but everyone is like family gets along great, all try to do stuff and get things done, we all fight for better ways."
good,"It takes team work to have a good day at work and good listening skills are needed, the hardest thing to do is to rearrange goods that someone put in the wrong place.  It is a fast paced job at times, it is enjoyable when we are buzy and people are not having bad days.  Management has alot on their plates."
good,I was hired as a cashier and I developed my basic skills in retail store from Dollar Tree. I worked hard and diligently but my pay never increased. They need to pay more
good,"A day at the Dollar Tree can be very eventful but also fun and "
good,"I enjoy the people at Dollar Tree. But I feel  The Corp cares much for its employees. Our store went without indoor plumbing for 8 months before our restrooms were fixed. We had to go outside the store to use Porta Potties in winter!!!"
good,Basically responsible for customer service an stocking in between checking customers out. Easy job but hours are part time an vary a lot.
good,"Dollar Tree is a very interesting work place. I strongly believe they need to improve many points in the workplace, such as management, organization, security. It's a rather rough area where I live, so working there is no different. "
good,Wages are horrible. Supervisor is immature at the age of 20. Has her friends come in and stand around. Refuses to put stuff away even when she walks right by it. Will instead bring it all the way to cashier to put away.
good,"I learned to till the cash registers, good coworkers not to hard of a job with great understanding. Could Not do the 30 day work period thing before hire though."
good,"5 hour work shifts "
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers. The energy at the store was off. The management and co-workers seemed to be sort of ""cliqued"" up. The hardest part was staying positive in negative energy. The enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"I was not trained on how to be an assistant manager because the store manager that hired me quit the day after I was hired. The entire time I worked there, I had no store manager, no one to officially train me, no one to do any of the online training material, and no one to go over my assistant manager's training workbook with me. The associates were extremely reluctant to do what they were told and were prone to calling out of work. The other assistant managers helped me as best they could, but the one who made the schedules began completely ignoring the availability I provided, which forced me to leave the company."
good,It is very hard on the body. You are in one of three departments and are always moving. No matter what if you stop you could get a talking to by management and possibly loss of job.
good,"My boss had a hard time finding good employees, which lead to double work and low oral. He gave it a good try but the was out of hand before we got there. The crew that showed up was very friendly and hard working."
good,The work environment was friendly. Customers were nice. I learned how to manage multiple tasks in a very small amount of time aka micro management.
good,"Dollar Tree wasnt a bad place to work, it was fun, but there was too much drama. It would be between the associates and managers. It caused for a very high turnover rate. The drama rolled over to the performance of the job as well. Overall, its manageable and you will love the regular customers."
good,"I enjoy working for Dollar Tree, meeting the customers with encouraging words to me, and I to them."
good,"I log in, see manager for what im working on that day, get started take a break and finish my work. if I finished early I helped someone else get their job done"
good,"it was a decent place to work at , good people easy work , customers made it enjoyable , I got a lot of cash and money handling experience as well as working with the public."
good,"Interaction with customers, register/cash handling, stocking, price checks, typical retail duties. I bettered my math skills. Management was good, attentive to detail and considerate to their employees. Co-workers, not so much. Bad attitudes followed with lots of whining. Hardest part of the job was angry customers who didnt understand policies or returns. Best part was constantly being busy made work days go by fast and kept me from looking at the clock."
good,"Hard labor"
good,"While I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, I think that the company could definitely use improvement as far as the work environment."
good,"There is no hard part of the job, I learn everything fast, I go to work and when not busy I do stocking and cleaning. My main manger is not very organized, but one of my mangers is completely great. She picks up the slack of all the others. I learn a lot from her. I enjoy working with her because we get the supplies out and store cleaned on top of taking care of our shoppers!"
good,"Under current management schedules are inconsistent, leading to low moral. Under current management priorities are inconsistent, hours fluctuate, trying to fluctuate with these conditions adds stress where there usually wasn't under previous management."
good,Overall alright place. Could always use improvements. Great place to work while going to school because management is  really good with working with your schedule to accommodate you and your needs.
good,The people are grate but the way the company ( corp ) works / operates is not the best. They cut hours for no reason. They force out unnecessary work.
good,Usually always on your toes when cashier because theres always customers since it is a dollar store. I learned how to cope with fast paste environments very well. All the co-workers are friendly and nice  especially the head manager.
good,"Working for Dollar Tree is a life changing experience, I learned how to make executive decision that benefit not only me but the store as a whole. The hardest part of my Job is not working as a team but against the grain, my co workers take pride in there work and care for the store. My most enjoyable part of my job is getting all my task done plus more."
good,"Cashier job with simple tasks and friendly customers. "
good,"•	Recognized by Manager for consistently maintaining accurate cash register count "
good,"One of three Assistant Managers, worked closely with Store Manager. Duties include: the opening and closing of the store, daily cash reconciliation (register operation), daily office work (reports and scheduling), unloading warehouse trucks, exceptional customer service and stocking shelves. Helping vendors to place proper orders for our store (ordering). I also oversee average of 15 employees."
good,"When I first started working at Dollar Tree, we were opening the new store, which meant loads of hours. It was a lot of manual labor with heavy boxes and shelves that didn't always cooperate, but you were always busy doing something. Never a dull moment. Then the store opened and the hours took a nose-dive. Only scheduled for 3 shifts a week (3 and a half hour shifts at the most) and they would call me and tell me that 2 of my 3 shifts were cancelled. Or they wouldn't even bother calling me and I show up (after a 30 minute drive) just to be told to go home because my shift had been cancelled. When I did work, it was rather enjoyable though. There were a lot of regular customers who would recognize me and were all very nice people. The rest of the employees were very kind as well, and always had very positive attitudes."
good,"I worked every position in this store. I was a cashier, did recovery throughout the store, freight in the back and some management things here and there. I worked great with my co-workers and assistant managers but the general manager wasn't very good. A lot of the time she left me on a register by myself with huge lines and would just sit in the office talking to someone on the phone about something non work related. She was also very rude when talking to any/all employees and never gave anyone respect. I had never felt so bad about going to work before."
good,"I did not like this job, the managers never knew what to do . The store was always dirty . I would come on time and the manager would never be ready to open my register ."
good,"It's good for entry level into the retail business as a start, because some things they do are way different than the way a place like Walmart does things. Ex: stocking. "
good,"From the time i got there ,it was busy till i went home."
good,"Dollar Tree is overall a poorly run company. No hours for it's employees, which in turn leaves the store looking messy and shelves empty. They are flexible with days and times you can work, which is one positive thing about working there."
good,"Little to know payroll for employees.  If you want to succeed in your numbers consistently, you have to work a lot of hours with little to know time away from work."
good,Very first time working in a warehouse retail environment it was a very interesting working experience each day provided it's own unique task very thankful for the employment opportunity.
good,I had to stock groceries and put up merchandise. I would clean the store and bring in all of the shopping carts to the store. I learned how to merchandise.
good,"Not to bad of a job. It was my first job and they accepted me very quick.. It must of been because I bought to the table that the supervisor wanted from previous employers that didn't. "
good,I loved most of my managers while I was there. I learned great cash handling skills and how to multitask. On the days where I was needed for something else I got to experience other aspects of the job as well.
good,"A typical day is answering phone, stocking and customer service. The hardest part of this job was that I stood for long periods of time and that hurts my knees."
good,The Biggest issue that I have  with this company is the salary.They want you to give them platinum and  gold in exchange peanuts.Was a fun place to work.
good,"Dollar Tree was a great place to work. Friendly environment, great coworkers, great reviews from customers. The only problem was the higher up management (district managers, HR). They literally said ""we should not have to treat you with respect in order for you to do your job."" What!?"
good,There is a lot to do in a typical day. This is ok however at this location everyone is not always a team player. I have an awesome time though because I learn to make the most out of any situation and my customers are awesome.
good,There are three shifts to choose from. The management needs some improvement. The warehouse is not inclement for changing weather. The co-workers work together in there individual departments.
good,"a typical day at work is i clock in and start right away on starting up my register, counting the money, set it all up for the line. then i basically remain there for most of the day until it dies down which then i get switched to the floor where i proceed with cleaning around the store. the most difficult part of the job was the large amount of people and the small amount of staff on hand, had to take care of hundreds of people a day all on my own almost all the time, although i do clear them out pretty quick. i most enjoyed the atmosphere my fellow employers gave off, felt like we were all one big family."
good,"I didn't work here long. I wasn't really trained to work on the register, never really saw the manager, some of my coworkers acted like they didn't want to be there and had major attitude problems all day. I dropped a case of soda on my foot while restocking the fridge and was told that I couldn't go home even though it hurt to walk on it."
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. The other employees and manager made it fun. I only left this job because I was not getting enough hours and Pizza Plus offered me more hours and pay.
good,"Unload trucks, separate merchandise and stack"
good,i like working for the company. just wish people could work full time. it is very hard to make it out here with out benefits and part time hours. it is hard some times when you have to run a register and stock down aisles . it seems all you do at times is run back and forth. could get more accomplished if it was one or the other.
good,No advancement available. Work environment was good. Good group of people. Wold work there again. Managemnt could of been more helpful.
good,"Loved the customer service aspect of the job but you had very minimal hours to use to have help so management ending up working long hours mostly nights with no help,  bonuses were never given when they were supposed to be and promises of advancement was never fulfilled."
good,"I began at Dollar Tree, Inc. as the Store Manager in Cabot, AR. My duties there included, but were not limited to, opening and closing the store and supervising all store associates and assistant managers. I was responsible for freight flow, inventory, making schedules, answering the phone, cashing out all associate cash drawers at the end of each of three shifts per day, merchandising, seasonal transitions, ASR sets and resets, customer service, completing exchanges, running the register if the cashier gets overwhelmed or needed a break, and following the instruction of my district manager and regional management team. In this position I accomplished bringing the store up from running negative numbers in sales to running positive sales numbers and earning bonuses each month for me and my assistant managers. We received customer compliments daily and our customer base was gradually growing. I became well known at my store for showing much appreciation to my associates when it is deserved and following company policy. I led by example. I did the work right alongside my employees that I expected them to do. By doing this I earn the respect of my employees and ended up with great results in teamwork from everyone. I'm extremely happy when doing retail work and my great attitude brings out a great and happy attitude from all those around me."
good,"made schedules, customer service, stock the shelves, jumped on the register.. I learned how to run the business, co-workers made it a great work environment, no breaks.. the workers are the best part of the job"
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree, consists of..."
good,overall working for this company was a terrible experience the only reason I staied as long as I did is because I had a great manager.
good,"customer care, shipping & receiving, cash handling, advancement within the company, trouble shooting"
good,"not enough hours, management not professional, pay not good"
good,"When I worked at the Dollar Tree, I had an amazing Store Manager. He made everyone feel like they were appreciated. When he left, the new manager would play favorites and treat everyone once else bad. I would work there again with different management."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are my customers, Handle money, have customer service experience"
good,My day usually consists of 8 hours of processing freight and assisting the cashiers at the register. I provide customer service to our customers. The employees get along well and are dedicated to providing great customer service.
good,Everyone that works here are very kind and would keep the work days fun. Managers are fun and very encouraging. It is a very repetitive job.
good,"It was not the most enjoyable place to work. I always felt like everything was left up to me. Being a 3rd key holder was a very enjoyable job though. I enjoyed having the upper hand when helping customers, unloading the truck, doing daily paper work, and all other managerial duties."
good,"great place to work, liked the hours, management staff, and co-workers. easy job. had they not cut the hours so drastically, I would have remained"
good,"A typical workday consisted of freight, assisting customers and delegating work to employees."
good,"Nice environment, fun energetic people reasonable hours I worked."
good,This was a relaxing workplace but the compensation was not great.
good,"I learned how to become a better Manager everyday at this company, How to fix hard situations and make them better or work better. How to work certain Programs and to set-up and close-down registers.Clean and stock shelves accurately."
good,During the holiday season the days were very hectic and I would only be on the schedule for 4 hours and I would end up working 6 to 8 hours because the store was so hectic. In the beginning I only got like 2 -4 hour shifts a week. Then as I started working there more I was called in for non scheduled shifts and I took them and began to get 4 scheduled shifts a week. Then everything changed and I was called once after new years day and nothing since then.
good,There is no real teamwork in this workplace. There is very little training but high expectations for new employees. The demand for work completion is unrealistic for the amount of employees working at one time.
good,"The work is easy, perfect for someone out of high school or attending high school"
good,"helping customers,working cash registrar,greeting everyone."
good,"I was usually scheduled for two four-hour shifts per week. I did mostly cashier work and some shelf stocking. I found the management team to be quite helpful, especially in training. I worked hard when I was on duty and appreciated all of the hard work of the staff."
good,"typical day at work is just like any other day for me wasn't hard at all just simple work. I learned different ways how to stock shelves, and a few tricks as to doing it as well. Management wasn't all that bad but it was when I first started but as they Dollar Tree company changed managers it got better over time. My co-workers weren't all that bad they did ok job in getting things done, I was the top employee in my job that I know of. There really isn't a hard part of my job it was easy to me. Enjoyable part of the job is that I made friends while working at the Dollar Tree."
good,great job for a high school student or college student looking for a little extra cash.
good,I really enjoy the work environment and the people I work with everyday. Also helping customers is very fulfilling for me. Other than that the pay is at the bottom and the hours fluctuate to much for it to be a steady job.
good,It was a nice Job...That i had got offered threw my High School. I was only Getting Paid 8.00 per Hr..but i could say i learned a lot from working here
good,"I would get to work, clock in, then start stocking shelves. Then throughout the day would help customers find what they are looking for. At the end of shift would clean my work area and crush cardboard. The management is ok, the crew is awesome and friendly. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the productivity quota. The only enjoyable part of my work day was interaction with co-workers and customers."
good,"Very flexible and fast-paced job, especially if you are a college student like me, though at our store most of the management and store manager didn't do much for the employees if someone had an issue, most of the time the assistant managers would notify the store manager before contacting the DM (district manager) on our bigger issues."
good,"Days went fast due to how busy they were. Management was ok, not great. Co-workers were friendly and most kept busy. Hardest part of job was the hours per week i worked."
good,A typical day at work was loading and unloading trucks.  I also packaged shipments that were loaded on the trucks to be delivered to Dollar Tree locations.
good,Met alot of different people. Really care about their members
good,"learned how to deal with big orders"
good,"Good company but employees such as store managers, district managers and theres a million other kinds of managers (i.e, merchandising manager, who kinda like your ""other"" dm.. useless tho) have no clue what they are doing. I loved working there but the constant inconsistency of policies and work detail made me leave."
good,"Very fast paced environment. Working the cash register during the holidays was very hard work. Loved helping the customers and helping my coworkers everyday. Looked forward to working. "
good,I did not work here for long but for the time I did work here it was nothing too terrible. Great starting job for high school students. Management was friendly and very helpful.
good,"stocking store , cleaning store, unloading trucks, promoting products "
good,"My position as a cashier had very consistent duties, including handling payments, assisting customers, bagging items, stocking shelves, and cleaning. I was taught to use a basic cashier machine and the importance of displaying merchandise to attract customers. I also had many opportunities to use customer service to resolve problems, greet customers, and maintain a good relationship with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was staying productive when all assigned jobs and tasks were finished prior to my end of shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working directly with customers and seeing how my personal customer service effected them in a positive way."
good,"Stocking, Cashier, Merchandize,"
good,"I have been in both sides; team member and team leader. I have been working for Dollar Tree for two years. I am currently a assistant store manager at Dollar Tree. I personally see Dollar Tree as an starter job, or if you are close to retiring. It is a good job for starters because they start you in a comfortable yet fast paced place. Dollar Tree has flexible hours, and  you have the opportunity to  talk to the manager face to face about any questions and concerns. Managers in Dollar Tree are helpful and understanding. The bad thing about Dollar Tree is that it pays minimum wage and there are no benefits. I really like that you don't get bored, there is never a time when you will say "" I have nothing to do"". Dollar Tree is okay for a seasonal job, but I do not recommend this job to anyone as a long term solution. I hope this review was somewhat helpful."
good,"it was a nice place I enjoyed it, unforrtunately it was only a seasonal job it would've been nice to have had a permanent job"
good,"Dollar Tree was a fun environment to work in, I enjoyed interacting with different faces.I also enjoyed seeing new inventory come in on stock day. My co-workers were nice didn't talk much. The hardest part of the job was learning the cash register for the first few months but I was able to get it down over time."
good,It has been difficult working here because management has not been very professional. They talk to other employees about each other and the employees. Some curse quite a lot about dealing with our customers or their duties. They show a lack of time management and complete lack of ability to be an example to their employees.
good,I did not care for dollar tree much but it was an experience that I could learn from. the management was just all messed up. that place was a complete horrible experience
good,"always busy"
good,Working at the dollar tree was a waste of my time. I only did because I needed extra cash (I am in college) and they were close to home. My biggest problem was the store manager who was a harrasher. He was constantly FINDING things for me to do like collecting carts from outside and sweeping sidewalks. The asst managers were lazy always on their phones and would ask you to do things they could do themselves. The customers were either really friendly or plain rude and to make matters worst you I only got paid 7.50 to stand on my feet for HOURS. closing was the worst because at times i didnt get out til close to 11 or 12 and the store closed at 9! Im not saying all experiences will be like mine however this is what I went through. you are standing on your feet the entire shift with only a 10 minute break sometimes a 30 depending on your hours. The hours were good at first but then i was only getting 2or 3 days and on days I TOLD the store manager I was unavailable. He would also WRITE IN people to work on days they werent orginally scheduled to work after the printed schedule had already been posted and hold people accountable for it. SO WRONG! i wouldnt recommend it but if you need the money go for it.
good,"Customer Service is hard but manageable. Its very busy retail business store. I enjoyed the teamwork at my job and also the co-workers. The hours they give is not good and also the pay is not that great either. I learned alot of patience within Customer service and also to become more sociable, Professional, I learned more experience in retail also to than greet all customers."
good,"Benefits are for full time employees only, full time employees are just management. Company will work you 39.5 hours to avoid paying benefits. Lots of drama, tasks are not realistic. Job is somewhat stressful, but you will probably tire of the drama."
good,"low pay and hours unless management,not worth it if you are looking for full timw"
good,"Too much micro management -- doesn't promote team work, do not promote the good employees just put more on them, and the lazy ones, just float on"
good,Not very much pay and usually not too many hours but a fun place to be
good,A typical day at work would be recovering and cleaning up the whole store as well as handling the customers and cash handling . The mangement is okay and the hardest part of my job is just how busy our customer flow can get . I enjoy having a job i would prefer a career and advancement in my job.
good,Perfect job for students or people just entering the workfield. No room for advancement. Doesn't pay enough for a living...
good,"My typical day there was coming in get my list og things to do n get started, management was not ok at all, co- works was great people, being there at five six in the morning unloading the truck in the cold the enjoyable part about the job was getting off work"
good,"Wheen I first started working for the company the stock was only 25 dollars a share.When I left the stock was 95 dollars a share,and the stock had split several times.The company only cares about there bottom line.If you are looking to move up the ladder its a hard place to do so."
good,Wasnt there that long but for the time I was there it was a nice eniviorment to work in.
good,With outstanding merchandising skills this is a great place to create great sales. A small enough store to allow you to succeed in yet large enough to allow you to notice how good you are. Always changing merchandise making it exciting.
good,If you are looking for extra cash for the next holiday season. This would be the perfect place for you.
good,"The position for hourly employees is very limited. No overtime, and no full time cashiers. If you are in management, then their are benefits, however, having seen the manager I work for put in 60 hrs a week and have that be expected for her salary, I was not impressed. Its an easy job, with little stress."
good,"Learned time managment, how to be productive and a hard worker."
good,"If you like working with the public this is a great job, It has been an experance."
good,Running the register and a lot of lil things
good,Merchandising and stocking every day.
good,"My co-workers gave me problems, and business was always slow."
good,A typical day at work was always busy because of shortage of employees..But all employees gave it there best!!! I learned the different areas of how to run a retail store. my co-workers were always ready to work and go above and beyond to work with others to satisfy the customers. The hardest part of my job was to finish every single thing on the agenda when there was mostly a shortage of employees. I always enjoyed working with the public and meeting new people.
good,"good company to work for very poor upper mgm,t required to work 75-85 hrs. per wk very poor follow thru with upper mgm,t large turn over of employees"
good,"unload trucks, greet customers, count inventory, cashier that probably was all the duties i had to do"
good,"plenty of work during the holidays, not much work during off season."
good,"Very demanding, fast paced work environment, physically demanding, minimal opportunities for advancement, low pay, steady work schedule, enjoyable coworkers."
good,"I had a good schedule and my boss was usually sympathetic to my needs.  I didn't agree with how this business is run, and the pay was very low for the work we are expected to accomplish.  Things were disorganized and inefficient.  People weren't being effectively trained.  High turnover, low employee satisfation."
good,"Well, the managers are quite slow. But understandable. They have boxes everywhere they are still trying to make the store look presentable. They are doing they're hardest to keep it going."
good,"Fast pace,hands on entire shift,multiple task in very short period. First to see new shipment rotating seasonal items. Pay is horrible for all that is expected."
good,"This was my first job when I started. Started as a cashier/stocker and moved on to an assistant manager "
good,"Nothing much to say, but just a part time job to get by while in school. The staff were friendly and we all got along, except for the regional managers and anyone above that title."
good,"I like working here.  However, when I interviewed they promised me 15-20 hrs per week.  They are only giving me 8 hrs. per week.  They have computer based training to start.  Management is average."
good,"The work is fast paced and hard.  I like the work because it keeps me busy and I like staying busy at work.  I don't like the varying hours.  I never know how long I am going to be at work and that was one thing that I asked about when I interviewed with the company, among other questions that I asked and was given a different answer than what actually has happened."
good,"Dollar Tree is a fairly good company to work for but I'm just ready for more. I believe I could be doing more than working in retail and being a cashier."
good,"work experience was good, though would be stressful during rushes that involved the holidays. Most enjoyable was co workers and organizing the store. hardest part was identify thief's.."
good,They don't give good raises I have been there 3 years and I might've gotten all together as a raise 75 cents partial because minimum wages went up and they had to move me up to minimum wage 8.46
good,The management team was not professional and was stealing from our place of business and made the environment was very unhealthy.  I still had a chance to meet a few good coworkers.
good,"For the amount of work expected, the pay did not match. The pro is the flexibility, the con is also the flexibility. Employees are disposable and not given much to compensate the low pay. Easy to get hired but just as easy to get fired."
good,Unless you in the management position your pay is 735 they don’t give any overtime and it’s all about who you knowIt was fun to work it in the beginning while setting up the store because it is a brand new store but I would say about a month for you and away the store manager really didn’t have your back and of the workers just put stuff anywhere as long as the freight got out yet trucks in the room and stuff
good,"Was a good company to work for unfortunately the employees where unreliable and the turn over rate for employees was just way to high. It was hard work, for little pay and not enough employees had enough drive and motivation in them."
good,"Management is easy to get to but, hard to hold. Many changes with in the district and managers. Not many honest people in the store level and just above."
good,"Its a decent place to work at for like your first job, I was a cashier and a stocker, nice managers, friendly environment, I learned how to cahsier here, nothing really hard about the job."
good,"The work is enjoyable, should be great place to work. Could be with better training and realistic goals and better scheduling. Customer service needs to be placed higher on importance, dependability should be rewarded. Some great people, some fun, schedules just to random"
good,I enjoyed what I did just not the company I worked for they didn’t care to help when you needed it. Turnover was awful and they expected their salary managers to work a lot of extra hours and definitely not enough pay for all we had to do.
good,Pay rate is horrible under minimum wage and for Dollar Tree to be in same location for seven years and bought out family dollar that's really horrible the pay rate isn't even 9 dollars an hour. They MOST DEFINITELY NEED TO UP their hourly rate.
good,It's a cool place to work just doesn't pay enough to survive off of. Also it's only part time positions available. It would be a better place to work with more pay.
good,"We I first started truly thought this company was fair but you learn. They cut your hours very low, they call on your days off and for some reason if you can't make it they take your hours. They have you trying to do everything but what you was hired for. Sorry I a very reliable worker but that job wasn't for me or should I say the managerment. I came everyone they asked me because I love to work and make my money."
good,"Needs more experienced employees, not very clean, pay is not very high, needs more organizations. Overall its a okay place to work. Needs better management too."
good,Very easy job could be a really good company with better management in place...I feel employees do not put their all in the job because of the very low pay
good,It’s ok I won’t recommend anyone to work there only because what I just went through I just feel like I’m out here all alone some times and I didn’t feel that way tell I transferred to another region
good,The company is fine I could use more hours but other than that I like it . I get there do my work that I’m told to do . And I make sure I ring out the customers with a smile 😊
good,The pay is good. It is a part time job so your hours vary between 20-25 per week. They do not allow over time and holidays you get paid an extra 1.50$ on the hour. An ideal second job.
good,"Every day is a new adventures, I've learned that u need to learn something new everyday. I can do what ever task is at hand I might not like it but I get it do at a timely matter,from unloading trucks to helping customers......"
good,"I guess its good for like a first time job if your still in high school. The pay is horrible, the stock room is always a mess. How we unload the truck is very unproductive."
good,Working here is fun because you develop a relationship with your customers .However there is favoritism with management and the hours are touch and go because the employees hired often quit because the hours are very scares .15 to 20 hours per week averaging 300 every two weeks roughly.Management makes all the money and rarely are there.
good,"The current Dollar Tree location in which you can I am employed has a great atmosphere for the customer shopping experience. The rudimentary staff have excellent customer service skills, but the turnover rate is very high due to the low pay being disproportionate to the high work. Hours are also limited, but so one cannot expect to make a ""living"" if not within a manager position."
good,Job was hard because we were on too strict a labor budget to get the job done.  Trucks were huge and back rooms were overflowing with products.  I averaged 70 hours a week as a salaried manager.
good,Not a bad place to work if you only want to work a few hours and not many hours through the week. The only problem I had was people stealing. The pay could be better with the hours they give.
good,"This is my first job in USA."
good,The job itself is easy. The hardest thing is trucks. You get a email saying when truck is but 95% of the time truck is being moved to a different day. So you have to rework your schedule because your only allowed so many hours in the week.
good,"Increasining managers workloads annually weaker healthcare benefits at increasing costs, less hours to schedule labor means more work, and split days off with no real time to reset... This all results in good, educated, and experienced managers burning out and walking away. The ability to transfer is almost laughable. Ive been driving 26 miles one way when there are 2 dollar trees less than 15 miles from me. Transfers are always denied."
good,I didnt work at dollar tree that long but it was a great experience working there...i learned new ways to work with people.. The workers was very nice..i picked up more work experience.
good,Often was busy but not too busy were I became overwhelmed. When not busy I would just stock whatever I was told to stock for that day. This was my first real job so I learned a lot
good,"Most customers are friendly and actually easy to speak to. Some days I'm working as a cashier and some days I'm working duties as a keyholder. collecting and taking out the trash and cardboard, restocking items in its specific place, sweeping the store, cleaning the bathroom, closing each till and preparing the bank deposit each night."
good,Dollar tree is a great temporary job but shouldn't be permanent not the best pay and not the best with hours or best to work with you schedule either.
good,Dollar Tree has great management that's what makes it a great place to work at for the most part. Keeping the store stocked is not hard to do at times.
good,I had no real problems until i became a asst mngr but as a cashier its pretty productive and time flies however now going into one of these stores things seem to be more hectic dont think i would even be willing to work there now
good,If you are prepared to move around a lot bouncing cash register to doing go backs. The its a pretty easy job considering. If you know how to work a register it's pretty simple the pain the the back part is the constant things to go back and strange hours like one week you will work thurs-sun from say 4:00pm till closing then the next week you are working mon-thurs and start at 2:20pm so just prepared with it all.
good,There wasn't much other then stocking and checking customers out during checkout. On heavy customers days or truck delivery there wasn't enough co works to help with the demands of what was expected from. So at times this job was stressful plus you are never thanked for a job well done.
good,The work environment was lovely I got the chance to meet in work with excellent people. I learned how to bring positive into people life. The only hard part was nothing.
good,It’s just not a job I would want to spend so much time and energy on and it’s a pretty good job with a good work environment but I need to spend my time and energy and skills or something more for me instead of me working for money that wouldn’t last me for long
good,Working at the Dollar tree can be fun at times it is a ok place to work  you are required to work hard there is not much time for a breather in between your tasks
good,"do not go into this job looking for security they do not value employees, they do not accept doctor excuses so missing will get you fired no questions asked."
good,Working at dollar tree could be fun at times but it could also be slow at times. Some of the co workers were great to work worth but the manager on the other hand well I would rather not say but most of the time I didn't work with her which was good
good,"Always something to do so you will never get bored.  Unfortunately,  everything is part time except management positions.   The pay is minimum wage.   No benefits."
good,"Overall my experience at Dollar Tree was not good. I enjoyed my fellow co-workers, however management was not all too friendly. The workload was really stressful for a minimum wage job. (7.25 when I was working)"
good,Everything was as expected. Management was replaced and the job atmosphere was much better and the store was getting back on track and towards the goals the company had set.
good,only for the hard working fast passed demanding job with no rewards customers are harsh and you have to have thick skin a good part time job for 15 hours a week but full time is salary and 50 plus hours a week
good,"Enjoyed working with most of the staff, felt comfortable with work load, liked the store products and customers. Customers seemed to appreciate my good service. Didn't receive enough hours."
good,"The customers waiting in long lines gave me anxiety. Plus the customers getting mad at you for problems that you have no control over. Overly picky customers, the ones that throw money on the counter in wrinkled bills, rude people that hang up the phone on you. Inconsiderate people who leave their carts and baskets anywhere, and then complain when they are no carts. During rush hour, I had no time to pick up the baskets and push the carts back where they belonged, so they remained in a mess."
good,They have a crazy schedule..I enjoyed my job and people I worked with in S.C but moved to WV and they do things totally  different  then I have ever seen..No one does their own job and it is full of. Back stabbing instead of working as a team its was all about favorites instead of having ones that will work and get the job done..I think they need a total review  there and aee why the have such a turn in employees..
good,"Fun work place, associates work as a family, you basically are helping customers all day while putting out freight.  They never give enough stocking hours, makes it stressful.  It can be a great place to work, if you are a fast paced individual."
good,"A typical work day consist of opening at 7:00 A.M -10:00 P.M closing. The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with all the stocking and mess that customer did to the store,your always organizing and trying to maintain the store apperance."
good,"This Specific location is in the middle of a cultural change, so I won’t rate the  Organization on a whole. I have witnessed a warehouse in the organization run at high efficiency with floors and belts that one could eat off of. This is not that one, employees cry about needing change then just walk past  debris on the ground. Upper management demands actions but when we present an employee for punishment nothing happens. Long way to go, but in time it should be ok."
good,"Wages are minimum wage here at this job.....as cashier....I was an asset. Manager I made 9$ per hour there.The store manager at this grove location is a very messy,unorganized,young believes she knows everything,isn't very professional,blames others for her mistakes,takes short cuts but doesn't want anyone else to.she talks to people terribly."
good,"It is a fast paced job and can be fun, but once you get into management it can suck the life out of you. Money isn't very good and benefits are only for management."
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with a disgruntled boss.  Some of the customers would not come back there due to management's attitude,  On a typical day of work I would stock shelves, cash customers out and help customers locate products.  I would also clean the area behind the cash register.  The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting customers and giving them good service. Staff would call in a lot, not wanting to work their scheduled hours.  One employee would show up for work intoxicated and was not reprimanded for it."
good,"On a typical day working at Dollar Tree I would, work a 4 hour shift doing cash with a 10 minute break. I would also tidy up around the store and put away misplaced items. The management was ok, everyone was friendly. The hardest part of the job was defiantly the customers."
good,They do not like to do their jobs work at a very slow paste they let people come in and steal from the company and when I threaten to tell I got fired
good,i worked there for my job experience class in high school. the customers were nice their. but the customer 9/10 nice. the workers i worked were very nice people. i got easily with them. but when I had a question to ask. i would have hard time to find the manger.
good,"The job was pretty easy and fun. There is a lot of opportunity for growth! However, it started to become a very unethical place to work. I mean lots of drama not only from customer(due to bad neighborhood) but also from the employees!"
good,"Cashiering at Dollar Tree was interesting. Most times, cashiers would be left alone and sometimes we would get help. Other times, there would be long lines backed up. We were also paid minimum wage."
good,"To much interpersonal drama. I prefer to just do my job and go home. Workplaces, big or small should never act on a personal 1 on 1 basis unless it involves your actual job. Otherwise, I enjoyed the flexibility and the responsibility of fast paced environment for that kind if retail."
good,A lot of mirco managerment. Spend to much time trying to keep your D.M. off corpI. bad list so that she looks good to her boss instead of focusing on the customer's in your store. Way to much product is pushed into store with small stockrooms which makes it hard to work the 80% of product that the customer's want everyday.  I enjoy making my customer happy every time they shop but when the company ships you 100 cases of items you just warehouse in your stockroom but only send you 40 cases of items the customers want and is gone in the first d two days and the company still wants a sales increase.
good,"Dollar Tree, from the perspective of a cashier, is a good first job to work at, or okay job to work at if not your first job. What make or break your days is a combination of your attitude toward your work, fellow employees, and customers, their attitudes toward you, and how well you can work with what you are given. Sometimes days are good because the customers are nice, the workflow is good, nothing has broken and no accidents have happened, and other days are terrible because all of the above are bad. I learned a lot of patience on this job, and how to remain, if not cheerful, then at least calm and neutral. The most enjoyable part is honestly not being at the cash register and doing some other task in the store, and the hardest part is appeasing troublesome customers."
good,Stockers can't get enough hours. Cashiers can. Only manager can live on pay (salary). Weekly truck delivery brings too much product. Back-stock always excessive. Fellow workers are fine and work environment pleasant. Enjoy helping customers. Store constantly cluttered with u-boats and unswept aisles. Never enough stock help to meet demand.
good,Dollar tree’s work load was very very easy most of the time you were working on register or cleaning and arranging isles according to your set managers request.
good,The days typically started around 5am stocking shelves. It was a fast paced job and we would try to get as much work done before the store opened as we could. My job was to have boats of merchandise ready for the stock team in the morning. And also keeping track of productivity. It is a good job to learn about customer service and management. There is a lot of turnover due to pay so problem solving is a must. Many days you just have to figure out how to get the job done while being understaffed. Management can be a mixed bag. Some really do care about their stores and some don't. You do meet some nice people just trying to make a living while working here.
good,"stressful"
good,"My manager was awesome. My store was pretty laid back. however pay is terrible, no benefits. i wouldn't make enough money in 2 weeks to pay a phone bill."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree, I would open the store with a cashier and maybe two stockers .Go to the bank to make the night before deposit, If in need get change to last the rest of the day. I would supervise my employees to make sure all duties for the day get done along with making my customers shopping experience great."
good,Working at Dollar Tree was average. The compensation was not the best. The Hours that were given you basically have to beg for to make enough money to get to work. There was and still is only one cashier open when busy.
good,It is a great part time job but it isn't something you can live off of. This is more of a second job.The manager was very helpful and pleasant to work with.
good,"I honestly would not recommend this job to a friend. I never knew what hours I was working they always tried to change schedule with no notice. Hardly got breaks. Had a problem with a manager I was being harrassed, reported it numerous times for both response"
good,"This job was perfect for me because I was still in HS.  It worked well with my school schedule, so I could juggle my school work and after school activities.  It is a great 1st job to learn how to handle money and work with customers and build your customer service skills."
good,dollar tree company is only a stepping stone to get experience in retail all stores get there merchandise stolen by some customers they have no security presents to prevent shoplifting and gets worse during holiday season.
good,"Not for everyone. Management was not very good and didn't help when in need. Pay is low and you depend on the bonus in order to make a good income. The DM was not well versed and did not help. Deadlines were almost impossible to accomplish, unless you work 70 hours a week. No family life."
good,"If you're not on the register, you're stocking the shelves, and if you're not doing that, then you're unloading a truck. At least that is the typical day of a cashier. Management has a larger handful of responsibilities on top of some, if not all, of the above mentioned tasks, making a typical 4-5 hour Part Time shift  seem very difficult, and a lot to handle at times. If you can manage the very flexible hours, strict company policies, and are just looking for a quick job, then Dollar Tree is right for you."
good,I enjoy working with the customers and fellow employees. They put me on split shifts and had me travel from different stores. They worked with my schedule while I was in school
good,It's ok store to work if you are willing to work part time and never move up in the store . I think it ok for a older people looking for a part time job.or a student or summer job
good,Dollar Tree is great place to work its fun and you can do a lot at your own discretion as a manager. Its like having your own store as franchise. If you are single and can dedicate your life to the store its great but if you have a family and need a work like balance good luck
good,"Working here is good first job experience. It’ll help you with customer service skills, help with restocking shelves and help unload new shipments. You’ll develop good work skills."
good,Wouldnt work for another company thats wont give you a raise after 3 years of dedicated service. Its students or kids trying to have pocket money or someone who just needs something to do you cant survive off of dollar tree income alone
good,"This job is for people that don’t mind making minimum wage, can deal with disrespectful customers, and does not want any benefits. The pros is everything in the store is a dollar and you can also use coupons to make them even cheaper. Other than that there’s not that many pros to working here."
good,"Dollar tree was not a horrible place to work for, but I personally did not make enough there to live on and the hours were just not there that is why I chose to leave."
good,My experience at dollartree is there is horrible communication between staff they over work there employees then they also do not believe in sending help to stores when needed
good,"I worked at the Dollar Tree until I could find another job. It was okay, management was tough and felt judgmental at times. They did not give me many hours. Overall it was okay working there. Not my favorite job, but not the worst either."
good,The had a very relaxed atmosphere.They took my disability in consideration when hiring me.They are very intuned with customers and employee. I felt like part of a family while I worked there.I would recommend them to anyone looking for a job.
good,"Challenging, but rewarding work experience. Not the best management structure, but I believe that was exclusive to my store. Schedule hours vary week to week, with no consistency."
good,They did not have many hours available too give at the time i work there  the pay was very low  the management was real flexible  and they were respectful
good,At dollar tree we were very busy and most of the time we were short staff. and we had to do extra work because we did not have enough people to work. if not we had to many people and sometimes it would be very hard to keep up.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree I assistant customers and answer any questions that they may have to ask. Being that this location is close to the airport, I am exposed to people from all over the world. The hardest part of this job is getting corporate to act on issues that we have concerns about and not only do things to benefit your companies needs. I enjoy helping customers seeing them satisfied makes me happy and feel as though I have made their life just a little better!"
good,"The Manager of my dollar tree is a nice understanding man, never had any issues with him. Other employees weren’t the smartest people- mostly teenagers and old men working there. Schedules weren’t made till the start of the week- so it’s hard to plan around your work schedule"
good,at dollar tree we were very busy and most of the time we were short staff. and we had to do extra work because we did not have enough people to work. if not we had to many people and sometimes it would be very hard to keep up. i stayed because i needed the money.
good,"Wow--so much to offer here! Party supply central. They have played, table cloths, all colors of silverware, chips, decor, balloons, you name it. "
good,"Great boss, just a lack of pay.. Plenty of work to do you will stay busy!!! It is unlikely you will ever get 40hrs. a week. You meet good people, but you can't live off the pay."
good,Dollar tree can use more stickers they are only short staff at night but dollar tree is ok I would go back there to work I just don’t like u have to go to other stores to get hrs
good,"We got to know one another and had to treat each other with respect, we had lots of laughs and memories in the store cleaning up after our day was over, it was fun while I worked there."
good,I am not faund on how the staff treats the staff with respect. I think the staff doesn't take in consideration that the other staff has things they asked off for and then they say we have to come in
good,"Started as cashier advanced to assistant pretty fast.very fast paced and tons of product to stock, hard to keep up with the front and throw freight overall I enjoy it"
good,"It was nice place to work but nice co workers good management. Nice environment"
good,A typical day of work there. your able to goof off around an with the managers. They only take things serious if it hurts the company. The hardest part of the job is advancing to another level of the job
good,"The schedule put on mangers is a little over the top, 70 hours per week if your sales figures aren’t. High enough to have any employees work.  Hard to complete every task with you and one cashier in building"
good,"Management kinda sucks, not the best. Not many hours are given , only part time. Management is not very informative about rights and benefits.Could use better management."
good,"Management has been all over the place for the past year. Lack of a consistent schedule and a lot of turnover. Overall, it feels like nobody cares, either about the store or it's employees."
good,"A typical day at work included providing countless services to customers, maintaining cleanliness throughout the store. I appreciated the support of staff and the experience in meeting new people."
good,"I enjoyed the environment it was fast-paced and friendly time goes fast. I worked for dollar tree 2 and half years and they wouldn't give me not even a ten cent raise. I was very disappointed which resulted in me leaving. They rather hire more part timers to avoid full time employees. It's a messed up company in that way because it reduces them having to give pay raises, health benefits and sick days. Bottom line, there is zero advancement unless you are management. Which brings favoritism into play depending on location."
good,If you are a cashier with no intention of advancing with the company then you're fine but if you want to make this a career I wouldn't recommend it. They don't staff enough people or allow enough hours to be scheduled to complete all expected tasks.
good,This job was probably my worst job I’ve ever had work. The pay was terrible. I never had more then 15 hours a week. The work load was not worth the pay.
good,They do t hire you on full time unless your a manger the pays alright I liked the hours make sure you keep your schedule with you or written down other then that I was good job
good,Follow planoguides and respond to customers needs. Cover shifts as needed and follow directions and directives. General screening of associates and moderately high turnover.
good,"Dollar Tree is a good place to work if you are willingly to work they only offer part time hrs. to employees full time is for management"
good,"Easy , slow paced job not a lot of issues except for the occasional over the top customers and lazy store managers and dms . I worked here for two years but I left because I need a change ."
good,"Dollar Tree practices a reasonable idea of making every product they sell $1 or less. As a part time sales associate, it is good work with great flexibility for a starting job, but there are plenty of opportunities to grow and prosper within the company itself."
good,"Typical day varies between stocking, cashiering, unloading trucks. Sometimes all are required. Days required you to make bank deposits on your own time, unpaid. Short staffed often due to call offs."
good,"I was a stocker at Dollar Tree and in my time there I worked hard and efficient... I had to stock all areas of the store to make them look clean and presentable to customers upon opening of the store.  Management was sometimes to aggressive and confrontational in front of other employees. And it came of as very disrespectful... Other than that, it was a good place to work... Just wasn’t enough pay or hours."
good,"Stocking shelves, working the cash register, working with people on the daily basis, sometimes have to deal with rude people, seeing a happy customer walk out of the store"
good,A typical day at work at Dollar Tree would be to come in clock in and count register to make sure its counted at the correct amount. I would have to ring up customers and bag up their purchased items. I also had to stock all the shelves and the coolers. Every Sunday I had to gather all items that are misplaced and put them in their correct spot. Dollar tree was a very busy environment to work in. I had to be on point with everything. My drawer couldn't be short and I had to make sure I got each customer in and out in a timely manner.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to contribute to my team and be there when they needed ne to pick up a shift or come in to cover someone.
good,There is a constant turnover in staff. The compensation is close to minimum wage no matter how long you have worked there.The most difficult part of the job is pleasing the different managers.
good,It was a great job but definitely not long term like in was hoping for. In all the managers were fair but some were new an depended on me for answers I wasn't even trained to know.
good,"I am not really there enough to give a thorough review. I have learned how to unload a truck, using a roll-track as a conveyor, I am still learning how to stock items 'without' matching of UPC codes, or any numeric or lettering system of any kind, which in my opinion is a haphazard and inefficient way of stocking. This in itself is the hardest part of the job, but I am still learning. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers, and ringing them up at register."
good,it was very bad there. when you were off they will keep blowing your phone up on your day off to cover someone else's shift and then on top of that you only get a 10 minute break and when you finally get to sit down someone else either quits or they need your help so you really have no time to actually get a break. pay is not good either you basically work for pennies here. i do not wish anyone not even my worst enemy this type of work. of and forget about friends and family because they want you to work like a slave here
good,The management was amazing but with the pay rate and the amount of hours they try to give out it's impossible to live off of the salary you'd have to work another job as well. Plus they get very busy so if you get overwhelmed easily I definitely wouldn't recommend.
good,As for as Workin there it was steady and constant. The only problem was when work was left between shifts no one would step up to finish what was left off and then it falls on management or probably just one manager to get it all done plus papper work and a host of other mandatory things before they can leave
good,"It was good job for me at the time, when there wasn’t any responsibilities that I had at the time. But organization wasn’t that great and opportunities to grow weren’t there either."
good,"Dollar tree is a part time job, and more like a secondary job but i liked it partly for the circumstances of working with a friend and nice coworkers. Sometimes the customers were really nice too, but as in any retail place, its very stressful-- especially approaching big holidays or during charity's. If you have a bit of extra patience i'd reccomend it as a side job however, and its overall laid back when its not bustling from holidays or peak points of the day."
good,"Dollar Tree was very unorganized in the back end of the store when it came to the stockers, but they are currently under new management so the working conditions may have improved."
good,"I worked here almost 2 years before I moved. I watched several people come and go, while I stayed, learned all I could, but still was treated as if I knew nothing. There was no way for me to be more than a part-time cashier; since the store manager didn't like me on a personal level. It's a good place to work if you know people, and it's easy to climb the ladder to get full time that way. Most places are understaffed and have management that were just thrown into their position. It's a job, but nothing you should keep at consistently. Stay here until you find something better, then move on."
good,"Dollar Tree was a good place to work because of the people whom I worked with.  As far as the benefits and pay went, it was not very good at all.  The hardest part of the job to me was cleaning up at the end of the night."
good,"Set the registers up for cashiers, assign area to cashiers to stock and keep straight when it was slow; maintain the up keep of each isle on the floor. be visible and  available for customers and employee throughout my shift."
good,"Working overnight and it's alright. Nobody standing over you. Fast paced. A lot of walking, organizing, restocking. If you're looking for something simple, collect an easy check then this may work for you but it's not for everybody."
good,Dollar Tree is great for students and people that live at home. If you need to pay bills this is not the place for you. Also good for someone who was just starting out in the workforce.
good,"Coworkers were trash "
good,"A slow paced store with a very lenient managers. "
good,"Dollar Tree, gave me the freedom to supervise others, and manage store operations, while learning new skills within the organization."
good,Open the store get the drawer ready for the cashier get the pallets together for the cashiers put up the stock on Fridays we will get a deliveries take care of the customers give them change as need
good,"Very unorganized at times, alot of unnecessary drama, alot of items in very small area making it looked cluddered. To many managers, not enough workers."
good,you wake up at 4am just to get there at 6am and no lunch break. management was good and had a schedule and pace they all worked at. i would go back...
good,The job was a good job just not a job for anyone. It showed alot of team work but it was slow at times.My manager was very understanding .I learned that working as a team gets the job done.
good,"N/A"
good,"A typical day as an assistant manager at Dollar Tree includes answering customer questions and phone calls/emails, cashiering, stocking shelves and freezers, getting change for cashiers, go backs, recovery, overall cleaning. Receiving vendor orders and ordering frozen stock bi-weekly. If you have a good team around you it is a good place to work. Unfortunately turn-over is high as the company is strict on hours and overtime and majority of employees are strictly part-time and make minimum wage. Theft rate is high and many of the customers can be rude/demeaning, even to management but just as many if not more are very sweet and can truly make your day."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers, the shifts always went by super fast and never had time to get things finished, management wasn’t the best and the work was easy"
good,it was a job I needed at the time to help pay bills that's it I was stocking cashier and remodling when she needed me I was pregnant at the time and when I went in labor I did go back
good,"Everything was great about the company itself, however, there were too many employees and not enough hours to go around. I would recommend this job only to someone who is retired or a student looking to make some pocket change."
good,"I loved working with my manager! She was absolutely amazing! The pay isn’t good, but that is on corporate. I had my bad days, only because I am human.. other than that, I had fun every day. We laughed, we got things done, we made our customers happy."
good,"They make promises about hours and working with and then failed to do so ,change schedule without informing me.and then fired me because I didn't so up. Total lack of management."
good,The job was beginner job which provided me basic skills to get into the workforce. Being a high school student at the time allowed me to develop a work ethic for future en devours.
good,"Like all jobs there are pros and cons for working anywhere. Depending on your manager, more than likely you will only experience cons. Store Managers will be abused, since they are salaried."
good,Dollar Tree is an okay place to work if you have the right type of manager. There is room to grow depending on the type of manager you work for. The days varied
good,Dollar tree was a great place to work...the atmosphere was friendly...The co-workers were a family and we laughed and joked as well as get the job done...
good,"Its was an okay job. If you are looking for a first time job experience, Dollar Tree is a good place to start. It gives the experience of a Cashier worker, and also the fast paced work of retail, especially during the holidays. Management was good, but the job life really depended on who your co-workers were, whether it made the experience made it worth the minimum wage salary"
good,When I was there management was a little bit out of order so I contributed in any way I could to help get the store running back to its original order
good,They could offer a little more benefits. They don't give enough hours. They could also someone who is better in management. And also they don't keep the store clean.
good,okay job but have got in trouble over stuff i wasn't informed of i don't get very many hours has been over a week and still didn't have my schedule calling in every day to see if i work had a few manager calling for the same reason
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is constant work. As a cashier, you must take care of the customers. If no customers are coming in, you must go through all the go-backs and place them correctly in the store. If there are no go-backs (along with no customers in the store) you must portal the store for any misplaced items and place them back into their respected places. The key thing that has taught me is that if you look as if you don't want to work the job that was given to you then you won't have the job. The most enjoyable thing about Dollar Tree was handling the customers. I haven't had a problem with a customer and it's nice to talk as well as helping them out with things in the store. The hardest activity was either finding things to do after everything was done or keeping up with things during the busy days. At Dollar Tree, we're required to wear a formal green shirt with either caky pants or black slacks with closed toe shoes."
good,Enjoyed my time with Dollar Tree. Had issues with manager and contacting corporate. Having multiple managers sounds like a plus but when those managers have issues with each other it makes things difficult.
good,"My manager at the job was a great guy however all Shift Supervisors and Assistant Manager under him were awful, very bad superiority complex with a competitive attitude going on, didn't feel easy to do the job there but the job was actually easy."
good,I was able to start off as a freight unloader and worked my way to cashier then to management. Plenty of room for growth. If you need to transfer to a new location the company is very accomodating.
good,"I liked the job. It was simple and easy to do. Liked that it kept me busy and on my feet all day, yet didn't require me to be running around like crazy or with too much to do. A lot of turnover and undependable employees due to very low pay."
good,The work was easy but the customers are difficult at times so you would need patients and be able to put aside your feelings and not take things to personsl.
good,"overall, under the right management, it's a good part time or first time job for great experience for young people entering the workforce. however there are very few hours available."
good,They don't give enough hours and the salary is not enough. Some workers doesn't do there job. The hardest part of the job is unloading stuff from the truck. I enjoy to be around with our costumer and talked to them.
good,it wasnt the worst or the best place to work. the amount of work and hours i put it didnt equal to the amount of money i was making. i had no benefits or payed vacations. they were sometimes under staffed and i would have to pick up the slack of other employees
good,I cashiered and stocked shelves at night both positions were ok just not enough pay. I enjoyed the people that I worked with both days and nights . people pleasing was strongly encouraged.
good,"Typical days at work would be slow even as cashier, usually fast at certain times of the day but not many. Learn ed how to be effectively fast cashier. Hardest part of the job was trying to get the hours you wanted to work as in the amount of them not the times specifically. Most enjoyable was mostly the customers very friendly very rare a rude one came in."
good,"This job is not for someone that is trying to make a living.  The amount of  work for the pay is not as fair, but durable for someone needing a job while on college."
good,High volume of customers all day and night. learned how to deal with people. management is not the best. loved the customers that came back over and over
good,"I like  the  job  but  not  enough  hours. That  is  why  I  would  look  for  employment  elsewhere.I learned  alot  at  dollar  tree.  I was  mostly  a  cashier , but  did  alot  of  stocking  and  also  unloaded  trucks.  They  never  gave me  a  schedule. I didnt  like that  some  days  closing  . some  days   opening."
good,"Too much work and little time to get it done. Pay is not worth the amount of work that you have to do. Pay needs to go up or there will always be a huge turnover rate. Assists managers should receive benefits and should be full time if pay were to improve I think people should stay. I also think that there is never enough people working in the store there should be at least 2 people working the floor , and at least 2 cashiers so that management can get their work done with little interruption."
good,"This was a great first job for me, who had never been exposed to the retail environment before."
good,work life balance is hard. Somedays it is like working with high schoolers. Can be a rewarding job at times.Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,its an ok place to work. I wouldn't work here for longer than 2 months. Job isnt that fulfilling and the atmosphere isnt that good. Needed some extra cash but this wasnt worth my time
good,Been a while since I worked there. But as I remember it was a good started job. Helped me get to know what it was like to work. Management was very helpful and nice
good,The company has so many opportunities to be a great place to work. The biggest issue is that the location was twice the size of most locations but was given the same amount of manpower. I was hardly afforded the opportunity to perform my job duties on the floor because of having only one cashier and having to help them because of how busy the store was. I was advised to just ignore the line and focus on the other tasks but I can’t do that when I’m the highest ranking employee in the store along with only one other coworker.
good,"Good benefits only if your there for over a year. No structure for if you get sick or hurt , may or may not be out of a job. Over good atmosphere if your customer friendly."
good,Too much work and not enough pay compensation for the amount of work required. Employees we're pretty good to get along with. Didn't always take everyone's ideas do better run the store into consideration. Too many duplicated paperwork documents to document one aspect of the job.
good,Dollar tree is a good entry level warehouse where you can learn the basics about logistics. If you wish to learn more they do offer career advancement.
good,"easiest job i ever did very laid back "
good,"Easy environment, simple math involved with everything being a dollar including your paycheck at the end of two weeks. Perfect job for a teenager, kinda scary if you're still 30+ years old and okay with making a little over minimum wage."
good,"It was nice being able to take charge.Help my employees with whatever they need or didn't know,It would get busy and messy but it was worth it.Team wk"
good,managers are rude and cause drama with the cashiers i enjoyed the work but i didn't enjoy the pay its a lot for one person to handle with little to no experience
good,Didn’t really like it there. Didn’t get much hours. The people where nice I did enjoy the customers. I wouldn’t work there again because I’m out of school and need a full time job.
good,It's not a bad job if you're ever looking for something while you're at college. It's a good place to start off with. When I was at dollar tree. I didn't enjoy it as much.
good,"Part time employees can only work four hour shifts a day, only 1 ten minute lunch break, part time cashiers are pretty much running the store by themselves. Too much work and too little pay."
good,"Most of the time customers were regulars besides on holidays and days people receive their benefits. There is no outstanding expectations demanded of the workers, you get breaks on time and they are dependable, you are not asked to perform tasks that you are unable to do. manager and coworkers are understanding and work with a change in schedule."
good,"We had fun laughing  and greeting customers. It's a great job it's fun and easy."
good,"Great for second job."
good,"great co-workers, horrible clean up time, store always looked dirty, they love to promote within, no employee discount should be regardless if everything is a dollar"
good,"When they have good management it all runs smooth"
good,days at work use to be fun till the store been losing money and couldnt get enough hours cus people steal from the store also thats makig the company lose money everyday and everybody losing money and hours so thats not a good look at all plus i wasnt geting pay the right amount
good,"it's been along time ago.  management was understanding and helpful the pay was low.  the work was steady the store was usually very busy"
good,Stores should secure their items more and have specific labeled aisles so workers had exact placement  for example cups plates bowl etc.hire more employees and try not to fire them as if a continuous wave of new faces in the store.
good,The bargains are wonderful but the work environment  is quite stressful .  I think over the past few years  the company has stopped  looking at their employees as actual people  that matter but instead as easily  replaced
good,"They work too hard for little pay they want u to stock,  clean, serve customers, unload trucks deal with rude customers n coworkers, I was there for 2 or 3 years n didn't get a raise and no discounts"
good,no room for advancement or pay raise. standards set too high. management constantly pushes people to work harder with no incentives or positive reinforcement.
good,"working as a cashier is very fun and good experience,giving a good costumer service and super productive ,time was so short when the pick season comes"
good,Overall this job helped me learn a lot about managing a store. It was a very fast-paced environment. I enjoyed my time there as well as the other managers I worked with as a team.
good,Like all companies Dollartree has its good points and bad points. Average company to work for. You are in the lower level of retail and deal with a lower level of customers.
good,"Although the pay is small, and benefits only apply if you are full time, Dollar Tree is a good place to work. The stores that I have worked in have all been managed pretty well, but I have experienced management staff to have favoritism to certain employees"
good,Hours are not there to meet demand of jobs that need to be done in store.Results in high turn over rate of employees leaving to seek more hours elsewhere.
good,"Depending on the location, it is a good store to work at. Only problem is that it is only part-time, unless you're a favorite (All my co-workers are part-timers at my location, only 1-2 co-workers are full time. So... not really equal hours/pay) and there are no benefits. If you are looking for someplace just to make some cash, this is the place for you. Do not expect the customers to have positive attitudes because most of them don't. Cashiers make 12 an hour so a little above the minimum wage."
good,This is a decentbjob for high school student or someone needing extra cash but not a job to survive off of. This started off as a good job butbthe pay isnt sufficient to survive off of. The management at this location isnt up to par.
good,It's a very fast pace job. You have to cashier and when no one is in your line then you have to stock items that are in boxes. You have to keep up with the amount of boxes you get out. You need to get out as many boxes as you can while keeping an eye on your register to make sure no one has come up into your lane for check out. They also make cashier's come in and help unload truck. After truck is unloaded you jump straight into stocking what came off of truck. If you work nights your job is to make sure every aisle is straighten up and everything is in order while cashiering. Then before closing you clean the store. If you are over or under $3.00 in your register you will be written up. It can be a stressful job all while getting paid $7 an hour. And you get one 10 minute break during your shift.
good,"dollar tree as a whole was a good place to work.  upper level needs to ensure that the stores are clean and held to a certain standard. with the single price point, it can definitely be challenging to keep product on the shelf. would love to see more payroll hours allowed. or an overnight shift when there is not foot traffic."
good,"Working the overnight shift was simple yet tiring due to needs of daily activities and lack of sleep, but overall was a great experience which allotted me to gain further knowledge in fast paced stocker work"
good,"Is a fun place but fast on weekends and holidays,the only part I didn't like was the fact that you can't leave the premises for lunch,other than that is was ok"
good,"It's a job for for an high school and college student. If you are trying to be an manager, I will say go head there's nothing wrong with making more money."
good,Store manager relied on employees to do their tasks. Productivity was low due to lack of work from store manager. Policy was not always followed. Some employees got special favors.
good,The lack of pay is the only thing I’m not proud of I got 2 daughters an a apartment been there over a year hardest worker and they know it and still being paid 7.25 an hour
good,"It was difficult working at Dollar Tree because they don't allow many people working on a given shift.  This is how they keep the prices at a dollar.  It was hard to be a cashier, clean, stock, and organize all at once and it was expected of you."
good,"Dollar Tree is a good job if you're looking to make some extra money on the side (for a sales associate). The hours are part time, but the environment is low stress."
good,The job was easy with flexible hours. I did not like having to unload the truck but overall it wasnt bad. I did enjoy the people I worked with and great customers.
good,Overall it's a great starting job or retirement job. You can move up in the company. Honestly it depends on the store manager if the experience is good. I went through 4 managers in 3 years and the 4th is one that was brilliant and made work amazing.
good,Day at work it's the same as every one that works.
good,I am currently working as a part-time Operations Assistant Manager.
good,"The pay is not enough to survive on. You work all day and you're still broke. Meanwhile you are being rushed along and everything is done half way. You will do this every night for 8 days straight before you get one day off. You would be responsible for stocking the shelves , setting up displays, cleaning the store, office paperwork, ringing on the register, and maintaining the employees."
good,great until they put a 76 year old male chauvinist who thought only men should be managers. taking my acting store manager position away from me twice. the two men they replaced me with didn't last 6 months. Very harmful to moral lost some great employees over this choice.
good,The manager lies to you.  Most of the time you always had someone who did not show up or the managers were late. I like meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was not having enough employees to do the job.
good,"To be honest at first it was a fun job, but after working there for almost 5 years it began to bore me doing the same routine everyday. Overall a great job to start off if its your first job."
good,"It's not a hard job to do, but to be recognized or appreciated for a job well done is rare. There isn't much internal communication for employees and the management doesn't show thanks when the hard work is done right.  The day you have at work depends on what kind of a mood the manager or assistant manager is in that day."
good,I really loved working as  team player.We really enjoyed working all together on shift to shift. I enjoy working with the public and love to have a great time at work. I would come on and clock in and then count my drawer. Stocked around the counter area in between checking out customers. Wipe down work area. Management is what it is. Store manager wasn't the friendliest nor a real people person. But she was our boss and I never stepped out of bounds. All other managers did their jobs but as well made us feel great about the job we were doing! My most enjoyable part of my job was being interactive with people. I am a total people person. But I always get my job done.
good,"Dollar Tree was not my first choice in a job, it was just something that fell into my lap. I got the job right away and I have been working there for the past year and 3 months. During the holiday season this year I got a promotion of a seasonal manager and it wasn't a bad experience I learned more responsibility with having the job and I feel if you want a job to learn experience, it never hurts to start working in retail."
good,Dollar tree is a fast-paced environment with something to constantly keep you busy. Everyone was very kind and the management team was very organized.
good,It was just a job no room for advancement no overtime only during holidays hours change whenever they wanted I was just a job and I showed up whenever asked did my job and truly understood my position so no hard feengd it was a job
good,although the job was easy and enjoyable there wasnt many hours. this isnt a job that a person could work at and live off of. and very little opportunitity for pay raise
good,I would not recommend anyone to work for Dollar Tree as a Store Manager! They expect you to work all the time and get no compensation for any extra hours worked. You constantly get call ins and employees complaining about their pay and hours because they only get minimum wage and hours are VERY limited. They want the store manager to do it ALL!
good,"I worked during the Christmas holiday's and my job consisted of being very productive and it was fun interacting with the customers.  Also we had to do multiple task, like stocking the shelves putting away merchandise and gathering the carts from the parking lot."
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work. I learned more about using a cash register and handling money. The only reason I left was because of the management. The management was very poor when I worked there.
good,"Very hard job and they don't pay a lot. If its your first job then Dollar tree is a great place to start developing job skills and experience."
good,The environment is very nice. All the workers are nice and easy to get along with. The hours sucks. I quit because I wasn’t scheduled for two weeks. I really liked the manger though.
good,"Shifts often get cancelled without due notice, or shift hours are changed without warning, so you have to check the schedule as often as you can. Also, availability has been ignored multiple times, being scheduled on days or times when I had said that I was NOT able to work. Scheduling conflicts can be worked out, of course, but it would be much less of a hassle if they paid attention to availability in the first place."
good,"Each day is different.  There are many obstacles  to tackle.  Higher managers, outside of the store, have forgotten what it is like to work the stores."
good,"Dollar tree overworks its employeees but it doesn't provide enough working hours for any given part time employee. In most stores enployees are lucky if they get 15 hrs a week. Only a few assistant managers work full time, full time being only 32 hrs a week. "
good,It is a pretty good place to work if you only want to work part time hours. They are very flexible on the hours that you are able to work. The only bad thing id say is that you only can get part time and minamum wage unless you become a manager.
good,DT is the typical Corporate America Company in most ways. CEO gets a HUGE Bonus. When over budget which is ALL the time they cut corners affecting everyone's jobs.
good,Coworkers were lazy and didn't finish tasks so i usually finished tasks and help managers with whatever was needed at the time. Managers were great but terrible cashiers and stocking crew.
good,"Dollar tree is a nice place to work if you hardly want any hours, want to get paid 10 cents above minimum wage which is $7.35/hr. It's a nice place to work if you don't want to be able to do anything about people stealing from the store. If you want to be able to just watch people walk out the store with a backpack, purse, or bag full of things that haven't been paid for, without being able to say a word to them, feel free to work at dollar tree. They have the most ridiculous policy and rules I swear. It doesn't make any sense, they won't even call the police or stop them from coming in the store."
good,Always have something to do. Shelves always need to be restocked. Manager was friendly so were my coworkers. Wish benefits and vacation was offered. Other than that not a bad place to work.
good,"Overall my work experience at this company is great,  Wish they offered growth in the company. My manager was nice and patient.  Whenever we have a question she is available"
good,"if im at the register all day theres some moment where theres no one at all going through but some times there a lot of people and i do my job fast and effectively ."
good,"Being there under a year, management practices were unstable and unpredictable.  There were a lot of favoritism among certain employees. Employees who really wanted to work with far more experience, they were overlooked and given shorter or no hours, in retrospect, the ones who came and did what they wanted received all the hours, mediocre work and had bad attitudes."
good,Company went downhill fast after merger. Horrendous leadership from regional level and higher. Pay was decent but it does not compensate for incompetent Zone Vice president.
good,Could be a fun place to work if you’re motivated to work fast. Management is horrible and they don’t care about employees. Overall not too bad though.
good,"Dollar Tree is a productive place to work. From a manager outlook, there is never a dual moment. Managers are expected to pick up the slack when someone does not show up for work, or when there is no one to work. Assistant managers are advisers, stockers, and cashiers."
good,"Typical day I open set up tills count safe,"
good,"During a typical day at work I will help unload the trucks, and process the freight received. The stockroom is usually overstocked due the volume of merchandise received off two trucks weekly. I've learned how to work quickly, and efficiently. Management is pretty laid back, but works very hard. Our team at this particular store gets along pretty well. Camaraderie is pretty tight. The hardest part of the job is heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job is maintaining one's work area well stocked, and presentable."
good,"*4-5 hr shifts"
good,"Dollar Tree is a good first job, it is easy to catch on to the work. However, when I worked there, the manager did not pay attention to the hours I could not work and I had to miss several college classes due to this."
good,"My previous manager I worked with was a nice and sweet person. That is the only positive thing I like about working there. The payment was just very poor.  The inventory was always off because there are times sneaky customers would steal certain products. Dollar Tree is a state wide company, and you would think they would provide cameras or security. And I think every Dollar Tree sales associate would agree when I say that it is always hot in the store during the summer. I sometimes wonder if the founder of the company is just as cheap as the name..."
good,"It was okay working there, defninitely not for people trying to make some good money. Mainly for high school kids who are looking for their first job."
good,"Open store"
good,It's a good job for people with no kids and people who trying to get there life on track.They only care about them self in not others.You wrk to hard for what they pay
good,"While Dollar Tree isn't a terrible store to work for, it definitely depends on the managers and your co-workers. As a stockworker, you're not allowed to talk to other employees, and when unpacking boxes, you have to stock so many boxes per hour in order to not be written up."
good,It's a good part time job. And I love the team I work we we are like a family e help each other out and take care of each other. The company it self I don't think they care about us employee very much. They are out to make a dollar.
good,Not enough hours. To many pt positions You could only get hours by getting called in. You were just expected to do more and more. No accountability to those who repeatably called in or didn't do their assigned tasks.No coverage for manager breaks.Pay low for Asst Managers.
good,"Some coworkers are helpful and friendly. A backup cashier is always available. Hours are very flexible ,a little too flexible for me .    I felt as if a  manager at the store had  favorite associates."
good,"I liked working here. Manager was nice and understanding. I recommend this place if you're looking for experience. Personally, I would be somewhat careful because I was somewhat thrown into my position with ZERO experience behind the register."
good,"I liked working with Dollar Tree, for the most part. For the first year I had some very nice and helpful co workers and managers. A typical day could involve working at a cash register or cleaning an aisle. The thing I did most was face and clean aisles. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to stock a store. The hardest part of the job was definitely holidays and whenever corporate/higher ups came to visit. it always felt like a scramble to get this or that accomplished. The most enjoyable part was definitely, for me, sorting things to return to aisles and cleaning things up. There was definitely a great sense of accomplishment when everything in the store was completed on time before closing."
good,"Hard work environment, lacked appreciation for hourly associates. Poor training practices. stores are dirty and disorganized. Money is not properly invested at store level."
good,Great job for a part time summer job between semesters at college. Different shifts allows for flexible hours to schedule around appointments or other personal things.
good,"The managers a tweaker (smokes meth) jack, manager in Moscow idaho but in all its a pretty chill place to work, they finally got a company pay raise from $7.25 - $8.75 I think"
good,"Dollar tree has taught me a lot about customer service and about hard work. The management is amazing and you get recognized by your work, your work shows. But pay is low and the labor is very high."
good,I've only worked here for a few months but I'm liking it as a part time job since it does work with my school schedule. Very productive always something to do and a lot of creative thinking.
good,I really enjoyed working for then its just the pay was not affordable for living and the hours are not flexible but overall the managers are very sweet they also run out of bags so it make the job difficult every week
good,"Fast paced, hard work for store managers. Most of your employees are very underpaid. Overall, I great starting point for potential store management. Although the pay is low for all other positions, the chance for promotion is greater than any other business I know of."
good,Very flexible and great place to work. Manager was well trained and treated everyone very good. I work part time. The location was only 10 minutes away from my home at the time so it was very convenient. I applied and started to work in the same week.
good,"It's alright it's pretty stressful but"
good,I feel that working at the dollar tree was a great over all experience. I felt that the staff were not the best to work with but it gave me an idea what it is like to work with all sorts of people
good,The Only Truly bad things about dollar tree are the fact that there are very few hours to go around and the manager's inability to keep everyone in the loop.
good,"I actually worked on and off at dollar trees greenville location since 2007. I absolutely loved working there, which is why I returned multiple times. I always left on good terms but every time I returned I expected it to be the same enjoyable job it was when I started. Unfortunately after the crew I originally started with went our separate ways, everything went downhill. Without a good hardworking crew, the store was completely disorganized and everything was 10x harder for everyone, especially management. Katy Evans was my manager the whole time & she did her best but without teamwork it was hopeless. And the pay was not worth the struggle in my opinion."
good,"Typical day at work: register and stocking. Unloading the truck."
good,"this place is okay if you get the right store and the right team, its more fix others misstates and trying to pick up after people. hours flex all the time and change and some managers don't call you."
good,"Its been a while since i worked for the Dollar Tree, but management picks favorites, and can get too close to their employees. Cleanliness also needs to be improved."
good,"If you need extra cash it is a decent place to be. It's just cashiering, cleaning, stocking. Some of the coworkers are nice. The customers do not care since it's not expensive they think they can be trashy and rude."
good,fast pace and little pay.  they do not allow you to work more than a 5 hour shift per day. the also don't employ anyone over part time unless for management top insure they don't have to pay benefits to their cashiers and stockers. plus keeping under 5 hrs they don't have to provide a lunch break.
good,"I enjoyed working with the associates and loved the customers. "
good,not a bad place to work for its steady most of the time but it would be perfect for 18 and older high school students not so much of a job for those who have a lot of bills to pay who may live on their own.
good,"Coworkers are great, however upper management lacks compassion and faith, general and district managers refuse to work with employees on promoting from within, and would rather hire outside of company. Needs to promote from within and allow employees to feel secure in their position."
good,"It was a good place to work, but there was little room for advancement. They would hire anyone but the training wasn't very good.  a typical day for me would be covering cash when needed but mostly stocking shelves, or setting up new displays."
good,"count tills and safe , get store ready to open at 9 am . clean ,great customers , train new cashiers, count my till and go home . freight was the hardest thing . got to meet a lot of different people."
good,"All jobs were part-time, except for assistant managers and managers. I would have preferred to either be at the register all the time or stocking all the time, not a mixture of both.  There were times when I wished I had more hours in a pay period.  Managers need to tell employees the correct way to stock items rather than have them done wrong and then the employee is reprimanded .  I learned how to operate a cash register.  The manager wasn't always the most helpful when it came to scheduling."
good,"Although nothing was said i feel like the supervisor i sometimes felt a little annoyed when i would as for help but she is a nice lady. maybe I'm just a little insecure on my work.. I do wish I had more hours, and I do wish the pay was more, considering I work part-time."
good,"It got hard at time working front or back register sometimes but I manage to get the job done. Greeting customers and taking orders. If I had a problem, I just go get the manager."
good,"Great place to start your career in retail merchandising.  people are very nice, the hours are monday-fridaay,  the pay could be a lot better depending on your position."
good,It is very easy work. The training took less than one shift. The pay is just over minimum wage. Its not a stressful work environment. A few of the managers could use improvement.
good,"Very stressful, you only get enough payroll to have yourself and a cashier in the building at one time. Crazy expectations without the man hours to complete the task and the expected to stay until it's complete."
good,"I work at Dollar Tree currently, my manager Jeremy is amazing and couldn't ask for a better manager. Most of the employees are friendly and willing to help. Customers are a little lack luster and can be pretty rude."
good,Although they are a good place to work. They show minimal care and concern for the needs of the employees. No motivation to want to work there. 8 to 12 hour work weeks
good,"A bad manager can take a good staff and destroy it. You will never be able to have a functional private life, as your hours will be all over the place. You can get suspended for the boss being in a bad mood. It's OK for a ""need it now"" job, not OK for a life long career."
good,It was very easy work. But not enough hours and is minimum wage. It was always short staffed. Management was very lazy and did not care about other. Only got a 10 minute break and it wasnt paid
good,"Working at dollar tree was a relaxed but quick paced kinda job, you would either be cashier or cleaner or even both if it's short staffed. But overall it was fun depending on who you work with"
good,"I do enjoy working for Dollar Tree but some improvement is needed.Maybe with the increase in minimum wage, Dollar Tree will be able to retain its employees longer. Lots of people no show quite often. There is always too much back stock. The insurance for employees is not that great either or no benefits really. There really aren't break rooms. But I do love seeing what awesome merchandise is sold and how amazed people are with what good deals there are"
good,It was a good experience working for the company and you can advance if you have a good ethnic. The mangers will work with the scheduling if you have some schooling.
good,"Did a lot of Managerial duties as an entry level cashier. Required skills to work there are below minimal. Easy, menial work. Pay raises are nearly non existent."
good,I would recommend Dollar Tree to anyone looking for their first job or a job to do while in College. It requires minimal experience and is pretty slow paced. Dollar Tree is a good temporary and part-time job for when you need a little extra cash. It is not a career/
good,"I enjoyed most aspects of this job. At the time I worked at DollarTree, my kids were very young. I worked very long hours all days of the week. I missed my kids."
good,"Fast Easy place to work , everyone is helpful , nice clean place , customer friendly , great deals on merchandise , all around nice place to be , very nice area , business is good."
good,"-Very old process and ancient systems.  "
good,"a typical day at dollar tree work was slow and easy wasn't really that busy but working on holidays do get busy working on the register. What I learn was how to  Assist customers by providing information and resolving their complaints.Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change. Management was okay , work place culture is okay as well all co workers got along. In my opinion there wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting the customers and helping them with what they need."
good,the store was clean and stocked nicely and they always asked if I needed help and they knew where their things where in the store didn't have to ask for someone else to show them where it was.
good,"Typical day for cashier is stocking front end, while ringing customers , answering phone calls, blowing up balloons, cleaning vacuuming , returning items to their correct spot in store  .multitasking is a must ."
good,"The job itself was good for someone like me in college during a summer break who needed to make some extra money, but from an overall standpoint, the job wasn't much of anything to be self sufficient with. There was quite a bit of disorganization when it came to impromptu scheduling if changes were made, and the staff was very much underwhelming which came to be a gripe whenever the store was busy. The environment wasn't bad, but other than that, the job left much to be desired."
good,"Laid back work environment but pay not worth all of the work needed done"
good,"Just a simple job with no real benefits and no opportunities, perfect for a high school kid. You don't really do much and are a slave to routine which is expected."
good,There was moments when the job was quick paced but most of the time it was pretty chilled. There was always a mess in the isles so I was always sent to clean and restock the shelves.
good,"The only way I would work here as someone who hasn't before, only if I was in school. You sometimes didn't get a full 30 minute lunch because there wasn't enough employees at one time"
good,This place was great to work for except when new management happened. This lady was crazy so she made my work life miserable. So I wouldn't advise working here.
good,"Some room for advancement however advancing would not allow for a good home/work balance as there is a lot required for management per shift. Any member other than management is not allowed full-time hours, therefore, no benefits are offered. Open availability is preferred so the schedule would not be set. Overall a decent company to work for but not long-term unless you are a part of the management team."
good,"Dollar Tree was okay.The Head Manager was hateful at times, and the general managers didn't know what they were doing. The didn't give a lot of hours but always called people in to work 3 hours and leave."
good,they hired a bunch of us to set the store up for grand opening and told us most of us would be kept on well instead they lied and only kept the people who worked at the family dollar there before they closed they only hired us to set up the store and that was it
good,The management there was a single function focus. Getting products on shelves and out the door was the manager's only real measure of success. Other than that the management was sloppy and usually fell on assistant managers for day to day issues.
good,"It's a really nice part-time or holiday job. At the location I was at management was nice and fun, but not so lenient that work wouldn't get done. The other bonus was that since everything was $1 the customers never really got overly sensitive or serious about the products. Over all as long as you aren't counting on this as a full-time job, and you can get to work on time this is the perfect job for you."
good,"Everyday when you come in, you always have to keep moving. From checking out people in your lines to keeping the front of the store clean for the customers.  You are not allowed to be still for a moment or else the manager is going to get on you to do some more work."
good,It's a pretty good atmosphere except for the store manager. Their not the nicest person to work with they pretty much make you do everything and they don't help out that much.
good,Dollar was a busy place I helped get the store open stocking the shelve and later was a cashier.  I needed more hours after being laid off.i enjoyed working with all the staff at Dollar Tree.  However was disappointed when lay off came.
good,They don't give you a lot of hours. Unless they really like you. its a fast pace job but they don't want you to call for back up unless he line gets to a certain size.
good,"If you want a job with 5 hours per workday, definitely apply here. The pay is legal minimum wage and only the stockers get full-time hours.  The only way to move up in the company is to become Assistant Manager then transfer stores."
good,"The only thing about Dollar tree that I like was the customer's.  Meeting new people. Helping the staff getting started with the day. You could call and ask questions about anything, you could only email and wait days for an answer"
good,"This is an ok company to work for, but not intended for a long term career. The upper management environment is not reflective of a happy company. The overall tone implies that all of its employees are stealing from them."
good,Dollar tree was a job I loved. I got to know the regular customers that came on a daily basis. However the hours were bad n some management was unprofessional but I loved my job.
good,I didn't like the hours or the people I worked with. I wasn't making enough and I didn't keep busy do to lack of work. I was also going to school full time which made it hard to work also.
good,"It's been a long time since I worked at Dollar Tree. Training was just watching other employees on register.Recovery was a a big priority. Customer's thought that because items were only $1 that it was ok to make a mess. As a young adult it great way to learn product placement, time management and how to run a small scale store."
good,Fun to see all the different types of people that come through the store and a good place to work for a part time job you definitely won't have trouble with getting too many hours. With the right manager it can be a fun place to work.
good,I currently am an assistant manager for the dollar tree I enjoy my job for the most part but there is a lot of things that go on that I personally do not agree with and nothing gets done about it especially the favoritism that goes on between some employees and district management
good,"Arrived at work to help manager open the store.  opening the register, greeting the customers, stocking, cleaning, answering the phones. The most enjoyable part of the day was engaging with the customers & employees. Management was easy to work with the exception of problematic scheduling."
good,Fast paced work environment with a variety of customers and great variety of good buys. Good place to work while attending college full time.
good,"Great short term job. Very good for people just starting out or students. Does not have much room for growth, low pay, and poor hours. Its a lot of hard work. not for everyone."
good,considering I am still currently employed with Dollar Tree I find it in my best interest not to answer this since I would not be able to offer an honest evaluation of my employment experience and not have the fear that it could potentially cause harm.
good,"There was always something to do at Dollar Tree, not just stand at the register waiting for customers to come. We had to clean, restock items, and make sure to hustle your way back to the register when you saw a customer in line."
good,The workplace is very friendly and easy to get used to. Management is very open and hears you out. All in all a good place to work. Other than that the pay is not desirable and is the reason I'm seeking new employment. They offer part-time positions and being in my current life position I am seeking a full-time job.
good,"Hard actually, and low pay. No changes for promotion. Coworkers are friendly. Alother of customers complain and even threaten you, even if you have done nothing wrong. alot of craziness. Have to vigilant."
good,It is an okay place to start your working career but not a place you wan to stay for long. The work was not very difficult and it will also teach you how to multitask.
good,"Not enough pay, looking for more opportunities and more pay. I work my hardest and I can back it up. I deserve something great! The team is great to work with though."
good,Dollar Tree is an easy workplace for anyone who prefers a slow paced environment. The management can be very unprofessional and mean. The pay is very low since it's minimum wage. You are also told what to do periodically.
good,"The work environment was fast and friendly. I enjoyed working with my team and it was an easy job. However, I had to look for more opportunities since I prefer to work more hours and be more productive."
good,I enjoyed working at the dollar tree I learned a lot. it was a fast paced environment.  often room for extra hours if you are willing to travel to other stores.
good,"Liked working part-time, meeting new people everyday. Didn't  have much training for job. I was a seasonal worker and wasn't told when the job was over with."
good,Lots of pressure around payroll. No hours to get stock to the floor means less in sales. Its a visious cycle of DT greed causing the issue.Someone needs to get it through to the CEO you have to spend money to make money.
good,I would get to my job sight sign in and check with my supervisor on our daily task . commence to load U-boats and start condensing to make room for the new freight that is what I found to be difficult we had to stock 44-46 boxes of merchandise in an hour.  The most rewarding time of the day is when I would get a smile from the customer knowing I helped meet their needs.
good,"Ringing up items at the register and handling money, or selling household products on the sales floor, can't say much it was an okay job."
good,"- always something new as in new paperwork, interesting customers and jobs to complete"
good,"the management wasn't great , but i enjoy the job and coworkers overall clean store. part time hours was always something to do. was busy sometimes nice flow during the day"
good,I like to keepy hands busy and I like to help people and I like to clean up and re stock the shelves . I like the short breaks that I don't be lazy on a long one
good,Work was slightly interesting hours were tedious overnight shifts due to Classes co-workers were helpful and a typical day at work was smooth
good,I loved working with the staff and the customers. Everyday was different but in a good way. I would recommend to work here if this would be your first job.
good,"It's a good starter job but long term is only good if your management and higher. Labor is the word but 20 hours per week does not cut it in America. Employees are awesome, they make you want to stay. Living on just above $200.00 a week is only chump change."
good,"It was very fast paced and the customers made the highlight of my workday. The hardest part was the pay, you do a lot physical labor for almost minimum wage."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, but they don't give a lot of hours and the store is kind of dirty. I wish I stayed at my other job instead."
good,The customers made you want to come to work and stay there all day. Nice people. Pleasant staff. Well mannered and well behaved. If I didn't move so far away I would still be working for them.
good,depending on the store location it can be very hard to enjoy working. it is a seasonal job so you don't get very many benefits. They do have flexible scheduling .
good,"I worked hard on my job. Loved our team and when a new Manager came on the job our store kindof fell apart. Some of the team left for other jobs, it was unreal! "
good,work was usually fun but they critic on almost everything you do wrong instead of say what you did right and then helping train on what you did wrong. most of the time there is no training and they throw you into jobs that you are unprepared for.
good,Need to give more hours in better pay to the people that has been working for them for years In can also better management other then that God place to work
good,Dollar Tree is a growing company with lots of on job training and opportunities to be promoted. The pay is minuminal and most skills I had to develop on my own over the years
good,"Not something I wanted to do, or where I wanted to be.  Wasn't quite used to such strenuous work at that time in my life.  Made the best, and gave my best."
good,"Its a busy store  and a typical day would consist of multitasking stalking shelves and serving customers ,unshopping and keeping the store clean and tidy .counting your till at the end of a shift ."
good,"There was absolutely no support from the district manager. Aside from that aspect, the company is a great place to work."
good,"when I get to work i count my drawer. Then head to my position during my work hours I cashier, bag, recover and restock. when my work day is over I clean my work are then head home."
good,"Dollar tree Stores inc was nice  part time job.the company have good price,and nice variety of product"
good,I was constantly coming into work with long lines. It always seemed like they were understaffed with one cashier's register open. The management was always tied down and never available in anyone required assistance.
good,"Although i made tons of friends, sonic was a high school job. It had its ups and downs and little flaws but, it was a great experience. Loved the time i had there."
good,"The store I worked at went through a bunch of bad managers, They dont keep their word, very bad management skills, they do not take care of their employees."
good,"Morning Shift: Counted the safe as soon as I walked in, set up the registers for the day, looked at the daily agenda for what had to be done for the day, stocked majority of the time, while being the back up cashier. "
good,"You do not want to work here, trust me. Cashiers don't last here long, usually a couple months....I wonder why???? Being a cashier is fun, the coworkers are great. The customers are sweet most of the time. The hardest part about the job is putting up with an overbearing manager that publicly criticizes her employees out loud in front of the customers. Glad it's over. Wish I could manage my own store. I would treat my employees right, talk to them, not at them. And not do stuff to them behind their back and outright lie about it then put you in as unrehirable when you quit!!!!!!! Making it hard for me to find another job! When they are the one that caused this problem in the first place!!!!"
good,"a typical day at the dollar tree would consist of me helping customers find merchandise in the store, ringing them up, and cleaning up the store."
good,its a pretty normal job simple and easy low hours and pay but its a dollar store so that's to be expected management is pretty good they look after there employees and don't micro manage you just do your job and you wont have any issues.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers, operating a cash register and making sure my work space was tidy and organized."
good,It is a good job temporarily but not what would satisfy me long term. The pay is not great but the people you work for are pleasant. The schedule and the hours fluctuates each week.
good,"I really enjoyed working with my coworkers, but it was challenging to work when we were constantly understaffed. I was left to manage a store with little workers for up to 5 hours at a time. Management made it difficult for us to do our jobs to our fullest potential and offer customers the best service that they deserved."
good,The typical day at work would be to help all customers with checking out. I would also help with the inventory. The management was very great because they would help anytime the cashiers got backed up.
good,"Typical Day at work for me was Opening or closing of the store , Taking care of delivery's that have come in for the day , Checking E-mails , Refrigerator and Freezer Temps and log those Numbers Stocking shelves , Getting Cashiers Tills and Money counted  and When closing Getting the store clean and Ready for Customers for the next day and also taking nightly Deposits to the bank . Co-works > treat them as you would like to be treated , RESPECT , 1 for all and all for 1 . And that also goes for our Customers always Greeting them with a smile and Hello and thank you . Hardest part of my job I guess would be very little time to do so much , but never stop trying to do my best and give 110% .And Not having Benefits . The Most enjoyable part of my job was working with the employees and the public , A smile and a kind word goes a long way , Word of mouth can make or break your business , always treat other with respect and kindness ."
good,Overall a good company to work for and quite challenging. very high passed and a lot of hours. but you are treated very well.
good,"The people at the dollar tree were great to be around and talk to it was a very friendly environment but corporate never gave enough hours so I was working 8 hours a week sometimes, and the quota for unpacking boxes and stocking the shelves was ridiculous to the point were some of the workers had to cut corners and not do their job properly. I ended up being pulled aside once because I didn't cut corners and took the time to make sure to do my job right."
good,"An average day consists of greeting and assisting customers"
good,It was a nice place to work when you didn't have to keep hiring people because the new ones you hire can't do a job. It's nice if you are 18 or older to have a job instead of having to work full time but if you live in a tourist town there aren't alot of people to hire. Sometimes you have to work 12 days or more until you can get a day off.
good,Work extremely hard and get paid very little.The managers get paid a tad bit more than a cashier and they are required to take on way more responsibility so its not really worth it at the end of the day. No benefits or advancements.
good,Dollar Tree is your typcial retail job. Mostly hire part time. Dealing with customers was a double edged sword. I enjoyed it most of the time. But you also would get rude people.
good,Company should compensate employees better for the remarkable job they do. also establiish a better relationship with it's employees.
good,"Typical day at work was great did what i had to do."
good,"A typical day at Dollar tree is spent cleaning and straightening the Store isles, and helping direct costumers and then retrieving store carts."
good,my co workers was very friendly and easy to get along with . the hardest part of this job was dealing with the boss mood swings an very disrespectful costumers .
good,"The job was fun at times, but what I really enjoyed was building relationships with the employees and vendors. I thought there was room to grow within the company, instead they would rather hire outside management at a higher rate than what I was making. Only to have those same people leave after a few weeks. The store I managed at had at least 3 new managers within my time of being there. I did try to find the fun at work though. Nothing that was like having a party, but the kind of fun that kept my employees engaged with the work. In all, the customers respected me for being honest when resolving complaints. I felt the challenge there wasn't enough to keep me around much longer."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the people at Dollar Tree.  The tasks required of my position gave me enough challenge with the organization needed, speed required to complete the tasks and ability to speak with the customers."
good,It was a very demanding job. High turnover  rate with little or no job advancement. The one thing I can say about Dollar Tree is that every day is different because of the customers.
good,"Ringing up customers quickly"
good,"I learned how to use the cash register accordingly, how to count the money from my till at the end of the day, and how to do stock. My hours, and the days I worked, were usually scattered around the week, despite the times and hours in which I put in so that it could work around my schedule. The management team is OK, nothing too special. My co-workers were fantastic, a jolly group of people that I could rely on. The hardest part of work that I would say, was having to mop and sweep the entire store with only 2 hours to spare. ON TOP of having to watch the register sometimes. Please note that none of this was electric. But the most enjoyable part, was the 10 minute breaks. Just getting to relax. Other than that, I hate it there."
good,"You have to be at least 18 to work here, but its a great job for a teen in their senior year of high school or a student who is about to go off to college. I have been a cashier for over a year now and I have not had a raise nor have been promoted. I am a part time college student and work here part time. I do not see myself here for very long. I make $7.30 an hour which isn't enough to support me. I don't have any kids but a family that does include children wouldn't be able to be supported of this alone. I feel like the managers make you do most of the work and the customers are really rude. You only get a 10 minute break. the managers have forgotten to give me a break a few times that I have been here which they can get in trouble for if they don't give you one."
good,Cut hours every other week. friendly staff. great work environment. If your closing hours you have minimum time to clean the store and successfully cash out customers in a polite and timely manner.
good,The hours were awful and the manager was not very nice at all. It wasnt' very neat or organized at all. I wish a different manager worked there while I was there because I may have stayed longer and enjoyed working.
good,"The job required a lot of working together with other co-workers and dealing with people."
good,I worked there for four years and got a promotion which I had more duties but my pay was bad. I loved my co-workers but the company didnt have its workers interest at heart.
good,"Not enough hours need full time employment, not any room for advancement for better pay. Working condition are very good. Overall work experience is good."
good,"Opening and closing procedures, weekly payroll and schedule building. Daily walks to identify opportunities within the store. "
good,"A typical day at work requires getting my stockers going with my daily plan. Count our store safe and cash registers. Do a store walk checking for empty areas and endcaps. Conduct a store walk checking for empty packages, door seals on all back doors, proper osha procedures being followed. I would then stock the empty areas making the store look full and impactful. Tend to all the cashiers calls assisting them when they become backed up on register, get them change, and pull drops from their drawers, and relieve them for breaks and lunches when needed. Check daily for important emails and respond in a timely manner. Check in vendors and also start my plan for the following day checking in with my stockers and their productivity for the day. The hardest part of my job is juggling all these tasks by yourself. I'm definitely not afraid of hard work, but sometimes the company's expectations are a little crazy when its just me and a cashier. The best part of my job is all the wonderful new people i get to meet some of which have became life long friends, and merchandising."
good,Working at Dollar Tree taught me to deal how to work a register and how to be patient and deal with costumers. The other employees were nice and easy to get along with.
good,"it was fun to work there. 25 hours a week only, and you start out at part time, if you do well then you get more hours. I don't suggest stocking unless your a morning person. I suggest only working at one if you are laid back personality and get along well with others. (Because that is what it is like) Cashier is much funner then stocking. Stocking in the early mornings was boring and I was always out by the time the store opened everyday."
good,Opening the store. Getting the employees on their day. Receiving trucks and remerchandising to make room for new product. Management was hard for working together. Co-workers were great. Never a hard part of my day. I love to do the remerchandising.
good,"I am a current employee at Dollar Tree Distribution Center 3 in Joliet, IL. This is not a bad job, but it IS hard work that can sometimes be extremely frustrating. As well, there is a LOT of overtime (mostly due to being understaffed on 3rd shift). Lately, we have been working 6 days a week with the choice for voluntary overtime (on top of the mandatory extra day). Management makes some  bass-ackward decisions too. Sometimes they make decisions that can only make you say ""Whaaaaa...???"". "
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with employees that you cannot get to show up to work. I manage a store where all my associates appreciate me and work hard for me. Most of all they love working with me. The most enjoyable part is I like being there.
good,Each store is different but I enjoyed my time working there. THe only thing I would like to improve is the consistently of my work schedule. and more hours.
good,"I was frequently on register alone and since everything's a dollar,the lines are very long all day. I used to get 3-4 hours then suddenly just one day."
good,"Key Holder, Supervised and directed staff, daily bank deposits customer service Conducted daily cashier audits, stocked merchandise.."
good,"It has it's days. For me the best days were the slow ones with nice customers. The rest were just rocky, bad customers taking their frustration out on you. i met some really great people though so i can't complain too much."
good,"I enjoyed working at dollar tree, management is amazing and really understanding.  I have enjoyed working with diverse cultures."
good,"I clock in and they assign me a register. I help customers with things that they can not find in the store. When the lines are not long I go on the floor and clean up after people that may have left something where it shouldn't have been. I make sure that the sodas and shelves are stocked up for the customers yo have a verity of things to chose from. I learned how to deal with rude customers and to keep my composure and apologize even if I am not in the wrong.The management team is great they care about here employees and try to work with them the best way possible. My co workers are great team players if one of us have a problem we try to help the best way we can we never let one of our employees feel like they have no support.My job is not hard at all its one of the easiest jobs i worked at in my life. The thing I enjoy most about my job is that I feel like we are family and they have my back no matter what, and also seeing these customers grateful for my assistance"
good,"Enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, good for a fast paced, busy environment.  enjoyed my co-workers, rules are all laid out and compliance easy to follow"
good,The manger shows too much favoritism and if she doesn't like you she wont give you hours. I worked hard and I only got 4 hours.
good,"Dollar Tree is a very demanding job with low pay and no benefits. Typically days are very fast paced. Dollar Tree has made a stronger worker out of me. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customer, who want a better deal on products. Most enjoyable part is see a customer happy."
good,"My co-workers were great.  However, this job was a dead end.  The pay was no very good and there was little room for advancement."
good,"I loved working at the dollar tree. I worked there while I went to school for my associates degree. very flexible schedule."
good,a typical work day at dollar tree consist of face store due to each item being priced at $1 the store is frequently shopped assisting co-workers with back up cashiering duties which i would say is the hardest part
good,A typical day at would be me coming in getting straight to work stocking varies items throughout the store as fast as i can to make everything looks nice and full for customers. I work the cash register sometimes as well in which I'm very quick at ringing and greeting customer at the same time making sure no one feel like they're not important but being considerate of others acknowledging them.
good,The company keeps cutting the budget and payroll. This is a bad way to do business. Customers are the best.
good,loved to interact with the costumers and i enjoyed working with my co-workers
good,Review monthly income. Order new inventory stock items. Incorporate leadership skills and training new employees.
good,"I loved working here, I moved up quickly. It was a fast paced work place and they cared about the employees."
good,"•	Ensured orders are entered in the P.O.S system accurately"
good,I spent most of my day at the cash register at night I would vacuum the store and return product to its proper area. I learned that items priced at $1 brings many customers and generates a lot of money. Management was very nice and taught me to adapt to a fast paced environment. The co-workers would stay to themselves but were fairly nice. The hardest thing about this job was to quickly check-out the many customers to keep the line from building up. Everything was actually a dollar.
good,need full time instead of part time. need more pay than $7.35 an hour
good,"Employees and management got along really well. But this is not a company I would recommend to retire with. I worked for this company for over 3 years and only received two raises. I was always on time and never called off, as well as went above and beyond my job description. The regular customers that did come in were surprised I wasn't already a manager because they knew what a strong, reliable worker I was. I enjoyed being a cashier with this company because the store always stayed busy which made time fly by. Overall, this company offered a nice work environment, but is not a place for growth."
good,"A usual work shift is about 4.5 hours with a 10 minute break.  You have to work the Cash register, Stock merchandise, sort go backs, assist customers with request and blow up balloons if requested all at the same time with little to no help from management.  Co-Workers are nice and but you rarely work with anyone.  Each Shift is usually just one Sales associate and a manager."
good,"Dealing with customers daily, providing outstanding customer service, assisting other associates with stocking, maintain store appearance"
good,Was given only around five hours a week.  Plus was asked to do the manager favors during my lunch break.  Was never given a chance to get situated in the job.  The job was only seasonal.
good,"I really enjoyed helping customers with their purchases and setting up displays of featured items. Co-workers were great. I enjoy helping co-workers and appreciate their help, but this company (or maybe just the manager I had) did not allow you to help out. You had to stick to what you were assigned to do."
good,"Very fast pace organization.  Through this company I have learned that the only way to have success, is to plan it."
good,"A day at dollar tree would consist of cashiering, stocking, and answering customer questions. And assisting to resolve complaints."
good,I loved being busy. The coworkers were ok to work with. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,"I think that the job was ok"
good,Its a good job for when you are young but after a while when you can not get another job with in the company it gets frustrating.
good,greet customers and provide assistance when needed. ring out and bag items really love helping people and get feed back like i have  done an awesome job for them  love working in a fast store
good,"benefits were good,leadership could have been a lot better"
good,"A typical day would be meeting with the team, what work needs to get done then working with the typist to make sure the orders are right. I learned how to get the job done and interact with people. management was fair but, the hardest part was when we were shorthanded and the most enjoyable part is making the work place enjoyable."
good,opening and closing store and counting deposit from end of shifts
good,Hardest part of the job was dealing with managers that did not communicate things that were needed to do the jobs. Also had difficulty with management not following dr restrictions because they want the job done either way.
good,I enjoyed my job even though it was seasonal. I just wish i was given more of a chance to advance.
good,"A typical day at work was 5-8 hours, I learned how to run dollar tree's cash register and count down the drawer. The management was not as organized and I would have liked and it was really all over the place but overall everyone I worked with was really supportive, nice, and always had positive attitudes. The hardest part of my job was trying to unload shipments from the truck. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers find their products and get them in and out of the store as efficiently as I knew how."
good,typical day would be stocking shelves with products from the delivery truck. Learned to manage time a little better. management was okay.. were more by the book which was good. Co-workers were great to get along with. Hardest part of this job was not getting enough hours to pay bills if its the only source of employment. Most enjoyable part was that you could balance your work/ personal life.
good,Please refer to the brief statement above. I worked at Dollar Tree durimg a transitional timeframe. It was satisfactory; but I only worked there for a short period time
good,"Be at work at 4:30am to 8:00pm every day even holidays.You come in and either work main line, starches, short order or salads all day.The best thing about it was the people I met.The hardest thing about it was the inspections cause we cleaned and cleaned and cleaned some more but I learned alot I mean I learned everything!"
good,You have a lot of time to think about how much you hate your job and what else you would like to do with your life.
good,"Nice place to work, but the hours and benefits werent.  You have to be fast and very reliable when working here."
good,Not much opportunity for advancement. Long hours with minimal payroll hours for scheduling associates.
good,"One day while I was working I had to train this person on how to do truck unload on truck day. As we are talking I explained everything that I felt needed to be said before truck arrived. I show her how the company wants things done and what the Store Manager wants his store to look like. The truck came and unload was good then we needed to start the promotional wall which was empty for summer toys to go up on it. I told kept telling trainee that she could jump in and help at any time she started helping but was extremely slow. You can not be slow especially on truck day. I then became slow trying to do both jobs while she just starred at me. I was thinking of something to keep her focused on what her task were because I new if big boos seen her he would let her go and I new she could do it. I then set everything up for her I lined it all up and put pegs up designed the whole thing, she just had to come and put the product on the pegs on the wall. I left her doing that while I finished my project in a hour and she should have been done by now. She was not done yet, I was getting upset because he was going to come check up on us. I said we have to pick it up or else he will not let you come back tomorrow. There fore, I still new she cloud do it. I tried something else I had another coworker come in and assist with me he and I were moving in circles around her my boss called me to do something else I said to her girl okay this is the deal u pick it up and you will have a job tomorrow if u don't he wont let u come I promise you this, so please try work together and make it work"
good,Dollar Tree was a typical store job to work. It was ok. Work was normal cashier and stocking.
good,It was a good place to work i only worked there for a month to help set up the store for opening.
good,everyone i work with is super friendly. the customers are also friendly. i havent had anything to complain about yet. i love my job in all honesty. it is very easy! standing your whole shift is the only downfall.
good,"I really enjoyed most parts of my actual job, freight manager.  I learned their system really quickly as I have been in management & retail roles in most of my jobs.  I enjoyed working with other ASM's, cashiers & stockers in which I believe they also enjoyed working with me.  They were the most enjoyable part of the job because they respected my position and would do a good job because they could talk to me & I would give them respect of listening.  The hardest part of the job is keeping the good people that don't want management or doesn't qualify because the only way to give a pay increase for a decent wage is for them to be management."
good,very busy especially on the days when the manager wasnt in. extremely high turnover rate due to abusive nature of manager. co-workers were a pleasure to work with.
good,"I was mainly a cashier, and also regularly stocked the shelves and rotated product."
good,Liked it but not enough hours.  Did enjoy my duties and responsibilities.
good,Good job for teens/college students. Very repetitive work.
good,Was't a hard job at all. I had to help them move there store into there new location and get everything set up.
good,"My current location is great compared to when I was with this  company in Danville, Va"
good,"ran a cash register and stocked shelves"
good,"was main cashier stocked shelves sorted go backs answered customer calls, set up displays made announcements, store-wide,  tended front end of store."
good,"Overall, I gained 11 years of retail and merchandising experience, and made many friends."
good,First I would set-up cash drawers with correct amount to start shift. Then I would fill out daily work assignment sheets with duties for the day. The people that I worked with were very nice and professional.The hardest part of the job was theft and detaining people. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping people.
good,Dollar Tree is ok to work for just trying to find something better.they dont have benefits and the pay rate is not good but I really enjoy working with The public and meeting people.Im a very friendly person and customers are th best
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is busy. Alot of customers come in to get most important things they may need at home or for school supplies. I have learned to speak up more in a work place, not to be as shy and quiet. Management is alright could be a little better at times. There really is not a hard part in the job as long as you have fast pace and you are willing to learn different ropes. The most enjoyable part in my job was seeing my customer leave with a smile and saying that I am a very happy person with great customer service skills and that they would love to come back and shop at dollar tree just to see my face."
good,This job showed me how to be friendly to customers. I also learned how to handle money.
good,out of all the hard work that the employes do i think it should be better benfits that should be given
good,My typical day at work consist or stocking shelves and assisting customers in any way possible with a fun and friendly staff. I love working with other people to help achieve the greater good of the company..
good,unload trucks when shippment comes in i learn about conditioning an the store manager have a positive attitude an my fellow co worker was helpful i enjoy my job just was no enough hors
good,A typical day at work includes unloading the truck and stocking out the merchandise I like my co workers but I think the store would run better if we had better management
good,Decent place to work but doesnt pay very well and seems to be always understaffed.
good,"A typical work day is starting out slow day at the register, stocking shelves to becoming very busy with only myself as a cashier until help arrives. I learned that the computers they use to handle cash and credit transactions is complicated and that they need to simplify their computers to be able to help speed up transactions faster for the best customer experience that they desire. Hardest part of the job is not having enough help to deal with the overflow of customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with people on  a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at work isn't bad. Basic to say the least. Hours vary by store production. Store management depressed and over worked, Assistant managers knowledgeable."
good,Store Managers do not get any kind of break with this company. Prepare to work 55-60 hours a week and salaried at 45
good,"It was a job honestly. Fun people to work with. Hours were not steady, pay not so great. Benefits not there unless you worked full time. I did like the fast pace enviroment. I like staying busy so this was a demanding job."
good,Dollar Tree was a fun place to work. I was a cashier so I rang customers items and bagged them. The co-workers were friendly and the managers were also friendly. The hardest part of the job was getting everything on a list done before closing time because the store was so busy.
good,"One of the major things I have learned to do is get a lot done quickly. You have to pace yourself and prioritize your daily activites according to the need of the store. Mornings are the best time to get out freight and process paperwork, because they are the slowest sales time of the day. I have learned to deal with the public confidently and politely, which is something I really enjoy doing. Also I have learned to recieve vendors, deposits, ordering, managing up to 4 people per shift and many other useful skills."
good,I enjoy everyone that i work with.. Nicely ran store.. Started as seasonal help and was able to stay on after the holiday was over. Would like it better if I got more hours in a week..
good,"Losding/unloading,stocking retail items.5 hour shifts,co-workers fun to work with."
good,"I would stock the sunglasses in between customers. I would also do go backs, (items customers did not want), which is re stocking them in their right place. I would shop the store, take an empty basket and grab misplaced items and take them to the go backs department. My co-workers were very nice and helpful any time i needed help or had a question. The hardest part of the job was during the christmas season and keeping up with the customers in the check out. The most enjoyable part was getting to interact with the customers and help them out."
good,"Went in for first shift and prepared the store for customers, stocked shelves, waited on customers. I learned how to properly assemble products. Management was AWESOME! , Co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was leaving my 3rd shift job and coming to work here 1st shift only because sometimes people who were scheduled to work wouldn't show up and then I was stuck there even longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around nice and awesome people."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree was very exciting, I learned how to manage different task on daily basis, managament was good, co-workers got along great. The hardest part of the job was when a co-worker call in sick then i would have to take up the slack, but overall i really enjoyed my job."
good,Dollar Tree has a lot of great qualities about it but I have encountered a number of problems working for them in terms of opportunity for shifts and continual lack of communication of various options available to the employees.
good,"Stock unloading trucks, inventory and customer service daily maintenance cleaning building stock rotation ,customer support"
good,Long work weeks. Mandatory Saturdays. 10 hours a shift minimum.
good,Work days consist of merchandising and stocking shelves while providing customer service at checkouts. The best quality I have gained from working at this company is being a great multi- tasker. I think the management program there is a great stepping stone in preparation for a career moving on from there. Meeting and serving the customers is most enjoyable part of working there.
good,I worked third shift and mornings when freight truck came in. We unloaded the freight and stacked it in the section of the backroom where it is suppose to go. Then we stocked shelves. Most of the time it was during hours after the store closed.
good,As a freight manager i was required to maintain backroom stock. Unload freight and log in how much is on the truck. Also log freight and store items sent back to factory. A keep track of product use of store.
good,I was able to learn about cashier and stocking and got to work in a fast pased enviroment
good,"Fun environment, new faces each day, Receive new items for the store every week"
good,"employee relations ,comunication on daily basis"
good,I did like working for them but it is in my opinion a dead end job with little to no benefits. Trying to balance life and work there was no life sometimes it was all work if you were in management like I was if not you barely had work.
good,management is very organized you will work and stay busy at all time but you work so hard for so little pay overrall its a very good enviornment to work in teams are very good to work with
good,"Began shift clock in,start till with $100.00.Maintain till at all times.Schedule money pick-up before till reaches even $400.00."
good,Nice place to work. Great co-workers. Always something to do.
good,"I would open the store, check the inventory inside the warehouse , assign my crew thier areas to stock merchandise. Constantly changing out merchandise. I enjoyed the people i worked with and the hours I was assigned"
good,"Diverse, growth and opportunity, great products for only a dollar"
good,"I wouldn't ever honestly work for Dollar Tree again. Of course when I worked there it was a holiday season, but they didn't even pay me enough to work the hours I did."
good,"No, I have nothing to say. I've blocked that company out of my memory and I want to keep it that way. Thanks. Nobody should have to answer these ridiculous questions."
good,I worked there part time as a cashier. I soon got promoted to second shift assistant manager. I was responsible for closing the store and making deposits etc. I was given more responsibility but no extra money.
good,"everything is priced at a dollar $1.00. No refunds,exchange only,and register is simple/"
good,Dollar tree is an ok company to work for. As a store manager they will make you work all the hours they can. Compensation depending upon when you joined the company
good,People can have bad days and good days and try to take they anger out on you or someone can get hurt depending on what they doing or someone just show how to do anything
good,I think sometimes I was given more than my fair share of the work. I was also working through lots of pain. It is just mostly just a normal minimum wage job.
good,Just hard to get hrs to pay bills. They want to give stockers 20 hrs a week and there is only 2 stockers and I freight manager to stock whole store. It's a busy store.
good,They were very welcome and the staff was very welcoming. It's an easy job. You stand for long periods of time but it's tolerable. Lines can be formed easily so you must do your work as fast and as professional as possible.
good,"Dollar Tree was a go to job when I had nothing to occupy my time. I then Decided to go to school and that didn’t work out, so I moved to Houston in August and looking more opportunities."
good,"it was nice place to work, but wasn’t worth my physical health. They didn’t really give long enough breaks And the pay wasn’t really the effort you put into the job, but other than that great place to start working at if your 16 or in high school"
good,"A typical day would be making transactions , stocking , counting cash drawer , I learned how to use a cash register . Mangement was cool. Good place for starters . Hard about the job doing returns & the enjoyable part was interacting more with people and customers"
good,Working at dollar tree is a bit frustrating only because of how crowded it can be sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and juss talking to different cultures.
good,"Not 100 motivated because of the ammount of hours I get for the position I have. Poor security causes constant lost of merchandise, but its a company always willing to keep growing."
good,"Decent place to work. The customers were always good. Most of the workers were nice. "
good,It's ok just make sure your store manager is a fair employer . They do work with you while you are in school or taking care of family. They also give good opportunities to advance
good,Never enough employees on the clock. Schedule is only fit for store managers. Team work needs to be improved badly! Products are being put off efficiently.
good,"I like the job never worked in retail before now good 1st retail job "
good,"It's a good place to work. Usually only part time hours. Yearly raises are very low.  Good teamwork at our store.  The day ges by fast, always something to be done. Friendly atmosphere."
good,"Most enjoyable part was Being a cashier and helping people "
good,working at dollar tree for a good 9 almost 10 months were good but it was rough on me because i had another job as well and was in high school still  the experience that i got was good and learned new skills there as well throughout my time there.
good,"The workplace is good, however, the bad pay is bad and the store needed to be fully cleaned so expect to never leave on time. Almost everyone is either looking for another job due to work/pay imbalance. Finally, even though I like the store the pay is terrible to the point where it is unlivable. what stood out about the company was how dedicated they were to the employees."
good,"The job was so so due to the nature of the environment which to me was very disorganized. The manager gave us tasks to complete that had no end or real purpose to them, and hours were limited"
good,When starting out in the entry level positions this is a great place to get experience but not for a life-time position. Great place to learn about diverse group of people
good,I enjoy meeting the many people that come in to the Dollar Tree.  It is fun to see the customers on a regular basis.  I enjoy seeing the many saving people get.  I also like the people that work with me at the Dollar Tree.
good,"Flexibility was great...Pay was awful!!!! $7.25 hr. is unacceptable for this day and time!!!! You work your butt off for pennies!!!! Other than that, I loved my job..."
good,Good for a person starting over Or needs a part time job Or in school and easy income good work environment flexible schedule OK management no room for a Career or a new growth im the company
good,Dollar tree distribution is a great place to work I just wish it paid a little more money and that we didn't have to mandatory days and work days that u would lik to work
good,"I worked their with great hours, unloading the trucks, stocking shelves and greeting customers. All for 8 months until a new manager arrive that promoted over me and took hours away from me. I may have worked 12 hours a week after her arrival. I was trained as cashier, which after the supervisor counted my drawer I was either more or a little less. After 10 months I was let go."
good,"It was a great place to work! Something new everyday, great customers and coworkers. My bad experience is the lack of care for the employees by the HR department! I was promised a raise never got it, promised a promotion I applied for never got it; instead they bring in someone who has never been in the store to do the job! Was supposed to receive back pay from not getting my raise and never received  anything while everyone else got theirs!"
good,"A job for a person who is in high school with no attachment to responsibilities. I maintain it for me to maintain my credit but if I did not have, I would not be working."
good,"Dollar tree on portage road I feel is judgemental, and dirty it was very hard to work there to to the dirtyness, and u organization. Customers that came there most days always complained and had a hard time finding things. Managers are unprofessional and they expect employees to leave personal items in a unlocked locker that customers have accessnto"
good,My review on Dollar tree was a steppingstone. If anyone is looking for a first job to get on their feet Dollar tree would be recommended as a first job but I wouldn’t make that as my career.
good,I would work at the Dollar tree very friendly work environment flexible hours and slow pace work environment I would definitely refer friends and family to work at the Dollar tree
good,"Not enough, days, hours or compensation! Management was great the customers were friendly most of the time and the work wasn’t too hard would recommend it to someone for a part time job"
good,"You clock in the hour you are scheduled to work. Say you work at 9:30 you punch into the screen monitor and after you punch in make sure you log into your register and count your tail. make sure you have the right amount and fill up your register with things you need up front for the customers. If the line is full make sure you are the backup or you have to call up for backup over the speaker. When there is no customers ask if there is something your coworkers need help with. most likely you will be stocking things upfront by the registers like candy, bubbles, toys, snakes, markers, etc. You get a 10 mins break depending if your working 5 hours. If you work 8 hours you get two 30 min breaks if I'm not mistaking. After you are done with your shift you have to make sure your things are picked up from your register for the next person doesn't have to pick up your mess."
good,"I work as associate and stocker.I really like working there. The manager cares about you, she es flexible and kind. Good teamwork. The salary is poor. ☹️"
good,They didn't give enough hours to make the store as it needed to be putting more work on the employees. Needed more hours for stocking and wasn't aloud at certain stores based on sales due to theft which left that store in the hole to not reach its goal.
good,"Missing Something , money , ect. I felt like maybe I didn't get a fair chance that most of the emploees here are known friends or family already with each other and they are for each other ."
good,"The environment is okay, there’s nothing wrong with it, I believe there’s a lot of favoritism and bias but that can’t be helped in most situations. Overall it’s an okay place to work."
good,It was definitely a learning experience and molded me in making the job easier I actually learned to love the job I just like the hard work and satisfaction of a completion
good,"It would be a good job if they paid more and gave you the option to be full time as well as get raises. They really could offer employees more hours, pay, and benefits but they don't."
good,For the hard work i gave they did not recognize with any incentives. Human rrsource manager has a black anf white disposition. He is not nice compassionate or cares about people.  He is by the book only.
good,"a typical day is assisting customers and stocking selves. and I learned by working this job is building speed, independence, and people don't care about in this world. the management at the store is that they really weren't  consist at that position. the hardest part of the was unloading the truck because they would send trucks we wouldn't need. the enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the customers."
good,over worked and under paid. but the management is nice and if I had to I would do it again. It was family dollar but they was changing over to dollar tree. its a lot of work in reseting a store for 8.00 an hour
good,"Had to resign because mt brother to a management position. Other than that, its not a bad place to work, its a job. Stocking and cashiering isn't hard."
good,Flexible hours. Pay is ok. More family time. Opportunity to advance. High turnover rate. Good communication. offers extra hours when they're available.
good,Dollar Tree had short breaks and I only worked once a week sometimes once a month. Working once a month is not enough to live off of. And I just needed a better job.
good,Stressful nerve  racking and good DAYS and bad days but VERY good meeting people and helping them but it also can get you upset and mad some customers will work a nerve VERY bad
good,It is a good company but our Department not consistent. HR is also slow when trying to move up in the company. I enjoy my team here and like the people. Too much micro management and busy work and things change on a whim as far as what is policy today and then tomorrow. Only department that Supervisors rotate schedules of times and days off on a 4 week basis. Associates are treated better and more accommodated than the supervisors.
good,"This was a great entry level job. Advancement was slightly difficult due to favoritism among management. This was a fast paced job that required a lot of standing, and walking. The customer base was friendly and fun to be around."
good,"Very little hours, make you do more than you’re suppose to. Hourly rate not worth all the tasks you have to get done in a short period of time and get timed to stock"
good,Dollar tree was my first job i was really proud that i got the job to support my family. I was a cashier i liked doing that but sometimes not ppl are very rude. I rather do stocking.
good,Its not too bad of a place to work my only complaint  would be the management mixing up scheduled work hours other than that I enjoyed  working there.
good,Not enough hours to train correctly. Also not the right amount of people on the closing shift or for inventory. Managers that are salary work from opened to close most of the time so they don't get written up
good,"the busiest time for them is around Christmas, it could get hard. Good place to work. friendly co workers. usually slow in the evenings. the customers are nice"
good,While i worked at dollar tree it was okay at the beginning however it got progressively worse for me. While there i enjoyed the customers and most of my coworkers however due to how understaffed we where i was not properly trained to do the tasks i was given for a majority of the time i was employed which didn't get resolved until they started hiring more people at the end of my employment.
good,"Being responsible for tens of thousand dollars worth of merchandise as well as receiving 1000 to 2000 pieces each week, Piece by Piece, for $10.75 and hour is somewhat unreasonable in my opinion."
good,"They don't pay enough since you have to stock and run register. You have to unload truck by hand. You should never be bored because there's always something to do. They only offer benefits to management. Medical, dental, vision, sick leave and regular leave and 401k."
good,"Dollar Tree not a bad company to work for but the district manager is  very unprofessional , the turn over bad ,pay is not fair , I helped improved a lot of dollar tree's I had a sick child and they didn't work with me with leave so I had to end my employment there"
good,"The jobs easy the works easy the people are easy to get along with , it is a busy store which I love it makes my time go by fast ,the management is pretty laid back ,I feel comfortable around them . Not like my last job I felt out of place and like I was being talked about in a negative manner and behind my back."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree and I got along well with all my coworkers and managers, which is why it came as a surprise when I was terminated without notice or explanation. I've heard bad things from others about working at that store, but other than not being told I was fired or why, I personally had nothing to complain about."
good,"I liked working at dollar tree, however the pay and hours given to work weren’t . The management was good, there was room for improvement though. Over all the work environment was good"
good,"For what its worth, I think that Dollar Tree is a great first job. However, with no progression in the company and the overall lazy type of culture, I couldn't be asked to stay longer or even a transfer because of the sour taste it left in mouth."
good,Okay job. Not flexible. No room to grow. Hours cut a lot in order to make hours for cashiers. Management hard to communicate with. Never hear your concerns. Sometimes you get an Assistant manager that will relay message for you but that’s the only way you’ll be heard.
good,"some positions require a lot of physical labor."
good,"I cant complain too much, since my situation isn't the norm. But generally there is barely any training,  they just tell you to get a uboat to the isle they pick for you and say make it fit. Now granted i started with a manager who usually focuses on the cashier side, so basically we both were learning the stock side of the store. Have to make quota no matter if you know what you're doing or not. Other than that its a quick 3 to 4 hour shift."
good,"Only management can get shifts longer than 5 hours, and getting them to work with another schedule is out of the question. "
good,Employment at dollar tree since 2018 has been very interesting. I have been employed at two different locations so I could get the proper training for store manager position.
good,"I am trying to move out of state.How do i make this happen? I have been with the company for a year. I am good at what i do. I enjpy my customers, znd and i like this company.  Wish they paid more."
good,My time over at dollar tree was short but it was fast paced and a bit fun. It did take time for me to learn where everything was at the work over there was good.
good,"The store I work for is not like most stores, that have a cashier and stock crew. If you're cashier you have to do a lot more than just that, over time it will get to you. They don't give enough hours or money, the paid and hours suck. There are only a few things I like about the store I work out, good management, store somewhat neat and clean."
good,"Working at dollar tree is pretty easy going when you don't have a long line of customers at your register. As a cashier you have to: of course work the register, unpack  boxes that contain the items that are in the register aisles, and put back any items that customers no longer wanted and/or are returning. I think its a lot of work for just being paid minimum wage honestly. Management is pretty cool for the most part. Also you are only put on schedule 3 days with 5 hours shifts, so you only get a guaranteed 15 hours a week but you may be called in when another employee calls out."
good,They were okay. I needed a job so I applied at dollar tree but I quit because it was hard work with little pay. Co workers were fun. I got along with everyone.
good,dont get a lot of hours but that’s what a part time job is.....pay is not the greatest ....this job would be great for someone going through school and has no bills to pay
good,"My overall experience at Dollar Tree was Great"
good,"Typical day at dollar tree includes starting shift by counting your till, then start doing whatever is needed. By working at dollar tree I’ve learned how to handle money, how to talk to customers, and time management. I worked probably the busiest seasons which included back to school, thanksgiving & Christmas. The store would get really busy but I never let it get the best of me. I got my job done and did what I had to do. Sold items I was asked to help sale during back to school and Christmas. All in all it was a pretty easy job I just couldn’t continue at the pay I was given and hours I was given."
good,Met some great coworkers but does feel like management is a pretty disorganized at times. Managers are nice just kind of feels like there is a lot of miscommunication between management. Customers and balloons are brutal - probably the worst part of the job.
good,Store management needed improvement and scheduling was never properly overseen. Lack of motivation through in and through out not including the freight management.
good,I loved loved loved my time with dollar tree the people I met the friends I made the relationship I built! Everything is a moderate paced environment but if you’re looking for a full time position look elsewhere sorry. It’s a great place to start and move up within the company and get a feel for different positions within the store
good,Dollar tree was a decent place to work for a second job or something but I wouldn’t make it a primary job. Stuff was cheap and work was lame most the time.
good,"Cold ,hot stessful ,lack of hours .very physically demanding .sent home early frequently lack of help on large trailers very hard n your back and body"
good,"So not much I can say about the job. It's fairly boring, you do the same things day in and day out. It's a job, a means to an end. If you enjoy just having some kind of security where you know you will get a pay check, this could be your job."
good,"Have some benefits,promotes from within,flexible work schedule, paid lunches, has sick pay, has vacations, public relations, enjoy working with people"
good,"besideas that fact if you didnt come in when its your day off, the overloaded amount work for one cashier( as the only cashier there for the next 4 or 5 hours) and that one manager that would take credit for the cashier/stocker effoft. if you looking for a beginner job work for the tree"
good,The environment was really friendly and everybody was treated like family. It was still a fast pace job that was overdemanding and did not pay well. I was making less than minimum wage
good,I loved that job but management was awful.in fact wasn't long after I quit that she got dropped.but if I could work there again I sure would.wonderful coworkers
good,Great people to work with.This company is very busy and still growing. I like our senior leadership.As a manager my passion is to be on the floor with my associates and help them excel in their job by mentoring and building trust
good,"A day at this job requires you to cashier and work freight,. making sure that merchandise at the register is kept full. You are also required to encourage the sale o special weekly items."
good,"The systems are easy to pick up, Culture quite inviting with a low-pressure environment. The hardest part(s) is/are miscommunications. I learned priority management of how to address customer and store needs"
good,Too much work for too little pay. Management is expected to pick up the slack at all times. Work three different jobs at one time plus make all of the decisions.
good,This company allows their personality quiz to determine if a person is management marital and ignores the achievements and work performance that a person has.
good,Dollar tree is an okay job to work as a 2nd part time job. The pay is not very good unless you get a lot of hours but they don't have a lot of hours to give out.
good,For the most part it is a fairly easy job. The most important thing are the customers then it would be making sure the isles are fixed. The hardest part of the job was fixing the isles while having to watch for customers or during holiday time.i enjoyed my co workers and everyone was nice.
good,"Spent the day stocking shelves helping customers and wrangling staff who refused to work"
good,I applied for a sales position and was offered the Assistant Managers position because of how short staffed they were at the time. The store I worked at started out as somewhat dysfunctional and unorganized. After a few months of retraining employees and implementing a better floor system the store ended up having better sales and a whole different demeanor.
good,"Not all rules for management are followed, Some guidelines for upper management are not followed and nothing done to correct issues. After submitting FLMA for a surgery the date had to be moved up a week so it was resubmitted then 2 weeks after me being off from the surgery date my FMLA was denied and I had to forgo my position."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers daily; and the other cashiers I worked with.  Very fast-paced environment. "
good,Good for a first job. Low pay for the work they expect. Will work around hours your available. No raises that i now of unless you take management and even then its just over a dollar more. Is alot of opportunities to advance.
good,"Typical day includes cash handling, stocking shelves, customer service, cleaning, go-backs, facing and basic cleaning. The staff (in my experience) was friendly, they work well with your family obligations and illness. Breaks are required and given, hours and pay are fair for the job ."
good,it was easy work cashiering and stocking shelves. my favorite part was seeing my regular customers. my favorite shift was opening shift because that's when the nicest costumers came in
good,"Days were pretty calm. The only busy times there were around the holidays. I learned to Work your greatest no matter how they are around you. The management could improve. Back in that time it wasn't so great, I'm not sure how it is now. Hardest part was picking up others slack. For me the most enjoyable part was how flexible they were with me since i was going to school."
good,the only good part of working at dollar tree was the customers and the staff the bad stuff was they wanted you as a cashier to do more then you could with stocking shelves they put a lot of stress on you and you can work any were from 20 hrs in two weeks to 30 hors in two weeks
good,i did not like working at Dollar Tree since the management was terrible as well as the pay. i really wish there was a better pay for everything that you do while working.
good,"I actually liked working there. Met some nice people no one was ever mean or anything. Rarely had bad days cause of coworkers or customers. Pay could have been a little better but I was fine with what I was getting, it was an extra income that helped for the most part."
good,"You have to catch on pretty quickly, you only get training for 1 day. Far as the money it’s good but the people and management is terrible. I wouldn’t go back"
good,"+A ton of store manager and assistant manager turnover. "
good,Not much going on in the store however when there is activity and work needed to get done the management makes sure 5he employees are well equipped and trained on what to do
good,My experience working for the dollar tree was overall a great experience. IT helped me develop my communication skills as well as organization skills.
good,I wanted to work but this job was very unorganized they never had a set schedule. I would stock boxes mornings and nights I loved doing the work. Poor management was the case for all of the employees.
good,Not bad as a stop over to something better. The pay is low and the job is hard work but they pay every other week and will work with your schedule.Don't get too attached.
good,About what you should expect out of a place that sells items for a dollar. Typical retail environment. Expect more than the pay should entail. Management was great.
good,your experience depends on your co-workers. My first year I worked with a lot of great people and I would still be working there if that was the case. However new management rolls around and drives everyone away with their work ethic and need to micromanage everything. Not to mention being forced to do a job the store manager failed to train anyone for made the work load way to large for one person to handle.
good,"I Got Terrible Work Hours Only Getting 7 1/2 Hours Every Week EVEN During Christmas. The Management Is Very Sketchy Hard Word And Labor For Very Low Income, Under Paid Definitely."
good,"i rate the job a 5 out of 10, due to rate of pay. i'm busy at the register. management is easy to get along with, i feel that i am friends with them while working. nothing is hard, not like moving furniture. the workplace is fun, the customers are friendly and the enjoy shopping there. i enjoy having conversations with customers i can identify with; like people who wear university of  iowa or fishing paraphernalia. i have learned nothing. my only problem is rate of pay."
good,"my particular location I work is in a kind of limbo space. it's larger than a small store, but never hits the weekly quota to be considered a ""large store"", keeping us relatively understaffed and overworked. Shifts are short, and the pay is incredibly low. Even if you manage to step up to be a supervisor, the pay isn't worth the workload managers are put under."
good,"I was told I would be able to work after holidays , but he gave the job to someone  else. He said I did a great job, but he never hired me back. He hired others and always told me he had too many workers."
good,"I only worked for a couple days, stocking to shelves for the grand opening. Yes it was extremely hectic at time but management did their best to help us help them."
good,"The job pays the bills, but not much more.  Management loosely follows the schedule or schedules personnel to cover shifts. The schedules can change without warning or notifying the employee."
good,"Dollartree gives the opportunity to move up within the company ,always keeping it a family oriented place to shop while striving to keep customer service first and foremost."
good,"It is is a good job for students and retired adults who just want something to do. It is always busy. The customers at my store anyway were the hardest, they are loud, rude, and allow their kids to do whatever they want."
good,"Great people to work with, you learn how to work in a quick-paced enviroment due to all the people that go (especially on the weekends/holidays). If you are just starting off it'll be good but i'll say it's best to be there to gain experience and find another job."
good,"Every time I would work I would have to make sure my re-shop was in a basket, so the ones that put the items back could put them back. I got along with everyone. The managers would be good. Have patience with me when I was starting. The hardest part about this job is when people get upset n start catching attitude."
good,Loaded and unloaded the truck stock the shelves open to store close the store and many other things. Great as a part-time job the manager was a great manager even though I didn't want to go farther at Dollar Tree just a great part time job
good,"I worked at Dollar Tree as a secondary job. The managers were a pleasure to work for and always made my shifts more comfortable, especially since I had just moved to Ohio from Florida for a temporary change. I learned that there are some pretty neat products that the Dollar Tree sells. The environment was extremely relaxed and comfortable."
good,Its a good job depending on the stores you work at. You learn alot about about costumer service. the management is easy the most enjoyable part of the job is that you meet new people and that if you get to learn all fields of the job then your job will be easy.
good,Fast passed job. Always busy. Hours vary based on store and sales. Managers and associates are helpful in training new hires. Give ability to go from seasonal worker to part time associate.
good,It's your typical retail job. Not difficult but depending on your store manager you'll either love or hate working there.  Opportunity for advancement.
good,I come in check my area open my register i rang up customers bag order and some time get off the register and stock.After we close we clean up the store
good,This job is slow paced and requires patience. The ability to stand for long hours and deal with rude people is a must. Knowledge of cash handling is a must.
good,"Stressing about whether you're going to be able to get all your work done, if you didn't get it all done you would eventually get written up even if you had no control over it. I learned how to work in retail and the patience required for it. the hardest part of the job was when customers are yelling at you or giving you an attitude."
good,This job was unbelievably stressful. I was there as a part time cashier in Absecon at first and when I transferred to Jersey City it was a whole different experience. Absecon was clean and the customers were friendly and the work environment was orderly.  The Jersey City store is where i was promoted to manager after only a month working there and a few months experience in general. I am really dedicated to getting the work assigned to be done no matter how frustrating it may get. I enjoy working with people and figuring out ways to improve my work methods.
good,"Very flexible hours, only have minimal raises when moving up positions. Management is decent but often unorganized. Work environment is very friendly and laid back, lots of ability to get tasks done. Very focused on customer service and satisfaction."
good,It’s a relaxed environment. Work at your own pace. The only down fall is that other employees do not want to work their scheduled shift. stocking hours are pretty good.
good,12 hour days are the norm. High turnover at store level . Lack of payroll made it diffcult to achieve goals. The work is rewarding when given the opportunities to win !
good,Dollar tree is a fast paced working environment. I worked there as seasonal help. Very busy store. Had to help keep putting out seasonal items. I liked keeping busy there and management was very helpful.
good,Working at dollar tree is ok. They do not hire full time so you will be part time. The money is not that good as a cashier you make minimum wage. You get a ten minute break unless you are working 6 hours or more.You do not get a discount and retail is not the easiest iob. The environment is good it all depends on who you work with.
good,"merchandising fun opportunities, one price point, great hiring opportunities, awesome salary entry, flexible part time working hours, good in store promotion opportunities."
good,"Fast paced,fun, always something to do. High turnover depending on location, not a lot of hours a week for running a high volume store and for recovery"
good,Not very well managed. Last minute schedule changes which often resulting in fewer hours for the week. Very small store lacking inventory space and employee break area.
good,Busy work environment and some team focus.  Very little training and advancement opportunities.  Large amounts of production with minimal amount of hours.  Not as focused on family life/work balance.
good,way too many hrs/ not enough help to cover shifts . deliveries weekly and all merchandise must go to sales floor very little stockroom. had to work all holidays and weekends.
good,The job itself is not hard. Managers there are very demanding. you sometimes have to ask to go to the restroom. you get PTO but you would lose them quick even if you don't request them to be used or you might not get them at all for some reason. if you miss 4 days of work with in 5 months you get wrote up and every day after that is a write. after the 3rd write up you are fired. yes even if you have doctor notes or other important documents.
good,"Loading an unloading freight "
good,There are about one or two cashiers counting you while there are a lot of customers. Some days are busy and some are not. Sometimes the managers are not there when you need them.
good,"Great job for teens that are still in school or someone who wants extra money, or if you just doesn't want to seat at home everyday. The hours depends what job title you have and where you work."
good,"The people and work is enjoyable and very laid back for a customer service job, despite dated equipment and methods. If you're looking for a job to settle into, I don't really recommend it."
good,"Nice place to work for a starting job, but management can cause you problems and the scheduling system they have is terrible. pay is a minimal wage. Also work can be stressful during seasonal times of the year because you have no backup and are alone in  the store with a manager for the whole shift."
good,Each Dollar Tree is different. I loved my store manager but the turnover was incredibly high while the pay was just the opposite. At 9.50/hour for a full time job I would not have been able to make ends meet alone. Communication between corporate and each location was severely lacking. I had high hopes in being able to move up within the company (which my SM was training me for) but was unable due to such high turnover
good,Well my days was very smooth no drama. I had to greet the customers.  I also had to do the take backs after my cash register was over with and time to go home. I injoyed going to work and work to help my family out with bills and other things that needed to be takin care of.
good,"Being a store manager, you are salaried. Working six days a week is very frequent for a store manager. Depending on your support personal, working 7 days a week is not uncommon. Lots of turnover for ASM's. The company seems to be behind the times for merchandising, logistics and freight flow."
good,Small staff will get to know everyone who works in the store. Flexible hours they will try to accommodate to your schedule and availability. They mostly offer part time.
good,"The district store manager was wonderful in Lake Jackson TX. But the store manager's had something to be desired. The work kept you busy,it was also fun at times."
good,Great first time job for a student. The management and staff were professional and the shifts were flexible to fit with school hours. The work environment was stress free and fun.
good,it was fun and creative. I enjoyed everything just the pay was too low and few hours. great management and fair. I liked it just needed more hours was all.
good,"I was only employed at dollar tree for a year and a half  however it was a good place to work my duties where to pull orders for shipping as well as unload trucks by electric or hand pallet jacket , I also learned how to drive a fork lift so I thought that was awesome. the managers where good and my co workers made it easy to come to work everyday trying to unload a 50 ft. truck that was messing was a challenge however we got it done."
good,The job is easy but you don't get paid enough to live off of. I have worked there for nine months and people who have worked there less than me got promoted.
good,Was a good place to work. Small store however the hours were limited. Not enough hours working only 4 hours a day. Other employees there had a second job.
good,I have fun with some if my coworkers we laugh and smile and joke around with one another just to make the time go by so fast. Dollar Tree is a fast paced environment especially the one I work in we even joke around with some of our Customers.
good,"When I first started working there it was really good service , they employees were nice and helped you whenever you needed help. There were someone there to help you whenever a customer need assistance."
good,"Dollar Tree was my first job and I became employed a few weeks after giving birth. The store manager was great. She was understanding, flexible, kind and sweet. The job offered great flexibility but the pay could be better or more hours during a work day and week. It's a great job for somebody new to the work field or a side job. On average the hours I worked in a two week period would barely pay for utilities in my home, let alone a child. As said, A great side job or beginner job."
good,"Dollar tree kept me going, even when I had bad days at home I wanted to work to keep my mind off things, I enjoyed everyday since I been there. The people I worked with were amamzing and the manager was great to me."
good,"If you like to stay busy to make your day go by quickly then this job is for you, there is always something to keep you busy all day... The hardest part of this job is unloading trucks. And dealing with bad management."
good,employers work together as a team and help each other out when needed. Great people but the hours weren't so good. in one week you could work 8-12 hours.
good,Recently there had been a management change with two managers that don't get along. Before it was a good place with excellent customer service. Now there is one manager who does not get along with people well.
good,dollar tree didn't stay busy so there was a lot of down time but that's when the stocking and cleaning started. not many employees in the store so sometimes I was left alone to handle the store.
good,Some days it would be slow some days it would be fast paced. I learned how to be consistent with customers and answer any questions they had and could lead into the right direction. Employees were nice and easy to get along with.
good,Dollar Tree is a fast paced. It requires its employees to work hard as the payroll is tight.  Lots of growth for people that want to advance their career.
good,"Fine if you are in the management positions, but as with any other company hours only come with the holidays. So this is only good for people wanting to keep busy and not interested in extra or any income."
good,I like it there I just wish I was paid more that’s it . It’s cool because your not on a time clock to see if you can ring someone out faster then the other person in front or behind you can.
good,"Like every job it has its good days and there are some bad ones. As an associate it's a good job. As a manager the pay isn't worth it, however you do meet some wonderful people. If you're in the right store with a strong team and proper communication it will be smooth sailing."
good,I loved working for Dollar Tree. When got promoted was harder than I thought.  Was working long hours and barely any days off. Loved the customers and some of the people that I was working with.
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to build your foundation as you look to move up. There are opportunities to learn and grow that are hard to find elsewhere.
good,"Easily understood equipment."
good,like working with my co workers .interacting with customers .I like fast paste environment. I like the challenge it offers me.  in over all I just like to get along with everyone I work with.
good,"This job is great for a person who is organized, great at planning and executing. Then again if you are that type of person, then what are you doing working at Dollar Tree? One down fall is that there are not enough hours for things to get properly done. Another is the pay isn't great."
good,"I was hired in seasonal! Nothing bad to say, I liked the job for the short time I worked there. Co workers were nice and store was always clean and straightened."
good,Just do your job help costumers help cashier if needed make sure your daily task is done no cutting corners be on your a game make sure the front is always cleaned
good,"Dollar tree is a good job to get you by, to supplement your income. there is room for advancement if that is the field you want to stay in. If your a worker bee I say apply."
good,I got to meet interesting people and work at a fast pace. the location was nice and we had a lot of business. worked well with other employees. miscommunication was the main problem with the manager but overall it was a good experience.
good,Most men supervisors were not professional an treated co-workers unprofessionally. Also would write someone up if they weren’t working fast enough or if someone came over to were I was working we both would get wrote up. Even though I was doing my job.
good,"I worked here close to a year to see what kind of potential I had coming from previous retail experience. Learning the typical filing of paperwork, staffing, stocking promotional items of the week. Work days would often include counting and switching registers, basic management duties. While the work was easy to learn, management could have been a bit more enthusiastic and shown more recognition towards associates as well as other managers when it came to hard work being accomplished rather than constant criticism regarding work not being done to their liking."
good,"Depending on what store you were at determines how you enjoyed the job. My store Manager & Co-workers were nice, no drama, and we all worked as a team. But Dollar Tree company as a whole was not acceptable at all. Didn't pay cashier the right, refused to hire more staff, had strict hours of work hours on top of demanding company standards keeping the store clean, getting the customers in and out with keeping the line at three. Company didn't replace old computers or set a clock-in machine for associate to clock-in instead of the cash registers that didn't pick up are punch in time half the time. Just not enough support from the company. And wasn't supportive for the Customer stores & Store Associates. Also Full-time management shouldn't be forced to have a break or meals everyday. Should be optional if they are management, associates should also have at least 15 min of a break.  But I do enjoy their prices for the products they offer can't beat Soap for a $1 or office supplies."
good,"I was looking for a job to work at while I was home from college, so I got my job at Dollar Tree on the spot due to lack of help present. I just wish the training process was more efficient."
good,I spent 4 yeas working for the company a really fast place environment i enjoyed working there the only thing i didnt enjoy i was the only cashier in the morning so there were times i couldnt go to the restroom nor take my break
good,Easy going work environment  but low pay wages and very few work hours each week run the register stock shelves clean store greet customers bag items blow up Ballons
good,Dollar tree is a good company buy not enough opportunities to get more money for the past month I'm only making about $200-300 dollars a month. Not enough hours in my opinion.
good,"A typical day at work was busy all the time. The managers didn't believe in even a second of free time, you should always be doing something. The hardest part of the job was filling up the balloon corner, can't have too many, can't have too few, can't have certain ones in with other ones. The most enjoyable was the customer service."
good,Just another day at the tree. I learned a lot about management. Everyone was happy. The worst part of the job was holidays when the store was packed and not enough cashiers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see everyone in a good mood and working together.
good,They focus on saying money at any opportunity including products and labor required at the store. Cashiers pull double roles to help cut back on the cost of labor
good,I worked there under what I thought was pt for about three days and never received a call back.i even went down to My store and asked if I was on schedule.  management should be changed. It was completely unorganized and unprofessional.
good,"I like working at Dollar tree, I like to be cashier, I like to stock merchandise, I like doing customer service, but I don't like the way my manager is managing the store, customers are saying bad things about how the store looks, but I can't do anything if she's not doing or even caring about the store, she even hire a new lady that she doesn't know anything and she put her as assistant manager (she doesn't even have 3 months working there)."
good,"Large company with poor oversight, lack of corrective communication and action. Not consistent with policy enforcement. Poor work life balance and often understaffed."
good,They want you to so much with no payroll and the coustmers are rude you try to make the best with what you have to work with and it never will be enough but there not the ones in the store with you day in and day out
good,"Good place to work, but need to be more appreciative about their employees. I loved what I did at Dollar Tree, but remember to never trust others because it will bite you in the rear."
good,Learned to delegate more productively and schedule associates to be most productive for the company.  The environment is what you make it.  The hardest part of the job is being able to unload the truck and run the front of the store within the same time frame.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of completing task such as stocking, cashiering, and cleaning the store."
good,"The job was good,safe at times.. other then that it was nice to work there and help out on the job site.the workers was nice a pleasant to work with.."
good,"I had a fine experience here, I got along with my coworkers fairly well. Really the most frustrating part was corporate, who on occasion,  would put in place illogical policies."
good,"I am not interested in submitting a review of Dollar Tree, however, i cannot figure out how to proceed without completing this portion of the form. -Former Dollar Tree Employee"
good,"A typical day at work is usually quite busy no matter what you are doing. As  cashier, you hardly ever leave the register. Doing recovery you are always moving around, cleaning  and  fronting/facing the product. Throwing freight also takes up the whole day and you are constantly stocking. I learned how to do most everything but manage at my store  and I am quite proficient at it. My co workers are all friendly and generally nice to be around.  The hardest part of the job is having to unload the trucks on Fridays. I enjoy stocking and being able to straighten up the store so that it looks nice."
good,"A causal workday at dollar tree would be when truck came on the weekend and I and two other employees would help unload an put materials onto u-boats an start stocking, if not unloading truck then cashier would be my task and job for the day."
good,"No exaggeration, Dollar Tree always keeps the shelves stocked with irresistible items. Time after time, I enter Dollar Tree stores with the intentions of buying just one or two things. Again and again, I end up leaving with baskets full of items. When I get home I am exhilarated by all the new things I purchased and didn't expect to have. Dollar Tree is consistent with their dollar price guarantee, extended holiday hours, and vast seasonal items. Surprisingly enough, I stop into Dollar Tree about three to four times a week, and often find others doing the same. It's a great place to bargain shop, and overall reliable. I love DollarTree!"
good,A very busy place at times. Stocking is no joke especially during the holiday seasons. The hardest part is having to run back to forth from stocking to running back to your counter to take care of customers.
good,"I enjoy my co-workers, and boss. But I'm not a huge fan of the corporate side, higher-ups. Barely allowing hours, starting at minimum wage and barely giving opportunity for advancement. As simply a job - I'm not a fan. But I love my co-workers."
good,management is great job is fast pace stocking cleaning shelves making sure floors are clean clean warehouse if needed unload truck stack product in product in location where they belong.
good,"for a seasonal job. it wasn't bad. hours were good for someone who doesn't mind early mornings. pace wasn't bad, and the time you get out of work wasn't bad."
good,"This job is very fast pace however did not  have opportunities and no raise and also inconsistent schedule not very good fan management was great!"
good,Loved the management very easy going and understanding. Unfortunately the pay for my title of Assistant Manager was not worth the pay. Other than that the hours were fair.
good,Great job for college students or those just getting out of High School.  Friendly work environment.  Scheduling is pretty flexible.  Not the best benefits.
good,the assistant store manager was terrific at her job. she made sure the work got done without being overly aggressive. she always made sure the workers were ok. she never allowed anyone to have a bad day at work.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is fine, depending on where you are located. You are either assigned as cashier, freight, or both. This job pays unfairly due to being paid minimum wage in Idaho, where you start off at $7.25. I've worked for the business for more than two and a half years and I've only had a 40 cent raise. Terrible hours as well!"
good,"This is a good place for a student to experience the retail field. They will hire you part time, but their are plenty of opportunities to take on more hours, especially during to christmas season"
good,Advancement is based on passing a personality assesment test not on the merit of your work.  Not enough hours given per day to get required tasks completed.
good,"-You normally stay at the cash register from the time you get there till the time leave if your not stocking"
good,I was 16 when i started working here. It was fun for my age and the hours worked well with my school time. I never felt like I was having to give up my school work
good,the actual job was pleasurable. The scheduling was terrible. I received a phone call everyday to come into work. Even on the days I was already scheduled to change the shift.
good,Productive and fun place to work. Hours and pay was not completive and not much in advancement as a part time employee. Hours was not enough and steady. I needed more pay per hour and hours.
good,"*Operative a PE."
good,"It's not that the dollar tree isn't a great place to work, it isn't bad, but personally I had two managers and their styles were very different. I felt that it was hard to talk to the ""main manager."" Work was very laid back, which made the day drag on. My hours were shortly cut after being hired. "
good,"opening the store, putting out freight, scheduling, managing employees, recovery of store, closing the at night, receiving trucks,."
good,"Always enjoyed the fast pace of retail, teaching younger managers to plan, delegate, and follow through on tasks, and beating financial goals set by the company.  The company grew incredibly fast in the 10+ years I was with them, which added to the excitement.  The most challenging aspect was staffing the stores here in Indianapolis due to the extremely low unemployment rate and our non-competitive starting wage for hourly associates and assistant managers."
good,"Wasn't too busy, loved interacting with customers, coworkers were friendly, wouldn't mind working there again at some point. Only left due to lack of transportation."
good,"Receive, store, floor merchandise. Stock shelves, racks, cases, bins, and tables with merchandise and arrange merchandise displays to attract customers. May periodically take physical count of stock or check merchandise."
good,Dollar Tree is a fair company but I was used to a much quicker pace than a dollar store could offer. District management changed often and appeared to be overwhelmed.
good,Could be fun but very stressful night time is always short handed and no help at all but day time has a lot of workers for back up. Its tiring and crazy with rude customers
good,"Maintain a clean organized store, product face front and tight. Keeping carts on hand for the elderly. keep product on the shelves and stocked up. Wasting off damage goods and having a full inventory."
good,"Friendly work environment very professional assistant managers"
good,"The costumers are what kept me going and motivated for so long. There was a lot of opportunity for people to find work at the Dollar Tree, and the prices were very reasonable for the product."
good,clock in and go and get a uboat of freight and start stocking how to condense freight down to put out more freight rearrange freight to put out more freight my store manager works just as hard putting out freight most of the people are really nice and i enjoy working with them the hardest part of my job would be unloading the truck and when a department is really full trying to find someplace to put out the new freight and the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new and different people and having conversations with them about where they've been
good,"Clock-in, count drawer, scan customer items, take payment, keep area stocked and clean for customers, balance till and go home."
good,"Always had reasonable hours, great team to work with. Got busy most of the time to most of all it was a easy and laid back job, Overtime was optional but overall i loved it."
good,"The typical day here at Dollar Tree is pretty much either busy or really slow. When it is busy you don't leave your cash register, and when its slow you do go backs. Go backs mean the items the customers leave at the register or in their carts you return to there designated area."
good,"A normal day would include stocking, cash register operation, customer assistance, and general store maintenance. Good management, and good workplace culture."
good,"Pay is just over minimum wage, making this a great first job.  "
good,"Fast paced, busy, I now know how to run a cash register.  When i was there management was very good.  The workplace culture was interesting.  Meeting the customers were fulfilling"
good,"I deal with customers everyday all day, i handle cashier request and issues they may have. I deal with the freight on a day to day basis, putting out any that comes in off our weekly DC truck. I make sure the sales floor is stocked to plan with extra displays that the manager and i come up with."
good,"Dollar tree is a fast paced environment it can get the best of you at times, but it also has its times when it's feasible to maintain and do your job on the floor."
good,I worked hard and long hours and never complained. All it took was one employee to complain and start problems. my dm didn't have my back and they don't care about what you are going thru. its all about them making money. they let me go for no good reason.
good,"there was always gossip, the work process was fine but the managers talked bad about alot of the other employees, they however run a good store and are very helpful to customers"
good,"I worked at Dollar Tree for approximately 3 months, seasonal position.  My duties included cashier, stock and working on the floor. I completed a training program on Customer Service and Customer Satisfaction."
good,I was a manager for dollar tree.  I found it an easy job with little challenge.  The product wasn't available when needed a lot of times.  I would think about working for dollar tree again.
good,"Typical day is running register and general cleanup."
good,my manager didnt even let me know i was laid off he kept telling me for 5 days he would calll me when i worked again and he neer did so i called when another manager was working and he informed me i got laid off 5 days ago
good,"its a place if you looking for work you can get it, not that many hours Available to you because of experience or sometimes management. You might not make more than min wage an that's not really fair but hey it pays some pills which is only my phone bill"
good,Great relations to be build with home customers and coworkers with great work ethics also cool items you might wanna purchase and take home and pay is not bad at all
good,A typical day at work would be unloading merchandise from the truck and stocking it in the storeroom.  Stocking shelves and meeting the public.  i learned how a business that big runs.
good,There is lots to do and no help to do it. The job requires 200% effort everyday. The hardest part of the job is balancing cashier shifts or freight shifts.
good,Just didn't like the fact I worked for them for two years and still could NOT receive Maternity Leave... And the benefits weren't useful for part time employees. Only full time employees at that time were Managers.
good,Typical work days vary and offer many challenges and opportunities. Workplace culture is task/Productivity driven and there is never a moment that something isn;t needing to be done.
good,Dollar tree is a great placed to work for those going to school or someone who is looking for their first job. My manager's were great and always showed me ways to promote and healthy habits to learn.
good,"Training was easy, learned a lot of new things, friendly employees, easy to request off, hours changed every week, pay wasn't the best, and unfair management at times."
good,When I was there the Director was quite rude and didn't treat everyone fairly. This made for a not so fun work day if he was around. The FMC mgr was great and had a good team to work with.
good,This is a great company to move up quickly into a management position. All that is required is to put the company Before Your Family! Do not expect Any days off then if you do get one on occasion you will believe that you have a great job. Bless your heart!! One day maybe you will understand that your time with your loved ones is more valuable than money!!
good,Dollar tree is a great organization to a certain level but for a manager to have to be the one to be doing the 90% of the work do to lack of staff it wasnt in my best interest as a manager
good,"I'm writing this review because of the management I experienced, that I know to still be at the Jackson location.  She seems very sweet, and can be very sweet to the customers when she does decide to help at the register.  But she can be very rude and unwilling to help in any way.  The job itself is fine.  The customers are about half friendly, half don't care either way.  Only a few rude ones here and there.  Dollar Tree does have a lot of cool items that you can purchase for your home or your child to enjoy.  It's a fast-paced job that will strengthen your retail skills, probably good for someone just starting their retail career.  There are opportunities to move up, because there is fast turnover."
good,"Typical day at the Dollar Tree is stocking shelves, helping customers on the floor. Overall not a bad place to work. There is a high turn out with this company."
good,Could be better in a lot of areas like pay and hours for starters. It is a job more for teens in the summer time. Maybe if they offered more it probably would be so bad.
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work management is willing to work with you.  I learned to be a team player and customer service standards.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,Typical day would be stalking the selves and helping customers if needed. I've learn about the difference in cultures and personalities of people. The management I was under was not good. My manager didn't have a keen liking to people who was happy all the time. There was no hard part of the job. I did enjoy meeting new people and learning new cultures.
good,"The job, like many retail jobs, is underpaid, because minimum wage of course is way under the rate that it should be in 'Murica. The job is repetitive and boring and doesn't stimulate me at all."
good,Dollar Tree is a great place as long as everyone works together as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to hep customers out and see them leave with a smile on their face.
good,"A place where you can get experience, and if you're a workaholic and work hard a lot, this job is for you because you do everything here on your own most of the time."
good,"As a sales associate, my duties were to maintain stock, serve customers at the register, assist managers with bank deposits, and daily maintenance to keep the store clean, although most of the day went to manning the register. I was required to multitask in order to finish product displays on time while continuing to serve customers, often working alone with a single manager. With relatively few employees, I was responsible for doing more work but in turn felt I had contributed more to the store's success."
good,Unload and stock merchandise on shelves.Work is very fast paced and they require employees to must maintain a certain criteria like maintaining amount of box count every hr.
good,"working with dollartree was a great experience for my first job. i learned how to manage a cash register, i filled balloons, and stacked isles. working for dollartree helped ready me for more job experiences."
good,These is an okay company. Its gets stressful at times. Management is tough and customers as well. Gossiping is very toxic for company. No being a team is very tough. But overall if you have good team and very good customers that makes day go great.
good,"A typical day involves working on the register, stocking shelves, and helping customers. I learned that retail is a great experience for bettering yourself. Sometimes it can be tiring to work at dollar tree because there is a lot to manage at one time, even as a cashier. The hardest part of the job can be trying to remain professional when customers are rude. The most enjoyable part of the job tends to be the consistent customers who are happy to see you and happy that everything is really only a dollar."
good,"Have been employed for seven years. The company, like any other company has it's ups and downs. Benefits are good. There is always opportunity to grow if you have the ambition."
good,Can't say much bad about them cause when I was unemployed they hired me so I'm great full of that. Place is a revolving door when it comes to staff. Hard to have a good store when management is changing every 3-4 months.
good,"Overall fun place to work with good management, however, company standards were low. There were low standards of employment because most of my coworkers engaged in drug use and other illegal activity."
good,"Need better manager's alot of work and not good pay they cant seem to keep employees."
good,Good placed to work at. Good management there. Wish there were more employees in the evening.  Overall rating would be a 3. Very flexible hours and management works with your schedule.
good,Workload was heavy because of turnover rate and it was often hard to find items because the store unorganized. I enjoyed working with the costumers and helping them find items.
good,The position was temporary and basically it was only for 2 weeks and our objective was to prepare the store for its grand opening. We stocked shelves and cleaned the store out.
good,Management was ok to work with wasn't really all that great. A lot of work throw on you and little time to finish. To much work in your plate at once.
good,The job is pretty and easy but the hours are not consistent if you're looking for a steady job. Depending on location the management is very nice and easy going. There's a good amount of positions to chose from.
good,"set schedules, assign department to be stock unload freight assign tills and registers. do pick ups over 400.00 make deposits/ change. open and close."
good,"I have met some really nice friends in my coworkers and my customers. I love working there but don't like the closing shifts every night and don't like working every werkend, would like to work the day shift from 8 to 5 so I can spend time with my famiy."
good,"It's a good job but its really overwhelming because of the new ""Chip System"" it holds up the lines, customers get frustrated and they don't understand it's not really the cahiers fault. Most likely you have to be able to not take anything personal and just concentrate on moving fast. My favorite part was doing ""put backs"" you learn the store from top to bottom doing this and it gives you a chance to help customers out."
good,Training is great! Learn how to do everything from backroom and stock to cashier skills. Awesome place to get resume skills.
good,"overall my experience at the dollar tree distribution center was fairy interesting. the high pace of the company calls for and adequate approach to heavy work loads and demands presented by the employer. As an employee of this company the most intricate of task required for heavy lifting and organization of paper work, handed over to the order pickers(me)  by the management."
good,The typical day over all was amazing. Being able to work with the public and working alone. Being aware of the new products that have come in and will be coming in.
good,"Dollar tree was my favorite jobs out of all the ones i have had. I would come in for my shift and first thing I would do is count the safe make sure it is correct and than sign it off with the AM manager . I then would mainly recover the store, be a back up cashier if it got to busy or i would stalk product. When the next shift of cashiers come in i would than have to switch them out and count the tils. Management was not the best because every time i needed to get in touch with the DM i never had a response. the hardest part of my job was probably preparing for a DM visit because the store had to be perfect an i was typically the only one making sure it was as nice as could be for the visit."
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar tree but the pay just was not enough. It was very fun working with the staff and register and the costumers. They train you properly and will not put you on the floor until you feel if you are ready.
good,my experience working at dollar tree was great .Everyone i worked with were nice and very helpful.I learned how to be patient with people.
good,"Good place to develop job related,skills, management were willing to work with you through training and daily work activities"
good,"This was a very relaxing, low maintenance job. Cashiering there was a breeze. The only problem was the manager who put me into the system as being unhireable after I gave her 2 weeks notice. Because of this, I was unable to be hired at a different Dollar Tree location that really wanted me. I quit that job only because I moved to another city which is where the other Dollar Tree was located."
good,"Dollar tree was a fun company starting out, there was wonderful job stability and the  management was easy to get along with, over time things just spiraled down hill, management got worse and worse almost as if the company just needed a warm body to fill in. In each store it is very he said she said, although Dollar Tree was good to me it is time to put my experiences and work ethic towards a more valued company."
good,"This Company was fine all in all, their constantly replacing Management,Lack of structure. This company is a long day of physical activity including Stocking the shelves and Backroom,Taking Truck 2 times a week.little to no room for adjustment in work No Lunch Breaks 8+ Hour days"
good,"Decent place to work, customers were nice and friendly. Neighborhood store so everyone that shopped there is a part of the community."
good,"I needed a job and I was willing to take anything, so I took this job. The biggest perk is the company pays for 100% of your healthcare costs if you work at the home office and are hourly. There are a lot of departments that have high turn over rates and a lot of stressed employees because of the company merger."
good,"Dollar tree is a vile place to work for after spending so much time the turn over rate is immense do to ignored and blatant bad managing not all are awful but the majority are, and it reflects in the stores and customer service."
good,"Dollar tree was a great working environment. I got along very well with my manager, who was very helpful whenever I needed it. There were many customers who were fairly difficult to deal with, as well as unusually difficult responsibilities, but my manager was always right there to help resolve any issues I had. The only major drawback was monthly payroll, rather than bi-weekly."
good,Communicated with manager and cashiers about the tasks that needed to be completed. Ensured that stock room was neat and organized and product was stocked on shelves. Helped customers find what they were looking for or if they had any issues helped rectify them.
good,Lots of stocking work for very little pay. Rare promotions. Management changes very often. Little training. Dollar tree is an equal opportunity employer who will give anybody a chance but the work is hard as there are thousands of items that have to be stocked and it can make a big mess.
good,It is a good place to work. The four years I have worked there has been a good experience. I learned a lot and will carry it with to other jobs
good,"it is an easy easy job and everything is laid out for you, no room for error.  Very nice management very flexible schedule. To get ahead, you just have to manage to stay"
good,The job was good as my 1st job to get experience. People come and go so they are usually looking for workers a lot of the time. So if your looking for a part time thing of the side can check there.
good,good place to work really easy to learn job duties. Real easy to learn how to work cash register. Easy to get along with co-workers. Like the environment
good,"During my time working at Dollar Tree, the supervision was not so comforting. my main supervisor would talk behind my back and put me down sometimes. i did my best to complete my tasks perfectly but it was never the right way."
good,"loved working there but was upset with lack of security and not so professional management. A typical day at work; everyday was a different day and nothing was predictable which i enjoyed. What i learned; customer service skills, cashier skills. management; friendly but need to be more professional. hardest part of the job would be the customers who come in buying one small item like a piece of candy bar or gum only to get change or knew if you were a new worker and try to take advantage of that. most enjoyable part; overall everything. I loved working there, sad things weren't kept professional and organized, also lack of communication"
good,"The work atmosphere depends upon many things, including treatment from management, customer handling, and how well one gets along with coworkers.  Being a minimum wage part-time job, management does not try to get along well with employees and most employees are unable to get along with each other.  The best thing to do is to interact with them nicely and work with them to the best of your ability, however, one must never share personal details with anyone."
good,"Working there kept me on my toes. Had lots of fun with costomers and staff. Enjoyable exspearence, would enjoy working there again."
good,"Always busy. Honestly the part of the job I liked the most was greeting and establishing a rapport with the customers. People love to shop there, but don't like to have to stand and wait in long lines most of the time with only one cashier."
good,"An average day at work means that you are going to be faced with many challenges throughout your day. Its required that you find solutions to customers problems and do it effectively and efficiently. Management can vary from bad to really good depending on the situation. Its very frustrating to see the lack of action that is taken when people steal daily and their isn't anything done to resolve it or keep it from happening less. In fact, iv'e been looked down upon for reporting theft of customers in the past. It seems very rare that their is ever a problem between co workers. Everyone always seems to get along pretty well as long as the environment isn't extra chaotic. The most difficult part of the job for me was when I would see opportunities to get more done and create an attractive display to sell more product but I was never in the position to do so. It's on those occasions that management is not so good due to laziness. The most enjoyable part of being a cashier was seeing the pleasantly surprised looks on customer's faces when I cashed them out so quickly and thoroughly. I really love being able to improve someone's shopping experience."
good,Dollar Tree is a small retail job which makes it hectic sometimes.You'll have good and bad days and the bad days can be very overwhelming.
good,"For the work and amount of time this company wants you to spend there, it dosent equal the pay. there is really no advancement within the company. They hire outside the company."
good,Dollar tree was a good experience for a job. Work hours were decent and co-workers were supportive. The most enjoyable part of working in Dollar Tree was the satisfaction of providing the customers with the hgihest standard of support.
good,"a typical ay at work includes, helping on the register, getting change for cashiers, unloading trucks, stocking freight, setting end caps and different departments by ASR, building displays, changing signs, going to bank for change, vacuuming floors, recovering the store, front facing product on shelves, providing cashiers with their daily work requirements, checking emails and responding when necessary, balancing an counting tills an the safe, preparing bank deposits, counting down tills and keying information into the system, providing excellent customer service to all my customers an associates, setting work schedules for all associates, and taking the deposit to bank at the end of day after closing the store."
good,Dollar tree was an okay place. Me personally don't care to work customer service. But it was an easy job. Some of the other staff were easy to work with. This place you just work. It's a job.
good,they have good hours to work if you like the day to yourself. a typical shift for me goes by pretty quick and smooth. co workers are friendly and helpful.
good,"I worked there thru Christmas holiday. A typical day at work was cleaning up the mess everyone made rushing thru the store buying all the Christmas things that we had for sale. I learned how to manage a big store. Management was not that great, I believe she was on drugs. My coworkers were nice. The hardest part of the job was the fact that I took the bathroom trash out and got stuck in my leg by a used needle, I had a meltdown. I went to the ER and the good thing was I didn't get anything from it and Dollar Tree did take care of it as they should have. The most enjoyable part of this job was the fact that I was back to work and able to make money to buy things for my little girl as she was just a baby. I was off work for a year and a half with a sickly pregnancy and staying at home for most of the first year of her life so I could bond with her."
good,"I have a good time working with this company."
good,"Company only allows part time. A lot of work to be done, never enough hours. Company is deficient in managers and store management. Good place to work when first starting retail."
good,"Always busy, with lots to get done. No employee benefits, part-time hours are often too low to maintain happy employees"
good,"Everyday I completed the same tasks and was always told to sell certain products because they were the premium items of the day. Management did the bare minimum for employees and never took constructive criticism from their employees.The most enjoyable part of my time there was that of customer service, talking to customers made my day as an employee of Dollar tree interesting. I did not learn anything new at that job but polished the skills that I already had from previous experiences. Former co-workers were kind enough to show me the ropes of the job without any delay."
good,"cramped break room with broken down icebox that was replaced and old microwave, uncomfortable beaten up chairs, boxes stacked very high and no where/budget to put them"
good,"Great people fun workplace, terrible pay. Nice environment, terrible scheduling. learned customer service and interpersonal skills. management worked well with my schedule but it was often unclear."
good,Customer Service skills a must. Cash handling experience needed.  The ability to be observant at all times of what is happening with each transaction and your surroundings as well.
good,"It is a nice place to work with the right management! Great coworkers.....Do different things all the time. Flexibility with hours, great advancement opportunities"
good,"They'res always a lot of stuff to do to keep occupied, get along with every one that works there, and I'm always early, either to clock on  when they need my help or just to be around them if needed."
good,i was a cashier or I was stocking shelves.  I learned how to unload freight trucks and how to cashier.  I love working with my co-workers and management.
good,A typical work day for me is to always smile and to be in a good mood. While at work I learn basic mathematic skilled and how to properly stock and recover the store. At Dollar Tree my co-workers are very helpful when dealing with costumer's and helping other co-workers with things they don't understand. The most hardest part of my job is being patient and waiting for my manager or assistant manager to come help me with a problem they can only fix. Lastly the most enjoyable part of my job is when I can relate with the costumer's or when a costumer is in a rush I enjoy helping that person to the fullest of my capability to find what they need.
good,"The typical day is usually boring, but the store manager tries her best to keep things fun. The hardest part of the job is waking up early for stocking."
good,"Hardest part of the job is when its slow, but al in all not to bad, nice relaxed atmosphere, do what is asked of you, put forth the effort to get it done and even if it dont get completed manager will be pleased"
good,No room for advancement in the maintenance dept. medical ins is free for assosiates but to expensive for family members. matching 401k. its an ok placed to work.
good,"Not the best place to work, but it is easy work. cashiering. recovery. basic cleaning and customer service! Freight work."
good,It is a lot of customers around the christmas holiday and they make the store a mess daily. It is very hard to maintain the store.
good,"Management can be tough! I have learned many tools to help me succeed and have meet a few wonderful people along the way. The hard part is upper management,  word is like glass If you add a bit of Respect mixed with Honor then your team will be unbreakable."
good,"One will definitely have to eat their WHEATIES upon beginning their shift. It is very fast paced, can definitely become tiring, but the free health benefits make up for the work done."
good,the people around me were friendly. Gave me Regular hours. The hardest part of this job was getting a certain amount of boxes out before my shift was over.
good,"I was a cashier for two years at Dollar Tree. The work is simple: cashing out at the register and stocking shelves. Truck duty was once a week. The job entails a lot of manual labor in terms of moving merchandise, bending down for lower shelves to stock."
good,"Dollar Tree is a fun environment, but the low pay and little to no compensation does not make up for the hours and shifts that you will invest in."
good,I really enjoyed working with the people there. We worked very well as a team. The only draw back about the job was the pay.
good,"Dollar Tree has certain processes in place to help in tracking productivity of all the employees.  The hardest part of the job is doing more with less hours.  Dollar Tree only wants Store Manager to work 45 hours per week, but in a smaller store you are only allowed to use 150 hours per week.  Therefore as the store manager will usually go over on payroll.  To mitigate this, store manager must work extra hours constantly requiring you to lose your work life balance."
good,"My day consisted of cashiering, assisting customers, going through paperwork, handling money, stocking shelves and cleaning. I learned how to solve problems quickly and efficiently. The Management was almost non-existing. The co-workers were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers and management alike. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"I learned how to count back change, manage money, and keep a clean work place. Management was very nice and would push you to do your best. The hardest part of this job would have been going in a million different directions to try and keep costumers happy but even then it was enjoyable."
good,"The Dollar tree at Argyle shopping center is very ""urban"" to keep it appropriate.  They were robbed 5 minutes after I left the store one day, and there are people who come in every day to rob and nothing is done to prevent it.  The only police around are the ones Publix has to hire."
good,"Day starts by staging product on floor. Then stocking shelves and assisting customers"
good,"Talking to customers, teasing coworkers and staying busy stocking shelves and running the register is what I did on a typical work day. I learned how to be creative in stocking the shelves to fit new merchandise as well as how to handle a stressful job. My manager was high energy and a perfectionist. Pleasing her was difficult at best but I was able to earn her respect and get along well with her. My coworkers were usually pleasant to work with and I got along well with all of them. The most enjoyable part of my work day was talking to the customers. I loved to connect with them at the register and help them find items in the store. I worked hard to please the customers with quick and thorough customer service."
good,"It is an okay place to work, but the pay and labor they ask you to do is not equal to the pay. Working there has been an experience I will not forget."
good,"Fun and friendly atmosphere for the most part.I did learn how to use a cash register and general ops manager functions. I also learned how to process damages. I went threw hasmat training.  Work was easy aside from having no payroll. lack of hours, pay and advancement opportunities."
good,"Worked as cashier, also stocked shelves and completed inventory.  Good boss, nice co-workers, but very hectic at times."
good,"I feel I had plenty of opportunity for advancement. The pay was decent, but it really didn't balance out with the hours required to work because I did not get overtime or holiday pay. I was required to work a minimum of 45 to 50 hours weekly. Due to slow sales during some months, I was required to work more because of the hours I had allowed for hourly customers wasn't enough to cover the hours we were required to be open. There were often 2-3 hours where only one employee was in the store and I don't feel that was safe."
good,learning not to go beyond ur rank and running the dtore more smoothly. working with customers who have an need of something
good,"This job is best for kids that just graduated high school. I am a single parent and I don't make that much off of this job. The hours and shift times fluctuate. You pretty much have to have an open availability to work here. Just wish this job could be fulltime instead of part time."
good,"i would help unload the truck, worked with other employees, took on the shift of others when they needed, and was willing to work hard each and every day. The hardest part of the job was people cancelling and not showing for their shifts and having to adjust the whole day around others not showing up. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers out of the store and meeting new people each and every day."
good,"On a typical day at work I am greeting and assisting customers. I am also responsible for stocking, merchandising, truck processing and inventory control. Other duties include approving payroll, money/safe handling and deposits as well as approving store orders. "
good,I have great days at work . the manangement are so great to work with. the work is organize and the employers work as a team. great team at dollar tree.
good,Its not a hard job or a really bad one its just the lack of hrs and the amount they pay you and no raise that I know of. eeehhhh its a means to an end but a good first job. Every one is really nice and easy to work with. Just not something I was willing to stay with my whole life. I did not always give me the satisfaction that I was looking for in a job. It is also good if you are living with others and do not really need a lot more cash.
good,A typical work day for me includes consistent interractment with customers as a cashier and directing customers to where they can find what they need.  I have learned how to stock and condense products the right way following a system.  My co-workers are very friendly and easy going. I have no complaints.
good,"•	Greeted, and assisted customers with their requests"
good,"Overall, My time spent with Dollar Tree was interesting.  Very little time spent with direct supervisor to help with development but self development was important.  Having company car, not having to clock in and out, and trust but verify operation was a benefit.  Working with this company further developed my interactive skills with all level management, from executives to hourly associates.  Working with various demographics and educational levels improved my understanding and teaching methods to be most effective.  I really enjoyed my co-workers and the established relationships whereby if we were needed people were available."
good,"receive trucks and vendors"
good,As an associate Dollar Tree is just a regular job. Working too hard for too little pay. Very dry environment. Definitely one of those jobs where you have to be there to make your money. Your a cashier and you clean the store thats it. Nothing special at all.
good,No team work and the District managers are only happy if you make them look good always pushing you too hard to do tasks that are not as important as filling the shelves with stock and helping our store be productive
good,Had a lot of fun at work but also made sure to complete all duties required. Management was very strict and a lot of employees could not handle the job. High turn over. But overall the job was a great experience and prepared me for the next opportunity.
good,"Day"
good,The experience here was pretty enjoyable. The hardest part of the job would have to be finding items that need to go out under a mountain of other boxes.
good,It's a great place to work. The company has high expectation and offers less supervision.
good,Fun fast paced job. Was a district Manage for 5 years had any where between 10 and 15 store.
good,"The hours are VERY flexible, no benefits, minimum wage pay. This is a good job for a high school student or a person with no responsibilities"
good,"I liked the job I really did, th manager then was jack and he was wicked cool."
good,"The actual stores are great and the employees tend to be nice. The management is very good at working with various schedules. Unfortunately the pay is low (minimum wage), especially with the amount of work that is actually required from employees. However, this is not something set by individual stores, but by the corporate HQ."
good,"This job has its up's and down! Overall if its your 1st job it will be an good start. The work place is different, you meet a lot of good people."
good,"As a home health aide, I took care of 1 client for almost 60 hours a week. It was a lot of heavy work. Cooking, cleaning, cleaning up after my patient, and making sure that my patient took his medication was a lot of work. There was a great balance between my life and work balance and the pay was great, its just that my patient needed someone who could help him with his personal problems that possibly needed for him to be hospitalized."
good,"Working in four hour shifts was not ideal, especially for minimum wage. However, the management there seeks to appease their workers, and allow leniency in some cases. Co-workers who had worked there longer than I had often said that they hated the job, and many left to pursue better employment."
good,"My typical day at work is pretty normal customers rush, I really didn't learn anything because I learned all of that from working at circle k. For the most part my co workers were pretty easy going but the hardest part of my job was dealing with my unorganized manager and having to hunt down the schedule to find out when you work then you come in and he tells you to leave because he over staffed"
good,worked with local organizations to build relationship to use venue as location for tutoring. We went door to door to talk to parent about our organization to make them aware of the program. Co-workers were great!
good,Dollar Tree is and great company to work for with an overall decent management.
good,"It was my first legitimate job after high school. I enjoyed working with all my friends and my boss was strict, but she was a good manager and kept the store going smoothly. All in all, if it was fun until I had to move away. Definitely worth a look for first-time job seekers."
good,"Overall rating 3 stars, typical 60+ hrs per week, quality of life suffered due to lack of consistency following corporate directives and scheduling functions."
good,a typical day at work would be signing in and checking my schedule to see who I have working on my shift for that day then reading all e-mails from corporate and check if any big details need to get taken care of before I continue to stock my isles that I am in charge of and assisting with a lot of issues that customers have on a daily basis due to exchanges or complaints.
good,"Your average work experience with any retailer. Stocking shelves, dealing with customers and customer issues on a day to day basis."
good,It was a busy store management is/was horrible pay is low and hours hardly exists for such a big name successful company.
good,Like most Places its all a matter of the make up of your team. Dollar Tree can be a very fun place to work when you have the right team. Pay rate could be better.
good,"*Make nightly deposit"
good,"I started as a cashier , worked myself up to head cashier , then front end manager."
good,Liked being assistant manager but they were not for the employees like they said.Was hard to get a raise and they would promote someone and take it away just as fast.
good,Working there was a great place. But hard work. The coworkers where nice and helpful
good,Typical day consisted of showing up to work at 3am and stock shelves until 9am. I learned the dedication and mental effort needed to motivate yourself to cary out with your work during hours you wish you were sleeping. the hardest part of the job was staying motivated and not slack off on your work staying consistent.
good,"It was a nice first job, but soon the responsibilities became a tad ridiculous because I was in charge of things that a store manager should have been doing."
good,There was good and bad days like any other work place. I loved working for Dollar tree my boss was a good leader
good,The manager was crooked at the time. Overall I liked my job but I could not take working there for to long because the manager at the time seemed to be doing his employees wrong.
good,"Worked at a rapid pace to meet tight deadlines. Removed pallets, freezer boxes and damaged products from trailers. Operated pallet jacks safely, with a 0% incident rate. As stock associate that works overnight fills the shelves and prepares the store when customers are not present. Recognized by peers and management for going above and beyond normal job functions repalitization, stacking arrangement and properly tagging pallets for inbound outbound shipping."
good,It is a good place to gain some management experience and knowledge.
good,"-Depending on what the managers would like me to do, I either spend my day as a main cashier or stock merchandise."
good,A pleasant place to work. co-workers were pleasant to work with.
good,A typical workday varies. One day it can be laid back and the next day hectic. I've learned that this company does not care about anything but maximizing profit. Management does not get paid enough for what they do. Co-workers varies and are from all walks of life. Hardest part of the job was trying to stop shrinkage but couldn't do anything about it because we are always short staffed. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with all kind of people and meeting new people everyday.
good,Leaving a company that a person is dedicated to is a very difficult thing. I will not say things to put the company or myself down.
good,Dollar Tree overall has opportunity and great benefits. I worked there for over six years. I got a chance to see the full spectrum of what the company actually stands for.
good,"verry good profitable company , very tide with pay roll and management have to be multy task"
good,"A typical day would be stocking shelves, cashiering, helping others, and paperwork. I learned how to deal with upset costumers. Management did what any other associate would and were fun to be around. I loved my coworkers, they were all friends to me. The hardest part of the job was inventory and the most enjoyable was my workers."
good,It's a great company with very low pay. It's a place where you can build a good resume with plenty of experience how ever it doesn't provide a very good secure future.
good,"The job is great in general when it comes to with employees, and work environment. The only downfall is even if you're a assistant manager there is no guarantee you will receive over 30 hours of work a week. My co-workers are all amazing, I personally would stay with this company my whole working career if there was solid pay and better hours. I really do enjoy my job but it's difficult to meet ends meet."
good,A typical work day would be going in about an hour and a half before anyone was scheduled to get a working order of the operations that would have to be done that day.I would write out my break sheets and any outstanding issues i found would be put on work list after that i would check my freezers to make sure if any ordering would need to be done.I would also make sure any training issues would be spear headed by me to make sure we are all following the companies path and working more efficiently.The hardest part of the job for me was that the company just didn't give enough hours out to do the job required and the most enjoyable part is getting to work with your customers creating a special bond with them was very important.
good,"Learned different ways to stock, first job ever to show me how to use a register and they showed me more ways along time of employment.Most enjoyable part is working with the other employees and interacting with the consumers."
good,"good associates, teamwork, and support from upper management. hardest part would be not enough hours, too much freight . The associates were enjoyable, and customers"
good,Met nice people for the most part. Coworkers were great to work with. My manager and assistant managers were great. Nothing was hard to comprehend or accomplish. There was always something to keep you busy.
good,"I overall enjoyed my job at Dollar Tree, however it wasn't the best fit for me.  There was not a lot of room for advancement and I can't afford to pay off student loans from a minimum wage job 10-15 hours a week.  I enjoyed working with a group of people that cared about keeping our store as nice as we can and customers really noticed that too.  My managers had a nice balance of getting everything done in a quick manner but also having the store feel a little more laid back. I loved interacting with people and never grew tired of greeting people as they walked in the door.  For a store where everything is a dollar or less, you really can't go wrong with shopping at Dollar Tree."
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, with the exception of the little hours available and the schedule changing at times."
good,"I start work at 1:30pm mostly cashiering, it is the busy part of the day, try to throw out some stock, keep the check stands clean, I have learned to be more patient and listen more, mamagement is good at our store they listen to us there, my co-workers are great to work with, I work with only a certain few because I work 1:30pm to 5:30pm, hardest part of the job is to get everything done that needs to be done on my shift, stocking, cleaning and facing shelves, best part having great customers who have fun with you and thank you for a good job."
good,"Store operations on limited payroll"
good,"A lot of work involved beyond the job description"
good,"The Dollar Tree is a great place to work if your a student but not if your trying to raise a family and pay bills. The pay per hour is minimum wage but the company lacks in hours, they only give cashiers and stock employees a maximum of 10 hours a week."
good,Dollar tree was a good place to work for. Everyone was like family and got along. you got paid pretty good well I did. after working less then a month I was assistant manager.
good,"I really injoyed working at the store in Kenmore. Everyone was nice ,friendly, and good to work with.  "
good,"The job is meant for someone who want a little bit of money."
good,Management looked out for themselves versus the overall well being of the staff. The staff and the customers made this job enjoyable.
good,not a company to live off of especially if your a cashier. they pay minimum wage and you wont get promoted unless 3 manager approved of you no matter how good of worker you are.
good,"No day is typical at The Dollar Tree, as it is always something different and you meet all kinds of people. There is room for advancement if you want it. I have learned from working at The Dollar Tree that hard work doesn't always pay off when there is little cliques in the work place. The best part of my job is some of the people I work with and many of the customers, make my day and I enjoy that part of it very much. The hardest part of my job, is that it is a struggle every day to get everything accomplished that head office expects with a small amount of employee hours. There is constant changes being done throughout the store daily and that makes some days more difficult but it also makes it challenging."
good,Some of the people that work at the location I was employed was rude. Although I loved going to work it was hard getting to know others with their bad attitudes.
good,My boss (Store Manager) was great. Easy to get along with and backed up his employees. Got along with other coworkers. Typical work day went by fast and I was always busy.
good,"Not so big on pay, long periods on your feet with short 10 minute breaks"
good,"Working hard hours, with disrespectful customers and staff, but some of the staff were kind. My manager at the time was one of the worst. I really cannot say much since everything has changed since I left."
good,Working at the dollar tree was nice. The employees there were wonderful and the job itself was easy going and enjoyable. 
good,"This workplace taught me to basically do everything in a large grocery store. Freight, cash register, customer service, stocking. It was a positive I worked to here to gain all these skills."
good,I was the only cashier at most times it was stressful. I felt like people were angry at me but i was doing my best with what i could do
good,"I love my customers im such a people person i love to make others happy, but the hours nore pay is not really good at all so im back on the market now that i have comopleted school as a medical addmistrative assitant looking for a better job."
good,"A typical day would include counting my cash drawer and helping customers with their purchases. Stocking and straighten the merchandise by the registers. All of the managers were very helpful and understanding. The hardest part for me was that I did not speak spanish. The area where I was located spoke mostly spanish, But for the most part I tried to make it work. I also had my managers and co-workers to help me. I enjoyed meeting new people and the fun and up beat enviroment."
good,"A typical day at my job is really simple. your either on the the register or recovering the store floor. Something I learned working at Dollar Tree is to deal with different types of personalities, someone can come in with a rotten attitude or you can get a very kind person its my job to make their experience shopping at Dollar Tree a pleasant one. As far as management the store is ran in a pretty decent order. The most enjoyable part of my job is communicating with the customers in helping them find what they need."
good,I did this job whlile i was in High school. I did have fun but at the same time it was tired. why? because I had a lot of resposability at school.
good,"A typical day in volves the general running of the store, various reports/emails, dealing with schedule call-ins, processing freight, resets, customer service, cash mangement. For the most part...I love the people I work with. The hardest part is keeping the good associates. There is little payroll and most only get 8-12 hours a week. Not enough to live on. The most enjoyable part is the people I get to wrk with and the regular customers that come in. The opportunity to meet and speak with the public."
good,"Dollar tree is a great place to gain valuable experience. If you work hard and prove yourself as I did there is a lot to learn and great advancements..... My only problem with this company is that when an incident involving the store being robed on a closed day, I was blamed and fired with no investigation, come to find out the store manager that was there at the time was fired for stealing the store deposits the next week, I have tried to discuss this and clear my name and return to work for them but they refuse to talk with me."
good,not bad but could have a better management and steady schedule. Hardest part of the day of stocking 2 to 300 boxes depending on the truck delivery but not that bad.
good,Doing everything from shipment to customer service. Cashiering and stocking.
good,At dollar tree you had to deal with a lot of customers. The managers were really great! The hardest part for me was probably mopping in the morning and sweeping. Then enjoyable part was my co-workers.
good,"I was told what to do and I did it. I also helped people, but in a different way than health care."
good,a typical day at work was long and hard it was the other coleages that kept you going and helped you enjoy your day. The management was very much so professional and consistent. The job itself with its rules and regulations are very firm and strict. The most enjoyable part was knockiing off at the end of the night.
good,All retailers have tough times like inventory and holidays. At Dollar Tree it never ends.
good,"Pays the bills, Free Benefits are nice."
good,"Helping costumers, costumers are allways right. If the manager i well train it will fine.Ae good comunication try not to be so bossy and you will work fine. Hard time is to work doring the holidays. Enjoyable part it getting pay."
good,I enjoyed this job a lot. At times wish that I wouldn't have ever left. I started as a cashier and was quickly promoted to a management position. I liked the people I worked with.
good,"i started at 5am and got off at 9:30am. i loved that shift. i just wish it was an 8 hour shift. i learned how to stock shelves with merchandise. and condense merchandise so i could add more or new product. i became a very good cashier. i also learned how to unload truck on truck days. i love interacting with customers. i loved everyone that i worked with. i never had any issues with anyone. i would have to say one of the hardest things about my job was having to change the store for each holiday. i would have to pack away the old holiday merchandise and get out all new holiday merchandise. it was a challenge but i did it. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers get the things they need. if they cant find something, i would stop what i was doing and help them find it. customers are my number one priority when im working. another thing that was enjoyable was working with a great team. everyone was nice and helped each other get the job done."
good,Everyday I worked 3 waves of inventory but labeling boxes and placing them on a conveyor belt that leads to the merge sorter that sends it to the shipping loaders I worked from 6am to 230am
good,great stepping stone. Plenty to do and busy all the time. you work all sorts of hours from 5am to 10pm. you do everything from stocking to recovery to marketing.
good,starting on my work as soon as i get there to be a leader there is no hard part and meeting new people
good,I was a cashier person mainly. I also came in on 3rd shift to help with stocking and merchandising until it was time for me to start up my register.
good,"Started as Assistant Manager, was given additional responsibility as Freight Manager as well. Was allowed to use my creativity in setting up displays and planograms. Hardest part was trying to get huge amounts of stock out and give good customer service as well, forcing me to work off the clock to get stock out."
good,"After about a week of starting you get the gist of how things work with the position you have, learning new things was easy not difficult at all to follow. I've learned quite a bit, starting from not knowing how to do practically anything but count to being able to multi-tasking a register, answering a phone, assisting customers, and keeping work place clean for the next employee after my shift. Managers were understanding with situations and helped with matters if they were able to, disciplining when necessary as well. Co-workers were a give or take as they would with any other job. Had employees that did nothing and take undeserved credit and also had other employees that did their part and beyond. The only stressful part of the job was holiday, especially 4th quarter."
good,Everyday has a different problem for you to find a solution. It is a good entry level position to get your feet wet
good,i was a stock person and my job went well. one day ther was a shipment of beverges for doller tree and that was tough i had to stock all day and every min to get our store in order and i acomplished it well.
good,This was not my most enjoyable job. I worked so hard and I felt that I was never given the proper credit by my store manager.
good,"Liked the job as a starter, Little pay for the work expected."
good,Its a lot of work and not a very good pay for everything that you have to do.
good,The manager is cool he is very outgoing and bubbly. All the employees are fun and energetic. The whole place just treata everyone like there family.
good,"Hectic, not well organized on with certain manager on duty...other times can be fun and enjoyable place to work"
good,"Dollar Tree is okay overall, but there has been a great amount of unfairness when it comes to not enough hours and favoritism. The company requires too much of the employee for the compensation earned."
good,Always more and very hardto do what is expected with the resorses they give
good,"overall workplace is okay, they have a good benefit package, there is a lot of overtime, but that hopefully is changing, some jobs require more physical labor than other"
good,Good overall just not enough hours & management wasn't that great when I worked there. Only apply if U are looking for extra income not meant for your only source of income.
good,Working here taught me many things and met some good people to work with the hours were perfect for me and the bonus was the job was right around the corner from where I was living
good,It was a challenge cause of my personal life with my 6yr old daughter. So it got better with time. My co-workers were animated and easy going. We had an awesome overnight crew.
good,It's retail. Everything stinks sometimes. It isn't enough money for the amount of mental stress you have to face during the busy hours. I would recommend for young adults looking for work but it brings you down eventually. Isn't the best  to work for some resume/ work experience but leave sooner than later most definitely
good,"This is a very busy workplace, and always something to do."
good,Okay the job was pretty normal for what I was experience doing. The interaction with customers was exciting at times. I could have used more  hours. But management treated me well.
good,A typical day at work would be just having alot of people to ring up. Most of the time it isn't so bad with the type of people that go through that store.
good,"Face paced work environment, hard physical work for the whole 8 hours. you can get overtime periodically. "
good,Flexible schedules are more readily available to associates than managerial staff. Very little benefits. No full time positions available. Customer service.
good,Met all kinds of people and never knew what to expect. Store was fairly organized and required little maintenance. how ever over stock was outrageous and a team effort really made the difference in what was accomplished within and outside of the stereo.
good,Everything is average. But I enjoy working and making my money as well as getting to know different people and moving up in positions at work. Becoming an sucessfil woman is what I am all for.
good,Your paid minimum wage and are the only cashier working when there should be at least 2 or 3. Managers avoid helping on the registers. It was hard as a cashier.
good,"There was nothing wrong with my experience. "
good,Public environment.The environment is what you make of it.The customers always right.Not enough hour’s for some workers.The Customers service is key.This job had a high turnover.
good,I like this job it’s just that I did not like the manager that hired me to work he was always rude and somewhat mean to some of us that worked there and I did not like that
good,I rather talk in person. If you have any more questions please email me or give me a call. Again I feel more comfortable we talk in person. Have a good day.
good,Dollar tree was a job that i enjoyed. I would work very hard to keep store together as i did recover the entire store. It was only part time and i worked very hard in five hours. Also they hardly give raises.
good,"The best stores to work for is a healthy store. Good Managers, clean store and good customers. If your comfortable shopping there then you'll be comfortable working there."
good,"It was a job. The hardest thing was unloading trucks,stocking and keeping the store clean all by myself with no help from the other employees. On top of all that sometimes I had to do cashier"
good,The customers are great but I can't stand all the back stabbing that goes on within that compan. You have to be careful because each assistant manager is different and handles things differently. A lot of two faced workers where I am at. My manager gets taken advantage of.
good,"It's a fun job but unless your a part of management, you won't get very good hours and the pay raises are terrible. I had a great team to work with and great management so if the hours and pay were better, I would've stayed."
good,it was terrible and had mice and bugs....it had mice in the product boxesz storage area also in food boxes. they customers always stole from them and also ther was no security.
good,Few staff and easy work for few hours. This store had a great team working and I found it easy working thru the seasonal time........even offered me to work past seasonal help
good,What I learned is that not everyone at work is your friend and you need to focus on what you are asked to do and needs to be done to have a successful day at work.
good,The pay rate is minimum wage. My wage is what it is for now its close to home so thats only reason i continue to work there. Although management is very understanding at times.
good,"I like my team that I work with.  The problem is I get ONLY 8 HOURS PER WEEK OF WORK MAX! There are zero benefits. They pay you minimum wage. Employees seem to be looked at as a burden rather than an aide, and employees are also seemed to be looked at as if they are thieves and not trustworthy.  Breaks are only 10 minutes in a nasty, dirty, and cold breakroom with broken equipment and broken lockers."
good,"While employed ay Dollar tree, i gained knowledge of new things and tricks. I dealt with some pretty rude customers but it helped me handle situations that occur like that. All in all it was a short but sweet job."
good,"I liked working there, but didn't really like the people working there, they would favourtied  people which was annoying, they were sometimes way to hard on us."
good,I really enjoyed working for dollar tree. The job is very physical but it is also fun. Meeting many new people and helping customers is a part of the job.
good,The pay is outrageously low but the job is beyond easy the management team can be hit or miss it's a nice place to work you will definitely stay busy.
good,They don't pay enough....not enough hours to get a paid check. I only work once a week. I think they should give more pay and more hours to help there employee
good,A typical day at work was stocking shelves and running the cash register. I learned how to operate a convenience store. The management at my location was somewhat harsh and would write people up for doing minor things that didn't seem of much consequence. The hardest part of the job was dealing with uncooperative customers. The most enjoyable part was stocking.
good,es un trabajo dinámico y requiere de buen carácter para brindar mejor servicio.
good,"In my store we often had trouble keeping everything in order. Only one of the managers really seemed to push for that. Part of the problem was that we always seemed to be restocking, only finishing in time for a new shipment to come in. "
good,The employees are very nice and helpful. The management team is awesome they care about the customers. The store cleanliness is up to standards and to help the customers is something I enjoy doing because I get to assist people with their needs.
good,"Very fast paced when it came to being on the register , store gets very busy. Being on the floor was hard work when there was a lot to clean up in the aisled. Stocking the store was my favorite part."
good,I like my job but I need more hours and I need a good pay I have a 3 year old that needs from me. And if there is no hours that means there’s no money.
good,"Dollar tree is a decent job for the most part."
good,They were not interested in doing things the right way but only the fast way. Their was not a lot of stability or organization. They didn’t seem to know what was going on.
good,"Working at Dollar tree is fun and easy. The customers make working there fun. Getting along with co workers is also fun, makes the day go by fast. Overall it's a job great for people who are retired or kids in school looking for first job."
good,Don't really have any bad or good feed back based on this job experience i can say they pretty good on the hours that's being provided to the employee's.
good,I love working with the public  I'm a people person I got to know interesting faces  as I was ringing them out dollar Tree was amazing but there was better opportunities but if I had to go back I wouldn't hesitate
good,over the years it begin to be not that great. I made the best of it. For me it was the people I worked with. I had been through so man many manangers and they all had their ways and changes through out the store. Some things just get old and never change.
good,The store manager belittles employees and constantly tells and degrades you. Constantly are calling you in and expect you to be in last minute not caring if you have to contact a babysitter and if you do not come in its marks against you
good,"Dollar tree is flexible in hours."
good,The was ok at first but then the manager start to play favorites nd I didn’t like that  so I try to talk to her about it but did nothing so I left the job
good,"While working at dollar tree I did learn that all money isnt good money and you should not have to get treated like a slave instead of an employee, atypical day was long and that would be your day of work  for the week"
good,"The following is what a daily work routine looked like at Dollar tree:- "
good,"working in retail is the same whichever company you work at. but what makes it sound are the people that surround you , guide you and continuously inspire you to be all that you can be. encourage you to look past those unfortunate events that will arise on a steady basis. This is retail for you."
good,"This was a temporary job I had while in college. It paid the bills, but compensation barely made ends meet. The management wasn't great. Coworkers made work bearable."
good,"Dollar Tree is Dollar Tree most of all the positions are part time. So if you need something to start with go for it. You can move up and out, all depends on your availability"
good,"It was a really good job , if you a very good people person and the only bad thing would be the hours,you dont work much and the pay is bad.People can be rude and you have to know how to control your temper."
good,"Apply online with the location you want. High turn over. Cashier job very easy must move fast. Low hour per week. Get paid bi weekly. If called in for a shift, take the shift best way to get more hours."
good,"I was hired as holiday help, they had three positions available and they brought in 27 people to build up a store unload trucks and stock every shelf and wall. In sort after a month everyone was laid off except three with management experience."
good,"This position is wonderful for someone who needs a little extra cash, most positions are part time. Very simple day to day operations. You won't walk away from work feeling drained, compared to some similar positions in other companies."
good,The management of the store is overall ok but they in my opinion need to pay more they have the cashiers stocking up the shelfs and the registers plus checking out customers. So for an example if I'm on one of the aisles and can't see the register while I'm stocking up the shelves then the customer is waiting till I come back up there which to me no customer should have to wait on
good,"I loved being an assistant and eventually wanted to run my own store, but due to a not so well organized store and a high turn over rate in employees. I chose to leave plus some of the companies policies seemed unfair and not up to par in my opinion. I hope the best for this company but if were to ever go back I would only do so if I absolutely had too."
good,wish it was not seasonal so I had full time work.but other then that I like working there.its nice paced easy to catch onto. employees are supportive and nice.overall good experience so far
good,"A lot of work for such little pay. Everything is a dollar and people complaining about the quality, but there is nothing the lower personal can do, they would need to complain to corporate. Good place to work to gain experience."
good,"For the most part, the early morning work is consistent. Whatever days you're set to work early in the morning, you'll usually do that. The problem is that the truck chronically conflicts with the schedule. They have a habit of being late, which can lead to not working certain mornings (because there's nothing to stock yet) or coming in unexpectedly because the truck is now set to arrive at so-and-so."
good,It’s a good start !!!! You can learn the basics of customer service as well as leaderships!!! You can learn some things working there! Just learn and reach for more
good,"Management is good, my coworkers are amazing. The customers are always fun and make the shifts go by a lot easier. Hours are very off and on. If you need only a couple hours a week for work this is your place!"
good,Need More Money & Benefits.. Some People Dont Work And It Makes Your Job Harder Because You Doing There Work As Well..There's No Team Work  At All...They Hiring To Many Children That Doesn't Want To Work As Well
good,"I do my best on any job I set out to do, no matter where it is. I love working with people, meeting new people, Ang just moving about. We have a family vibe in the location and I love that."
good,work ten to twelve hours a day. picking and loading cases to deliver to over a thousand stores a week. always on your feet and very fast paced and physical enviroment
good,"It was a very easy job very simple but customers do get crazy sometimes. but overall the manager was great, the assistant manager was great and they worked with my schedule being a single mother."
good,I learned to ring up products efficiently and quickly. i also learned to properly stock shelves. The work place was fast paced. the hardest part of the job was disgruntled customers.
good,"It’s was a good first job for me to open the door for better jobs ,Career ,Opportunity It’s was a great Experience to help me get into higher Position And opportunity to come along in my future"
good,working here is okay if you have to work. stocking is the best job to here at this company because you don't get bothered. you just have to get your job done.
good,"Overall experience was OK, I’d recommend this job to anyone that was seeking employment. There are no benefits and pay isn’t the highest, but you do have a chance to work your way up the ladder."
good,Cashier great co workers Fun fast pace environment most enjoyable part of this job is the customers. Its so very busy at Christmas time. I had the opportunity to work in two locations. and enjoyed both.
good,"Great customers, I learned more about the money management side of the business.  Not enough people during the Christmas season.  The job is easy not hard."
good,"fast pace work environment, friendly customers, typical work hours, numerous cashiers only getting 15 hours or less, lazy ASM and no manager. insurance, dental and vision offered but cost entire check for family"
good,"If you can deal with a busy pace, this is the place. Great store to shop. Plenty of different items each week. Friendly customers. Good location, parking."
good,It was a 1st job for me straight out of high school.... while I learned a lot the pay sucked and that's all I have to say about my time at the dollar tree
good,Dollar tree is a great 1st time job I would recommend that you work there easy work as well very fast pace but overall easy work simple and freak hours
good,"Dollar Tree is a place, I'd say could definitely use improvement, at least the one I work at. I have seen stores with employees much happier than the one I work at and I feel it comes down to too many aspects to write down in one review."
good,"The workload wasn't that bad, but management and their designation and changing of work hours was horrendous. The manager at the time would give shifts to whoever they wanted, even if that meant canceling another person's shift."
good,Good place to work to better your career working at a fast speed I like the job I would recommend the job to other people friendly environment great place to start
good,I had fun working a Dollar Tree teammates were fun people the company its a great company but it had some upper Management not too well train hope that now its better place than before.
good,"Dollar Tree isn't too bad to work for. There is a lot more labor and stress involved in being management than for the average worker. All things considered, I would work there again."
good,"I enjoy working at dollar tree, but it does not offer the schedule I need to accommodate my child's schedule. At my location it is not team based, and a lot of the time the employees are out of the loop with everyday work. They did advance in me into managment fairly quickly which I am thankful for. The employees often stand around complaining. I try to reinforce positive thinking"
good,"The overall work place is very fast pace, but lacks employees help. Your are expected on a daily basis to fill as much product in the store, while helping customers. The company is really a stepping stone for those who need to start a retail career. You can be overworked most of the time being there."
good,"Overall my experience at Dollar Tree has been a positive experience. I've learned a lot about how to keep a store organized and efficient. I've learned new skills that can help me in future endeavors such as: cash handling including knowledge of how to recognize fake money and give proper change, opening and closing, security of keeping secret codes, and customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is that you have to stand most of the time other than on your break. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your regulars that come often and working with your co-workers. It's a bonus that you rarely have to work alone, there's always someone else scheduled to be in the store with you."
good,"Dollar Tree personal have and continue to be a fun group to work with. Regular employees have their own set functions and tasks to complete on a daily basis. We have very nice people that come in to our store and it is a pleasure to see them return to our store.  I have enjoyed working with customers in a retail climate over the past two years. My background is in nursing, 35 years and I am seasoned to work with the public in most situations."
good,Did not have many problems good work environment not many hours tho but i would work there again if asked pay is okay would need another job to make bills
good,"The staff/management are awesome. Most customers are very nice, however their are the bad apples everywhere that trashed the store. It was difficult to keep the store organized because of the high volume sales we did. They are very flexible and understanding. Very hardworkers here. Plus you could do your shopping when you were done with your shift and save a ton of money. The job was a God sent, as I was new to Texas.👍"
good,I had to wait 2 hrs but I was patient because I really wanted the job I was respectful and answered everything how I should have I even got hired on the spot
good,"It is not difficult to get into management, but you must be able to put in the hours that are expected and then those that are unexpected. As a manager, you work your hours above and beyond what is scheduled if you want to succeed."
good,the store is great but i think management could be more organized  and the company could provide more of pay for the loyal  full time employees they work so hard a deserve to be respected and shown there appreciation.
good,"No further explanation for Dollar Tree. "
good,Fun but everything was unprofessional. I would've stayed but management was in organized and trying to do it by myself was a work load . I advanced quickly from stocker to cashier to part time management.
good,"Great Learning Experience. Each day started with me manning the register for about 2 hours, then I switched to the main floor to stock. At the end of my shift I would sweep up the floors and replace products."
good,I liked working there but they are only a part time giving out only 20-25 hours a week I have 3 kids that depend on me to provide a roof over they head and food in there mouth I'm a quick learner and willing to take and help on how to become better at anything task that's but in front of me
good,The job was very easy as long as you’re good wit money and counting. It’s kind of a fast paste job to keep customers satisfied and to keep down commotion in the job.
good,I needed more money to survive on for the cost of living so I had an opportunity to get more pay better hours and it fit my professional forte in the security/investigation field. For a short time I worked both jobs.
good,"Overall, it was a nice place to work at. As an assistant manager, I had to train new hires, do recovery, help customers, answer phones, monitor register activity, handle schedules and so on. However 8.25 an hour is not the pay an assistant manager should be getting..it'll barely get you by."
good,"a typical day was only about 4 hours.  Did not learn anything new. management was decent. workplace culture was hazardous, with customers allowing little kids to run around constantly."
good,The company sells things cheep. But they dont hire enough people to stock stores properly .Then complain when the stock piles up.They want to pay u low and not give u hours to have employees do the work
good,Dollar tree was a stressful job when it came to the deliverys they weren't organized remember one time they made us unload the truck which had over 3000 items which we only ordered about to 2000 items
good,Overall I did not like the riverside experience. The managers aren’t doing their jobs right and no one else really knows where anything goes. I would have to learn on my own!
good,"Start morning bringing in freight from truck, recover misplaced products, stock shelfs with product, assist customers and keep store clean and presentable."
good,If its a day that Im working a mid shift. I work on cash register and put product away. If I'm working a night shift then I would make sure store is clean and everything is put back where its supposed to be. And also do a night deposit. If I'm working on a weekend I would open the store by getting the cashiers ready for work and then I have product to put away from the backroom. When closing do a deposit and make sure store is locked.
good,"Good place to work im just needing more pay the store does not hardly pay but minimum wage , the manager is greag one of the best ive ever had at any work place"
good,"It was a really good  job, I learn a lot of new things. I was a cashier I had to help customers with the items they wanted and to clean the areas that I was working."
good,It was ok but more work days would have been good. I guess the only bad part was the Company system terminated some workers without notice. Would work there again but only temporarily.
good,If management was more involved instead of just worrying about the bottom line I believe this company could be a great company.  A lot of elderly and customers on a fixed income depend on the Dollar Tree.
good,"Working at dollar tree was a great job to have when you are in college. Its a simple job where you do simple things such as cleaning, organizing, stocking, cashing customers out and closing up the store with a manger."
good,Managerial staff was completely revamped because of problems when I worked there. The new staff is good now as far as I can tell being just a customer now
good,"Dollar tree was an easy stocking jobs I use to work at goya’s, precon, hillphonex, TFC. Those jobs had something to do with picking, packing & stacking all those are warehouse Jobs."
good,is a part time job they pay at 9.00 and hour and is a productive store you learn a lot of thing there's a good store all the employees they are nice especially the manager
good,when i was there i was part because of the holiday thats the only time it was and stressful besides that when it was over it got really slow and thats when my hours changed
good,The most enjoyable thing I enjoyed about this job was meeting people. The salary was not great but was enough to keep my bills paid. I had to multitask and check the customers out at the same time. Sometimes it got really hectic.
good,working at dolla tree was great and everything went fine for the first 5 months then I meet the district manager and everything changed my manager become cold and hostile towards me giving me nothing but the night shifts trying to write me up for thing that wasn't my fault I ended up having to fight daily to enjoy my workplace the only thing it had going for it at this point was my co-workers but most of them were leaving my co-assistant manager was leaving I felt there was no place for me there so I handed in my notice too
good,"This was a ok job. No benefits, very little hours, little pay. The managers are very lazy and the store manager is a whole mess. Thief... This is a job for high schoolers!"
good,I didn't have to do much but be cashier help customers and blow up balloons on my free time or when a customer wanted one at checkout. sometimes I would have to clean each register if there's a lot of things that are misplaced and belong in the aisles.
good,Store managers are frequently in a position of issues with store hours and overtime. Better employee benefits would boost employee morale. Overall communication with store manager is proficient.
good,"Managed front end of store by greeting and welcoming each"
good,Working at dollar tree was ok. But I don’t recommend if you have children or plan on having children they don’t give family medical leave for their associates only managers
good,great co worker and kind fair manager i enjoy working there the product is new and interesting the customers are friendly they love the store the hours are great for part time
good,"A typical day for a cashier is customer oriented while doing your best to stock what you can and keep the store front as clean and organized as possible. I learned a lot about customer service. Management split most of their time between being in the office, the stock room, and on the sales floor putting out merchandise. The hardest part of the job was the going back and forth between stocking merchandise and cashiering. Most of the time I felt like a boomerang in that sense. The most enjoyable part of working at Dollar Tree was getting to know regular customers and being one of the first to see new cool merchandise."
good,I love the customers that come in everyday. I got along with almost all of my coworkers. Being a cashier at the dollar tree was a relatively easy job.
good,"Some stress when there are a lot of customers, cashier duties, maintaining the appearance of the front of the store, and stocking merchandise. I learned customer service skills."
good,The job was easy I'm used to unloading trucks full of products and stocking the shelves. I enjoyed meeting new people but there was no teamwork in that store and there were no good managers as well
good,the managers were very understanding and informative. great first job experience. taught me the fundimentals of working for any establishment. would recommend the job to any young person looking for their first job.
good,"Very demanding and driving kind of job. Stressful at some points, hard to move up in the company. Job base one pushing freight out. Ask for way to much for you to do for less pay."
good,"They job was good i had no problem with it. The job was fast paste and everyone worked as a team, even though we didn’t know each other everyone got along."
good,Overall  the place needs structure. The stores are always untidy. The isles are crowded and products are always lying around on the floor. The shelves are dirty and most times seem to be going out of business.
good,"I have been at Dollar Tree for a while now and it seems that the better of a manager you are the more you are counted on to help other stores managers do their job,with no rewards. It gets very old after a while"
good,"This company needs to pay atleast 9.00 hourly for their employees. Often business is high and only one or two cashiers on duty, the lines are extremely long , and you get no help. You're often asked to merchandise items etc outside your job description but not paid accordingly."
good,"A typical at day at work is a challenge. From experience here i learned a lot such as the things that come with management. My most enjoyable part is getting all of the product the floor and working it up and me and my crew, making sure we complete the job before we leave. The hardest part is how the hours are limited while doing a load of work. The culture of the work place is positive with smiles and working as a team"
good,the manager had her pick preference of employees and dint recognize the hard work other did. sometimes i would clock out and continue to work because they didn't want us to go over the hours but yer wanted the store cleaned and stocked when it was busy during holidays.
good,"Very very easy job. Stocking, ringing and cleaning. The work life balance wasn’t the best. Constant open/ close shifts that were never the same. Made it very hard to be happy outside of work."
good,It was an experience to work at dollar tree. The environment was great the customers where nice and a delight to see everyday. It made my day joyous while i was at work.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty much this; you go in, type your work number and the last four digits of your social security number in, you do your job, then you get out."
good,This is a stocking job where box count is more important then appearance. You work between 12 and 16 hours a week. Your co workers are friendly and management is flexible.
good,"Work is challenging but can be rewarding. Always a lot to do. A lot is expected from you. If you can not handle change, or are not able to problem solve quickly than this is not the job for you."
good,"This was okay for a starter job. Especially for those in school. "
good,"I got hired in at part time on spot. The management team was iffy about a lot. Other than rude employees and customers, it's just another customer service job."
good,I like the co-workers and the manager. I love the customers and staying busy all the time.i like being able to joke around with the other workers and customers
good,This job is more for retired people or college students. And only give cashiers and stockers 3-4 hours of work maybe 3 days a week. All though it is a fun place to work at times.
good,"Cashier , door greeter , "
good,Typical cashier/stocking job. Customers were rude most of the time. The company is not really for the employees. A good job to work while you are in college.
good,I worked here for 3 years. Shifts are 4.5 hrs long which left lots of room and flexibility to obtain another job or even attend school. I loved working here during my time of service my first store manager walked out one day. The store manager who replaced him is still one of my good friends. You will never get enough hours here to support the cost of living in the area. However if you are trying to get back into the work field or are not able to work long hrs this is a good fit. There will never be enough cashiers. 5 lanes and only 2 cashiers.
good,"They overwork you and your staff. 95% of the time it’s just you (the manager) and a cashier. Which leads to long lines and complaints. This has to do with hours they give you as a store and they definitely have their favorites. When I started working there we had a good SM, right now there’s a temporary and she’s not that good (she wasn’t even trained!). They definitely don’t value their staff"
good,"It was an ok experience. Ididnt really feel like i was getting the recognition that i deserved."
good,I  would unload merchandise when truck would come in. I would also  stock shelves with the merchandise. I was also a cashier I would help and greet customers as they came into the store.
good,"think long and hard before working for this company, and make sure you are excellent at multi tasking and and can push a lot of freight. That you aren't afraid to be on your feet all day, and make sure to stay away from register as much as possible when their is no customers"
good,Very fast paced environment. Can be stressful when not enough cashiers are on the clock. We found ways to make work fun by joking around in our free time while stocking or cashiering.
good,"I liked packing out and doing throw backs and cleaning the isles at night, it helped me learn to be responsible at work and to be organized, it gave me a sense of achievement when i would fix the entire isle the way it was suppose to be or when i packed out the right amount of boxes for that day."
good,Dollar tree is a great place to work. The only problem  is that u can never get enough hours to survive in this society. Management is good to you and also coworkers.
good,"This job is very fast paced, especially around the holiday seasons. The customers are nice but expect a lot of assistance.  The management is nice to work with."
good,If you have a great manager then your job is easy. But if you dont its stressful like any job. They will put anyone in any position just to fill it. And this drives the poeple who want to work to quit.
good,"Dollar tree is a great place to shop . You greet the customer  ,expect the customers expectations and thank the customer for shopping at dollar tree . Your day will go very well ."
good,"Never worked at a place that is run by such incompetent mgmt and unprofessional standards in my life. I actually used to get in trouble and told I didn't have time to spend helping customers that had requested my help. Zero concern about customer service. Long lines, hot stores, dirty bathrooms, clutter everywhere.  Definitely an all u can do for them company. "
good,It's alright i mean i really don't understand this review i mean i was a cashier a typical day at work should be self explanatory i thinl anyway checking customers out
good,The job is pretty good but I need a better pay. The cost to live in my area is to much and dollar tree does not pay me enough money to help support me
good,The Hardest part of the Job here was unloading stock from the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job here was putting stock in shelves. The workplace culture here was known as sales floor.
good,I liked working here. I had an awesome manager who worked with my schedule. However the pay was low and there wasn’t enough hours available for each employee to work.
good,"Dollar Tree was relaxed, easy, and slow-paced. Around the holidays is when the paced was really picked up. For someone who doesn't have many bills or someone in school Dollar Tree is a good place."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Just little frustrating.  I was promised to move up from position, but never got that promotion. "
good,"Wonderful customers, ok bosses. Flexible break's. Unloading trucks was always a challenge. But it was always done to perfection..."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers. Dollar tree as well as many other places have whats called regulars. It's nice to know some of the faces that come in sometimes as much as everyday. I enjoyed my job it just was'nt enough hrs.
good,"Not enough hours, not enough pay to support my family even though new people get hired despite not having enough hours at the store. No weekends off for me."
good,"Working here is not hard at all. Some days are busy and some days are slow. There is always something to do within your shift so you can't get tired. The staff and customers can make it a friendly environment for you. unfortunately, it is not worth the pay if you plan on making it a permanent job"
good,"Its really nice to see a family to come and shop. dollar tree company is a joy to work for. their is always great energy, great attitudes and great people"
good,The job is good for a summer kid out for the summer but not if you have bills and a Family to take care of but I love the job environment and the people that work there
good,i personally enjoyed time with my manager. he was very lenient. i didnt care much for the hours they usually were less than 30 a week plus there was barely any benefits. good job for part time and going to school though.
good,I do not think the store is ran in a good way. The hardest part of my job is that it is a messy store. I do not get enough hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers.
good,"Dollar Tree taught me about product, service and merchandise. My managers and coworkers were very friendly and taught more about the job to the best of there ability."
good,I didn't have a problem working here stuff was friendly and so were customers. I only stopped working here because I moved. It was a brand new store then back 2015.
good,"this company is great to work for if you are in need of extra cash, a secondary job, or even if you are in high school and you want to practice being in a work environment"
good,"its a good part time job for your first job, cant really pay you much if youre older or working there for longer, they can barely pay you since everything is so cheap and minimum wage is going up."
good,"unloading trucks was difficult due to orgaization. had to put away stock according to company policy x amount of product per minuet, some was easy some impossible"
good,It's very hard to get enough hours to make working there worth while. Great manager and pleasant work culture. Good for someone not looking for many hours.
good,"I was the merchandise manager at our local Dollar Tree, & it was fine at first. After I became acquainted with everything our store manager was hardly there, & when she was she was always on her cell phone. I was expected to do my job, & hers with no additional pay. She would have these"
good,this was a part time job and I only worked 3 days a week while going to school. Weekends were busy most of the time and if i would work with this one manager she would not help if things got busy. Overall it wasn't a great job.
good,"Fast paced workplace have to be will to work at a steady pace and deal with customer on a professional nice manner, nice if you need a part time job decent management"
good,"The pay that I got was decent. The management decided who they did and didn't like and delegated work accordingly. After begging to be trained properly on a new job for months, even talking with human resources about the situation, I eventually had to move on. I would have stayed had the same management not constantly asked about my production numbers after numerous accounts of me asking to be trained properly."
good,"i needed to have a job and dollar tree hired me, management was friendly and helpful during a rough time in my life. minimum wage pay is kind of unreasonable, though, dollar tree stays so busy that it was not abnormal to spend a whole shift at the cash register with only a 10 minute break. they can do better."
good,Particular areas require real improvement especially management wise having a disciplined manager but lenient one may be cool but having a messy store doesn't show any progress of real management.
good,if you have a good team its a great job. same with having a good DM. lots of turnover not competitive with wages so be aware. overall job is very easy.
good,"its an Okay job on the side, they don't Pay a lot but you'll have more chances on getting hired on spot,  so its better then having no money at all. this is a more young adult first time job."
good,"Scan items, stock items out of boxes, ask customers if they need help, assist the customers in finding what they need if it is possible, wipe down conveyor belts, etc."
good,It was an okay place to work need to be flexible with schedule - schedule chsnged every week to different times and days - it is a retail job so as you can expect you have to work holidays but you do get holiday pay
good,"Easy work , great management , decent pay . Hours are a little different . I left because I had surgery and needed time to heal , and the hours ended up not working with my home life."
good,"Jobs not distributed evenly,lack of teamwork,favoritism,same hours of work everyday,lack of people working,too many things to do In small amount of time,dirty registers"
good,"The hardest part of the job was the turnover rate, a lot of work could have been put into helping people grow through the company and the person could be gone before having a chance to truly benefit from the experience."
good,Good place to be to start out...nice to interact with different people and learn different things and new thing about the retail world.very good company
good,I was hired on the spot I wasn’t interviewed. That was my first job & I didn’t get trained I had to just learn as I go. I got a little help on how to scan & cashier the correct way but from other coworkers. Overall the job was okay it was a fun environment to work it.
good,I would work 70 plus hours as a store manager and only get paid for working 45 hours.  I was told by the one district manager that i was doing a great job but then they replaced that district manager with another one who became friends with an associate that she promoted who was caught before stealing from the company but not let go.  they became friends and kept telling lies about my job performance just to get rid of me so I went and found another job.  Put in a months notice with 2 of those weeks being vacation time that i needed to use but she refuse to give me those vacation hours when I left.  so I got screwed my 2 full weeks of paid vacation
good,Dollar tree wearhouse is a great place to work but the managment is bad they have a lot of favorites and that's who does the best there and the management dont help when there is a problem
good,We don’t get very many hours. And when you do you do not get a set schedule. The best thing I like about my job is the interaction with the customers.
good,Working at Dollar tree was definitely an experience that I feel everyone should have when starting a new job. Especially those like me who chose this as their first job. I gained many skills while working here and I'd recommend this job as a temporary stay to someone just looking for a few extra bucks. You could not live off of a dollar tree salary iny opinion.
good,"Feeling overworked and underpaid, there is always something added daily but not enough hours given out to complete these task."
good,"Nobody shows up for work. but the managers will give out hours so that's the good part, not much goes on, it's easy, smooth work for a decent amount of pay."
good,it was a productive work place to work but it was stressful... busy place especially on the weekends and evenings. customers can be very rude and extremely annoying. they would mess up the place and ask the employees there on why is this place such a mess.
good,"Overall it was a nice introduction to the retail side of the business world. Aside from having to deal with shoplifters, I'd highly recommend the place for anyone."
good,I feel like it’s good too get the opinion of people who are working this how you are making a environment a better place for workers..the more peace there is the progress there is
good,Lots to do at Dollar Tree. But not enough shifts or hours. This would be an ideal job for a high school student to put a little bit of money in their pockets or an older person looking for a PT job. There is no advancement opportunity with dollar tree that are offered.
good,"Poor management, they bring other employees from other store to work instead of giving hour to that stores employee's. Was hired full-time and working part-time"
good,"At this company, you have to be 100% dedicated. You can not have a second job or be involved in any other outside activities. This job requires everything that you have and you have to be willing to give it hands down. This is a company that you WILL work very hard for."
good,A starting place to learn how to become customer service friendly learn different stocking and positions and different tasks become a great social person overall a good working at this place
good,Its a good environment good people clean environment good working hours mangers are nice and work with you if you need time off. Good place to work for anyone
good,"Finding help is tough enough and only allowing to schedule less than 15 hours a week for part times, you go through lots of help because people cant live on 15 hours per week. Have been with them for 20 years and there has been a sharp decline in store standards."
good,"Dollar Tree at 1750 E Gun hill rd in the bronx is terrible!!! All the assistant mangers have attitudes, including the manager himself. I used to hate coming into work because I felt unwelcomed in this environment."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was beneficial for my career. I learned a lot of management skills and customer service skills in my time working there. It is a lot of work, you're always doing something. Management was the best part but they don't give you a flexible schedule."
good,Dollar tree is a job for people that have very little job experience and are willing to do minimal work and get paid minimal wages. this job is also for people that have limit time and only wants to work for 20-30 hours a week.
good,"Relaxed, not stressful. Nice, easy-going manager but that also meant little supervision and little accountability, hardly knew what my schedule would look like a week from when I was supposed to work. Was promised calls for updates on work schedule that never came. Truck delivery days were always a pain but still very doable. Really only had experience stocking food and food related items."
good,a ttypical work day consists of ringing out customers and cleaning your register and completing your side work. very repetitive. hardest part of the job is unloading trucks and the most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,Dollar tree is a Good place to learn retail to get experience and hone your skills thier is room for growth as well as relocation opportunitys available
good,"I didn't really enjoy the job like I planned to, but I made the best of what I was given. The managers and employees were great people with great communication. The hours and the pay rate just wasn't enough for the living circumstances. It was hardly ever busy and I could only work evenings."
good,"Well every day at work was different. One day you could be on register, but some days you could be unloading a big truck that takes about 5 hours to unload."
good,The crew always seems to act like family. Work is prerty slow paced but easy. Only difficult days are when the truck arrives. It all depends on management though.
good,"Management expects certain case count per hour, most of the time it was very difficult to get to the amount they wanted. Wished that we were allowed more hours to get things done."
good,It was a great experience to help me build my skills and explore different opportunities in a fast pace work environment management was hands on and helpful in helping training
good,I did like working for dollar tree but the pay was not enough for what you have to do even though its just 5 hours but it feel stressful to be. But the up side to this is that they are very flexible of hours.
good,People come to this tiny store and create lines with nearly 15-20 people sometimes all at once. There is usually only one cashier and one manager so it is so hard to keep up with the needs of the customers. We always have people stealing from us and the manger says that mean we get less payroll. It is unfair because I will get in trouble because of the lack of management and their attention.
good,"SOME OF THE DAILY DUTIES: "
good,"great staff, great hours, friendly town. Even though i was seasonal it was a great experience and i would recommend anyone that loves retail to work for this company"
good,"it's a beginner job great to learn mandatory skills, especially when in high school. You also realize how to communicate with a variety of people. Being optimistic is important on the job."
good,Poor management because employees were hired who did not have many skills or work ethics and made it difficult for us hard working employees to do our job.
good,"The job itself wasn't too bad, it was a pretty decent job just the pay wasn't very good and the work that you do is well worth more than $7.25/hr. The management was mediocre, I feel like they should have helped out more when it came to certain projects, but for the most part it wasn't too bad. Dollar Tree is a great job for young teens who are working part-time and going to school, or for those who just got out of high school, but their pay is not enough to cover living expenses where we live."
good,good place to work i love the manager and co workers are very supportive and cooperative. we get enough breaks to keep us satisfied and we are all treated with respect
good,"Hardest part of the job: dealing with rude customers"
good,I had a good time working there being with people and helping them when needed. It was a part time job I had after high school and eventually I needed something full time and something that would pay more. Stocking the store and unloading the truck would probably be my favorite part of the job.
good,This was not my favorite job I ever worked but it was by no means hard. I was a cashier and that was about it. The pay was minimum wage so that was one of the reasons I left.
good,Very laid back and easy going work place. The customers are regular and out of state. Fun and flexible schedule. A lot of patience comes with this job also.
good,"Friendly workers "
good,It was nice place to work. It was cool. Liked my manager. She was cool. Take off when need to with no complaints. Had a good time there. Helped me with patience.
good,working the night shift was a hard but easy shift and a good experience on how to manage my time during the day and not being able to procrastinate on my homework because i couldn't wait to do it at night time. the hardest part of the job was waking up to get to work.
good,The main boss was great.  It was enjoyable to work with her and I wish I had worked with her more.  The overnight boss was very rude to workers and needs to take a class of culture and professionalism.
good,"I believe there is potential in advancing your career, the pay will will start low, but a lot of raises are awarded when you apply yourself to your job."
good,You will have to work every weekend and holidays. From Thanksgiving to after Christmas you have to work 6 days as a Store Manager. You work 50+ hours and only get paid for 45.
good,"Dollar tree is a good job if you like to interact with the customers, it is also busy all the time. Working there you really don't get breaks, super busy."
good,"Dollar tree was a very average job from my experience. You worked the worst parts of the store for minimum wage, as to be expected. I do not have any negative feelings for the company."
good,"Not enough wages to pay bills, definitely not enough to support and feed you if your on your own in life. But enough to barely get by if your possibly still in high school"
good,Productive and fun workplace with an eye to value retail. My store is the best and cleanest in Manatee county. Our product is out on the sales floor quickly and in an attractive manner and is easy for the customer to locate what they  are looking for.
good,It could’ve been a better job some of the workers weren’t that nice n pushed the limits of a worker and too much on the body for the unloading and stacking
good,Worked as a cashier typical day was assisting customers with their needs. Keeping work space clean and organized. Restock end caps with miscellaneous items.
good,I don't like this company anymore we are overworked overwhelmed and and they don't give you help when needed. I need a new job where there is structure and a team environment.
good,Slow environment but it was a fun place to work as a first job just to get my feet in the water. I had great co workers and that made the job bearable
good,"I like how stay busy with the company, different task are always given some more challenging than others but always got them accomplished. If you are fully staffed in the store the Management team is great because they are fully staffed to maintain all job duties they are all required rather than being short staffed."
good,"It was a good learning experience,  I learne a lot for it being my first job. Learned to cashier & stock items back in shelf. Learned to have good costumer service."
good,The store is always bringing new items in that are name brand. Most of the locations I been to are kind of cluttered . I was having issues with them working with my schedule at first but so far they have just started working with it.
good,"I would recommend this as a beginner level job for retail work, they'll teach you storage management and how to use a cash register. no drug test is required."
good,"I had good management, they listened."
good,I only worked here for the Christmas holiday. It was minimum wage pay so I didn't make much. Management was nice and were the employees. The customers were nice as well.
good,"clean up around the store, restock shelves, and organize miss placed items. didnt learn anything there. not sure what the work place culture is there."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree, was a good experience. I worked part-time as a cashier and was able to balance work and school at the same time. It was a good place to start off."
good,It was a pretty good place for a first job to get some work experience under you're belt. I enjoyed the managers I worked with and i enjoyed talking to some of the customers that came in.
good,"Putting it simply, the job is easy, and you’re paid accordingly. Older employees aren’t paid as much as new ones."
good,Little pay for working 3 different positions. Job is never staffed and no overtime pay. Would recommend for a good first job. Staff is friendly and fun to work with
good,Great god experience and good work hours flexible work schedule. Pay rate was good also and nice management and customers. Worked all positions at the time.
good,"Stock shelves "
good,"Dollar Tree is a fast pace environment, we deal with difficult customers regularly, I have to provide customer service and stay professional a all times, we stock shelves, we do janitorial duties as needed"
good,The employees that worked there at the time did not work and management there at the time picked who to blame even if that person was doing their work and some.
good,"I really liked working here it was calm the people were all nice. The environment was really fun being there everyone got a long with each other.  I am a fast leaner so I really got the hang of the computers, helping the customers and being able to stock quickly and calmly."
good,"Every day was the same... Slow at first then would have times during the day where it would be packed but overall laid back place to work."
good,It’s a typical day . I learned that it’s a slow pace working job. Management is fine. The job it not hard. The most enjoyable is the end of the shift .
good,"It's a typical retail work environment.  Low pay and lots of work to do in a short amount of time.  It's ok as a starter job, not complicated.  Have to stay on your feet all day and work swiftly to keep the lines down."
good,I liked it because I feel like i got better at my communication skills talking to customers and so forth. I tried my best to be organized and overall I felt like I did a good job at that and I feel like the workers in general did good at that skill as well.
good,Some days where better than others. After I was hired there their were some ladies haired after me to help with stocking the shelves and by time I was there for three months there was a lot of drama between the employee and manger at the time
good,Working at Dollar Tree gave me my first retail experience it was a okay job have fast environment customer friendly environment my managers there were good
good,Its good for a first job to help get you started but i dont recommand staying there for long. The job is simple and easy. As long as you do what your told to you will do just fine
good,Dollar tree is a fast paced inviorment while giving great customer service being friendly and always giving all you have to make sure that the job gets done.
good,"My general day consisted of running the cash register, putting away the items left laying around the store, stocking, helping customers find what they need and vacuuming the store after closing. "
good,"Flexible hours makes it a good job while going to school.  Typical day at work consisted of counting the safe, filing cash out sheets, returning product to the floor and cashing out customers."
good,Like anywhere else..its too many broken promises and not based on knowledge but personality.true colors weren't shown early on .......itsa job like many others
good,i would stock and clean and cashiering and interacting with customers. the team members were all different ages and race. it was a calm place to work.
good,I loved it but I had to take a lead of absence. Had a very tragic moment. Other than that it was great working there. The staff was amazing they loved when I come in for work.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree mainly because of my manager and employee. I think I was lucky because the people I worked with were great people. They made me enjoy my work. The manger and assistant managers were not too strict but got everyone to get their work done. Assistant managers worked very hard and are great examples for other employees but manager did not seem to work too hard. However, the manager has other duties we do not know about, this is just how it seemed. He was a great manager still."
good,I wasn't as happy as I could of been. I liked it at first but it became a pain in my behind after a while. I liked some of the people I got the chance to get to know.
good,"would clock in get started on stocking shelves helped customers if they needed cleaned area, cashier would be fun you get to know the customer they tell a story but still working at a fast pace management was nice we all worked hard to finish tasks hardest part was changing shifts enjoyable part of the job was going back everyday and learning new things"
good,"Dollar Tree is an easy job, but at Christmas time it can be a bit demanding. The biggest downfall with this company is the hours. An typical worker may get 5-10 hours per week on minimum wage. It isn't really worth it if you have major responsibilities."
good,"It was okay. Not many hours. But cool place to work. Pay is horrible. But overall okay place to work. Management was okay. Very diverse, and fun place to work."
good,"Some days are fast paced and others are slow, the managers are professional and always willing to work with your schedule. They are also willing to give you some extra hours."
good,"Good place to work, nice people. If your just doing the register it's pretty much easy. On your down time we stock and put go backs away. Your only there for a few hours anyway. If your stocking, you have to put down how many boxes you've stocked. So if your slow your screwed. The company  sends over so much merchandise every week that even if you can stock fast you still have a lot to get done. Sometimes there's nowhere to put stuff on the shelf because they send the same stuff all the time. You don't even have a say in what your store actually needs."
good,They hired me for Part time yet gave me full time hours but could not offer me the benefits of a full time employee.  They allow you to get a second job but they consistently change the work schedule which causes job conflicts.
good,"This place will keep you busy, always merchandise to put out and things to clean. I met one of my best friends working here! Apply if you're looking for a fun and fast paced environment."
good,"Merchandise frequently changes. Great place to work with people and learn about soft line or hard line retail. Associates have set guidelines and tasks to complete for their shift. Multi tasking is a must. Stocking, cashier and recovery must have strong skills in order to complete daily tasks."
good,"environment was good , very fast paced , the boss was chill . not that many hrs and would always call at random . great communication with peers . great customer service experience."
good,Dollar tree was not a bad place to work. The coworkers were great. The hours on the other hand were not that great. It was not a steady shift. Management was good
good,The Dollar Tree I worked at was rather loose and sloppy with its organization and level of cleanliness. More often than not it was acceptable to have something on the shelf than have the correct items in place.
good,"Did not get the help when I needed it, was not treated like everyone else was. When I went to ask what was going to happen that day no one gave me a good answer."
good,I worked at this store for 6 months but I was pregnant and stop going I like that I was good with my coworkers I get along with everyone now I have a Transportation
good,Working as a cashier in a very slow paced environment. Consistently standing in the same spot for numerous hours with a 15 minute break. Time goes very slow and was not enjoyable
good,a typical day at the dollar tree concist of organizing items restocking and taking care if customers as a clerk. it was more of a laid back job on the way to something bigger and better
good,learning the register was very easy. Learning the stocking was easy as well. Working retail you have to be with customers all the time. It doesn't matter if you are on the register or stocking.
good,"Coming into work, putting away my belonging and gong into the managers office so my drawer can be counted. From there getting on my register and greeting customers and ringing the items that they picked out then providing then with correct change."
good,"I had this job as supplemental income. It did not offer very many hours, so it would be hard to live off the income at the Dollar Tree. However, it was a great place to work with friendly people and the manager there was very flexible a good to work for."
good,you end up doing the managers job most of the time. Not paid enough for all the things you have to do. Cashiers and stockers are pretty much always on call and still get paid minimum wage when unloading a truck.
good,"Because of how busy the store was almost constantly, it was hard to keep up on cleanliness and organization. Most of the management was very nice and accomodating while others were more than happy to watch you struggle with trying to balance all of your tasks and some of theirs."
good,it was okay i worked really hard there and it wasnt noticed but was abused. i put in a bunch of my own hours in and they didnt pay me the raise i was promised. if the managemnt of the store was better than i would have stayed
good,The Dollar Tree was a seasonal job management for freight was great the schuduling management was questionable great co workers but not relible hours.
good,"productive and fun stocking shelves, get to listen to music. The management is nice and understanding. The hardest part of the job is the early morning hours, but I make it work."
good,good job and very flexible with scheduling. fun place to work great coworkers and the job changes day to day as you serve many people from all walks of life
good,What I learned at working at the Dollar Tree was to get out of my confront zone and be able to communicate with others. I also learned to handle money.
good,A typical day at work was helping customer and i learned the every customer is Different.Management was great the hardest part of the Job was recovery the most enjoyable part of the job was the staff
good,Always had something to be doing. Zero downtime. Unloading the truck was a pain. And stocking shelves is hard when you are short. But it was very fun.
good,Working at Dollar Tree was good for my work experience skills.  I enjoyed the work I did but I felt as though the manager had a lack of management and professional skills and there was no Room to move up in the store that I was working in. The schedule was also inconsistent
good,Depends on the team and store manager. The company offers pay raises after your first year and every Oct after that. Each manager does different things and chooses how they run their store. Some Sm's are great while others are horrible and dont follow policy.
good,Have some energy it’s a good workout.  some days it’s easy a lot of times it hard work pace yourself  at all times. Take your time no need to rush at all
good,my overview of working at the Dollar Tree is its an okay place to work the draw back is that when the holidays are  done youre hours get cut immensely and when you are hired its part-time I also don't like that you get paid bi-weekly
good,"Busy, often called into work when not scheduled. Issues hiring employees. Not payed accordingly to job position. Very short breaks compared to most jobs."
good,The work place had a good working environment employees was good to work with. I can only say that dollar tree is a pretty stable job to work at if your starting off your working career.
good,"i enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, i was only there for a short period of time, but i love working in customer service and meeting new people. I liked working and the flexible hours"
good,"i find working here to be a challenge at points then very quiet. but from every time, i learned something new to apply to my work and it becomes a very productive day."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers but the customers were demanding and there was a lot of shop lifting. It is very difficult to keep the store clean and stocked, there are never enough people working. The lines at the register get long and the customers get impatient."
good,"The working environment was slow paced, but at times it would get busy. I was one of the only males who worked there so every time we got frozen food shipment, I was the one who did the heavy lifting."
good,Okay place to work for short period of time. I worked here for a couple of years and it was a good place to start but new management replaced everyone and it was a big inconvenience for all the loyal employees
good,Dollar Tree gave me the opportunity to have a full-time job. I love the company but they choose the wrong individuals to manage their. I tried to grow with the company but they just wanted me to stay in the Mod. My body use to hurt everyday but I still got up and went to work. The company like I said is a great company to work for but some people get in different positions and abuse it.
good,This is my first retail job and it has been a learning experience. This store can sometimes be a bit disorganized but the people are very nice and easy to get along with.
good,It was always somewhat full of customers always keeps u moving cleaning or organizing the shelves or the store. it kept you moving at a fast pace it helps if you are a fast learner. you got to be good with people and enjoy being around people all day
good,ambiente de trabajo agradable. Buen Aprendizaje en todo lo laboral.
good,"Dollar tree is a good company but lack the manager professionalism. Refused to work with schedules. If a day is requested off, you did not get it even when asked over a month in advance. Refused to put me on light duty while having complication 7 months pregnant and forced me to push heavy pallets and soda cases."
good,"You don't need much experience to work at this job. This was my first job, i think this would be a great selection for a first job. However the management here was poor."
good,"Plenty of work, not alot of employees to fufill the needs of the customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with very irate customers. Some were out right racist and belittled the employees."
good,"The pay wasn't very good at all, but my manager was nice. Most of the people who worked there were cool. There seemed to be a lot of miscommunication between corporate and local management."
good,the store has potential and needs a lot of work but it is a small store with great people that needs to put more love in the store or their jobs and the business will be more constant....
good,At times fast pace then other times it was very slow; customers were my real reason to work there.  It was a community of people from all walks of life shopping in the same place
good,"Good place to work and friendly co workers just needed to get paid more. but other than the pay it was a great place to work, and would have stayed if i would have been able to get a raise."
good,The dollar tree was my first retail job I really didn't realize how much work it was especially during the holidays all I can say is that you have your good days and your bad
good,I have learned to have good customer service and new job techniques I have learned how to do my job in a timely manner I also have learned new things everyday about the job and how to prepare for the best and worse
good,I would not consider working there again unless they change their production guidelines and raise the management pay. You work too hard for what they pay.
good,It is always busy. But you need a great team for the day. To run smoothly. Alot of times it is hard to take a break. They do not offer full time part time only gives you one or two days of 4 to 5 hours.
good,"It was great experience to get to know customers and co-worker, I made some family/ friends. It was not stressful, more laid back, just had to put out merchandise."
good,"On register constantly. Only get a 11-minute break. Plus, try to fill Balloon orders,or, Balloons to be filled right away and run a register. Had to fill soda coolers,vacuum rugs,take out the trash,and, bring in the side walk sale,all within a 4hr. period."
good,"Pay is far too low, and there are draw backs to full time acceptance of employment. The management above the store level is discouraging, cold, and impolite. But for a part time job for extra income, it is a good job; the customer base and fellow workers are good!"
good,lay back job easy to learn nice employees no health care and don't get paid very much but ok temporary job good for retied people who need minium income
good,The management does what it can with limited resources from corporate. Has a fast paced job environment with an opportunity to do more than one job position in store.
good,I think they're under staffed and not paid enough. They are extremely busy during holiday season and don't have enough people working for the store. Management
good,"The pay is too low, there is no hours, sometimes even with no hours you get called in. the people argue because the item is a dollar, crazy people come in screaming ""im from cali, cali is the best"""
good,"High demand of tasks to accomplish whilst providing great customer services to every individual."
good,"It was a fast pace job some days but they didn’t have a lot of workers that actually did work so more got left on me it seemed like, the store wasn’t safe at all to be working in or for customers"
good,It was a very busy place to work. I was never bored. Stocking and cleaning was always a challenge but that is what I like in a job was a challenge.  Customers were also friendly.
good,Well my employees is what i miss the most.  I got 1 out of 2 weeks training then thrown out to run stores alone not a good way to get in but ya know.  overall it was challenging ...  It helped me learn strategty.
good,"It wasn't a bad job at all. I had good management, good team, and learned well. The pay was average and reasonable, but the hours weren't enough. But over all it was a fun place to work in."
good,"Liked my location but both active mangers were bad,  1 micro managed down to the very last spec of glitter and the other was all over the place. Could have gotten better though."
good,Fast paced during the holidays but I enjoyed working there I learned to be organized and interact with different customers and help them with inquiries.
good,The place is okay if you want to learn how to stock customer service and much more it also will help you other things in your life after 5 years you can train for a manager
good,"Dollar tree Stores sometimes offer the opportunity to work around your personal schedule, The medical and dental plans are exceptional. Doesn't really consider the thoughts of their employees, and are stuck on doing things how they've always been done, which seems to work."
good,"-Greeted customer's with what they needed.."
good,"Not much work"
good,I like companies that give you endless work and little time to do them in! I would rather stay busy with to much to do then not enough to do it helps pass the time away!
good,I loved working for this company unfortunately I had to leave cause I was only getting 8 hours a week employees are very nice and friendly will go out of the way to help you
good,This type of job is only for basic pay. You can't afford to live off of this buy buy simple supplies . Work is very good to get out of your comfort zone.
good,It was a great experience learned a lot really enjoyed the crew and loved helping the friendly customers just wish they paid more and gave benefits to all employees not just management me they really just needed a lot of help putting freight on the shelves and also unloading the freight truck that comes once every week.
good,The job itself was great. The management wasnt great though. They woulf cut hours for no reason amd they under paid so much its not even worth work there.
good,"During my time there I learned how to communicate with outside cultures, which tested my patience but I prevailed. I also added a positive attitude to other employees."
good,This store helped me in working and opening a new location .showed me how to do inventory and work with customers guiding them to new parts of the store.
good,Working at Dollar Tree I was able to advance quickly. I enjoyed the people I worked with. The pay was not worth it and when it came to family or my job I had to ultimately choose my family.
good,I started as a store assistant manager. I created work schedules for the cashiers. I processed money and deposited at the bank. I opened and closed the store. Processed deliveries and restocking of shelves.
good,The team was polite and supportive. They provided training and it was busy place. They were willing to provide me with the work but I needed to work part time and I was not comfortable with the cash register.
good,"Most days I work closing. For the most part it stays pretty steady with customers. Always trying to make sure the store stays neat and clean. Managers are good at getting you out on time, as the company has a no overtime policy."
good,I maintained this job and i enjoyed my coworkers. Not bad for a first job and experience or for a job while attending school for a trade. It wasnt enough pay but you  meet lots of good people witch allows doors for other oppertunities.
good,I used to be a Manager at dollar tree for 10 years I gave that place my everything I kept it in shape it never ran down maybe a couple times when we had no one but we always got it fixed back up but  the other assistants were So lazy and didn’t do there job which made it harder on me and the store manager didn’t want to help me step up in the company so I had to go somewhere else for better pay
good,Every thing for a dollar requires a extemly fast pace to keep product on the selfes. Exelent merchandising skill is a must to survive in this envirement.
good,i was an ok place to work wish i couldve had more hours. i was getting like 25 hours per week. not enough for annually living costs where i stay at. the environment was ok.
good,"ok place to work."
good,Stocking and maintaining front end.  The procedures of the store opening and closing. Nice people just have to communicate. Friendly and upbeat. Unloading trucks in the winter it’s cold and you have to lift boxes. Getting a chance to meet new people.
good,my work days were long.  constantly dealing with alot of security issues.  managing the team of employees was fun. i did not enjoy doing this job and think they should pay there management better
good,We have about an hour to get things off the U-boat before costumers come pouring in and it leaves very little time in between to get things done. My management team is extremely helpful and are always there when you need them. The workplace gives you a chance to socialize with people and see regulars quite often. The part I love most about my job is I get to brush up on my sales skills and presentation of items of the week. I love to meet families that live in my area and hear the positive comments about the service they get at my store in comparison to others.
good,"Most was a cashier most of the time, when there wasn’t any customer around I would walk around stocking, cleaning up. Job was slow most of the time but okay."
good,Great fun just sometimes got super busy on yr feet all the time holiday time gets too busy and to many people call out but still u get the hours so worth it
good,"Fast paced fun place to work. Great people to work with. I liked unloading the trucks and putting away the stock, it was hard work but fun. Being on register was fun too the customers were a lot of fun."
good,Dollar tree is a job that will help u being a cashier and the employees are very sweet and will help customers with welcomes arms with a smile.All positive vibes and good customers service
good,It was a place where everyday we were short staffed. Plus the reason was because our manager would then take the left over hours from not scheduling anyone and would get bonuses for it.
good,"I only worked at Dollar Tree part time while working my full time job. I felt that customer service was lacking and I tried to improve it, but I was only there part time.  I felt like all the employees were there just because it was a job.  There was no sense of ownership in the store. I believe that every employee should feel like the store is a better place because of them."
good,Paid pretty low. Close to minimum wage. Expect people trying to steal. Management was good to me and the employees got along all together. Overall a good learning experience for my first job.
good,i did not really enjoy that job. The management was very poor and lacked organizational skills. But the people were amzing to work with. And the customers often made my day better
good,I worked over night and did stock.  it is a easy and hard job. the unloading of trucks was the hardest part of the job.  the staff was great to work with.
good,I think  it would be easier to work  as a team to finish projects and details that are needed for store needs and customer satisfaction. Always lend a helping hand.
good,"I have been working as a cashier for Dollar Tree since August of 2016. I have only received a .25 since pay raise. I am trying to get a career job that has better opportunities, advancement, and a great work environment."
good,stock candy and other items sold at the store onto shelves and check customers out when ready take trash out clean the back room of old boxes help customers find merchindise
good,"What can I say about this job? It's your basic soul-sucking minimum wage job that exploits hard work, and doesn't pay you accordingly for all your efforts."
good,"The day starts at 7am.I open the store with either a cashier or my Merchandise Manager. I put in my code to turn off the alarm and walk the interior of the store, all restrooms and  break rooms to make sure no one is in the store. I then check all exit doors and the receiving door to make sure they are secure. I then go into the managers office and verify the safe count with the employee that is opening with me. I put out 2 cashier tills for my opening cashier and a backup for myself. I walk the sales floor to see how the store was closed the previous night. I write a work list for my opening cashier or for my merchandising manager. I go to my computer to check my emails and respond appropriately to them. Usually after that I walk the sales floor and run freight out to the areas that need it most or I will start changing over seasonal areas in the front of the store."
good,"Honestly i (and EVERYBODY ELSE-LITERALLY) Thought the dollar tree was just a perfect* job for me.it really was..the kob responsiblies came eazy to me ..they were all for the most part kinda..my thing! ...on a regular.. and above that everything at or in a dollartree (amongst the..variety of things) sparked an interest to/for me"
good,"Took care of customers by cashing them out or providing service to whatever their needs may be.  Clean store, front face the store, put back item that are out of place."
good,"very steady paced "
good,"I worked with a lot of women who didn't really have to work, but did just for supplemental income. Nearly everyone was part time, but i worked with a great crew."
good,"Everything is 1.00 and when I say lines off the wall, I mean it but its all worth it at the end. Being on register from when im on the floor stocking ive learned that I have to move a little bit faster before the lines get crazy but it always made the day go by faster, which is a good thing. We basically make sure every items is stocked, and that the store looks presentable and make sure the customer walks out with an outstanding smile."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree was interesting. You get to meet lots of people and help the customers with their needs."
good,"this is a very friendly and outgoing place to work at if its your very first job."
good,"The management at this location was poor, the managers were always on the phone and not helping. Plus they started my salary off at $7.25 and said they don't give raises"
good,Dollar Tree is a good start off company to work for it teaches you the basics about retail and how to work with people. Dollar Tree will make you comfortable around retail so it can help you in the future.
good,"I liked working for this company, everyone was friendly and seemed like a family. Wasn't stressful at all. Relaxing to have space sometimes away from others when stocking."
good,"It was an okay company to work for. Didn’t pay much, but it was a good learning experience . Not many benefits came along with the job. Management was not paid much either."
good,restock items and keep shelves clean so all items were visible in an orderly fassion.also i helped customers find items.I also would vacume and sweep.
good,I only worked at Dolar Tree seasonal. I was only working like 15-20 hrs per week. It was not enough or even worth working to be honest. I loved the manager though. She was a very sweet person.
good,there is no leniency and it is difficult to get help when you need it. i wouldnt recommend working there but it is a very fun place to shop. usually on your own at the end f the night
good,"It was easy to work at Dollar tree. I was able to get along with all of my co-workers, and supervisors. We all were able to maintain and keep the store clean efficiently."
good,i would not recommend if your looking for full time  that will not happen you will get from 4 hours to 20 a week depends on the work flow and hours provide for store to use
good,"I'm sure it's a good first job, some stores higher within when they can. Easy job, even being a manager. Not stressful, would recommend to anyone in high school or just graduating."
good,"Basically everyday is the same routine. You go into work and are told where you are going, sometimes they may need you in other departments. Managers are friendly and understandable. Cleaning and making rate are very important."
good,it was an easy job. people were great. i had good managers. everyone got along great. customers were happy with their service. Enjoyed helping people and working with the people that i worked with
good,It was a good culture. I learned to be a hard worker and have a willingness to work. I was the first person to be on call. The hardest part of the job was to be able to unload the truck.
good,Well me as a person love to work. I feel as if i should have way more hours as i do now. Because if worst comes to worst im always there no matter what
good,"Alot of customers looking for supplies."
good,"Management allows a certain woman to run around and wine and moan about how she should have been the manager, when all she does is wine and complain, she's rude to customers and allows her family in the back room and office."
good,"The Dollar Tree was a fun and interesting place to work ."
good,A typical shift is easy going. Clock in and meet with supervisor. Then I list what items need to be restocked and i get the pallets from the back. Then i stock and restock items and fix displays until my shift is over.
good,Dollar Tree is a good place to start your work history.  You will be trained on how to use the register. You will also learn how to stock the shelves on the store.
good,"*the work environment is simple and laid back and stressless"
good,"working with dollar tree was not hard work at all, love working for the company had great benefits, just didn't have to much of team work and that starts with whom you have in management."
good,Overall the experience was warranted I learned a lot of new things learn how to better time manage better organizational skills great work culture and friendly people
good,"was very busy with stocking shelves an checking out customers at the register"
good,"For me there was never a typical day, I felt that repeated the same day all the time."
good,For me to be a stocker it was always fast paced. I was always working and customers was definitely easy to work with. The hardest part about the job was remembering where different things are supposed to be located.
good,it was ok job to work at this is a place foe young people that need a job and are able to attend school hours are not the best and dealing with some customer that were hard to deal with
good,very repetitive and I really didn't learn anything new while working. a very tense work environment and there is no benefits and no raises and starting salary of $7.35 an hour
good,i work for a manager who is almost 40 sleeping with an 18 year old employee. she received a very undeserved promotion and does as she pleases within the company. i am one of 5 or 6 who have called hr and complained and nothing has been done. the district manager is fully aware and takes no action.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. I liked my coworkers, the managers were pretty cool and laid back, training was good, pay was good, hours were pretty good for part time. I would definitely recommend working at Dollar Tree."
good,"Fun place to work, easy to stock, easy customer service.  Time off is accessible if you communicate and are respectful, nice company nice people, I'd work there again."
good,Offload a truck the come bring the goods set upvthebubolts count the products that come on the truck oraginze the good so they can get stock when we finshed with the truck in the right place clean up the stock room.
good,A typical day at work includes stocking the shelves while simultaneously running the till and ringing through customers. I learned all about the locations of merchandise and how to socialize better. Management was pretty nice they care about the company more than the workers though. My coworkers weren't too friendly but they were decent as coworkers go. The hardest part of the job for me was interacting with rude customers and the lack of recognition from my superiors.
good,"A typical day required many different tasks, and more were learned as I spent more time with the company. I felt I learned a lot of valuable tools, but often felt that I was doing way too much work for such little pay. I was only making minimum wage and was performing various duties within the store. I had a wonderful manager at the time who was knowledgeable and kind and took care of his associates, store, and customers. It would have been nice to be able to pick up more hours every week, instead of only when it was busy like during the holidays. On average, I only picked up 20 to 25 hours a week and would have loved to been given the opportunity for more."
good,Some good some bad but same as any workplace. Only had 1 issue at the job which was punching the clock. It was just hard to clock in being that everyone has to punch the clock at the same time in one specific location and any minute after is a write up or
good,"Overall great place to work. Good customers, good employees, and good atmosphere.Never had a problem. Everyone is so polite. just looking for a career."
good,"This is a job for someone who is trying to have a little extra cash or a high school graduate."
good,I had to relocate.  The shipping and receiving department was fun and the co workers were pleasant to work with.  I did learn the requirements of the position.
good,"I was supposed to get paid one amount, and was never paid that. I told them several times about it, and they did nothing. I had to leave. I liked working there, but i needed my money to be right."
good,Very hectic experience working for Dollar Tree. Poor management. Manager left me alone at register for most of the time I was working there with almost no experience.
good,Dollar tree was a pretty basic job considering if you can maintain the job duties here you can pretty much do most retail jobs else where. Management always seem wants to hire high up position outside the company i seen that 4 times from my time being there.
good,At this job you would always stay very busy.  Always got to meet new people.  I loved the fact I could help people in the store.  I also loved stocking the store and setting up for the different holidays.
good,even though my employment with company was brief I had a great time managing my younger staff. It was fun and the atmosphere was breath taking. I would work for the company again.
good,this is more so a temporay type of job not somthing for somone who wants to make or expect alot of money and thats honestly the truth but it was still nice
good,"I would arrive to work and say hello to my co workers. Clock in, get my things ready while speaking to my manager, and cracking a joke or two to lighten up the mood. For the time being I would be on the register and on the floor stocking merchandise. Always cheered me up to see the regulars come in and shop."
good,Dollar tree is a great place to work it could get hard and stressful at times because it’s fast pace and making production numbers is a must and the supervisors are easygoing gamer a long with
good,"it was ok, it was my first good outta high school it was slow and easy no challenge at all and that was my biggest problem with the job. I didn't like how they left me to myself all day."
good,"Nice job to  make extra money if you like working with people. Unless you want to go into management, it is not a career. However it is a great part-time or second job."
good,I learned a few things with this company that still benefit me to this day but they are unorganized. Improvement is definitely needed. If you are looking for something part time this would be good.
good,It  is a stressful place to work with a little workers in a lot of work to do and less hours And the benefits they give you it’s not worth it and the hours they give you it’s not worth it
good,It is a good job to start in management to cover bases on responsibility. Developing Customer Service abilities can be built here for future progression.
good,i have nothing to say about dollar tree. it is a stressful job and im ready for a change. im looking to further my career and i feel like i have gone as far at dollar tree that i can.
good,It's a great environment to work they people are always happy and in a great mood..the work is easy and doable...they just don't give a lot of hours so they pay sucks
good,"safety meetings, cashiering, stocking, cleaning, and customer service is the routine. great thing about this job is you punch in and out for breaks which insures you get them! One thing that you learn is unfortunately some customers (with or without children) will tear up the place because ""it's just dollar tree"". You should be comfortable talking on the loud speaker, and be comfortable unfortunate situations, smiling is key. If your going for management, you have to be on top of it, resets are always happening and being confident in your staff is important. you must be meticulous when it comes to stocking, knowing where your products are, is very important when it come to your job and customer service"
good,It wa fun but not enough help to keep the floor cleared from previous stock it was had to keep up with it all on a day to day bases but management had a limited budget
good,"A fun part-time retail job. Not many hours but if you're looking for a part-time gig as a secondary to a first job, this place isn't bad. There are times it gets crazy busy but the store is smaller than Wal - Mart so it's not THAT overwhelming."
good,"A typical day at work includes angry customers but not always, some are really nice. Poor management. Hardest part of the job would have to be closing time."
good,A typical day at Dollar Tree was slow but i always kept busy. I was taught how to handle money and provide great customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,I like working at dollar tree the problem is the oay in memphis thats why im looking for something in nashville. The mangers are cool but the location im in is very messy. Looking for somethibg with better pay in mashville
good,"Poor management from both in store and district manager. Poor communication skills between manager and associates. Cased a lot of ruffled feathers, and several to quit."
good,"It has its moments"
good,I learned how to stock groceries. The hardest part was unloading the truck once a week. They always sent too much product to fit in the store. They save money by cutting hours.
good,Training for loading and unloading merchandise.Stocking merchandise.Receiving Delivery and Checking merchandises.Arranging Stocks From isle to isle.Greeting customer service
good,"It was a good company they love people , and also help you out with about if things they also are very friendly we have lots of flexibility and nice ."
good,"usually only 2 workers on floor for night time and it was hard to complete all tasks during holidays"
good,"I usually worked the night shift, which was a lot of fun!"
good,"The only thing this place is good for when dealing with employment is that its a good starter job, something to gain work experience but not something that I would recommend as a career choice"
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work. Pretty decent. A lot of multi tasking. It could be fast paced at times, and hectic during the holidays. They pay minimum wage, but did not pay time and a half for holidays."
good,"Working for the dollar tree is very easy. Depending on your position you interact with customers very little, as a stocker sometimes all you do is stock products."
good,Scan the costumer purchase stock up my area. Great the customers every time they come to the store. Keep my area clean. Two breaks. Leaning where everything is.
good,Pay rate is low. Doesn’t give employees enough hours. Only part time job for associates they do not offer full time only for full time managers. Work is easy for associates.
good,"Dollar Tree is a stable employer. It is respectful workplace. A fast paced, always changing day to day operation. I had the flexibility to ""think outside of the box"" with merchandising and floor plan set up as each season change. Product rotation and sell through was fast paced and fun."
good,"I believe that if was control by different manager that things would have been a lot better. And also I believe that they need to up there pay, cause now days you can not survive and love off of 7.25 an hour."
good,fast paced work environment with great benefits. great managers the job was not hard i had oppurtunity to advance in several skills and develop relationships
good,"Great place to work"
good,"i did love working here since it was my first job in wichita but i was with the store through two managers and the first one was very mean  the new one is so nice, i regret leaving from there but i had no choice. if they would have offered me assistant manager i would have stayed"
good,"i loved working at the dollar tree. it was a fun place to be at, but it also helped having such great managers and coworkers. not a lot of perks but fun for when i was a teenager"
good,"I learned that telling the truth when you see people stealing products or taking advantage of co-workers and robbing the store is not a place i wanted to work, and when you tell the truth your the one who gets treated badly for being honest. i only enjoyed the customers"
good,"I did a little bit of everything including cashier, floor, stock etc. you have to have patience with jobs like this because a lot of people come and go and want to be in and out."
good,I came to work with the intention of being the best employee on the schedule and I did just that. I was attentive when on the register and worked to put merchandise out the fastest so I got a lot of hours
good,"Fun with the right people,  but A LOT of drama and blaming that goes on. Very stressful at times and always in a rush to go home. For the most part not enough hours,  and a lot of favoritism going on."
good,That this was a part time position as I had another part time position at a boxstore.  No benefits not full time.  Made it work for me.  Had a good crew.  Worked hard
good,checking email see any planograms can from corp. walk the floor what is the recovery looks like and what product needs to be filled. then talk to my department manager see whats going on for the day
good,"Started at Dollar Tree to get Management training and received good training and experience. Learned how to manage time and employees, learned how to do all paperwork and order for the store"
good,"This was my second job that I held concurrently with my first as the hours from both were quite few for me. I had no issues there at all, but after a change in the General Manager, I was suddenly given no hours at all despite repeated requests to be given a shift. I quietly left the company after not being given a shift for a month and having found another job."
good,I would get 3 to 4 hours a day every week. I got along well with the majority of my co workers but a few would act like they were my supervisor and try to get me t do their job for them.
good,They didn't give a lot of hours. The most hours you had in a shift was about three to four hours. The maximum was five hours. They also called in work for about three to four days in a week.
good,As a cashier i worked in the front of the store and i see them as they leave so i must always be people friendly. I learned that customer service is very important and must be implemented right in every business in order for the business to succeed and grow.
good,Its an alright job except Dollar Tree doesn't give benefits and they are very strict they want you working all the time. I don't recommend this job unless you a secondary one.
good,"The Dollar Tree I worked at was always dirty, but there were always a lot of customers flooding the store. The management was not the best and a typical day at work paces from slow to fast."
good,It was an ok job no benefits the hours are terrible but the manager was a real nice person the staff was friendly an very helpful if looking for akick back job this is the place
good,I was a freight attendant  Making sure all the aisles are clean and restalked. Assisted customers with finding items they needed. It was a great area to work in.
good,I've worked here for over a decade. Good employer. I have trained many people. The job is physically demanding and very time-consuming. I would recommend the company.
good,"This job is good as long as all your work is done. But one of the managers tend to be a pain, Always in your business but if that manager was taken out this job would be at its best it’s a really good place overall."
good,"Good place to work, long hours, wages are ok, you don't just delagate, you unload the trucks, stock, cashier... Must have a good team to be able to get job done..."
good,"The job is simple and easy. What I do is recovery and go backs. Anyone can do it. However, if you want a job that is mentally challenging then this isn't for you. You don't learn new things or anything of that sort. It is the same thing every day. I like to be challenged therefore this isn't a job that I would like to stay and build a career out of."
good,this was a pretty okay job had to do it for rop in school so it wasnt to bad of a job i had some fun doing it and i would maybe go back at some point u
good,"If you have a second job, this place might be a great place to work; otherwise you would never make enough money to meet your general financial needs. They are very strict with the 4 hours daily rule for all cashier's and stickers. They only offer staff members 3-4 days of work per week. The only solid staff members are their Assistant Managers & Managers who work like dogs for menial pay and basically have no life outside of working for the company."
good,"Your basic retail store except everything in the store is one dollar tax not included. The management varies from chain to chain, and the employees are required to do everything in the store from working the cash register, to storing items on the shelf and so on."
good,"Hard work, decent paycheck. good HR. managers easy to talk to when you have  problem. easy scheduling. pretty good hours. needs a better break system."
good,Dollar Tree a convenient store to shop for your daily needs of life. Easily accessible and great value for your dollar. Convenient hours of operation.
good,"I f you work for dollar tree distribution you have o be able to move fast and take orders from a head set and follow priciest orders, you have to be able to use a pallet jack and be able to life over 50 pounds"
good,"A typical day at this work is in some how stressful, this is because you have to interact with customers that sometime they are not friendly. They can be rude at you and you can not do anything about it. That can be the hardest part of this job. In this job you can learn how to operated a cashier and in somehow how to give and revise change."
good,"Not the best job Ive ever had. Coworkers were friendly and managers were kind, but hours were inconsistent. I was trained as a cashier and stocker and stocked overnight until Christmas, after that my hours went from 20-30 a week to 10 shifts in 3 weeks."
good,If you're going to work nights you would go in at 3 in the morning and work for 4 hours shift you would throw to you both you are required to have at least 80 boxes done for night you can work in the morning or cashier you'll get more hours being a cashier as well
good,"dollar tree is an alright place to work, if you want to work there and you just need a job then i say go for it. you should work here, it is a very fast pace working environment."
good,Had alot to do for little pay. we had to restock shelves run the cash register and clean.. sometimes we had to stay over night to stock shelves around the holidays because it got so busy
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree because I was able to have a flexible schedule and I was able to utilize my customer service skills and develop new skills.
good,Although this is a low experience job you are required to completed numerous tasks at minimum pay. I did gain job experience in good costumer service due to the amazing management. Employees arent aloud to be full time. Not even managers. Dollar tree only has benefits for full time but thats hard to achieve when managers will get in trouble if any employee gets close to 40 hours. The company is cheap in how the pay their team.
good,The pay is low. Lovely items in the store you didn't get employee discount. The manager is very nice. The work is not hard. You're allowed to put things back if you see something you want while you are stopping so that is an advantage.
good,didnt get paid enough for the amount of work. the hours at time can be a little crazy. it was an alright experience. i would not do it again. i did lean from it.
good,"very fast paced environment, must be very good at multi-tasking, stocking has to be finished within your allotted shift time, as well as taking care of customers at the register. recovery must be done to the fullest."
good,"Dollar Tree in San Leandro was so much fun! I was excited to go to work but once I relocated to Rohnert Park everything changed. The managers were rude and expected you as a cashier to do everything, which is impossible when you are the only cashier."
good,"stressful place to work. Pay is not competitive, Mgmtt keeps changing, i enjoy the people i work with. not enough staff. Good for people wanting a 2nd income"
good,"At the Dollar tree warehouse, you had to meet production demands at all times. If you're rates dropped too low, you were given warning and potentially let go. you got all your work hours in during peak season, but outside of that sometimes you would only work 4-5 hours before given the choice to leave. You could stay the full shift, but the rremainder of your time was spent doing odd jobs throughout the warehouse."
good,The logan store had poor management when i was working there. They were way too lax and often very rude. Hopefully they have cleaned it up and the managers are treating their employees well.
good,"Everyday was a fun day, I learnt so much the management was good, everything was easy for me. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers, I love it"
good,"A typical day was working at the cashier register and restocking shelves and cleaning up the asile.  Overall it was very relaxed, however when it got busy, people would get angry and became stressful."
good,Dollar tree was a good place to work. It wasn't to hard i actually had fun working there. The pay was only 7.35 i think and i worked only 4 hlurs. That wasn't enough for mr to pay rent or bills.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree was slow and easy. I learned a lot working there like customer service and stocking. The management there was okay, they wasn't hard on the employees or anything like that. The hardest part of the job was when I had to stock the items and didn't know where half of the items went."
good,It was great the first month or so until my managers were rude about my mental health. Wasn't the best work environment if you have any mental health issues
good,"This is a high velocity fast paced retail employment. Excellent for those just entering the work force or looking for part time. Typical day will consist of moving large volumes of customer and merchandise thru check out lines. You will learn to not let the opinions and thoughts of other bother you "" Customer is always right"""
good,Working at Dollar Tree is a good job to get you by but not so good to work there for a long time since you can't really survive on what they pay. Cashier position is quick paced but fun and interactive the managers are some of the best that i had the pleasure of working with.
good,"Worked on the cashier almost every day, rarely stocked. Fast paced during christmas hours, slower during off season. Must be quick on the cashier and on your feet."
good,"I was on the way to being a manager but had to move, I loved it there, it was very fast paced and I got very close with customers. was very sad to have to move on from it."
good,Very slow paced work environment. A lot of drama in the store but it is a friendly environment. Everyone knows everyone so its like being around family
good,"Image result for description of a dietary aide"
good,My time there was short lived because I could not balance my job here which was overnight and school which was early classes so had to leave but the little time I spent there was cool I never had any problems with management or anyone else
good,"The dollar tree lacked in a lot of areas from hours, pay, employees, management, and so on,. It could have been a better job had there been more benefits to working there. the job is good for a student who is looking for part time work in between school."
good,"Nothing challenging-every day is about the same, which makes it incredibly redundant after a bit. The bright side is their is very little stress and every aspect of the business is easy and straight forward."
good,"Started here as my first job, id say I was happy to start here. Environment was cool, manager was understanding, employees were approachable, and hours were nice."
good,Assistant manager role includes everything from stocking to store lockup to janitorial duties. Usually at a store there are not too many employees so this leaves room for a family-like environment. Great job to have while in school or to get management experience
good,With this job it is slow paced and relaxed. There were busy days but not many. The pay is minimum wage. If you were part time you didn't get too many hours.
good,i will not go back working for them bad managers i will not recommend but then again u all could i had problem dosent mean ya cant apply or work for them
good,It's a very clean and organized store and the people are friendly. It's a nice job and a great part-time job but does not pay the bills and help to get by with life.
good,"A day at work was fun you get to meet and help new people, work in the different areas of the store and still have manager to help you with store projects."
good,"I enjoy working at Dollar Tree, great environment to be in. I love the atmosphere of the store and people. I've been a part-time manager since 2017 and I really enjoy gaining the experience of learning the qualities about being a manager. I really think it'll help me with trying to manage my own store or Dollar Tree one day."
good,Great place to work only if you fully staffed .401k is great an pro an sick time.Set  salary is 45 hours but you always work over 55 to 60 hour week .So unfair
good,"Semi good job for some to pay some bills, really. Sometimes it was slow and sometimes it was fast. It depended on the days and the months. But sometimes, you'd get those rowdy customers who like to argue with you, yet you still have to 'kill them with kindness' because that's all you could really do."
good,"Its a job, not a career. It pays the bills. Your body will ache, your managers will annoy you but you get decent pay and it's permanent. What else do you need in a job anyway?"
good,"This job was a fair job, a lot of work and not enough pay, or hours to complete the work. Some of the management is OK. I did gain a lot of experience with company."
good,I only worked there during holiday season. It was easy work. Working cash register was easy everything was same price. I was learning some of the management roles.
good,"I loved working there, got to meet new people every day. Great bosses and I had some regular customers that knew me by name. I would work there again ."
good,I learned how to stock and work on the cash register. A typical day at work would be describe as customers coming in and speaking to them in a friendly manner and assist them if they need help. Also make sure that the store is clean. The hardest part of this job is communication with the co workers and management. The easiest part of this job was working on the cash register.
good,"Some days are better than others, but the goal is to service the customer with a smile and to work together as a team to achieve these goals and the target we are suppose to meet"
good,They worked with you when it came to the scheduling. Was not to much over bearing work load. I was offered to advance within the company. There was to much gossiping there for me though.
good,"I like to work with people , and give them the best I have to offer. Management is there to do a job and I didn't have a problem with the completion of a task at hand. The environment was over all good, the work in general was steady. If there happen to be a moment for downtime I would find something to do that would utilize my work time."
good,"They expect you to stock shelves, help customers, unload trucks, fill coolers and clean during different shifts.  They expect you to do things regardless if your hurt or sick and only pay minimum wage at part-time hours."
good,Company is constantly changing and improving. New products every week. The company is growing almost monthly. Its exciting to see the new things that are available.
good,"It  offers you everyday with a new challenge, need to be really quick with work and patient with customers. My only concern was that after such hard work you get no benefits or paid vacation."
good,"On a typical day I would ring up customers as they came through my line, help customers find things, and on truck days I helped unload the truck and stock the shelves."
good,The environment is very fast paced and can be stressful at times. It is definitely not a bad company to work for and if sales goals are met the bonuses are very good.
good,When I started working at Dollar Tree they were in the process of finding an new DM. Had complications working registers. Employees were stealiing. Customers were smoking weed in the store.
good,The job offers a great salary for your experience but demands a lot of your time making it a little harder to enjoy your family life. I've learned that to be a Great manager your have to build a Great team. It definitely takes a lot but is all worth it
good,"I worked there during the Christmas season.  It was very busy so I stayed busy and the time went by fast. "
good,"I worked for this company for about 3 years. While I was working here I was working on my Bsc Degree as well so I worked part time. I expected to get part time hours, however every week I was given extra hours to work which I can't complain about. I have no complete and accurate review for my immediate managers because corporate recycles their employees, especially management every few months so I don't think this is a good place for job security. "
good,"The store manager and coworkers really make or break this job. If you can keep an open line of communication with your store manager, this is an incredible first or temporary position! Honestly, the only down side to this company is the pay. Even management cannot support themselves on Dollar Tree's rate of pay."
good,Great customer service skills! I was always busy and respectful and also the employees and managers there! Everything was well managed and organized nearly.
good,Dollar tree is a great job for older people or for college students. It isn't a job I would suggest you want to work long term unless you plan on being in management.
good,I really liked this job and working with people . I think the only down fall for this job was the pay. I liked the high paced atmosphere of the place. It was hard making a living on that kind of pay.
good,It is an excellent customer service and sales position as far as getting experience to better yourself for the next step in your career.  Promotions are available if corporate deems applicable.  Pay scale is minimum wage unless you are in management..  It is a great place to work as a supplemental income source.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree but, there were no benefits and not enough hours. We worked very hard but, had to deal with a lot of theft and homeless people."
good,It is a good to work if you want pocket change but for a career no. As far as a place that is friendly and helpful for people it has it's ups and downs.
good,Friendly employees. I loved how they actually cared about you and your well being. The atmosphere was very welcoming and warm and the employees were very helpful
good,"Flexible hours, friendly environment  management was always great about me picking up extra shifts on my day off. Holiday season is very busy so the teamwork was appreciated"
good,"I enjoyed  my time at Dollar Tree not enough help made it hard to get all work done. I would like to have more pay $10.25 hour is very low. there was lots of work to get done, you would have to choose what was most important clean or put fright out. When I had enough workers it make things better."
good,"Good place to work, friendly staff, friendlier customers. the store stayed nice and clean compared to the confederation location. All in all a good experience"
good,"Once again, a hundred and fifty characters for a review I don't even want to write. So, I guess I can write about this again. My day is going great, how is your day going?"
good,Dollar tree was a great place to work it allowed me become a better manager it help flow and develop my over all people skills I was able to le learn more about  merchandising
good,"Wish the management would treat their employees better and with more respect. Too much drama also, always was a headache to work with some of my coworkers."
good,"Dollar Tree is a good company,if you are someone who does not focus on the customer experience. The focus is to get all the merchandise out and not give great customer service"
good,"-You normally stay at the cash register from the time you get there till the time leave if your not stocking"
good,Poor management  the need to have someone who have decent people skills.  They will try to railroad you into doing something that does not for tour building
good,its long hard hours and you don't get paid what you should for work. the bosses are ok but no real structure in the workplace. management isn't really involved with the workers.
good,somedays went by fast some slow.i dont think i really learned much other than getting good with a money till. i liked how the manager was always on top of things. the hardest part for me was the shopping carts i hated bringing them and putting back in place. the best part though was at the end of the day.
good,"the staff is very nice and helpful. customers are sometimes ""challenging"" just because...they can .  "
good,"Responsible for taking money in the form of cash, check, or credit card from patrons in exchange for food or services. Scans items, provides change, balances drawer, and processes card transactions."
good,They manger wanted you to get he customers in and out as fast as possible. There was never anything to get to know the customer and be friendly with them.
good,This job was fast paced and rewarding. I met many different people and customers. There was a lot of attempted theft but the employees were on top of the customers. We watched very carefully for those who were acting suspicious.
good,"You are hired on as a cashier and help with stocking, , unloading the trucks, cleaning, and, of course, the cash register. My particular manager was an excellent person and manager. The workplace culture is one of hard work but fun people. The hardest part of the job was having a long line of customers and not being able to be fast enough. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers and the customers."
good,I enjoyed all the people. I learned a lot about what people do listening  to them talking as they went through my line.It moves really fast and I couldn't stand for five hours straight.
good,"it was a ok job not much to do a lot of standing around with some stocking, not a bad job if you want to more up in to Management fast and friendly people"
good,working a dollar tree I was truck loader . it was easy to stay out the way and keep everything up to stock . the hard part was when you have to go back fix what has not been stocked
good,a typical day was cleaning and running the cash register. stocking shelves and moving things around. the management was always helpful and the co workers were nice and helpful as well
good,"They say do what you love and love what you do and I personally didn't like working for the Dollar Tree. It was slow and boring. The people I worked with were kind and helpful, management was fair. I did however learn patience and how to tolerate customers. There were no hard parts about working there, I mostly enjoyed meeting new people."
good,It’s a nice job to have. But for $7.25 vs the work we have to do and under certain conditions wouldn’t be worth working for $7.25 a hour & get shorted.
good,"Through working at dollar store i was able to gain skills on stocking, communication between customers and co-workers, team work, accounting, cashiering, recording daily transactions, inventory and sorting out damages on daily bases."
good,"I had no problem working here. I enjoyed my time here it was a good experience, It helped my career I received knowledge and I have a better understanding"
good,"relaxed  easy going environment , a lot of product to push to sales floor. poor communication skills. and low pay. co-workers are great , management not so great."
good,it's a decent job to start with. my location was near a walmart so we had a steady flow of people and a steady amount of money. I would not offer this to others looking for a steady income though.
good,didn't like the location hated the hours only working 2 to 3 days a week not getting no type of hours and that sucked they should favoritism to different people and that's not right
good,"it's a great place to work, besides standing up for 5 hours. The people that worked there sometimes smoked so you would smell the smoke on them. They were nice people though."
good,"It is a great place to begin in the working field."
good,"it was a slow paced job. it was easy but not something i would recommend i was payed decently but it was part time and not Enough to live off of, but i was in school so it worked"
good,Very face paced environment. Was stressful at times due to lack of help. Management changes all time so you try to get along with the particular managers way of doing things but it was a little inconsistent.
good,a typical day at work involve balancing efficiency with effectiveness. what i learned is how to take out change quickly and effectively. the managemen was friendly.
good,"Small store location, polite coworkers, and sturdy hours. Employees were curdious and worked well as a team. Management was well trained and easy to learn from."
good,"i really enjoyed this job and the position I had. being assistant store manager was well worth it. It does take you some time to get up to management but so does any other job, if i could go back i would."
good,"I learned a lot with Dollar Tree being my first job, It is just time to move on. A typical day at work could be stressful depending on the customers, how many boxes need to be thrown. But it could also not be stressful depending on who is working and what is to be accomplished. I would say overall everyone works together and it is not stressful. The hardest part of the job would definitely being a stocker and unloading truck early in the morning. The more enjoyable part of the job is being cashier and helping customers through their day efficiently."
good,"Fast paced, employees have a great attitude, Fun working environment, high expectations, high turn over, lower wage for management. able to deal with multiple types of pepole"
good,Mostly doing cashier with little help stocking merchandise when no customers in line. The hardest part of the shift is when the manager went on break and it got busy. The enjoyable part was going to work seeing your regulars and making them have a comfortable shopping experience.
good,The job is kind of boring and you don't get paid much. You have to be there for at least a year before they consider you for another position in the company.
good,When I started there 5 years ago it was a great place to work.  I was given the freedom to properly adapt the business to the specific location and customers I was servicing.  Recently Dollar Tree acquired Family Dollar and it is my belief that they are trying to make back the money spent on the acquisition in entirely the wrong ways.  They have begun to micromanage all payroll dollars to the point where all of the store are severely understaffed.  This provides undue stress on the Store Team and poor Customer Service
good,"•	Cashier, stock, Sales Associate, and customer service attendant "
good,it was a great place to work for you get to meet a lot of new people and it really helps with your communication skills I really didn't have any problems with the company
good,"Friendly workplace, management is great. Fun to work. The pay isn't the best and you do not get any benefits. This job is enough for someone who is in highschool."
good,Cashier and stocking were a daily job we were a busy store and some of the mangers    were team players while others were not  it made things stressful
good,I enjoyed my position. I needed to have benefits at the time and that wasn't an option. The hours were very limited and I have a family that I need to make sure I can support
good,"They pay well and there's usually a lot of opportunities to pick up someone else's shift, so more money.  Some managers were really good, while others were just ok."
good,"The manager that I was under did not seem to know how to stock and recover the store, or pick up after her self. It can be a fun job, even with all the stocking and customer service that has to be done. with the right people."
good,"really slow at times, not enough employees, had to do a lot everything in the store, culture was great and the most enjoyable is when it was the holidays it was busy."
good,"I was working there for a short time because I wasn't on the schedule at the time when I was working there. They told me to call before showing up there, then they finally said that they put me on the schedule after a month of waiting. They got a new manager that I don't know about. He let me go after he can't call me to tell me to report up there after a change of management."
good,"short work days, fast pace, entry level cashiering. Multitasking includes: ringing each item, tendering payments, stocking impulse isles, greeting customers upon entrance with a warm welcome smile."
good,"coworkers are friendly, we work as a team player, everyone got along with each other, good communication, every.one work as a team player. Love the manager there"
good,It's fast paced and easy. It's a lot of part-time work. If you are looking to make money there's only two positions that's open full-time. Store mangers and the operational manger are the only full-time position; which are rarely open.
good,"Wish there were more days to work and longer shifts available. Faster advancing opportunities and better pay compared to who does work better, faster and more efficiently."
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning up after the store, greeting customers, and providing customer service. The hardest part is dealing with the rude customers but the most enjoyable part of it is how easy it is. Management could use some help when it comes to communication."
good,"	Assisted customers with purchases and inquiries"
good,"Overall working at Dollar Tree was ok if you're fresh out of high school, no kids or a part time job if you have a full time job. It's productive and relaxing and there was always something you could be doing."
good,I work there for many years but thing keep change rule and manager too so it was very different went I start to work on to I left them even the holidays  change there went money hungry to work ever holiday
good,"Typical day at work was stressful, customers very rude I learned how to work on the registers. Hardest part of the job unloading the truck. Most enjoyable part of my job was unloading floats."
good,"Very friendly , very concern about the customers and every person that walks through the door and shops , willing to work with you if you just let them know ahead time ."
good,"Managed employees to assure they would pick and label correct orders that would be laid on the conveyor belt,scheduled employees,complete employees payroll weekly,maintain a clean and safe work environment."
good,The experience gave me the skills and trade to becoming familiar with different types of perspective and also importance of following instruction and learning the basics.
good,Basic cashiering job. would do some light stocking during down time when it was slow. Most of the time I would be trying to check people out as quickly and efficiently as possible.
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility,as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals.Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well,including filing greeting customers.I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,"On the register when not stocking or doing recovery. Under staffed, so at times things can be very stressful. One of the managers is not very personable."
good,"I've learned some things working there. It gets really busy, so you need a lot of energy for the work and for the customers. Overall it is a good store a lot of people love it."
good,I loved my job. But there was some issues when I worked there. They fixed them when I left. There are amazing people there .great people and job opportunities
good,I have been there for over 6 years and have had some good experiences and bad experiences. Overall I have enjoyed working there. My manager and the people I have worked with are truly awesome. The main downfall with this company is the pay.
good,"This company has become the stepping stone to what I was capable of overcoming.  Such a typical day at work is reviewing budgets, profits, and inventory sales, the work culture was definitely an opportunity to see."
good,Typical retail position. Has a lot of turnover with cashiers as do most retail positions. under paid for the management position I was doing. Had a lot of scheduling problems but for the most part okay job.
good,Its an ok place to work. Just alot of over time. Its a very fast paced job. The only thing I did not like was having to go outside in the cold to get carts.
good,"It was a retail job, it was a life saver seeing how I didn't have a job at the time. It was nothing complicated with this job.  It was really easy and I could get bored very easy which is why I kept bust."
good,Cashier position involved handling cash and selling weekly items to customers. Also have to make sure the shelves were stocked and organized. Cash handling.
good,Enjoyed the frantic pace. The turnover was the toughest to deal with. The productivity became hard to manage on a daily. For the most part finding good people to work for a low wage was difficult.
good,Good place to work it's an easy job the hours are short there really isn't much to learn. Everything is a dollar and all you do is scan each item over the scanner you put stuff back on shelves where it belongs not much to it
good,"hard working"
good,Stocked very detailed inventory for store. Hiring for need of store. Cash handle drawers and deposit on daily basis. Loss prevention for thieves that stole items.
good,I only had 4 hour days but I did like my job all the kids coming in and out getting balloons people being amazed at the prices they were paying plus the money they were saving. Very family oriented
good,Cashier duties included where taking products and scanning each item as required. I was also responsible for accurate and balanced register at the end of my shift
good,this was a very repetitive job but was not hard or boring i could work and go to school and made a fair amount of money from working their. if i had to pick a first job again i would go to dollar tree.
good,"My manager works with me and I get the most hours out of every cashier there because I am a single mother. The hours are mainly the same for me Monday thru Friday and I get mostly the weekends off because I work a set schedule during the week. The only downfall of this job is there is no stocking hours available so cashiers have to stock freight in between the customers and after a while, it gets old. Depending how busy a typical day is, not all the freight that is scheduled to get done by one cashier gets completed. There is always normally just one cashier and one manager per shift during low volume stores. Higher volume stores provide 2 to 3 cashiers, a few stockers, and some managers."
good,The dollar tree I worked at was in a location that consistently received a lot of heavy traffic. The store was always busy so there was something to do.
good,good as a part time job not much more the people i worked with i could have not asked for better.Always there to back you up team always came first very nice
good,"a typical day at dollar tree consists of packing out 30 to 35 boxes an hour 150 to 170 per day, you really get to learn what team work is really all about, management could better but overall fair, hardest part sometimes mainly was the multitasking 2 things at onetime but honestly i actually enjoyed working there."
good,at first i enjoyed the job then i got sick and  everything changed i ws to stressed and felt like it took a tow on my body i tried to like it but it wastn for me
good,You are busy all day but you don't have that rushed busy feeling just a relaxed busy. You get to see different mercindice every day. You meet really nice people too.
good,It was a very fast paced environment.Taught me how to multi task.Always has work to do.You will encounter many different types of people while working there.
good,"A good place to work if you want to deal with people that don't put in orders correctly, expect you to work for a low wage and don't have people running registers."
good,Its ok but very stressful at times. Fast paced at times. 10 min breaks and only work 4 1/2 hers a day. I work 3 days a week. Nice managers and go workers.  Handling money and register easy. They could write you up if over a little and under a little
good,"Job was stressful. It felt like you were being over worked in the trailers. The trailers were very dirty, dusty, and hard to breath in.You were asked to work more then you can handle everyday."
good,"the best part of working there for me was helping the senior with the thing they could not find or reach"
good,This is a first time job for high school students or someone who is looking to have work experience. If you like stocking shelves and interacting with customers this is a good first time job.
good,"It was a fun enviroment to work in but just didnt pay enough money or have an benefits. Could have gotten more hours during the week. Did not offer retirement, 401 k or vacation or insurance through this job."
good,"If you are just starting out working, someone young, this is a good job for you. overnight stocking with maybe 2 other employees . You can stock and listen to your music"
good,"i go in at 12 am stock the shelves organize the ails. i have learned the cleaner they are the better place it is to work . management is dependable when it comes to everything,work place culture is every diverse."
good,"Nothing nice to say about management at the time of my employment then,  I did like the job and hours! Clean store but way to much product for the amount of space. In the past year, management has changed and emproved immensely!"
good,"Limited mobility, as there are only two possible promotions you can get. You can move from store associate to assistant manger, and then assistant manger to store manager. Only problem is, those promotions can all take place within 12-18 months, and then you are stuck with very little else you can do for the remainder of your career. Wages are also far too stagnant."
good,Nice company to work for as a teenager. Sometimes I had to work long work days especially during the holiday seasons. Everyone was respectful & hatdworker in the work area.
good,"I love working at the Dollar Tree, but they do not guarantee enough hours. I want to get out of retail and start somewhere I can build a   career with."
good,"Dollar tree was fast paced, very nice managers, busy environment, different things to do, lots of people to talk to, multi task clean stores, super discounts,"
good,Good company overall.. All store staff is part time other than management.  Turnover is high due to lack of hours for staff  company does not want over 15 per week for employee.   Hard to keep good staff paying under 100
good,great part time job working retail is pretty cool the best part of the da was when the store first open it always a line of happy people ready to shop the great deals at the dollar tree
good,Overall very fast pace. This job required a lot of lifting and visual plan-o-graming. There was no advancement of pay increase. A lot of standing and bending.
good,"I worked hard for my paycheck.  Above and beyond what I was hired for.  I was hired as a cashier and on top of that I helped unload the truck, stocked shelves, checked my register out and made sure the monies balanced,"
good,it wasn't too busy but on the holidays it was a hot mess.... Some days it took until 11pm to get out of there because of everything that had to be cleaned up.
good,"I have been working at dollar tree for 2 years. I wouldn't have started there if it wasn't for family dollar closing in my home town. The freight that they bring in compared to the hours that they give for you to get the freight out is sometimes impossible. Now I have worked at two locations. In Hugo, Oklahoma, it was a lot easier. The work environment was a lot better than the location that I transferred to in Oklahoma City, but I moved to the area for a change. I love my job and I like the challenge at times, but I am ready for a change."
good,"I honestly love my job at Dollar Tree, I just cannot pay my bills with  such low pay. Management is the best balance of leadership and teamwork I have ever been a part of.  I have learned a lot from this job and what I have learned is priceless, so I do not regret working here at all."
good,"Unless you enjoy working in stressful places, I would not recommend working here. management is so bad, and does not help if youre behind at all. The pay was decent."
good,"At dollar tree the time flew by. We I loved creating end caps, I found it very challenging and loved the completed projects. I strived to be the manager my employees wanted to work for and have a store my customers enjoyed shopping at."
good,It's very stressful working here but if your an adrenaline junkie who likes the rush this is perfect for you. Customers and staff are rude and there is no chance of promotions.
good,"This is a good place to work if you need a second job, or some extra cash. It's really slow paced and they have a pretty nice work enviroment. It's a good part time fifteen hour a week job."
good,Unless you can become a manager you don't make any real money and you will rarely get more than twenty hours to work in the week. However it is a decent place to work if you only want a little part time job. I would recommend it for students.
good,"During the time I worked for Dollar Tree, I learned that if you're not happy, no one is happy, especially the manager on duty. Hours are part time if you're not a manager, and there's really no benefits to working for them."
good,"Dollar tree expects a lot to be done with no time and barely any pay. In order to get everything done your forced to work off the clock, How ever it made me into the fast pace and adaptable worker I am today."
good,"I feel like I did more work than my other works. Typically busy when I came into work. I experience different types of people. Dealt with different money transactions. Easiest part of job was closing the store, making sure everything was clean up for the next day."
good,I like it there just some times over whelming if you don't know how to deal with some people but other wise not too bad if you need extra income so in all its fine
good,"Morning shift would drop off deposit at bank. Then head back to store to open it. Helped manager with displays,stocked small refrigerator in front end of store by register. Then open register and count money for the day. Open store and help people find products and help check them out. I learned to use the register while having great customer service. The hardest part of the job was stocking shelves. The best part was helping customers."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree is fun. Although, the pay is minimum wage, I feel as if we do way too much to only make $7.25 per hour. Other than that, everything is awesome."
good,"I loved working at Dollar Tree because of my manager. We didn't get along to great in the beginning but became great friends when we did. She promoted me and I became her right hand man. I did everything and anything for her. A typical day was good as long as you had the proper staff. The culture was awesome. The hardest part was dealing with call offs and trying to fill people in. The best part about Dollar Tree was the people, customers and employees. The problem was sometimes our boss would try to force people to work off the clock and it became a lot to handle."
good,"go to work, meet and help people, nothing too big, nothing too small, some of the customers are nice, others suck. co-workers are pretty cool, and management helps whenever they can"
good,It's pretty easy for the most part. With everything being a dollar people don't usually buy just one thing. It gets the busiest around 5 and right before you close.
good,"A typical day of work I come in and clock in and go to the stock room and get merchandise then being to stock them where it belongs."
good,To me it was ok job. There are no benefit. It is ok if you want to have a cashier experience then you can apply at dollar tree. But it will be better to apply for the company in case you will get a better job.
good,Very quick-paced workplace. Management really does not care about you. On your own. Not given many chances to advance in the company so if you are okay with being complacent this is the place for you.
good,Cashier and sale associate . help customers on items they were looking for.  Count register before opening and after closing the store. I would be a stocker some times in the early morning.
good,I had a little trouble figuring out the closing routine at first but the managers were really helpful. I was sick a lot of my career there and the manager was very understanding. Little did we know that I was pregnant =)
good,"This job is a very fast working job, you do a lot of things ad get to learn how to manage our attitude with the different customers. This job can work well with he hours you want but it varies."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and enjoyable. Management was very knowledgeable and helpful. The workplace culture is team work makes the dream work.
good,It's a job good people to work with good customers most of the time just really wish I could get this application done I'm just trying to get another job and it seems like you got to do a bunch of stuff for no apparent reason so now that it's done I'm going to be going submitting this
good,It began at 5. Every morning. No breaks. Managers was always feuding instead of running the store properly. Not enough employees to work the shifts thats available.
good,"This can be a fun place to work. There is always something to do, never a dull moment. You can learn a lot of different skills while working here. Flexible hours."
good,It gave you the chance to possibly stretch your imagination for doing some of the displays but never got any praise for the job well done. Because they were about having you work long hours it is not about the money they pay the staff it about the money the company makes from repeat customers that is the most concern.
good,The store was really fast pace and i normally restocked so we didn't run out of things all day. We was under staffed. The hardest part was probably dealing with the really rude customers but that is any where you work.
good,"se necesita mas personas de managers que tengan profesionalismo y etica, asi mismo un mejor salario y un ambiente laboral mas entretenido."
good,I learned allot about stocking and organization while working for this company. Great place to start in retail. Willing and able to work with students schedules.
good,"Dollar Tree is a fast paced store with lots of great employees and very caring managers. I love working with customers by answering any questions they have, showing them where we keep products they are looking for, and helping them with any purchases they have."
good,At The Time Was Hired For Temp Work Store Was A Mess Management Was Changing But We Came In & Stocked Those Shelves & Did What We Were Supposed To Until They Didn't Need Us Anymore Probably A lot Better To Work For Now
good,"Company needs improvement in management, safety training, better equipment training, more general supervision and maintenance. However, It is nice that they have a monthly ""Grass Roots"" meeting for all shifts, that provides employee production updates, recognition awards and raffles."
good,"It was a productive work environment. The other employees were enjoyable to work with. The management were approachable and easy-going. It was monotonous work, but it was consistent. The pay was not that great."
good,"Many advancement opportunities. Pay is fair based on current economy. Hours can be crazy come holiday season, however, when working in retail, hours are always crazy that time of year regardless what company you are working for."
good,Daily task consist of getting products out for sale and having a plan in place for associates to ensure that their job is done in a timely manner.  I go behind them to ensure that the goal I have set in place are executed.  The most enjoyable thing about working at Dollar Tree is that the associates their are awesome and friendly.
good,A typical day a work is basically stocking  and making sure everything in inventory is correct and also giving the customers the best services as possible
good,I was not at Dollar Tree for any serious length of time. I was there for one day to help set up a new store. It took several hours and was hot and uncomfortable and they paid me with a credit card that had money on it.
good,I loved working at dollar tree. Always busy. The pay rate is not good. You don't get raised for yourself and the work u do. U get a 5 can't raise every year. There's no benifets there tho.
good,"my experience at dollar tree was good for my first job I liked it and environment was fun and busy. although my position was a cashier over seasonal ( Christmas time ) it was never ending lines with plenty rude people, applicants she be aware that they will deal with rude and nasty personalities and have to always keep a good attitude with everyone."
good,A typical workday consisted of coming in and replacing back stock and collecting carts. I learned how to face product. I rarely saw management around the store. The workplace culture was very fast paced and high strung. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck on Thursdays but doing it as a team made it easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know regular customers.
good,I enjoy learning new things and working with great people. you have to be willing to put in time and effort. but over all it was a great place to work.
good,Good place to work for people are fun to work for very fast paced and you get to meet alot of people I would recommend people to work there u get paid every two weeks
good,"It's a okay place to work, great people. Pay is okay I guess. Good Student job, not a great paying job but great a place to meet good people. Always, stays busy.. Which is a good thing."
good,Usually slow days working at the Dollar Tree. Dealing with customer complaints daily and having a very messy store to clean at the end of the day almost 100% guaranteed.
good,I love working with people & making sure my job gets done right & I like to make sure my area is clean & I like to make sure that the customers are happy with me & the store...they should give more hours instead of hiring more people... Because I can use the hours..
good,"This was a job where we often had to learn as we go along and it was hard being a cashier the first time because it is a bit unsettling having people get impatient when you are learning the ropes however some were understanding so that was a help. "
good,"Okay job that will hold you over until you find another. "
good,Typical days at these workplaces was not good at all the management is horrible and they fired and lay off way too much my most hardest times about these jobs was just going there period
good,Very busy job which is great makes time fly. Between stocking casherin and gelping customers and cleaning you never get a minute to relax. Definetly a job for a person with lots of energy. Pay was pretty good for a asstiant manager and bonuses was great
good,This is a very great job. The store needs some adjustments.  Overall this is a great opportunity for anyone looking for a part time job or for a second job.
good,"Nothing too exciting happened here. Most days were quiet and easily completed. Customers do become impatient if you cannot ring them out quick enough, and cashiers are not provided chairs as they are in other companies."
good,"good job. Depends on who you work for because I have heard complaints from other dollar trees, but I loved my boss and co-workers. dskl;jfklsjgsdfg'l;k'"
good,"Boss and staff are great."
good,"The environment is bubbly, and everyone is focused and on task with the minute negative managers; but, overall the spectrum of the workplace is one that I would recommend."
good,Dollar tree is a cool company to work at all of  my co-workers are super  fun and nice I just would like a job that pays more and giver me better hours.
good,"Relaxed work environment, but speedy productivity still a requirement. I learned how to balance speedy truck unloading with location of where merchandise goes. The management is average but carries a great attitude and does not downsize employees. The culture of the workplace here involves respect towards customers and others but an even bigger focus on the task at hand. There is no hard part about the job with the exception of getting all merchandise stocked on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with other employees"
good,I liked thw people at the store i worked at. The company wasent very good. Everyone was paid the same no matter the work you did unless yoh were managment. I was there 2 years and was not offered chances to further myself in the company. And hours were cut frequently.
good,"Recommends"
good,"It was a quick paced & stressful environment, yet the coworkers were helpful and supportive and the customers were very friendly . I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,You never have to do a price check.  Everything's a dollar.  The shift goes by quick.  It's always busy and stock always needs to be put out. Lots of nice customers.  Good place to work.
good,"The hardest part of the job was having to constantly clean up after customers would come into the store and mess up the products, floor etc.  Manager was not professional."
good,Dollar tree is a good first job to start out with hours are part time so you always have time for other stuff they try to work with you on your hours great first job
good,Walking around to help people out. Checking people out with all there ideas to make sure everything was great. Getting boxes out to get stuff on the shelf
good,"As a cashier I greet customers, very organized, and gives good hours. make sure things are organized and in place, good breaks. extremely nice people."
good,Standing for a long period of rime.  Have to be able to count money.  Scan items.  Bagged items. Handled cards an cash. Dollare tree was a cool experience although I worked there when I was pregnant.
good,"It is a good working area and great to meet new people,and very great place to work for a peoples person. I'm a stocker and cashier its not too hard but can get overwhelming at times."
good,"Open/close procedures. Relay daily sales expectations to team. Stock and maintain shelves. Demonstrated hardworking, positive, fun work. Handled customer concerns. Relay store activity, sales and other important information to store and district managers. Least favorite thing about working at Dollar Tree was major lack of communication between management/employees. Best part about working at Dollar Tree was working with and helping customers."
good,its a job if your in need of good income. keeping up with the day to day operation is a different story. over all its just a job to keep your bills in tact.
good,I enjoyed working with the other employees. I liked the fast pace of working there and constant moving when we were unloading the trucks!! I formed friendships with some of the customers as well!!
good,This job is for a part time high school or college student just looking for some extra money on the side because they are too busy with schoolwork to get a full time job.
good,"Get product out of back room."
good,Working at dollar tree I did a lot of work stocking and rebuilding a new store more of a summer job to keep busy have great employees nd manager but not much of a career job
good,"It was ok working at this one Dollar tree, I stayed busy do to i was a cashier and stocked shelves and I got along with most of the customers but as for the  Assistant manager we didnt get along but I insisted to make it work until I found another job."
good,This company s overall good. Just needs to pay their employees better. This job is not for an adult or anyone will children or bills. This is a great summer job.
good,Working for dollar tree was tough. I had alot of responsibilities and worked hard to get the job done but no matter how hard someone works its never good enough. The customers make it worth working there and helping them find what they need and their positive attitudes helped put everyone in a good mood.
good,"Very dull place to work. Simple, boring, depressing workplace. Compensation is not very great, time spent working is very uneventful, and staff is not very friendly."
good,Worked with nice managers. I wish I was given more hours because I couldn't afford to go to work for 5 hrs a week. It cost me more to make it to from what I was making a week.
good,"At this time I was trying to take on a 2nd job, I was hired I did great with customers an checking out an other tasks they had me do. Not being there long at all manager said she had to let me go because she needed someone dependable as far as taking money to the bank. An I did not fit that requirement, ridding my bike to work."
good,It was a good place to work. I enjoyed it as a teenager but I do not think I would as an adult. If you're going to school this is a good place to work because they will work around your schedules.
good,"Great place to work if you like having three or four different supervisors telling you what to do.  Work was fast paced and deadline driven.  The worst part of the job was being on-call evenings, weekends, and holidays."
good,"I normally stock and recover aisles in the store at a minimum rate of 30 cases per hour and assist with unloading a delivery truck once a week.  I have learned to pay close attention to peoples personality, better management skills and developed a better method for stocking a 30 aisle store.  Almost all of the employees operate as a team player.  It's wonderful being part of a team, but the non team players make the job harder than what it actually is."
good,"I loved working here, and I was really good at the job. The manager is a bit of a grouch, but if you can stay out of his way and keep busy, its a decent place to work"
good,"Hours are limited"
good,"They want so much out of the Store Manager. They talk like they want to make your workplace calm and easy but no matter how hard you work, it is an impossible job for the crew you have. They dont care if you work 15 hours a day, they want the job done when we are only paid for a certain ammount of hours a week. I do appreciate the job opportunity with the company but if they made a few changes to the way they run things, Im sure I would still be working for them."
good,Typically there are 2 cashiers and one manager on duty. It can get veery busy during most holidays. The mornings are slow but the pace picks up around the afternoon. Management is understanding when it comes to needing a specific day off as long as you remind them. The pay is minimum wage.
good,This was a very  long time ago and the staff has completely changed since I was an assistant there. I opened the store during the initial setup and helped to train new employees.
good,"It's fast paced, colleagues are pleasant and always willing to help."
good,Just a standard clerk job that have you stock the shelf. what i learn is a item got a place its belong to. management is okay. dollar tree don't really have any hard parts in it job place.
good,I enjoyed meeting the new people that came to the store and also the regular customers. I liked stocking up the products that came to the store because each week it was something new.
good,Its a normal warehouse besides the fact that it is extremely unorganized. The equipment managers have no idea what they are doing. This place is really just my place I work while I find a better position.
good,The work environment was very inviting to new people. While I only worked there a short time I did thoroughly enjoy the experience. It was an interesting one indeed.
good,"Retail isnt meant for everyone."
good,It wasn't the best environment and it was hard to get a day off when i needed it. The pay isn't good and it's not something you can really live on. There are places to work
good,"Great place to work, great customers, hours were flexible.     "
good,"Dollar tree is a very busy store and you can assume why. A typical day consisted of ringing people out, stocking, and cleaning. I liked working at Dollar Tree but when it gets super busy and there's only one person working it gets very frustrating. I learned patience while working at Dollar Tree."
good,"I like it due to flexible scheduling, very busy at times not to much down time, customers  are customers. It located in the central heart of Talladega. The management team is well put together regarding working as a TEAM!  You are working independently, on your on at your allocated time pace.  The only thing is they give you ample work for your work schedule."
good,"Just started working at Dollar Tree. The other employees seem very nice and welcoming, especially the store manager. However, I'm still looking for a better job because Dollar Tree's ray of pay is very low, and they only hired me for 20 hours a week."
good,this place was ok i had one of the worst managers i ever wokred with here so that made it so much harder and worse but they have new management and it looks so much better there
good,Nice relaxed environment great customers great products customers always returned good environment  Great prices loved my job loved the customers n polite environment
good,"Always had alot to do, with little amount of time.  I never had times to take a accurate break or lunch, and hard to get district managing o listen and follow up."
good,"Fun place for a retail job, Long hours, easy register operations. Receiving and stocking were the majority of the work hours. Security and deposit,s were the weakest part of the job."
good,"Really hard to give it all you got, and get nothing in return"
good,Always busy and worked with 4 very nice people whom always cared about you and helped you.  some management difficult to work for had unrealistic goals
good,"The managers at Dollar Tree are great and friendly, however the pay does not equal the stress that follows throughout the entirety of the store. I would recommend this to someone still in High School so they can get an understanding of the work force."
good,loading  and unloading trucks it was a great experience working with motivated people.management was very respectful to all employees.i was very grateful in learning something new.
good,"The main management is very friendly, there's really fast paced days. Organization is vital as well as basic math skills. Communicating with the staff is recommended."
good,"Learning techniques, more computer skills, interacting in helping other employees to achieve goals. Organizational skills, dealing w public., and at times fun"
good,The store has good deals and prices.I believe it can improve but overall is good.I like that everything is a dollar.the snacks are the best in my opinion.
good,I worked here as seasonal help to make some money during Christmas break while in school. While working here I improved my communication and customer service skills.
good,I use to be an opener and closer set up my money for the day and count after every shift. Then there will be days that I would just come in get my bulks and stock on the floor.
good,They have various locations mostly in residential areas. The employees assist you in anyway they can to help you. Very friendly and productive environment.
good,The Job Wasn't Bad At All It Was Simple And Easy. One Thing That I Didn't Like Was The Pay And Sometimes The Other Employee's Wasn't As Friendly. But Other Than That I Enjoyed The Job .
good,Very friendly environment! Employees are very helpful and great when it comes to teamwork. I enjoy how everything gets done with everyone's effort. The manager is stern but has an amazing personality. I've enjoyed the opportunity to work with such an amazing team of people.I've learned so many new things and gained a variety of new qualities that makes me a great candidate for other jobs.
good,Store was well organized and the people were always friendly. Managers were always understanding. The store was well kept. It was a great atsmophere to be in.
good,This is a great starter job. If you work hard they will help you advance. This is a great place for young people starting out in neee of work experience.
good,Fast paced company that has been around for 30+ years and I see that will be around 30+ more.  Your day is never boring or slow.  Dollar Tree has  come along way in the 12 years that I was employed there.  Unfortunately for me as the company was growing it went in a direction that I was not agreeing with.
good,Not much in working at a dollar tree. regular base pay. mild labor involved. wouldn't mind working there again. coworkers were great and made the job a lot more feasible.
good,"Typical day paperwork, stocking, cashiering, Stocking, hunting for produt placement on the floor, there are no modules for product placement. Customers love it."
good,Dollar Tree is a challenging and rewarding environment with new and exciting activities opening up daily.  If you are driven and have a solid work ethic and initiative you will succeed in Dollar Tree.
good,Dollar Tree was a great company to be employed with.  I really loved the hours and the fact that I could do my work with out alot of the hassles that went on with the location.
good,This was a very fun fast paced position. My favorite part of the job was my involvement with the customers. Meeting there needs always made my day. I learned customer satisfaction is very important
good,"Dollar Tree is a very busy place to work. If you're disabled, it's a hit or miss. My first location was not accommodating to people whereas the second location was"
good,"A typical at work ill clock in start working and clock out."
good,i liked the job and the people I work with wish I would have never left there could have gone to store manager but had to leave because of personal issue
good,"a typical day at dollar tree was, coming to work counting my till and getting right on the register and at the middle of my shift getting 10 minute breaks."
good,i had alot of experience here the only complaint is the shortage of hours and the low pay. other than that this was a great place to work for the time being
good,"Overall it's a hit or miss on which store you land in. The store can either be good or bad. It all depends on the store managers decisions. It's good for building relations with other workers. The company promotes from within, but not worth the stress for the salary that is offered compared to other retailers."
good,worked to increase  customer satisfaction and boost long term relationship with shoppers. Created a welcome environment for shoppers by greeting each visitors and keeping  area clean.
good,If you want a career in retail look for something better than Dollar Tree. I learned a lot about customer service and the business of running a store. But the workload on the store managers is a lot. Especially since the company is so stingy with hours. As a store manager you have to do everything from stocking shelves to ringing on the register to doing office work.
good,"Come in and stock, cashier, and work the trucks. Always assist the managers and customers. I learned more patience at this job."
good,"I got hired on to become a District Manager with the company. Starting off I was given a store to run through the Halloween season. I was in charge of all aspects of the store. I managed all employees while maintaining payroll and store standards. I had a team of about 25-30 employees. After completing training I was promoted to District Manager. I worked side by side with my Regional Manager for the first few weeks. Together we visited a little over 15 stores. We oversaw store standards as well as all other functions. Some examples were sales, payroll, cleanliness, proper signage, and store fulfillment. Eventually I was given a Northwest district. On a day to day basis I visited stores to help out in any area possible. This ranged from covering management shifts when needed. Helping the Store Managers was my main priority."
good,"I unloaded trucks when delivered, stocked the shelves and run the register. I liked working there but it didn't give me enough hours and the pay was minimum wage."
good,"The people I work with are wonderful, they are easy to get along with and they all work very hard to show the customers that they care"
good,Sometimes you will be very busy and some other days can be slow. It was hard to try to clean up the store before closing time and watching the cash register. I liked the supervisors just really no chance of moving up to a key holder position
good,"Overall, it was not a complete terrible experience. The workplace culture is a little on the strict side. The job requirement was easy and the co-workers were friendly."
good,I honestly loved dealing with the public doing cashiering. I enjoy the small talk while ringing up customers. it was a relaxing work environment and a pleasure to be in the building the manager was very nice and flexible with work scheduale
good,After ramp up period numbers are critical. Warehouse environment that can be cold or hot at times. Information dissemination is done during weekly meetings and pre shift stand up.Emphasis on stretch and flex during stand up.
good,I worked Dollar Tree as my second job and it was hard being gone all day long. I'm a people's person so it was great dealing with the customers everyday they made my day feel special.
good,I personally disliked this job. it wasn't for me and we all knew it. I went from standing at a cash register with no costumers a day to stocking and throwing away expired foods and cleaning the floor as a job. not good at all.
good,"Great environment, lovely people,benefits,good pay,good customer service ,heath care,friendly people,I love shopping at walmart also ,lot of things too choose from"
good,clock in get drawer and take customers. While waiting for customers you clean around the register. Any work that needs to be done.
good,I liked the store and the company had fair policies but low pay. They gave us enough hours and the store was organized.The company was on the cheap side.
good,"A very productive workplace, keeps you busy for the time being but there aren't a lot of hours. So I need to find a job with better pay and hours so it'll help get me through school."
good,typical work day I would clock in and count down my register I would stock clean front of store and count down my register at end of shift. the hardest thing about the job was trying to keep up with stocking and doing cash register. The work place was a mixture of household and personal items. the enjoyable part of the job was counting my register
good,It is a pretty good place to work if you need a job. It isn't very hard to move up if you do what is asked of you and show up when you should be at work.
good,"Simple and straightforward responsibilities, easy tasks, somewhat laid back environment, more focus of stock replenishment rather than customer service. Difficult to maintain store cleanliness and to keep office organized."
good,"Enjoyed coworkers and part time hours. Minimum wage creates revolving door for employees. If you are solely looking for flexibility, this would be a great place to work."
good,"good for you first job to get some experience they will work you.till you cannot work anymore either stocking, unloading a truck or cashiering. did it all didn't have a place for advancement or pay raises but like I said very good experience for a first time job"
good,"my review of dollar tree depends on the store manager this is where it all starts if there is a professional store manager things always fall into place but when there isn't a simple place to work parttime could be very stressful when the store manager is manipulative, lies and is unfair to the point of cutting people's hours and says there is no hours but hires new people for reason of their own if they don't like you or if you call out sick it's too personal of behavior i've never seen such behavior from a store manager with no skills of professionalism"
good,"Worked here was great. Cashier, customer service. Helped everyone. Made Friends and cleaned shelves. Work was manageable. Hours were decent and the boss was nice."
good,My day starts with counting my till before I start accepting customers purchases.  My previous jobs are where I learned my skills and have skills that are not used in this position.  The hardest part of my job is not having enough work to do...I hate standing around doing nothing.  The most enjoyable part is taking care of customers.
good,It really all depends on what store you get into. If the associates want to work then it is okay but more times then not the workers are not hard working. And the customers are impossible to deal with.
good,Customers make your evening fun .My co workers are great  .I have a lot of fun with the people that comes  There.. It make your days go  by.
good,good place if you need a first time job. the bosses change so often i dont know much about the current positions there. i dont know about what is going on there anymore its been a long time since i worked there but it was fun when i was  there i didnt have many problems
good,"I work 5 to 7 hours and greet customers, handle money, open and close cash registers and stoke shelfs. I've learned how to stoke shelfs, keep track of money and handle unhappy customers. I get along well with others. Delegate responsibility. Nothing's is to  difficult to learn. The most enjoyable part of my job would be interacting with people."
good,"Open the cash register, take care of customers, replaced products."
good,It was a fun job i would recommend it to anyone looking for work. they are flexible with scheduling and is a well rounded company
good,"I unloaded the freight trucks, I put the products out in the store, was a pretty easy job I would continue working there but hours dropped after the holidays."
good,"Hard work but fun, productivity, dont have a statement, great people trying to get by while attending college,  heat, success."
good,"My job gave me great hours. They were really good on giving us breaks, and a lot of the workers were really close and hung out a lot."
good,Inventory management is a bit chaotic in larger stores as the warehouse sends too much of one item and too little of another. Also tend to have deadlines for certain seasonal items to be displayed but will get the items for display about a week later.
good,"it has its ups and downs like any job. it had ok days, the manager at the time sucked. I didn't really learn anything other then how to receive a truck. the hardest thing was recievung a truck alone and the most enjoyable part of the day was when I was alone stocking."
good,The job is MUCH more physical than anyone can expect.  There is never down time or an off season in high volume stores. The chemistry among coworkers will really make or break you.
good,Job was easy once you had all your pieces in place. Holidays were very stressful with expanded freight load.  rest of the year was extremely easy to manage. DM and higher was very approachable
good,i was hired and was able to move up into a store manager position. it is a great company with great benefits. i work hard everyday guys
good,its a fun store to work only if you are a part time worker and able to stay longer on short hours and different schedules. holidays you can dress up whatever you like. greet customers and help them where are the stuff are located.
good,Same group of people for 5 years plus you become family. Enjoyed the friendly customers and staff. Good atmosphere. Good company to work for if looking for something part time.
good,I was a stocks person an a cashier I love to come to work each an every day that I was there at dollar tree. I left the company because I want to go to school an further my education an ending up moving to Wilmington Delaware.
good,"you do your basic stocking, and run the cashier. ive never had a job so basic, most of the time you can zone out. and all the people are friendly 99% of the time."
good,The job was simple I grab boxes and put them where they belong they begin to cut my hours slowly but surely until I turn around and they saying they dont need me anymore
good,"Dollar Tree has been a great aspect for me the past couple years. I have grown alot the past couple of years, I started just merchandising freight three days a week to being a part time Asst.Manager to becoming a full time Asst. Manager and a full time Merchandising Manager."
good,"Dollar Tree has a very welcoming environment. The customers are very nice and easy to get along with, but the pay is extremely low."
good,"Had great managers and they were very helpful in the development of growth. I had a great repor with them, and even tho I dont work there anymore I have kept communication with them. I had an awesome time with them. The pay was minimum wage but was still great people  to work with"
good,"Dollar Tree was the easiest job. I was responsible for attending to the register, helping the customers, keeping the store neat and clean, and restocking the store. My co workers were really nice and help me when I needed them."
good,"my typical day at work would be at the cash register ringing customers items, stocking the merchandise on the shelves, also unloading the delivery truck on delivery days."
good,The warehouse is a busy place and  you can advance in the company. The hardest part is cleaning behind grown people that don't clean. The company is a very good company it's just a few things need to be changed.
good,"Dollar tree is a good job & I have learned alot in my time working here. I have learned hospitality and to be respectful no matter how rude someone was to me. I also learned patience and to stay hard working and determined no matter what. I usually work 5 hours a day, 3 days a week cashiering and putting back loose items. Also clean when need to. Its hard to live off the small paycheck I get every two weeks and not working much at all. I love my co workers, but there is a few people who are rude to me and dont wanna work with me unlike everyone else. It is a good reasonable job I just need a second one in order to achieve the goals that I have."
good,"Typical day was working at the register, stocking shelves, managing my own til. Opening and closing the store to help out management. Giving me a great learning experience in a different type of retail."
good,Cool environment and enjoyed the regulars. I would go back if they paid more than minimum wage.  I did more than  expected. It's an overall nice place for part time work
good,"There are a lot of good people working at Dollar Tree. Very helpful, knowledgeable, and team work oriented. There is also a vast amount of hard working associates."
good,"I loved working there good environment, I stocked shelves helped customers. Managed money, I was only seasonal, I'm really good with customers I always help where was needed always cleaned stocked I kept myself busy."
good,Dollar tree was a good job also it just wears on your body and stress on your body we only get two breaks a day but always asked us about overtime that was good
good,Fun place to work with great flexible hours.  Multiple customer interactions guarantee a fun shift that flies by while working to create an enjoyable dinning experience.
good,Absolutly loved working at dolar tree. The staff was great. I worked at dollar tree for about two years and i learned so much. Although pay isnt that great and there is no holiday for part time employes. I would definatly recommend to anyone in school looking for something part time.
good,A nice parttime job able to move up with company good for a person looking a parttime job flexable hours fun people to be around nice hours not hard work at all
good,"Very productive work place, not well balanced with personal life. I would go back if the pay was more. Very professional work environment and nice,  neat staff."
good,"Not a very good place to work, if you get hurt on the job they ignore you. I got hurt on the job right in front of the manager, and he did nothing."
good,I like working at dollar tree. the management was helpful and understanding my co workers we young and still learning themselves though.
good,"A great experience with Dollar Tree, the customers were great and so were the people that I worked for. The store was in good order and neat."
good,As far as I can tell the store needs to be a little more organized. I really haven't worked long enough to make much of a judgement. I wish I had more hours. Seems like they like to hire a lot of part time. I'm not sure who can live off $8/hr with maybe 15hrs a week.
good,I liked working there it was a good job nice environment clean happy people like my coworkers for the most part pleasant experience working for the dollar tree
good,"Not a great Environment to work in, the manager make you feel like you dont matter. the labor is fine but the atmosphere of how the job is in not a good one to be in"
good,The store is always busy. Very friendly customers and employees. It is a very well aligned environment. Every boss will help their employees in every aspect they come across whether it is learning abilities or person matters.
good,"Over the 2 years I have worked here, I have worked opening, mid-day, and closing shifts. I also helped the store move. Starting out here was tough because they have a rule for cashiers that a variance of +- $3 leads to a write-up, and successive incidents can lead to suspension/termination. There is no corporate trust or value of employees. Cashiers are limited to 15 hrs a week, else the store manager gets in trouble with their superiors, and it pays minimum wage."
good,Need more hours I have to pay my rent.I'm always on time dedelicated to my work. Although the hrs are low if full time it would be better
good,Worked here for just a few years and managed to get into Assistant Store Manager position and was beginning a path toward managing my own store. Only left because job type didn't fit my lifestyle.
good,The job taught me how to work a cashier and balloons. It also taught me how to deal with people. It help me become more organized cause some times I had to clean the ailse.
good,"N ot given enough hours in a week, lucky to receive 12.5.Management was nice and employees were respectful.Requires a lot of standing, stays busy people come and go with this company a lot so if you require lots of hours look elsewhere."
good,"Compared to other retail companies, this is by far the toughest place to work as a manager and also the cheapest. Despite the headache, I loved my job there, and would go back in a heartbeat if I didn't have to put in 65 hours a week due to not enough distributed hours to give to other employees."
good,Great management and team work. Excellent work performance. No pressure. Payment is good for the position. Jobs tasks are very easy if you are willing to learn and move up quickly.
good,Had a lot of great employees at Dollar Tree that were eager and willing to learn the policies and procedures of the company. I learned how to make schedules and do daily deposits.
good,"Busy, i learned more management skill and customer service. Management needed more work with the right leader and team work. co-workers at times up and down but we learn and make better. once again being boss and friend. most enjoyable part of my job was learning and helping and working with people."
good,I loved the customers as well as employees. There just wasn't proper communication between management. Caused an uncomfortable work space.
good,"This is my first job and it has been a good learning experience.  I enjoy working with the public and working with with cash.  The store is quiet, I would like a busier environment."
good,"You are on the go from the time you walk through to door, you get your cash drawer, after you recount it, then, into the register it goes. Now, you are ready to receive customers, no customers, no problem, there is a list of items for you to achieve during your work day. The customers are usually nice, except for the couponers, they sometimes take special patients. We have our favorites that come in, some are daily visitors! The hardest part, is working in the heat! The building is air-conditioned, but it seems like I'm always hot. I had a wonderful manager when I started there that I learned a lot from, but once he left I stayed probably longer than I should. The manager situation was not good and I was very stressed out, I finally left for a better job and was much happier."
good,The work place was typical (an average store environment). Both stores I worked at were under staffed. Employees were not allowed to work a full 40 ( typically around 20-25 hours per week). Only one cashier was allowed to work per shift and was required to jump from cashiering to stocking between customers.
good,"First year as Freight Manager, then promoted to Store Manager.  Did all the hiring, wrote the schedules and planned all the seasonal transitions.  Promoted two assistant managers to higher positions."
good,A typical workday may have included organized and efficient environment.I was encouraged to develop personal development skills which incorporated customer service.Having an environment that was efficient and stable it promoted a healthy workforce which entail one to take initiatives and accommodate challenges as well . My co- workers and I established a team player roll. We encouraged each other. The hardest part of the job was increasing absentees with certain individuals which caused an increased in the work load. The most enjoyable part of the job was the availability of management when things were needed.
good,Great place to gain experience in retail. Not to busy. Just busy enough to get hands on training. Only downfall is standing for hours on end.
good,"bad employees that called off but lots hours in the outcome."
good,As a cashier you don't have a lot to do but check customer's products out and stock inventory. The store was a small one so it did not require much clean-up. Managers and supervisors are not always on you to see what you are doing.
good,"Its was my first job, and as that, I think it was a good experience. Its was a good and casual part time job. The retail experience is very helpful for any future job that requires customer service."
good,In my year working there I have worked more than I ever have due to the incompetence of the overnight stock staff.
good,Corporate controls all deliveries coming into the store and continues to send products even if your store cannot handle it. The bonus structure is based on the previous years sales and profit margin which makes it very hard to get them.
good,"Very fast paced, productive environment. Not really the place to elevate your skills . A typical day wasn't very typical. Dealt with a lot of non organized processing. Management wasn't very strong or punctual."
good,"Enjoy working with Customers. There is always a way to resolve conflict. Management always appreciates employees such as myself that show loyalty, consistency, and the drive to sell. my co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of the job is to be able to satisfy all the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have sales that have surpassed our previous sales the month prior."
good,Management is easy to get along with. The pay is minimum wage. The pay is not equal to the work required. On 10-15 hours a week.
good,when i worked at dollar tree my store manager was awesome but now the manager there is not good. when i worked there i had awesome co-workers that i got along fine with. the hardest part was getting everything settle for inventory. the most enjoyable part working there was helping customers find what they needed.
good,"A place where to start off working right after high school, but not a place to end up there and not move up higher. Helps build up skills."
good,"The staff was very friendly , and the regular customers were always happy to see me. That gave me even more motivation to do my best."
good,"Great on a Daily Basis, Busy, Management wise so great could be better, In much need more of communictaion on manager side, Very busy not enough employee's to satifys the companys need on a regular basis, But i do love all my customer's and making sure they are getting every oppurtunity and need provided from me while shopping at there nearest Dollar Tree."
good,It was a great work place . the management was great and organized. I got alone with my co workers. the hardest part of the job is not knowing if the next shift person is coming in or not. unloading the truck could get hard when you have so much to put out and don't have room for it anywhere.
good,"typical day at work starts off slow but after I warm up I'm on a roll"
good,"A typical day at dollar tree is basically ringing customers keep the lines down and helping with customer service. I have learned to work on speed with checking out customers, management is fair and works hard and friendly with all, my co-workers are friendly and everyone gets along great. honestly there is nothing hard about the job especially after working retail for 10+ plus years. the most enjoyable part about work are the customers and being able to help them."
good,"Worked as inventory staff and sale associate of cash register. Entry level labor job, with little room or opportunity to work full time/advance position."
good,The company as a whole has way too many chiefs trying to run things. It is very difficult to do your job correctly when you have several different managers on different levels telling you how it needs to be done. The pay is very weak when compared to other companies.
good,the job was easy. there were not enough hours and it was to much work for the pay. the manager sucked and was really rude. the employees did what they want because the boss had pick and choses.
good,Needs to compensate their workers for the job that they do. Also they need to come up with a plan to put merchandise on the floor instead of jus everywhere.
good,dollar tree do give the employees enough work hours. and the company do not pay the empolyees enough money on the job.i wish the company would the employees more hours.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people but the management sucked. the hardest part of the job was working with people that did not want to work. i learned a lot working in that field.
good,"I worked as a stocker for Dollar Tree, it was a fast pace environment. where I worked stocking supplies and produce before the store opened for business the next morning."
good,"Fun place to  work if like talking with people, sometime you have to work very hard, such as lifting boxes, unloading trucks ,etc also it is very hard to become full time  also can"
good,"A good company to work with if you are a student. A typical workday consists of handling cash, organizing shelves, stocking merchandise etc....."
good,"A typical day at work: 8+ hours (overtime offered), decent work environment."
good,I have had a learning experience where some people are people to remember. I enjoyed my time here but I'm looking for full time work. Part time is okay for students who are looking for only certain amount of hours. One is never too old to learn. I enjoyed learning new things everyday.
good,"I loved my job, my crew and my old boss.  He retired 2 years ago.  At first the job was fun, for 9 years or so, then things started to change as companies do when they grow like we were doing. . We fell into those changes pretty well.  My review is, its really the people you work with, and the customers that keep you going in this business."
good,Work was always busy with many customers to attend and provide client services. Fun and enjoyable place to work any time of the week.
good,"Assisting costumers to find items they need, sales, merchandising, use of the register, handling money. Friendly co workers. Learned to work in retail. Sometimes very busy but makes the time go by faster."
good,"Everything for a dollar?! I mean no one can beat that, it was fun working with Dollar Tree. Even more grateful for the over night opportunity, with that knowledge it oen doors for me."
good,Great place to work an be.Really nice customers and new projects an things to do everyday. The company really looked out for there workers and co-workers were really nice
good,A great starting place for part timers. Hours are not great but if you need a second job this would be the best place. The hardest part would be the unloading of the truck if the weather is bad.
good,Ensure that the store had a pristine appearance to create a clean environment for not only the customers but the staff as well.
good,"come in look at assigned sheet , grab a eboat & stock (front face) specific aisle. great work experience overall , meet alot of great people ! hardest part was there was no hard part , but the most enjoyable was the cheap snacks on breaks"
good,In a time of need Dollar Tree is a good company to work with while getting yourself reestablished. They are insightful and have a great style in managing the budget.
good,"I only worked Friday-Sunday my typical day at work was working has a cashier,sometimes clean up around the story or put merchandise on the shelves, sometimes i would work overtime, close at night."
good,standing for a long time. It was hard but I was able to do my work. Everyone was nice and caring. I will love to work again here.
good,Dollar Tree was a fun work place and i really liked my store manager and my employees Dollar Tree opened the door for me to be in management and dealing with freight.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree consists of stocking the front area, and answering any questions that your customers may have."
good,Honestly this job isn't really worth reviewing. Management isn't as well oiled as it should be. Also when you work really hard others get promotions over you based on favoritism.
good,It is always busy and you will learn a lot within the company such stocking the shelves. The hardest part is when you have to train someone on the cash registers.
good,"A typical day at work would usually be pretty busy. You have the usual customers who come in from the neighborhood. I learned that you have to be exceptionally patient with certain people in some situations. As far as management goes I had multiple managers in the time that I did work for the company. My co-workers and I got a long pretty well. Everyone showed up for their shift on time so there was no complaining and everyone was pretty much on the same page. The hardest part of the job was, in the beginning having to do recovery without any training, but I learned pretty quickly where everything went. The most enjoyable part was that the whole staff got along and got the job done which made work easier."
good,"Most days when I worked, we were busy. Not many people worked at the store either. My main manger was a sweet heart but the others were not. I was younger than most of the workers so they had some kind of hate towards me. There were always drama. If I opened in the morning I would clean the place up and refill balloons to make them look fresh and ready to be sold."
good,"This was my first real taxable job, I helped setup the interior store and stocked merchandise. I didn't really learn much from the job, to be completely honest, I felt like a chimp could apply it's skills to the fullest and get the job done. Management was standard, I wasn't being micromanaged or told what to do every couple of minutes. My co-workers made a difference, same as I, they were kind and understandable. I wouldn't say any part of the job was hard and the most enjoyable part was actually getting the store up and running."
good,"A typical day at work would be arrive at 5am, unload trucks prior to the store opening at 9am. Clean bathrooms. Help organize and put up displays and sales the week of."
good,working for dollar tree has its rewarding qualities like the ability to develop needed skills that will carry you throughout life and a career. Management is generally a pleasure to work with and the ability for advancement through the company makes it a great job for first timers.
good,Is a great store with convenient inexpensive items and they are all over the place. Hard not to find one in every other corner.
good,"It was a good temporary job. Good amount of downtime, and a fair work environment. Fit my schedule at the time. I learned how to work an old style register."
good,"My day begins at 8.30 in the morning, I learn a lot from my customers, the hardest part of my job is when i have to deal with a customer who wants to pick a fight with me."
good,"I'm given daily, multiple tasks to complete in a course of 6 hours or less. I successfully complete all tasks and most of the times I manage to complete additional tasks for the benefit of the store's image and others coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work was to pull stock cart and stock shelf."
good,Not a career but a job for now.  Prefer career oriented employment fun fill in for the time being. Love retail during holiday season. Fun to see what people are doing and making. Enjoy getting to know regular customers.
good,"Learn how to be a leader and work with no supervision. Like to work with people , a typical day of work include cleaning stocking , running the store with minimal workers and that is the hardest part ."
good,Most days it was really busy and most people would get really overwhelmed. I worked with some great co-workers and management was good as well. I would typically ring out customers and out away overstock and clean around the registers. You were responsible for your own drawer and making sure that all the money was there and not missing.
good,"Management is very supportive and helpful, environment is lighthearted with fun employees. freedom to set merchandise without planogram. Ability to show skills and creativity. Unfortunately there is not much chance for any advancement it is a good job for part time work"
good,"It is the typical retail experience. You may not always get hours but you are most likely to get a job there and keep it, reliably and hardworking managers. Everyone I work with is nice. Sometimes the manager will help you out if you are in a bind and need time off or need to switch with someone and can be understanding of situations that arise."
good,"Being at the Dollar Tree Distribution Center gave me an experience that enhanced me in many ways! Being in trucks alone gave me time to focus on building my personal character as I built walls made of boxes/freight in a timely manner. At certain times, I would work five 12-hour shifts simuetaneously, and did so without complaint! I left this company only because a center is not available in Atlanta, but I definitely enjoyed my time there!"
good,"A typical day included assisting customers, operating the register, maintaining a clean environment, and the most enjoyable aspect of the position is building relationships with the customers."
good,Good overall company. Does have its physical requirements and you do work quite hard for the money you make. most wages start at minimum.
good,pay and benefits are awful but its a great starter job because you can move up fast. Also great for a student since they will work with you on your schedule
good,"excellent place to acquire management skills,the opportunity for advancement is fairly fast within associate team members,at times improper or lack of training for new management and associates, the sink or swim method used often,unfair practices to certain members"
good,A typical working day would be loading the trucks on the days the store receive inventory. Once the staff and i are done loading we place whats needs to be place outside into the store ally. What i have learn working as a team pays off makes your day go by faster and get what needs to be done on time.
good,A typical day would be stocking the shelves and doing plan-o-grams through out the store. Opening and/or closing the store.
good,I liked working there. The only issue i had was ALWAYS understaffed. It is a nice place to work but it needs a better manager there.
good,"During my time with the company I worked in four stores. I have experience in both high and low volume sales. I worked in the training store of the district and I have experience training new managers and assistant managers. I performed various management duties which included opening  and closing the store, cash handling, scheduling, performing bank deposits, supervising associates, hiring associates among other duties.  I also earned Top Gun status for achieving maximum profits 6 times while working for the company."
good,"Nice hotel with great employees. Although I only worked temporary for this hotel, when I was there it was nice and quick work!"
good,"May issue payoffs and obtain customer's signature on receipt"
good,Management were clueless. Placed employees on forklifts without training. Asked for a totally different position when hired for something other than what I asked for due to experience.
good,I enjoyed working for dollar tree. it was my very first job and I learned a lot from Dollar Tree. I worked a lot and very hard. I learned a lot about items and organization.
good,"i like the people i work with and its not very difficult. it would be nice to get more hours so im looking for another job. It's an average kind of job, I guess."
good,Its great place to make a little extra money! And getting to know your regular customer. Good team mates. Picking up hours and picking up extra hours working at a different store location.
good,"As a part-time cashier, I basically did everything. Restock shelves, did returns and purchases and made sure that the store was clean. Usually when I close, I have to vacuum the store. If it wasn't for my super chill manager, I would have quit a long time ago."
good,"Okay its a job its not the best but its not the worst either. the employees are the best part of the job, to get along with the people you work with and are able to build relationships outside of work is great."
good,Was hired more than 4 months ago and since then I am given only 13 hours a week at minimum wage ($7.25 per hour). With no opportunity for advancement or wage increase. You are provided absolutely NO benefits.....
good,Its an ok job part time hours no more then 25 hours a week and its 7.25 a hour no benefits ok management great people there to work with
good,"Working for this company was a headache, because the management was unorganized and didnt treat they employees equal. Some people was treated better then other's and Managers would influence negative things upon others!"
good,this was my first official job. if the managers had better communication i wouldve lasted much longer. other than that i had fun working there.
good,Simple place to work with simple tasks. Only responsibilities are to check out customers and stock the shelves. Management is easygoing.
good,A typical day at  work would be ringing customers in. Stocking shelves when not busy. I learned alot about customer service . My co workers were really nice and got along with everyone. The hardest part would be standing on a concrete floor. The most enjoyable part would be the customers.
good,"Great management, and what I love the most is helping customers. Great staff and seeing customers happy when they find what they were looking for make me feel great."
good,"I really enjoyed working there from the time I was there. Only thing about it is when I was working there and the line got long, I was the only one at the register and one other co worker but they would be in the back somewhere doing stock."
good,"it was a good not bad job,,,,it was not a bad learning experience, cashier skills, management skills, independent responsibilities, management,"
good,"Over the course of my time with Dollar tree, I learned every position from door greeter, to management and everything in between. It was an enlightening year as I learned new things and broadened my work experience."
good,"Results- driven customer centered manager with 4+ years experience in store management of a multimillion- dollar store operation. Notable success advancing corporate strategy, streamlining operations, driving profits and maximizing growth. Promote employee excellence and motivate employees toward top level performance."
good,"Friendly workplace that focused on what I knew about customers and how to improve myself with customer service, cashier efficiency, and stock, rather than numbers."
good,"lots of stock, fast/medium paced, very costumer oriented. "
good,"Good hard working people my job was to stock, at times this can be difficult depending on whats being stocked. Every Wednesday we have new shipment that comes in, so unloading a 1500 piece truck was always a killer."
good,"Dollar Tree taught me how product placement increases sales, how to schedule on a budget, sometimes it was frustrating to have so much product and not enough space"
good,Over the company is a very fast pace business with supportive management team that are ready to follow direction and achieve all task. However I must say that the most enjoyable part of my job was customer service and working along my team.
good,District managers weren't the best and you do not have any freedom for creativity. Not a whole lot of managing with the higher ups.
good,"Extremely fast pace. Short shifts and they want you to a lot in one shift. If sales are not being met, they will cut your hours. As assistant manager, they say that you are guaranteed 25 hours. However, that is not at all true. Co-workers are there just for a paycheck, they do not do what they are suppose to do during their shift. Hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and getting merchandise out when they had to cut hours and there was not many people helping. I very much loved working and helping customers find what they needed to find."
good,"There aren't a lot of opportunities for advancement, however, the job security is pretty good. Unfortunately there are times when payroll problems result in fewer hours. The best part of the job is the flexible scheduling and friendly co-workers."
good,"A typical day would be working the cash register, Stocking shelves and provided inventory checks. make sure the store is clean including the bathroom. Then at the end of the day I cash out my drawer and count down all the money sometimes I deposit the money into the bank."
good,I used to help pick up the floors and I appreciated my manager at my site for everything she has helped me with. It was my first job.
good,"It was a decent place to work. Tasks included ringing up customers, and upkeep of store. The coworkers were the best part of the job."
good,"The work was seasonal and with low pay; however, I enjoyed work my work tasks. The job was within my skill level and I could rely on previous work experience to perform my job.  I had opportunities to do work throughout the store and kept busy.  I liked being busy."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day was spending time with the coustomers and making them smile. You never know when your smile is the only one someone sees in a day
good,the co-worker were sweet. the environment of the store is peaceful and calm. pay wasn't much but a normal easy job. the most enjoyable part would be meeting new people.
good,"I worked at thedollar tree as an assistant  manager in 2013 , Dollar tree was a good place to work fun and good people . great managment and accommodating to you for your family ."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree includes me handling the cash register , Re-stocking the aisles and handling new inventory , also Maintaining a clean and customer friendly work environment , I learned how to establish new clientele and met monthly sale goals , I thought my manager was fair , My co-workers were some what unprofessional but I learned to deal with them , The hardest part of the job was deal with some customers but I also learned how to deal with it , The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out people when they needed my help."
good,"Greeting customers, always on the registers, have to keep the shelves filled with everyday items that are important to and for the customers."
good,"Normal Retail Job of helping to satisfy shoppers!  Checking out and stocking is the normal day. Main thing is dealing with custmers attitude, in which I kill them with kindness."
good,"Fun workplace, management changes often but as management changes there is  no real effect on employees as they mostly follow the same guidelines. Customers are very friendly and love to chat with employees."
good,I have gained alot of skills and training working at Dollar Tree. Including training to become a manager and also working with windows excel working with warehouse management sytems I have training in all depatments working in dollar tree
good,A typical day at dollar tree would be loading the cash registers for the day.Management was really awesome when i worked there.Co-workers were awesome as well
good,ok company to work for good place to start out as a manager great training in the beginning but after that the trainning starts it's better to come in at a higher level but it is possible to work your up from worker to asm but very hard to go from assistant store manager
good,"Easy to advance in the company if you have a good work ethic, but very low paying compared to other retailers. I have loved my last two bosses."
good,"Here, it was a pleasant experience. the work was very easy and the boss was great with flexibility. Great with schedules. However, a lot of people were ""in and out"" with the company. I prefer to grow with a family, and this company usually only hired people seasonally. It was hard to continue special friendships with co-workers and frequent customers."
good,The pay was decent. It was very fast paced. It took a lot of skill to organize everything just right. It was a easy going work environment.
good,"fun work place"
good,"Dollar Tree was a good place to work, the people there were friendly and we got along well.  Only thing I wasn't happy about was no full time positions for cashiers."
good,"I kind of liked McDonald,s.I just didn't like the hours I was gave.This job was my first experience working cashier and with customers. It actually was my first job."
good,A good place to work with a diverse group of individuals to maintain and achieve one goal.  You always find the treasure just have to look for it.  A typical day at Dollar Tree in my shoes is to expect the unexpected.  Always on your toes checking associates and making sure you get quality production and at the same time making sure the customer experience is at a high level.  Go through and follow the planner and make sure all the top priority areas get done first.  Most of these are areas to get the best sales for that day.  By the end of one day you should be looking at what's next for the next day.
good,Good place to work where you can move up quickly. Although you get paid by- weekly the co - workers are great and the customers are fun and playful as well.
good,"My typical day consist of: clocking in, get a cash drawer, work mid shift. I clean the glass on the doors, clean register area, make sure I have everything before opening my lane. Do some stocking (weekly), cashier, fill balloon corral, and clean front of store and registers, do recovery, and pull out dated or close to expire foods."
good,"Coming in counting the safe set the cashier up for there shift,  give them there appleseed which what they need to due during there shift. Plan the day accordingly see how the backroom looks,  which endcaps need to be change order store supplies, etc."
good,"I was a sales associate. I was handling the cashier, greeter, and restocking. I just got this job to start learning to do things on my own."
good,As an employee you must know how to be patient and tolerant. you will come across a wide variety of customers. As a sales associate you will be required to perform multiple jobs.
good,"great part time job and first time job. Cannot make a living off of this job. nice environment and lenient. They expect too much from one employee to run the store, and register and assist customer and clean."
good,Dollar Tree was fun. You did your job and worked gard. Those that didn't got let go. I bonded with people over the work we did. It was fun but not very rewarding. There was low pay and only so far you could move up.
good,"Sometimes work was good and smooth, everyone has their bad days. Working at Dollar Tree was a great experience, but it wasn't worth it after getting used to everything. I was somewhat over worked and made money that i could spend within 5 minutes every 2 weeks."
good,"responsible for making sure orders were correct, restaurant was kept clean and customers were satisfied.  It was a great part time job."
good,Dollar Tree gave me the knowledge to solve guests problems while using excellent customer service.Dollar Tree also was very cultured which I admired the company for.
good,"Waited For Customers I worked at lets say a quiet store and  when I worked Extra Hours at a near by Store it was  Fast and  Christmas Time Helped  with  this   though  not sure  by much .. "
good,"Well when i was employed at dollar tree i had the best manager ever.i got trained to be a cashier by one of my coworkers, after i learned how to run the cash register it became so easy to me.every customer that came in my line i had a good joke for them that made them smile."
good,"Love this store, I really enjoyed working with the other co-workers! I would recommend this store to anyone looking for work! They sure know how to keep you busy too!  :)"
good,the hardest thing i had to do was not break the glass that i had to put out. typically i would stock the shelves and tend to the customers in any way possible.
good,"its not the worst job, the people are nice, just dont give enough hours."
good,This job kept me with a little money in pocket and I had a good amount of hours weekly. I would work there again but only if I returned with a better position.
good,very happy place to work and the management staff are very respectful. very different environment to work in when it comes to holiday season.
good,"assisting  customers,putting out freight and doing the schedule"
good,"Clocking in going to the register assigned to me. Checking customers as they come to my register, and any question they might have. Helping them anything they might need help with. At the end of my shift count my money to make sure it balances out to zero."
good,A typical day at work was fun  and stocking the shelves and working with  diffrent people. What i learned was  how to move more effieciently. maNAGMENT WAS AWESOME . Co-workers were great. the hardest part of th job was leaving and the enjoyable  part was making the store look  better .
good,"Working at Dollar Tree can be very fun and awesome. My co-workers and managers are really cool and out going. I can review my job as being competitive and easy, but the only the is the pay$. its fun work but the living expenses during these tough times is not enough to keep someone alive."
good,typical day at work was to make sure you had proper change to start your shift and make sure store was cleaned. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different customers and coworkers always made you feel a home.
good,"Work hard with few hours. High stress, low pay and little reward. A lot of gossip among associates and management. High turnover rate."
good,"Dollar tree was pretty fun to work at. Although my job was very short there for being temporary, the management, coworkers and customers were easy to work with. The hardest part was moving shelves and big appliances around and the most enjoyable was working with people that I knew."
good,It was a job I only got part time hours and really wanted to work full time it had no benifates. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"Challenging working with all types of people, Managing cashier   production with assisting customers, applying time management skills to get work done in a timely fashion. Hardest part of job is watching that cashiers get the work done without walking away. The most enjoyable part of day is when the customer is satisfied and leave store feeling they were treated with respect and professionialism."
good,My first job at the Dollar Tree was a good experience for me. I enjoyed learning about customer service and interacting with others to gain experience in the retail and customer service field of work.
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. It was my first job and it was seasonal. I was glad to have the work experience. A typical day was restocking shelves and helping customers with their purchases.
good,The management what's good but the pay was not I did not get many work days as a stock clerk I did not get much work time or that much money and I understand that cashiers would make more then stock clerks because they were dealing with the customers but when I worked there I would also have to help and deal with the customers but I got payed less it was nice to work at Dollar Tree but it's not some place I would stay vary long.
good,"Coworkers, the immediate management, and the people you'll see on a day to day basis are usually good people. A lot of quirky individuals work and shop at Dollar Trees (on top of all the really normal ones, of course) and if you'll let yourself, you'll probably enjoy all of them, but the only problem is, the company expects you to do it all, without paying you for it all. While I was working there, it was minimum wage starting, and you had a grand total of a possible $0.30 raise if you work there a year. The starting wage is more now (which let me give them one more star, otherwise, I'd have given them the lowest rating possible for that) but a yearly raise of not even $0.50 (and $0.30 is only because you've done exceptional) is a little unfair to the hard work every employee does (or should do, at least) to keep a store running."
good,not enough staff for truck days. some management were hard to work with and talk to. didnt really look into too many issues with employees. kind of just let things slide.
good,Don't get many hours but the people are really friendly.  Get to interact with customers.   Short shifts such as four or six hours.
good,a day at work was ok. the management was ok. my coworkers were ok . the hardest part was the management. the most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people.
good,"Dollar Tree was a good place to work. Perfect for those looking for part-time retail positions. A typical day included greeting customers and assisting them with locating store products, keeping work area neat and clean, promoting specialty products, and operating computerized check-out system."
good,Working at Dollar Tree I was able to interact with customers on a daily basis. If there were any projects that needed to be done that consisted of decorating or re-organizing they were handed to me. I usually worked on the register or participated in cleaning up the store and making sure items made it back to their proper homes.
good,"I moved out of state and had to find something to do. I love the store I work at and the people I work with. You may get hired as a cashier, but you end up learning more than just your job. Which actually works out in the long run!"
good,"take care customers on all they needs,make sure they find everything they was looking for.thanks them for shooping at are store."
good,"dollar tree was a very good/growing organization to work for"
good,Good place to start working as a teenager. It helps you grow and learn more about good customers services. The managements are also friendly
good,"I worked as a cashier, I stocked when the freight was delivered and provided loss prevention coverage. I left this job to attend college and start a career. The managers and coworkers were friendly."
good,Limited amount of time to close store and many times stuck on a register and the one thing that I learned from working for this company is you get what you pay for.
good,"Working at dollar tree was my first experience working retail . I learned how to become a great cashier , stocker and sale associate. My co-worker were pleasant to work with very helpful. My most hardest part of the job was cleaning and putting merchandise back into the correct aisles in a very big department store but always got the job done. My enjoyable part of the jobs is greeting and serving customers while maintaining a positive and welcoming attitude.Ensure that customers are enjoying their visit and take action to correct any problems.Assisted where various items are located."
good,Possibly the best employers I've ever worked for. Job duties/expectations were straight-forward and was not too demanding.
good,"Overall Dollar Tree is a good company to work for. My experience was from a management standpoint. They have great benefits for management but recently dropped their part time employees benefits. Its seems the larger the company grows, the less they care about employees."
good,"Balance work environment"
good,A typical work day at Dollar Tree was a laid back job. Management was good and always helped out anyway possible. Co-workers were fun to work with. There was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a very laid back environment.
good,"Customer Service, unloading trucks, stocking shelves, cashing customers out, helping customers when they needed assistance. Loved working at this company. Enjoyed meeting new faces and all types of people."
good,A typical work day starts out me counting draws and cleaning the front of the store  preparing the u boats for the stockers to stock shelves.
good,Love going to work.  Enjoyed the manager insight. Able to use my creative on plan o grams and end caps. Enjoy that the manager let my creative displays. overall rating is great.
good,it was okay job but I couldn't see myself there for a career that why I planed to move on and see what I can get a better job or better pay
good,"ok typical warehouse opportunity"
good,"As an assistant manager, it's a very fast paced place to work. You're responsible for unloading trucks, stocking shelves, in addition to supervising the cashiers and handling the money. All of which I enjoy. However, I was hired with the promise of training to get a store, and after six months there has been very little training. Most of what I have learned, I've picked up as I went along. All the hourly employees are very friendly and fun to work with. The most difficult part of the job is trying to have a family life outside of work, because schedules get changed at the last minute, which makes planning anything very difficult."
good,I would my week on monday by unloading the store truck into the stock room. I then would unload the stock room onto the sales floor and help with any customers that needed to be help as far as finding a product to picking up online orders or cashing them out at the cashier checkout.
good,"A typical day was standing at my register."
good,I've most if not all my customer service experience at this establishment. The staff is easy to get along with almost like a second family. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers have a great experience shopping there.
good,"Typical day at work is good helping customers with merchandise."
good,Company has a forward thinking model at all times. If they stay profitable they stay in business a lot longer than other retailers. Company model and thought processes were always ingrained in every employee from CEO to Part Time associate.
good,"It was a good opportunity working at Dollar Tree, but had little chance to move up and advance. Relatively good for beginning to achieve a skill set."
good,"Great work environment, for the most part.  We are the highest grossing store in the region for 4 consecutive quarters  and Top 3 store in the country. Comeback store of 2012 across all stores. My boss was released because one bank deposit was misplaced. It was later discovered that there was an error done by the bank.  Instead of looking to protect one of their own they immediately turned and placed the blame on a scapegoat."
good,"The management was lacking, because the main manager was controlling. I usually was the only one working besides a manager and it got boring quickly."
good,"Dollar Tree is great first job to get the experience of working at the register the first time and work at a fast pace. I was pretty much working on the spot and if I needed help, my supervisor did not have a problem helping. I learned how to adapt to it very quickly. I helped my supervisor close the store and manage the money for deposit. Whenever I had free time, I took advantage of the time and restock my register and shelves. I provided excellent customer service to the customers and did my best to help them find what he or she needed."
good,"I loved the management part of my job. "
good,"Great place to work, especially if you like slow days, and guests with time. I wish they offered benefits to employees, as well as longer breaks."
good,"Daily tasks would be to scan customers items, be friendly, and get customers out in a timely fashion. Management was sure to keep you informed of your performance and co-workers helped make this job fun and exciting."
good,"I learned to work with different types of people, in different situtaions"
good,A typical day at work consisted of coming in and doing daily stretches then finding out what you're to do from a manager. Two breaks of 15 minutes with a half hour lunch in between. Occasional meetings extended lunch. I learned what a typical warehouse environment is like. Management were pretty cool people but not very good bosses. They made no sense when it came to things important/business decisions/lying. My co-workers were all pretty great to work with besides the exceptional few. No one was really happy to work there but they were still friendly. Hardest part would have probably been working with the management when an everyday task was completed. Most enjoyable was working in inbound shipping.
good,good learning experience  liked working with the people and learning customer service
good,A typical dat at work consist of taking orders and giving orders at a reasonable time frame. I learned how to hear and repeat an order and process it quickly.
good,"working at dollar tree distribution was an amazing experience with loading truck, they have taught me how to load boxes on a truck from wall to wall and floor to ceiling without loosing any space at all.."
good,It's been years sense I worked at The Dollar Tree. When I worked there they didn't have back up cashiers so I would end up with a line. I have noticed while shopping there that they have improved on this.
good,"A typical day was basically working as cashier.  I did learn how to front the store.  Didn't know all aspects of being a cashier, wish i was taught everything for different aspects of cashiering.  i didn't have too much interaction with the other workers.  the hardest part of the job was being put on a register my first day with little information.  my most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,I ran one of the largest stores they have in Albuquerque. Also helped one new stores and clean up existing ones.
good,A typical day at work is working outside.  I have learned to evaluate what the customer needs.  The management was great.  My co-worker were very good to work with.  The hardest part of the job was mowing and cleaning up the grounds.  The most enjoyable part of the job was everything.
good,i really enjoyed working with others it taught me time management and great commutation skills with other co workers
good,"Dollar tree is a decent part time job, but can get very hectic and has rather unfair pair considering the amount of work expected"
good,"•	Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree would be at the cash register assisting customers to check out or guiding them to where an item is. Getting staff on the same page as you as to what needs to be done on that day, Counting registers, making sure all funds add up."
good,Learned more about merchandising and working freight to floor more quickly
good,"I am responsible for the day to day operations of a retail store recognizing more than $4 million dollars a year in sales."
good,"I got help full and get alot experience and learn how to merchandise and stocking and how to deal in customer service and how to work as a cashier. i got all my co-wokers help full and friendly. the hardest part of my job is waiting and working outside in winter to doing garbage at equipment and cross it over snow in floor,"
good,"Wonderful store, I started as a cashier and worked my way up to an Assistant Store Manager. Retail is a hard profession, but there is so much that can be learned. I enjoyed my time at the Dollar Tree."
good,great deal for consumers.  the most enjoyable part of work is customer satisfaction.
good,"A typical day a dollar tree begins with smiles and customer service."
good,Good for start up and it my pleasure to be part of the Dollar Tree family in which i learned a lot such Cashiering and Recovery
good,I would never work here again. I can't work somewhere and be stressed out all the time. I also can't work for someone who tells you to do one thing and then yells at you for doing it.
good,I love working at dollar tree but this job is not a career and a career is what I am looking for .
good,"a good place to work for a STUDENT, i liked it. I have a college degree so i need more now. if you understand."
good,I had a great relationship with majority of my co-workers. I love meeting new customers and getting to know customers. It was great working with a flexible schedule.
good,It wasn't the job for me. I wasn't employed there long because hours were cut and I also had to attend school.
good,Been working there for several years and need to have something that will pay the bills and give me advancement.
good,This was an ideal starting job with much opportunity for growth.
good,"I learned how to be fast-paced when needed and multi-task a lot better from having worked at Dollar Tree Inc.  I worked closely with the manager and assistant manager, and was offered an assistant manager position - however, at the time, my father had gotten into an accident and was in the ICU for nearly 2 months out of town, so I was unable to complete the assessment for the position."
good,the shift i work is great. i get started early from 6am -4:30pm. I learned that i am very flexible because it's changes everyday. The leadership team is okay but they don't communicate to the team as well as they should. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility.
good,"Assistant Store manager and Customer Service, would be attentive to the need of the customers and the ability to manage time well.  Was in charge of Unloading truck, responsible for making sure that the frozen/dairy order was delivered and put away in a timely manner.  Help customer with the needs of finding items in store and cashing out customers. Managing employees cash flow and break time, along with doing paperwork, and scheduling employees."
good,was a well productive company to work for ...taking care of customers and keeping store well stocked.enjoy seeing all the great merchandise that came in
good,No room for advancement.  Learned a lot.  Did not enjoy working 14 hour shifts.
good,I worked with some great people. I left this company due to a better opportunity.
good,I didnt like working at Dollar tree because i would go in to work then they would ask me to stay until close and during the time i helped but i was still attending school. I wasnt trained properly to answer the phine so when told to answer the phone i was written up because the customer complained about how i answered the phone saying hello.
good,"good place to work. the hours offered were not great. there is not much more to say about this company, it is ok."
good,The job kept me busy the full time I was at work. I enjoyed the people around me and the job itself.
good,"Working at the dollar tree communication skills were very important to have due to high customer volumes. Starting the evening shift you straighten up the stores shelves. remove any broken, misplaced or opened items from the shelves. If the shelves were a mess all items on that section are to be removed and reorganized on the shelf to provide a clean shopping enviornment"
good,"limited advancement, great benefits, poor corporate culture"
good,"The job overall was very easy and it was sad to leave the way I did. I would come in early and wait until my shift started and then would go with a manager to get a till to be the next cashier. While being cashier, my tasks were to help customers when i was not busy with purchases, clean the front area of the store, keep the registers clean and do anything else the manager tells me to do. I usually did the closing shifts due to me going to school throughout the day."
good,"I ran the cash register, assisted customers, and put away stock.  I loved dealing with the public and building customer relations.  i enjoyed working with a varied age group of co-workers and building friendships.  The hardest part of this job was not being able to get a full 40hr work week. There was a high turnover of managers at this particular store and a lot of customer complaints about some of the management."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, it was amazing to see all the different items a dollar can buy."
good,"enjoy working alone stocking shelves in own area, but often help others as needed we are a great team and works well together"
good,"helped any and every customer that came in out the store,stocked new incoming merchandise,made sure the store was clean."
good,I would show up at 11pm and stay till 8-9 am the next morning. We would be stocking the shelves and unloading the truck the next morning.
good,"A typical day at work would include assisting customers, completing cashier transactions, making sure the store is 100% recovered and stocked for the next day. Co-workers were always working together which is essential for success in this job."
good,We would stock and work the cash register.customer service was a constant.
good,"Receive freight, pick freight, drive equipment to attain percentage goals day to day."
good,I enjoyed going to work there everyday. I made sure the customers got everything they needed and never let unhappy.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, cashiering, stocking a managing other employees, along with banking, trash.  Most days were constant with customer service, tending with using a PDQ, vendors, I really loved being in contact with the public, on the most part they were very pleasant and were glad that we were there to serve them. My co workers would tell me how much they liked working with me and hope that someday I would return, The hardest thing about the job was working for some one that I felt didn't not appreciate a single employee that worked under her, and never took the time to explain things, if you didn't get it right the first time then you were an idiot. Also for some one that was salary based I felt took more time away from the store then was allotted.  Her 45 hours a week usually ran from 30 to 35 hours weekly. The most enjoyable thing about the job was seeing a customers face light up when I helped them find a product or held the door for them. Also many my co workers were some of the best workers, I miss them."
good,Good job to have to earn money. May have to work a lot hours sometimes and work extra hard to make a decent paycheck. Manager was good but his assistant managers was not reliable to help in store and wanted to put work load on all the other workers.
good,I done a lot of different things such as run the register and stock shelves and unload truck and check vendors in and out
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is not that exciting, it's more like you're giving quotas to fill and in most cases, not enough time to fill them. In addition to dealing with the customers concerns, you also have a giving work list to complete within a 4-5 hour period despite any distractions and obstacles that may come."
good,It was a fun place to work and i liked to see the regular customers weekly. i enjoyed working with my other co workers.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of stocking, cashiering and cleaning.  I learned that the dollar tree store could not advance me properly, hardest part of the job was only getting 15-20 hours or less a week."
good,Dollar Tree was a great place to work because it gave u the opportunity to help people find what they needed.
good,"This job was more of a circus, there was no team players, everyone was out for themselves. The managers were young and seemed to think they were to good to help the employees out. The managers would sit in there office most of the day unless they knew the big bosses were coming in. Then it was rush rush to get things in order."
good,Mainly cashiered but also stocked merchandise i wish the pay was a little bit better but all in all it was good
good,it was weird working there the managers seem to have slight problems
good,Daily I loved the job. Working with the public helping customers find what they needed and more.
good,"I have largely used this job as a way to fund my college education. At the store level, there is little opportunity for advancement. Hours are terrible, as a sales floor associate I was lucky to hit 20 hours a week. As management, getting over 30 is challenging. There are only 2-3 Full Time positions available Per Store, and these are Store manager and assistant manager positions only. These full time positions are rarely vacated. The CORPORATE OFFICE generally does not allow full time cashiers. Pay sucks as well. Expect minimum wage or close to. As management I make under $10 an hour."
good,"Dollar tree was alright. the co-workers were nice and friendly but it wasn't a safe place. The hardest part of the job was carrying things and the most enjoyable was laughing ans socializing with co-workers. Overall, I think it was pretty good"
good,There is little room for advancement at the Dollar Tree. I enjoyed working with customers though.
good,"very customer friendly, very busy store, Great work enviroment"
good,Open/close the store. Making sure that the shelves are fully stocked ad the customer leaves happy is my objective. I get along with just about everyone. The hardest part of my job is never having a consecutive schedule. It is different each week.
good,This place is a pretty good place to start if you are entering into the work force. I would say that location is a key factor in picking the right store for you.
good,"The days can often be long, an there are frequent cuts in hours. I extended my knowledge of bank drops, safe handling, cash handling, unloading truck procedures, and processing freight. Store manager is great, but assistant managers are typically not stable and frequently replaced. Co-workers were typically a joy to be around and converse with throughout the shift. Best part of the job was unloading and processing freight."
good,A typical day at work would be working 4-6 hours cashiering. I learned how to stock shelves and keep merchandise room in order. Management was not so good. Most of my co-workers were trustable and kind. Some were not. The hardest part of my job would be unloading the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing happy/smiling customers.
good,"Go to the stock room, pull out a u-boat and run as much stock as possible in a timely fashion."
good,"cashier duties "
good,Learn be more  fast pace  good management team great co workers hard part of the job working buy your self work as a team is best part of the job
good,another time please I have nothing else to say at this time. there is no more that I want to tell about Dollar Tree as they unfairly terminated me
good,I started here as a FT ASM and quickly was promoted to Store Manager. The company switched planning ideology a couple times during my time here. Sadly it was never consistent and each field level manager would not hold the same idea as another. One visit after another you would be told something different from the last. Associates are told to be treated as expendable and managers are not managers. SM's are just unaccounted for payroll to push the product out and do sets that the store cannot afford to do themselves. Promise of promotion dies quickly when a new manager takes over the area. District Managers in some areas go quickly with a lifespan of just a couple years max.
good,"My job duties were backup cashiering, cleaning and stocking shelves. When it was truck day I helped unload it and stock the shelves with the new merchandise. I helped trained the new employees. I also helped during inventory."
good,"At the beginning of the shift I would count the safe and make sure it was at the correct amount. Make sure my cashier was assisting customers( if not at shift change). Then I would start stocking. Always stocking to be done. I would also be on register for back up if needed. Clean the store, put the re-shops back on the shelf. Count down registers, make deposit, then go home."
good,The job was fun because of the environment around the other employees. They made it enjoyable. But the hours that were given did not fullfill the needs for me to support my family of four.
good,"Good place, it teaches you good skills about good warehouse type work. Nice people, and clean place to work in."
good,"The work place is a good, friendly enviornment. The store manger was a reasonable boss, and the store was well staffed."
good,stocking shelves and counting the safe opening n closing the store going to the bank to make deposits and get change
good,"Working in retail requires plenty of multitasking, agility and good work ethic.  Although it had its challenges I did enjoy working for this company.  It taught me to be organized, to think outside of the box and to be ready for anything that gets thrown your way."
good,"The store itself was okay. I wasn't there long enough to have any good times or bad times. Though, the thing I disliked about working here was, I was on call, and that they called me maybe twice a week. It was my first actual paying job but, it wasn't a good experience for me."
good,"Over see cashiers, check in vendors, do register audits, make change, make bank deposits, recover store, do put backs, do damages, stock and clean"
good,"Lack of communication is a frequent problem. Demands open availability, and doesn't pay very much."
good,Dollar tree was my first job and I enjoyed it. I became the primary cashier shortly after I joined their team. I maintained speed and accuracy.
good,Typical day would consists of unloading the inventory trucks. Then stocking the inventory that was shipped in. Provide customer service and cashier help when needed. I learned how to process the cash out at the end of the night. Management was unstable. Co-workers were very pleasing to work with. There wasn't anything about this job that was hard to me. I enjoyed coming to work all in all.
good,a normal day of work would consist of getting the store ready to open such as turning registers on counting the safe and the cash drawers. open the store write out the daily task on what was going to go on that day what was going to get stocked what was going to be cleaned up condensed for new product. Me and my co workers got along great we were like one big family. The hardest part of the job would have been if we got in a lot of freight sometimes it was hard to fit it all out.. The most enjoyable part was making my own schedule and just going into work everyday...
good,"You are just given an ""apple seed"", it is were you're duties and task are written for that day that you are working."
good,worked cashier stocked shelves unloaded truck kept store clean.
good,"Just reorganized aisles everyday. It was the hardest on truck days because that was the heavy workload. It was most enjoyable on truck days with only half the truck needed unloaded. Management was very understanding. Also, coworkers were very friendly. I learned that all work is not exciting"
good,"Ok place to work, wouldn't make a career out of it.  It's retail but managers do everything.  No budget for hourly employees."
good,very hard work but overall a very good company to work for and move up
good,This was a typical retail experience. Part time employment with up to 20 hours a week. My co-workers were easy to work with and the pay was minimum wage.
good,Rude assistant manager. Never trained me the right way. Stock room was always messy
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is fast paced with lots to do. From assisting customers to checking in vendors, stocking shelves, receiving freight and doing projects. I learned a lot as far as how Dollar Tree operates; The replenishment process, the hiring process, and the inventory process. I enjoy working with my staff and delegating tasks to them. Most work pretty independently and requires little or no supervision. The hardest part of my job is freight processing; Replenishment is based on sales so if we have a huge sales week then we have a big truck coming. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my associates and assisting customers."
good,I like every job that I have. I only apply for the job knowing I will get it or not.
good,The hardest part of this is working with only one cashier your whole shift. As a freight Manager my job is to empty as much as i can my back room and replenish all aisles in my store. With the store selling everything at a dollar or less you can expect a lot of traffic. Makes it hard to do your job when yu are back up for the cashier
good,Great company to work for if you enjoy a challenging yet rewarding career.
good,"I walk in, clocked in, made sure my register is working and ready to go. I sign into my register and wait for customers. i learned to be open minded with customers, understanding and be as helpful as i can. My manager is was pretty cool and professional and same for the co-workers. The only problems i faced with this job is when i need to call out for personal reasons my manager had no one to cover my shift so they decided to cut my hours which was not necessary so i quit. What i enjoyed the most at my job is the positive energy when you walk in."
good,"I have learn how to be leader at certain point. Making strategic decisions and to remain top of the task."
good,A typical day at work consisted of a start up meeting of our nightly goals and finding out who would be doing what. I learned how to use the management system in the short time I was there unlocking items finding out where they are and where to place items as well as registering items into the building as the manager does. There was only one hard part to the job and it was making production because some items from door 57 would go all the way to the other side of the building making it hard to make your nightly numbers. I personally like driving for the mods it was a lot easier to do and kept me busy.
good,"The management was fine.  Was a cashier, had to count my money and make sure the drawer was even."
good,regular cashier duties. Stocking shelves and recovering the store at the end of every shift.
good,"Way too much work with too few associates. Even with this being a retail trend, dollar tree takes this to the extreme"
good,I only worked part time because nobody was aloud to work full time. The breaks were only ten minutes long and no where to sit. There were only two people in the store at all time and it would get extremely busy. You would get fired if your drawer was less or over $2. No healthcare.
good,"I really didn't like it there but I like the people there. I would cashier, and I would make sure that everyone is happy. There is a lot of things that was good and there was a lot of things that were bad as well. The manager was really nice"
good,a nice easy going place as long as you do your job then it was a great place to work at.
good,The company was too focused on expanding. It failed to consider the toll that took on its workers.
good,"Greet costumers, stock shelf's and clean store floors if on closing shift"
good,nice place to work and grow and to understand how things operate
good,"A typical workday was punching in, getting on the register, counting the till, and assisting customers as they needed. I learned how to stock and re-stock shelves when the store was quiet. I learned how to do night deposits on late shifts. I worked with pleasant co-workers. The hardest part of the job was not working enough hours."
good,"Nice place to work, easy work, just unload truck & place freight onto sales floor in correct departments. Not a huge store, so fairly easy to keep straightened up."
good,"greeting customers, ringing up Purchases, handling returns, and answering questions about products, policy, and services"
good,"It was my first job so the expirience was invaluable. The managment and employees were easy to work with, and very patient to teach new things"
good,There is always work to be done.  No boring shifts. Great customers and employees
good,"This particular location had a Store Manager who was very egotistical, into himself, boastful, unprofessional and definitely lacked consistency. The job was good and so was the company however the experience wasn't all that great due to the Store Manager who couldn't seem to be professional at all times."
good,A place where customer service  and stocking is your main focus of the day.  As managment you do have daily duties that must be completed along with the opening/closing of the store daily.
good,Good place to work.  Hard work with limited manpower.  Bonus structure is good.
good,"1. Cutomers being impatient."
good,opening the store greeting the customers. how to schedule the employees ordering stocks. patience and kind. good listeners and respectable. closing and making sure everything been done. seeing smiles on the customers faces.
good,I worked with many customers and got help from the managers if a customer has a question.
good,The employees who worked there were helpful at times. The hardest part about the job was stocking the shelves. The job was not that hard.
good,"the hardest part of the job was when trying to help more then three people at a time when short staffed."
good,"Due to the fact I am a student and was at school a lot during this job I opened and closed every shift. The shifts were almost five hours and the only people working were a cashier and a manager or assistant manager, never more than two employees at the store. Managers give a lot of attitude to customers. Every manager would leave on a smoke break when a big crowd of people came into the store. I would have to greet every customer that came through the door and had to ask each customer if they would want to buy an item for the troops. The hardest part of the job was the stocking at 3am whenever a stocker was needed and since they did not hire enough stockers they made the cashiers do it. The most enjoyable part about the Dollar Tree was talking to the customers as I was bagging their groceries."
good,I would ring people up when they came with their items. I greeted the people as they come and go. I helped when needed or asked with no problems.
good,"Dollar tree was a job I held while in high school. I was mostly a cashier, but also stocked items."
good,"Come in and write down a plan for store needs and conditions.What I learned is this is a process. I also learned that you need a plan in order to be successful. In management you  need a good team.In order to have a successful store your team has to be motivated and willing to go beyond and exceed expectations.Management has to be a good leader. When recognizing co-workers skills it makes them work harder.The hardest part of the job is when you don't have a team to back up management.The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone is on one accord. When you have a good team,sales increase,customer count increase, and also the team increase.When co-workers care about store needs and conditions,store becomes very successful."
good,I mostly operated the cashier and dealt with customers. Other times I was responsible for organizing shelves and keeping the store in order. I learned a how to handle customers and how to work quickly and efficiently. Management was a mediocre. Managers were friendly but didn't help with training and could be rude to employees. The hardest part of my job was learning the products in the store and knowing where they were located. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast-paced environment.
good,I really enjoyed working with dollar tree. I learned a lot such as customer service and cashiering.
good,Move items here and there cleaning and the typical store duties
good,"Front cashier, Prepared and cleaned for the day and for the next shift, provide customer service, open and close store, stock, and count money."
good,"Company is not very employee oriented, its all about the higher ups!"
good,"Working here was a wonderful opportunity. For the first time I learned how to be a cashier, it was easy it took me a day to actually get a hang of it."
good,It was a good experience working in this company. I learn many things and the supervisor were very friendly and very considered with the personell.
good,"It was an okay place to work. "
good,"I was hired by this company and sent to a store at a remote location in WA. State to ""fix"" a broken store.  Long story short I was very successful in doing so and was sent to another store in the Portland, Oregon area.  I was also very successful at doing this. "
good,I enjoyed working for them and they always treated me fairly
good,Completed my internship of 120 hours. This internship position took place over the summer of 2011.
good,"It was very fast paced and demanding but I enjoyed it most days"
good,"Days are fairly normal. They go by quickly with the work load. Management keeps you abreast on issues, however having things in writing keeps them on track."
good,"I love working at dollar tree, my store manager were a great help with me get promotion. They treat me really well and were very understanding to my needs."
good,there will be more to do than you can accomplish in a day and district manager has unrealistic expectations.
good,It was okay. I went from a cashier to an assistant manager in a short period of time. It was a pretty good experience and I learned how much work goes into making a store run properly.
good,Recover store help customers find products out costumers. I only work when they have no one. So they call me to help them out.
good,stocking in the morning and putting items were they belong  I’m still on time for any meetings or important tasks.
good,"This company has a million reasons to employment there, the items. There so many of them. And you constanly picking up and placing items in the right isle and shelves. But I enjoyed working there, it was ery time consuming. You are always busy."
good,Flexible work schedule. This job worked well as part-time while I went to school and also worked another part-time job. Management was acceptable for the position.
good,"I loved working for this company.  Being an assistant manager, you were responsible for all floor employees as well as stock and counting the vault at designated times of the day.  The people I worked with were very great people.  I learned alot about management as well as how to run a retail business."
good,I worked for Dollar Tree for almost 13 years it was a good experience in a growing company. I  learned everything I know in retail from this company. Dollar Tree has know loyalty to its employees and demands far to much for what they are willing to give
good,"Typical day was busy, and hard to complete assigned tasks."
good,Being a cashier. how to run the cashier. my manager wrongly fired me so. co workers were nice. truck day at first was hard.
good,associates super friendly and you will find great deals every day!
good,Main focus to meet customers expectations and relate to their needs
good,Nothing much to say here! Did normal daily task with no feedback from management.
good,"Have learned to see what my strengths and weaknesses are, and how to use them to enhance my strengths and work on my weakness areas. Most of the time a typical day would be going to the bank and picking up deposit tickets and verifying the amounts, getting the cashier some work to do in between customers, usually having to find someone to fill in when another cashier calls off, getting endcaps set to planner, doing mark downs, checking for recalled items or pull and holds, checking for emails, resetting departments, cleaning shelves, keeping the floor swept up, doing a cashier audit, and counting down drawers, checking in vendors, making sure all the signage is up and in the right place."
good,"I have learned many things working in customer service, such as dealing with customers and trying to always keep them satisfied.  The customer is always right!  I was part of management, completing paper work, counting money all the time, dealing with customers and keeping store tidy.  My hardest part of the job was dealing with unsatisfied customers!  The most enjoyable part of my day was having everyone happy, makes the day go by so much smoother."
good,"Definitely fast-paced where you get to know the regulars by first named basis.  Fast advancement if you're interested in becoming up to a store manager.  No price checks, unless an item is less than a dollar."
good,"As soon as I get to work, there are always people lined up ready to get their things checked and move along their way. I learn to better deal  people and having more patience for customers as well as co-corkers. The hardest part of my job is going in. After my break, things tend to get better. The best part of my job, there is always something that happens."
good,"It was a typical part-time high school/early college job."
good,This is a great first job for me. The employees are all very welcoming and the days go by fast. I enjoy being able to work with the customers.
good,Values oriented. Associates believe in the values. New Management has unrealistic expectations for their associates.
good,"Well I started as a temp cashier during christmas shopping time (November-December) And well... I was thrown behind the register with no experience, however I was taught the basics. But I was never taught about the price changes, which almost cost my job on the first week. But it got better later on, however I was getting stressed working there, being told what to do differently by four managers. Since one manager left, it got harder for me for some reason, and I end up being terminated for one penny over the drawer amount of 3$ Sucks, but I wanted to quit anyways so it was fine, kinda  ^^;;"
good,As a basic beginner job. Team Associates work together for the customer
good,"I say OK because there is no way for me to advance in this job. I would be a sales associate forever,"
good,"worked with a lot of co worker , work with money deposit,shocked order thing that need to be ordered. some of the management team was okay and at the end of the day you had to put go back up and front everything, that was the hardest thing and try to get out at a good time."
good,"Typical day at work involves cashiering and/or stocking. Management is great but there aren't enough hours to go around at the moment."
good,Dollar tree was new and business was slow during my time there. I learned register skills and store upkeep skills. Management was rocky but ok for the most part. My coworkers were all older adults who were very kind to me. Hardest part of the job was maintaining store cleanliness during crucially busy times on my own because of understaffing. The most enjoyable part was learning the skills i learned to take with me after my time there. 
good,there was so much going on managers were irresponsible I was doing work cashiers should not be doing people there for a year did not receive their raise managers were picking favorites and hiring family and friends
good,I work along side with my store manager to make sure that everything that needs to be done is completed in a timely manner. I am the merchandise manager which means that I am in charge of all the freight that comes into the store and planning for where it will all go and how it will all get out.
good,"Open and close of store on a daily basis"
good,"A typical day would be me arriving ten minutes early to find out if there is anything i need to be aware of during my shift. once on the clock I would greet all customers to make them feel as welcomed as possible. From there I would make the daily announcements informing our shoppers of our great deals and item on the week. Then, continue checking out customers and building a relationship with them, because someone is more likely to come back if they like you as a person. Finally, I would prep items such as bags,cash drawers, ect for whomever was next in."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the work environment with Co-Workers.
good,"A typical day of work includes cashiering, maintaining the front of the store, cleaning windows, blowing up mylar balloons, assisting customers finding product, stocking, and always moving around. I have learned great patience and being very fast on register. The hardest part of the job can be the rude customers, the sometimes lack of supplies, and working so hard for minimum pay. I enjoy the common customer that comes in often who you build good relationships with. I also enjoy helping customers find what they need. "
good,The most exciting part of the job was receiving new products weekly. Displaying new merchandise was definitely a pleasure. 
good,a job is a job..low hours and hard to get by. 2 years working and no raise.
good,"Cash Handling assisting customers with all their needs."
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"Dollar Tree was a stepping stone in my job resume."
good,"It was a very social workplace. I had to deal with upset customers at the register and maintain a calm disposition as I helped sort out whatever problem they had. I was responsable for counting all the money in my register drawer at the beginning and end of the day. I learned all aspects of being calm and curtious in the face of other people not likewise. My coworkers were all friendly and I got on with management very well. The hardest part of the job was the fourtyfive minute bike ride to and from work in the rain snow or blaring heat. The best part of the job was asking customers about there day, that little bit of social interaction made the job enjoyable."
good,"When I first started working there, the managers weren't very friendly or willing to teach me. I tried my best to pick up on what I was supposed to be doing, but I was apparently doing things wrong. At that point, being new, I would've expected someone to show me the ropes so I could be more efficient at my job, but no one did."
good,"Learned how to use a basic cash register, learned how to help customers with needs."
good,"Easy pace "
good,"This job was not as much I thought it would be, they pay little and work you like a mule. "
good,"Oversee Cashiers, Keep Appropriated Amounts Of Money In Registers, Close Store, Oversee Cleaning Crew, Nightly Bank Deposits."
good,A diverse organization and tenure workforce. Great opportunity to grow within the merchandising and field operations sector of the business. 
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is very busy. Customer satisfaction is the number one concern for this company, and we work hard to make each and every customer feel welcomed and appreciated. I have learned that Dollar Tree is one of the fastest growing companies in the nation, and thus needs to be more heavily equipped with available hours for employees to be able to work fuller shifts. My crew is energetic, yet many times get discouraged at the amount of work versus the amount of employees and available hours to get the job done with. The hardest part of the job is trying to make up for the lack of hours offered by corporate. I am constantly coming in on my own time off in order to get all the work completed. Because of this, I generally average about 65 to 70 hours per week. Unfortunately I do not believe that the salary compensates for the amount of time put in to this job. The most enjoyable part about working at Dollar Tree is the fact that I am able to stay active throughout the day, which makes me feel alert and energetic rather than sleepy or lazy. I do enjoy a fast paced environment that allows me to exert physical and mental energy in order to maintain my overall health. "
good,"Worked on the register,cleaned,answer phones,help customers find something if they needed help."
good,"New retail enviroment, management skills challenged at all times."
good,"Nice place to work. Friendly, helpful staff. Nice location."
good,i worked for dollar tree for about 8 months maybe longer. i started as a cashier with the typical worthless shifts. i was soon primoted to asst manager with even more worthless shifts.
good,I like Dollar Tree they have the best deals ever. However while working here is fun it doesn't pay enough.
good,"cashier , stock , customer service. the managment was pleasent"
good,A typical day at work is making sure my shelves are filled and ready for customers
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree would consist of either being on register all night, or walking up and down aisles, and seeing what is out of place or in the wrong aisle. I learned better patiences and how to manage money at a young age, I also learned how to handle different kinds of people. There weren't very many co-workers, but the one I did work with was laid back and diwn to earth, so it was a nice experience. There was no hard part to my job. The most enjoyable part of my day at Dollar Tree, was when I interacted with the costumers."
good,it sucks... a lot ... indeed wants me to go into more detail so here... they pay u little work you hard and penny pinch... my store has good people but that doesnt matter whatsoever if im still eating ramen noodles 3 times a day.
good,hard
good,"Part-time employees not paid enough, so turnover was high. When sales are down and hours need to be cut the manager would have to pick up the slack and work more than required hours."
good,a day there would go like this clean my station up ring up the customers put out merchadise bring in the stock clean up the alse
good,"Has good management, lazy staff. Drama between staff members was very frustrating."
good,"My responsibilities at the Dollar Tree included Cashier, Customer Service, Housekeeping, and Merchandising. I completed daily tasks assigned by management. My previous retail experiences came helped me to fit right in with the staff. I was interviewed by the Division Manager to become an assistant when availability occurred. The hardest part of the job was recovering the store after closing in the allotted time. The Dollar Tree carries a multitude of items and nothing is over one dollar. That was great!"
good,I was employed at Dollar Tree when I was in high school. It was a great place for me to call my first job.
good,"Assisted with store stocking, floor-sets and opening and closing procedures.Courteously greeted customers and efficiently process transactions within busy fast-pasted retail evoirments (and on phones as well) operated cash register, scanners and computers to itemize and total customer purchases, collect payments and make change"
good,learned a lot from this company. helped me grow as an adult in the business world.
good,"Hard work isn't appreciated nor awarded by HR or district managers. Almost 3 years and no raise, but a job is a job. My co-workers are awesome and the work environment is colorful so never a dull moment."
good,This was my part time job at nights and on weekends while working full time for Mansfield Ob/Gyn so it mainly consisted of manning the main cash register and returning items that had been misplaced. My managers and co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of my job would have to be coming to work after and eight hour day at my other job but it was enjoyable because it helped me save money and I had fun while doing it.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, the people i worked with were all very nice people."
good,"I learned how to work the cash registers and help customers, I come to work and check if my co-workers are in any need."
good,"Not to busy in the morning. I learned how to work the cash register and how to use the box crusher in the back. Never really wanted to become friends with co-workers. I made my work my main priority. The hardest part was when it got busy, but there was nothing I couldn't handle. I enjoy working with people."
good,"You get to work and never know what you will be doing. There are chances to learn all aspects of the distribution process. Management is ok but sometimes are lazy and get others to do there work. Very fast paced,and physical. All in all it's a great job the associates are great people."
good,Disorganized location
good,I really liked working at this store. There was some management issues though.
good,No one there was over joyous to work. Wasnt really a fun place to be.
good,"Working as a cashier at the dollar tree store was alot of fun and really hard work,getting ready for the day by counting my tilt and making sure i had the correct amount of cash to start my day,making sure cash register area was clean and free of clutter,well stocked with bags and ect...assisting customers by cashing them out or answering any particular question to the best of my knowlegde,at times stocking special merchandise,promoting sales of a certain item of the week,making new friends in my coworkers and customers,learning certain key aspects from the managers on how to do certain things in the store,displays or specialty items and organization in key areas."
good,Liked always having something to do.Co-wokers were friends.Worsed thing being sort handed.
good,This job was really easy I learned how to work and get along with alot of different people it changed my views on life I become more mature and independent it was a great experience .
good,I was an assistant manager for dollar tree for about 4 years. I liked the people and liked what I did there.

Ability to motivate, organize, and direct the work of at least 30 and more subordinates and communicated clearly and persuasively with customers while observing the actions of my employees and patrons on a continual basis to ensure the personal safety of everyone."
good,"it can get very busy thru out the day and night, found most of the managers easy to work with"
good,"Cheap products always draw in a crowd. Store front is always busy. Needed co-workers for constant back up. Enjoyable ""regular"" customers."
good,"Usually my day was pretty good, the days I threw freight were a lot better than days I had to be cashier. Most of my co-workers were fun to work with and most of my supervisors as well. Best part of the job was throwing freight, the hardest part was to keep my cool and not quit when management would start playing games with me."
good,"Stocked shelves, and cleaned up at night. Got people to donate toys and food for drives."
good,Had a lot of busy days. Learned to basics of a cash register
good,"Key holder duties - Opening/ Closing store, Preparing to open store- Counting the safe, preparing the cash tills, store walk, chaecking emails. Writing out duties for all employees/ managers, Stocking and replenshing sold merchandise, receiving merchandise from different vendors, ordering in sold merchandise, assisting customers with there questions and complaints, assisting employees with exchanges and returns, Training employees."
good,it was ok. like every place they will squeeze everything they can from you and not give a thank you
good,Sales Associate/left voluntarily for new position at Pronto Connections
good,In the mourning I would open up my cash register and count my teal and put the money in the cash register and start the register.
good,"Typical day started at 11p.m right to work no cell phones, no playing around work was first and foremost. Learned to use a scanner connected to a computer on the lift to show where the product was to be placed. Co workers were great, hardest part of the job was the emotional toll it took on my daughter after my mom had past, constant movement was the most enjoyable part of the job for me."
good,Dollar tree..is a good for students that would like to work at.
good,The job was very boring. I learned more on currency but thats all.
good,"Its a good stepping stone, store policies lack more attention on the store needs and cleanliness before trying to catch up with Walmart."
good,"hardest part of my job was switching residents, and homes, or residents moving out of my area of work. i love helping others that was the best pert of my job."
good,had fun working here but nobody really ever came in which made the day go by slow
good,"I had worked here as a part time job. Was offered the titly of Management, but not the pay."
good,"The job was a fast pace which i liked ,but the pay was not good."
good,"Great way to meet a lot of interesting consumers, had a blast getting to know many of them."
good,Enjoyed my management and the new merchandise.Hours were not enough though.The days went quickly because it was always busy.
good,"At this job I learned a lot of things about working in retail, such as merchandising, ordering, stock, cash ect."
good,"My typical day at work was sign in at the register, I looked around to see if my help was needed if not, I would immediately start to clean my area and put things in there place. Most of the time I would stand at the register, the store was packed most of the time. When I was free I would start to unpack the boxes and start filling in the shelves. I learned how to talk to the people and handle difficult situations, I learned how to handle the money and how to properly answer the phone. I also learned how to stock and take inventory. At the time that I started working my boss went on vacation so I had a supervisor , which at the time she was twenty-two and I was fifteen. She made it a little difficult to work but I ignored it because I needed the job. The rest of the crew was nice and helpful they made it an enjoyable place. The hardest part of the job was probably putting up with the supervisors attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment, the fast pace that made the day go by quick, being around people, and doing the work it was not hard I liked it."
good,"managed employees,balanced registers daily,payroll,inventory,provided customer service,directed and supervised employees and responding to inquiries and complaints of customer"
good,it was cool working there always busy but not enough hours but overall i liked working there...except during seasonal
good,"I like working at dollar, but its not enough hours for a week. The co-workers are okay and the manger are is fine"
good,most enjoyable part of my job is making customers happy.
good,I would work overnight to stock shelves and clean up the back room from the previous truck
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree would consists of counting my till, organizing my work station, handling cash, and greeting customers."
good,"Some days I worked open to close. I learned to order, do timesheets,unload trucks,stock shelves and how to work with all types of customers.Most time management was good always had great co-workers. Hardest part of job was dealing with unhappy customers.Most fun part was having the customer smile as they left the store."
good,"The Dollar Tree was my first time experience working eight hours in labor, also this job had a limit of hours one could work which was only forty hours."
good,"Team work is having the right employees, then you know the day will be successful. Our goal was to boost overall sales and we did that on a regular basis. Our clientele always returned because we catered to their needs. Having low cost items on stock means selling an abundance of inventory to make the profits, meeting that goal, meant staying on our toes with stocking ordering and customer assistance."
good,"Very buzy, working hard, stocking merchindise, working cash register, credit cards,"
good,"On a normal day at Dollar Tree it can be very laid back and easy going. But then we have the rush when everyone seems to come in at once and your not able to move from your register. The managers at the store I work at are easy to get along with and I enjoy working with my co workers, I get along well with everyone. The hardest part of the job is trying to remain calm and professional when a customer is rude to you. To me the most enjoyable part of working there isbuilding relationships with the customers and co workers."
good,> Open of the store
good,"There is always something to do. Learning about displays and set-up was exciting. the people that I worked with were understanding and fantastic. Their wasn't any challenge I couldn't handle, the best part of the job was changing the displays when the holidays changed."
good,It was a good job to have . I had good hours and I could of advance in the store as manager. The hardest part of the job was when we unloaded 1200 items and it would be just 3 workers. The co-workers was easy to get alone with and we went through a lot of managers. I learned alot with this company and it was a good place to work.
good,"Worked with people from all walks of life. Always something to do, never a dull moment."
good,It was great. They were very friendly and had very flexible schedules.
good,I hated it. The store manager was rude and didnt know how to talk to people. The co workers were nice.
good,Pay was comperable for job. Great staff. Fun environment. Enjoyed helping customers.
good,"Shipping Associate, efficiently loaded trailers in a fast paced setting. Moving freight from one truck to another truck. Accomplished goals of doing at least two trucks a day"
good,I assisted customers with their needs. There was no hard part about the job and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public.
good,A typial work day would be checking out customers all day and stocking in between customers if possible.I learned how to damage out damges in the computer system and print the report out.Certain managers had attitude problems that I had to sometimes overlook.I was ok with most of them.My co-workers were nice and friendly.They all loved me.I made them laugh every time I came to work.There wasnt a hard part of my job when I was there. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people every time I work and talking with the customers.I made them smile also all the time.I'm just a people person.
good,I have worked her a month because I lose a credit paper I guess they never found it. But I thrught I was a great emlpoyee. I did my jobs they asked me too and then some. Ect..
good,Dollar tree was overall a good organization. It brought new jobs to an area that at the time was very limited. Management worked hard at creating a safe and friendly work environment.
good,Working at Dollar Tree Store was a good expirence . i wasnt so pleased about the few hours and days i was given . a clean and safe enviorment very well managed. Overall the workers were very plesant treated me equally and with respect.my experiance working at Dollar Tree Store was pleasent.
good,"This company has good benefits but you have to wait a period of six month to receive your benefits when you are full time employee. The company do not have vacations, they call it part time off, they give you time off paid when you qualify. If you quit or get fired and if you have accumulated time off the company do not pay that time. The company just started to train the managment staff only, I hope they concider to have all the employees train that will be a good approach to keep their employees for longer periods of time and to avoid turn over in regular and managment staff.."
good,"Since the sales each week pays the employee's paychecks, I'd rather have a different job. Employee's are to much into competing for hours and no one can live off of the small amount of hours they give."
good,It was OK to work there but on Somedays I will be there by myself working while the manager did other things got a little irritating sometimes they got a little annoying because I would be the one getting cursed out by the customers
good,It’s a pretty fun place to work and sometimes fast paced. They pay minimum wage and you get about 15-20 hours per week. It’s the kind of job you get as a second job. It’s a fairly easy job and you work in up to 5 hour shifts.
good,"Very Poor Management And/Or Leadership Skills... Unfairly Judged. Not Much Consideration Taken In Their Lack Of Leadership, And, Security. Not A Very Strong, Nor Held Together Company... Beyond Poorly Ran."
good,Its a great store to shop at. Hours are flexible and pay is normal. I have been employed there for sometime now and I never have an problem with management . Everyone is treated fairly.
good,Custers are so rude. They dont have alot of cashiers availability  stores be messy cpeople treat stores so horrible throw stuff where it dont go n open n damage items like people it cost $1.00
good,"The pay isn't enough in general. But mostly all the management are very cool and down to earth. Hours are flexible just request when you need off. Most of the customers are great as well. If you dnt have enough hours at your local store, you can always get more at another store!"
good,"En todo el tiempo que estuve laborando en dollar tree, segui todas las normas y reglas del lugar nunca tuve ningun problema con mis compañeros ni supervisores, tuve un buen desempeño laboral."
good,"not good for work life balance or if you have a family (management)"
good,So I worked at Dollar Tree for a year then I  got pregnant and when i was about 4 months i started having complications with my pregnancy and had to be hospitalized and then after i had my baby i tryed yo go back to work and the main manager there forged my signature and said that I quit and I did not quit or sign anything papers
good,DollarTree has a very demanding schedule which is flexible when you have a dedicated staff to assist with the day to day activities.   There is opportunities for hourly associates to move up within the company.
good,Dollar tree should be aware.  That they have hard workers that give there time and days to them.  Dollar tree works you hard but dont pay well as far as cahier. Who take on a lot of the feedback from customers.
good,"i was a assistant manager for 6 months and was given the job of doing all the go back , and reporting broken items that was meant to be done by the manager before but she had done none of the work so i was always struggling to keep up."
good,"You do Most or all of the work being a store Manager, very hands on. They only employ part time associates outside of the Full time Asm so be prepared to work hard."
good,Working here can be a bit difficult and different sometimes you aren't treated with respect and you get left out. I was very young when I worked there but I will not apply.
good,"worked here during high school. management at the time was not great. would only be me and one other person for the closing shift. if you like cashier work and minimal supervision, its alright."
good,Management changes rules per moment and friends with certain employees outside of work so has special treatment inside of work no matter job description or title a person is suppose to be and has first say over scheduling her own schedule
good,I learned how to deal with different customers personalities on a daily basis. It was my first time being a cashier which was new ti me but easy for the most part
good,My typical work day is you sign in using the number they provided on the back of your name tag after signing in you go talk to the manager or assistant manager and they will provide a till and they will tell you what cashier station you will be working at and then you would work until your mandatory break which is two fifteen minute break and one 30 minute break which is your lunch and after your break is up you sigh back in and resume your work day
good,"My manager is very flexible with working with my schedule but also knows I can be the first person she calls to fill in when someone else calls in. No more than 4 or 5 hours in a shift and minimum wage. Our store is mostly well organized  and kept neatly, I do my tasks throughout my shift, not a hard job at all."
good,Don't plan on staying there it's not worth it unless you like it. The manager was fun and easy to get along with but some of the customers were just rude just because they think it's just a dollar tree
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was ok, even though I didn't have enough hours in fact that's one of the reasons why I quit cause I didn't get enough hours and the Dollar Tree I used to work at was a part-time job. So now I'm looking for a better opportunity that I can have more hours besides part-time."
good,The pay was not good. It required alot of work for what they pay. It required heavy lifting and alot of heavy restocking. But I liked the cashiering it was fun to talk to customers.
good,I would come in depending on my role that that i would. Their be cashier or i would do fright or i would stock the store. But mostly i wold do a little of everything.
good,Very fast paced especially around holidays and seasonal events. Must have patience and ability to deal with the occasional dissatisfied customers. Willing to be a team player and quick on your feet. I believe that the company does a good job of encouraging promising employees opportunities to advance.
good,I liked the job for the most part but once I went from cashier to assistant manager my store manager took advantage and had me closing 4 to 5 days a week. We had 2 other assistants but it was always put on me to close. And store managers are supposed to close once a week and she never did.
good,"A typical day at work would look similar to me being a cashier, my peers occasionally going to restock the shelves. the most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to the customers, simply because of how laid back a lot of the customers were. Even when the customers were upset, none of them really made any attempts to take it out on me, and when it did seldom occur, an apology was given. Despite this, it was always interesting to see what the customers would get, from a 100 glasses for a dollar each to a complete set of 25 mops(for what i cannot possibly tell you)."
good,"At first it was kind of unfamiliar because I didn't know where certain things went,but eventually someone helped me out.I started with helping unload a truck,then was pointed in the direction to where  I was to set up boxes for the next shift to begin shelving the new products."
good,"A typical day would be checking in vendors stocking opening and closing the store. Unloading truck on truck days. When closing the store ,recovery was supposed to be done, mopping and sweeping store. Counting the drawers and assigning registers on the different shifts and also counting the safe."
good,"Advancement is possible but you have to work very hard for the opportunity. Compensation is good. 50k-60k annually. Plan on working long hours. Typically 60+ a week. Fun environment. High paced. A lot of responsibility. Not much help from higher ups. You're responsible for all aspects of the store, highering and fireing. Training. Oversee freight flow. Ad sets. Maintenance. Merchandise sets. Limited payroll"
good,Dollar Tree was a great place to words. It was my longest job to date. I learned a lot got great experience with customer service. This is where I learned to have phone etiquette as well as in-person etiquette with customers on a daily base. I learned to manage my time well also
good,The group of cashiers I worked with were great. Had a good repore with them. The upper management wasn't very professional and they were lazy. There were as always conflicts of interest.
good,"Dollar Tree was my first job and got me some experience in the retail world. It was a good first little"
good,It was a good place to work for the people where very nice and it was sad that they closed the one in Newport that's the one I worked at .stocking  and cashier ect
good,"dollar tree is a great place too work. they work around varying schedules and cicumstances, though much theft and very aggressive customers constantly come in."
good,"The workers there are very nice and welcoming and there is no problem adapting to the work flow at the store. It is a very multi-task requiring job, for there are many roles to fill and do. The hardest part of the job would probably be stocking because of the amount of stock that is brought every week. Management is nice there, especially with newcomers, and will always have something for you to do. I, and many others, have learned to work together as a team and learned how to deal with situations involving customer service and satisfaction."
good,I don’t recommend any body work in there because they strictly only hire seasonal people but then again if you’re in management then yeah go for it. Get paid weekly
good,I enjoyed this job but I left in order to improve myself. I was just getting my business off the ground so there was a conflict of interest. I left on good terms. However I would not want to go back and work there again. It was a great opportunity. I am thankful for it.
good,Overall I like working there but $7.25 is not enough to make to support my family. easy going workers and it was nice getting to know different customers
good,Great company to work for just had poor management when I work there. Wonderful products selection. Loved the seasonal switch up. Online ordering is a plus
good,Has long as there is team work in this type of workplace things can get accomplished. So just keep that in mind and everything will be great at the end of your shift.
good,I love working there.The Job is easy .All it need is better store manager's.When first started working there the first manager I had was in 2016.My first time work there.I met Ms.Sherry she was the best manager I had .Ms.Olga lied in said I didn't come to work when she had a assistance manager to call me to not .
good,It wasn't too bad but the pay made it 100x worse you get payed paid wayy too low. like high 200 to mid 300s as a part time worker. The job is easy though.
good,"The week before a holiday, the work can be hectic. I learned where everything was in the store. I did go backs and straightened out the shelves. I helped cashier. My manager was fair, and we would go to the manager for decisions we couldn't make."
good,The job at Follow tree was a good job for my first experience. I've learned to always count your change back. To face all the merchandise and making sure there's no gaps. Doing the go backs were pretty fun finding our where everything goes.
good,"Dollar Tree is not a place you want to work at. Biggest issue: low pay. Only stayed because Manager was super flexible with hours, needed for college."
good,As a manager it was my job to sure customer needs were taken care of and product from the back were pushed in a productive manner to increase sale profits.
good,"I was hired part time under the terms that I am seeking full time, for me it is just helping financially until I find something better. At my location the only full time employees are the management, the shifts are 4 hours, the pay is low for my state, it’s $10.00 per hour, but the managers are friendly and helpful but aspectations are high for the low pay, every employee is expected to perform multiple tasks and run register."
good,Disciplined organization that is consistent in following the company's mission and offering incredible values to their consumer.  Offerings at $1 are unmatched at other retailers.
good,"If you work in an area with low minimum wage, the turn over is high, and it is hard to find good employees that can do the work during the times they are needed. Especially if your store is near other businesses, you will not get quality employees and will have to work harder to compensate for lack of help."
good,"management was relaxed but it was indeed very fast and hurried on days the trucks arrived and unloaded . very hectic those days. fast fast fast paced and pushed for time. other than that pretty laid back if ust simply did your job and didn""t looy gag"
good,I walked into Dollar Tree with a small list of past jobs and job descriptions as well as some skills. The store manager looked over it and said he would contact me. He called me later that day to set up an interview. I went on the interview two days later and was hired that day. i was excited to start working two days later.
good,Working at Dollar Tree was something I did while attending graduate school.  It was not the best place to work but it allowed me to pay the bills while attending schools.
good,Great place to work if you have proper guidance from management. Opportunities for advancement was consistent. Fast paced but welcomed and doable. Fun
good,Dollar tree does not seem to care about its employees lives outside of work. They give store managers minimum hours to schedule cashiers and assistant managers causing there store managers to have a very hefty work load and do not compensate there store managers well for what they are expected to do.
good,Dollar tree is an exceptional employment opportunity with room to grow in the company along with a competitive salary and a safe and friendly environment.....
good,"Although Dollar Tree is an enjoyable place to work, I am having difficulty surviving on my salary. If the right job came along, I would seriously think about leaving Dollar Tree."
good,Dollar Tree is a good job to develop customer service skills with it being a fast-paced environment with demands from multiple customers. It also lets one adapt good communication skills with others as well as a positive attitude when put into stressed or very restraints positions. (i.e. inconsiderate customers.)
good,"Fun place. Stressful at times like any job."
good,"Very fast paced. Room for advancement. This job does require,that you are on your feet at all times. Just make sure you pay attention to details. I really enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day starts off with putting your drawer in the register before the store opens or when you swap out with another cashier. When you're not ringing up a customer you need to be either doing go-backs or cleaning you're (sometimes the bathroom). Breaks are really short, they are 10 minutes if you work less than 5 hours."
good,"nice start up job for teenagers 18 or older. friendly environment. helps me with my income. nice manager. very close to my home, right accross the street. was working in mt laurel store, transfered to pennsauken"
good,I won't  ever work dollar  Tree  again.  The upper  management is  very inconsistent with work projects.  And the stores are trash  by customers  all the time. Every day  the shelves and floors  were trash. The bathroom  distorted by  the customers by leaving  humans  waste on toilets and floors.  And turn around and  complain that the bathrooms needed to be cleaned.
good,I really liked my coworkers but my manger did not work with my school schedule and I had to quit for like two months and that’s the reason I left dollar tree to go back to school.
good,Dollar Tree does not provide the amount of hours you need to run a store properly. Therefore you must work them yourself. Managers are asked to work as many hours as it takes but not allowed to employee people for more than 15 hours per week.
good,i have to lurn how to work by myself and make sure all the works are done and work as a team if it's possible i get a lot of confidence about me having a job.
good,My experience at Dollar tree is good and fair. At first as a cashier I started off with 7.30 an hour with 12-15 hours a week. I only received more hours if and when other associates didn’t want to work their shifts. Now as a part time assistant store manager I have a title as a part timer but work as a full timer with a part timer pay unfortunately.
good,It's a nice place to work. I've learned more customer service/money management skills here. It's very fast paced and easy. We wish that we had our own security and custodian however. We rarely have rude customers. All of my employees are like a family to me.
good,relaxing  day   how to work good with other management was good    was very pleasing time hard to going home the most enjoyment  is meeting new people
good,"This is a good place to work, good people, decent work flow, the pay just isn't the best, if they offer 9 and hour and a few benefits you could definitely make this a career it's just hard to make something out of it when you only get paid barely over minimum wage and the cost of living is so high here."
good,"The place is not run very well. With only two people working a shift, the place is very disorganized and dirty. There's a mice problem and there is no security while working a shift. Everyday you will encounter questionable people due to the location of the store. The hardest part of the job is attempting to fulfill all your responsibilities and tasks with very little tools or time to aid you in doing so."
good,"They're struggling to hire, cant find compotant workers when they do hire. Increased the wage, only made the lazier of the group show out."
good,"made sure employees were doin ok then went to office to make sure time clock was ok and anwer any emails,made schedule, went out to the sales floor walked o see what need to be done made a list and went to my assistant to see if any questions, and started on my work end caps any cleaning sesonal change or if i needed to hire it was a good job i liked the fast pace and making sure my store was clean and full and made my sales"
good,"i like the fact that they give me a task, then i am left to do it.  i like things organized and done right the first time.  we only get 4 hour shifts, but we get a lot of merchandise on the shelves."
good,I was only seasonal & worked overnight so I didn't work when customers were there so it was calm enviroment. But if had offered more in pay i would work there. It's heavy lifting & hard work so should be $9.00 hourly.
good,I enjoyed working at dollar tree for the most part but I want to experience a different environment where I can have the potential to learn new things besides ringing up hot pockets and birthday cards.
good,"Easy job to do, good second or first job to have, fair and friendly mangement staff, flexible scheduling, mostly part time positions available, few full time positions offered."
good,Loading trailers non-stop could be strenuous. The job had many opportunities for overtime on the busy season. The company also offered Voluntary time off and would allow us to leave early if quota was made for the day.
good,I loved my job at dollar tree. I have awesome coworkers who were friendly and kind. They invited me with open arms and made the job fun even at 3:00 am shifts .
good,Arriving to work late makes the day difficult. I learned anything that on the floor already bring it up to the top of the pile. The hardest part of the job was getting certain merchandise from the back and bring it to the front and everything what just came in put it on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting off.
good,"Since Dollar tree was my first job, I learned a lot of things that I never knew about. I learned how to use the registers and learned how to use the phone, how to count money, how to adapt and work in a fast paced environment. I was able to ring people up, be in the register and clean all at once. you learn to multitask and find something to always do. The hardest part of the job is the holidays when it becomes overwhelmingly busy and stressful because you have to work and move twice as fast. the easiest and most enjoyable part of the job is when you stock or run go-backs."
good,"I rather enjoy the time spent at both of the dollar tree branch, I had rather memorable mentors who taught me the ins and outs of customer service very well,  I will never forget the understanding that I was shown at the Dollar Tree :)"
good,work as a cashier and also face and organize shelving/merchandise. I enjoy my job as a cashier as it is very nice dealing with the customers. Dollar Tree customers are very pleasent.
good,Not to bad to work at but you hardly get any hours and when new people come in you get put on the back burner so all the new employees get all the hours.
good,Great job for college students they will work around your schedule that's needed you don't have to worry about late night hours scheduled will be up in time
good,Typical shift is 5 hours and part-time only....very limited full-time positions. Run cash register and stock shelves as well as straighten and re-shop items customers did not want or put in the wrong home.  Hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time and irritable customers (not a lot of them).  Most enjoyable part of the job is when customers are excited as everything in the store is one dollar or less.
good,"whats great is that you always have something to do. there is a to do list given to each employee on what they are doing for the time they are there for.  "
good,"I liked working at the Dollar Store in Sterling Park Va. The customers were friendly, my manager was nice and the cash register was very easy to use. Why I left was because the hours and money were awful and there wasn’t that much of an opportunity for advancement."
good,They are not a bad company to work for. Not much room for advancement and the benefits aren't the best but its okay. Nice job for someone just starting out.
good,It was fast paced and busy and you meet a lot of different people and the store has great products for a good price and you can find whatever you need in the store
good,I would load trucks from back to front...worked there for three years got up to 16hr but I had some family problems and had to move back to Texas..i miss working there...now starting over
good,Cool work of place and kind people working there somtimes there hours bt then it's not.you work on ur day off. Then when its work they dont need you its a typical day there
good,I enjoyed providing customer service and interacting with different people. Good team to work with. During the holidays are the most challenging. Not only do you have to do your job doing your transactions. You have to pay attention to your surroundings because of people stealing.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty easy, it can get busy quickly and it can get slow quickly. I learned a lot of good socializing skills and communication skills working there."
good,Strive to competitive wages and focus customer satisfaction but need give enough payroll for cleanliness and more training for new associates. Prices excellent . Overall enjoy working with company for last 13 years.
good,I would say that job I got laid off. the store just opened and I was chosen to work there but I wasn't chosen to stay there but I was there for 3 months but moved to a different location to help remodel it. but wasn't something for me.
good,"Although we were not a very high volume store we stayed pretty busy with things to do. With lack of hours available we had to work harder to make sure things were done when they needed to be. This includes cashiers and managers stalking most of our freight during business hours along with our other typical duties. Management was pretty good about trying to work with all of the employees schedules and wants aside from giving full time hours. In the store I was at only two people were allowed to be full time. The crew worked together pretty well. We learned what each person we worked with was best at and usually assigned them to do tasks that they had strength in (this is what I did and most other managers). "
good,very slow paced environment which requires very little physical ability. a well managed establishment and very team oriented which has good management with supervisors that are very able to help with problems and respond quickly to need.
good,To be honest it depends on the manager and the team. If everything works good you are going to have fun. But if the team and the manager is not good . Go find another job. The place can be toxic.
good,not much to say just had new manager and DM take over store. not alot of hours for the employees to work. it is not a place of business to raise a family with.. only starts employee at 7.25 per hour... no one can live on that..
good,"you cant totally trust all of your management."
good,a good company to work for if bad co-workers and managment is a make or break for you but I didn't like what I was paid at all. It wasn't enough to live off of in my area but my co-workers and management were easy going and super enjoyable to work with. fairly easy work days with the exception of holidays and rushes.
good,Dollar Tree gave me the opportunity to get 5 years of management experience. My store manager at the time made it a great place to work. I was able to learn the skills that allowed me to be the best assistant manager for my employees.
good,"Great transition place its peaceful and I like what I do although its a contracted position. I'm just passing thru when the contract is over I will be moving to Charlotte, NC"
good,"Since working there gain experience in retail, learn bout more on what to do on somethings never did before.... It good work evoriment but depending on hours is what how long or days they need you for the week"
good,Pushing product is quick and sometimes a little stressful. Lacks the tools to help finish projects. Demands to much from their associates to pushing all frieght out.
good,"I worked  at a store in Seattle for almost two years.  I loved being a cashier at my store and never planned on leaving.  My store manager burned out and quit.  The manager they brought in was lazy, inappropriate, mean spirited, deceptive and just generally unbearable.   I stayed for 6 months but after the 2nd time he upset me so bad I broke down in tears, I quit."
good,"Great place to grow and excell in management if you like.  The days are long and could be 6-8 hours of coverage depending on co-workers, always busy. The workplace is what you make your work environment to be.  In other words you set the pace management or not.."
good,I liked working there cause i got to meet new people there. The work environment is fast paced but flexible to deal with.The pay is okay for the job and they work with you.
good,From my experience at working at three stores it's not fun. Some managers are better than others. They are often under staffed an busy. There never seems to be enough people working even though there are plenty of people on the schedule. Shifts are crummy. People are often grumpy. Its very hard to work part time at dollar tree and another job. Your break is scheduled an often I barely had time to eat and go to the bathroom. Some stores the manager will let you go to the bathroom quickly but most require you to wait till your break. You get 10 min for a break. The only job I recommend would be a stock person. They are only closed on Christmas for a few hours. Even when there was a driving ban I had to go to work. Corporate won't let the managers close the store for any reason. I worked in the blizzard an multiple times the weather was not safe to be in and almost got into several accidents going to and from work on days the store should have been closed.
good,But I kept the store clean and was a cashier I left the job.cuz.if money problem and rude manager. I love my customer they were the only reason came to work
good,Im a cashier at the east capital dollar tree i stocks thing in the store also the job is very easy work part time their the works are very helpful and also do what they have to do
good,When I first work there it was fun  now it’s for serious. You have to be there on time and get the work done. It’s a lot of work. You have to be ready to get to work.
good,Long busy days at this job. You do get breaks but it was rare that you actually sat down and got to enjoy your lunch or dinner without being interrupted by your co-worker needing assistance on the register with ringing or a customer looking for a specific item.
good,"Overall great place to work not too stressful great with availability, Nice employees and Pleasant work environment just not enough hours to go around to support a family."
good,"• Provided excellent customer service by performing various roles while working the cash register"
good,"The Working Environment Was Decent And So Were The Managers And Other Co Workers But They Didn't Pay Enough Really And The Worst Part For Me At Least Was That, Even If You Were A Single Minute Late; You Got Written Up. 3 To 5 Of Those And You Get Fired Which Sadly Happened To Me."
good,"Decent benefits, lack of hours. Work is not hard. It is very hard to balance your personal life due to not having a set schedule. The lack of hours definitely made it difficult to live"
good,Its a great place if your a mom with a busy schedule. Due to my little ones they are very flexible with my hours and they understand. If you keep them in the loop about why you cant be their and they know that your a hard worker when you are available they appreciated it.
good,This is a good place to work you will always have fun never a dull moment...You can get to choose how many hours you want to work. The management will work with you if have another job or go to school.
good,"This job was pretty easy, The corporate management sucked but the job itself wasn't awful. The customers could get weird but it was easy to get promoted and I got good hours. Pay sucked."
good,"he manager above me was awesome but the actual work wasn't great, unloading trucks piece by piece and then getting the products on the shelf directly after was hard. HIGH turn over rate, i was constantly covering others shifts, I woud say the person i worked with was the best part"
good,very fast paced only and always scheduled 4 hours a day about 16hours a week. The downfall is not enough time to finish the assignments assigned to you
good,"You have to go and spend time there and find that the place is anointed and blessed. I'm a prophet, but I cant begin to explain how the Lord moved there. There was one of the places that when something tragic had happened to me, I saw Him in the midst of it all, like He always is in tragedies, close to the broken hearted."
good,"You work the cash register and stock when the people are not checking out at your line. The management stays and help you when you need some help, the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the people. The hardest part of the day is when they don't work together or being short in hours."
good,"Dollar Tree is growing, new things to get experience on.  Very busy which is great. Advancement is hard due to the longevity of employees, which is a good sign.  Pay, not that great."
good,I loved this job to begin with nut as time went on changes were made without notification. Management struggles with hiring and keeping employment. Stressful work environment.
good,"I didn't really have anything to compare it to honestly. I did a lot of hard labor jobs during the summer as a kid. So getting hired there, nothing really changed but the part when I had work the register."
good,"Not the best environment, somewhat old school and backwards in tech. Would like to have had more money for the time spent at the DC but budgets at this company are tight."
good,Do your job and don't goof off. If you miss a day it is counted towards you no matter if it's an emergency or not. Only way to not come to work is if you schedule a day off sick or not.
good,"It was a nice part time job for a stay at home mom.  It worked well around my children's  school schedule.  It was busy in the store, and always fun to see the new merchandise come in."
good,Working for Dollar Tree encompasses many responsibilities so you must be prepared for this kind of work. It's a quick paced environment where you must be ready to move quickly and efficiently
good,"a typical work day at the dollar tree, everyone calls out and leave you by yourself with the manger and then the store becomes very stressful and then at the end of the night you do this thing called go backs and since your the only cashier your stuck with 16 different baskets full sometimes even buggys and the management is okay"
good,"Ready for experience, that will help me gain & further my knowledge with your help. I'm active, always aware of my surroundings as well as my performance. They say I'm out going well rounded with grounds of potentially becoming more then i have already."
good,"I was a cashier. I got  to stock Shelves, help customer, clean the bathroom and vacuum the entire store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,."
good,"Come in prepared to work your tail off! The job is what it is, you learn how to properly set things to a planogram, how to restock, and properly life things.  The management and employees have high turnover.  The hardest part of the job was to ensure you were able to make up for people that wouldn't show up to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to see what merchandise comes in."
good,"Dollar Tree is a fun, colorful store to work at, pretty lenient. Other employees are understanding.  However the dollar tree i worked at was very unorganized. It was hard trying to find supplies that needed to be put on the shelves. Other than being un-organized i had fun while it lasted."
good,The environment in the distribution centers is a mess. Management cant seem to figure out how to respect employees and get things done. Very dirty place to work in as well.
good,"It was cool, easy to learn how to use the cash registers, flexible schedules i think, cool supervisors, very busy most of the time, friendly coworkers"
good,cashier on a daily basis. Stock merchandise and help customer with products. Make sure cashiers and stockers follow policies and procedures. Cash out cashiers and balance safe at the end of the night.
good,Hours were cut on a consistent basis. Required to stay over or leave early on short notice. Often had to pick up the slack of other workers. The work load was heavy compared to the amount of time given to complete tasks.
good,I liked the business but it lacked enthusiasm so I would recommend more happy people than just plain people and more security there. Better pay as well
good,Being a store manager I was required to work to make it happen didn't matter how many hours you put in .  It became difficult to manage life outside dollar tree
good,Dollar Tree was a decent place to work part-time. It was always busy with stocking shelves and assisting customers. Getting full-time hours was difficult.
good,Lack of benefits and hours. Management is not very attentive. No career progression opportunitites. Managers are always late. No compensation for sickness.
good,I love working for Dollar Tree. My position dealing with stock and warehouse keeps me really busy! I enjoying doing what I do. I just need more hours and more money. Willing to move to better and explore other things.
good,Has it's slow moments but for the most part it is busy. Always a productive day at dollar tree. I learned how to communicate with people and how to help out. Hardest part of the job is maintaining clean at all times.
good,Enjoyed my time here even though I was not there long. The people were pleasant to work with and the manager was understanding of most situations. Would recommend.
good,It was laid back but I felt as if I was not really learning or benefiting working there. It didn't really teach me much but was a routine where I know what i'm going to be doing.
good,"Work hours were long and I had to cover shifts for all other people who would not show up, etc. This kind of work demand took time away from my family, which is why I am seeking a new job."
good,"It's a very good beginner job. I would recommend to students, but it is not something for older adults. The pay and atmosphere is unsatisfactory for anyone more equip for entry level jobs."
good,"Dollar Tree was an okay job to work at, the only problem is they do not have enough hours for employees to work. I would recommend this job to anyone who wants to work but doesn't care about the hours."
good,"A typical day at work could differ from day to day, one day I could being doing paperwork and stocking shelves and the next I could be running the cash register or unloading truck. I learned how to take deep breathes and have patience. I was Assistant Manager at one point however, I much rather be a cashier in retail. The hardest part of this job was the rude customers for sure. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting along with other employees."
good,Department is a high stress department and too much is put on each individual.  No way any one individual can accomplish the workload placed on them.  Also have to take duty cell phone and laptop on your day off
good,Cashiering isn't just staying at the register. You are expected to stock shelves and get a lot of product out on top of watching the registers in order for the customer to be served in a timely manner.
good,"Worked effectively in a teamwork environment, management was very helpful in ensuring we had all the resources required to accomplish the work assigned.  I had to read bar codes using barcode scanners to ensure the product were placed in the correct location. I moved product around on pallets using forklifts and hand dollies. I enjoyed working in an team environment with other co-workers to accomplish the assigned task, but also enjoyed completing my own assignments on my own."
good,The management is great and the employees. The work environment is great but can be stressful at the same time. But overall it is a great place to work.
good,"First job in Canada, culture was good but hours were very few. Salary was minimum. People you work with was awesome, I left because of better opportunities."
good,Over all good place to work for only downside the pay is low and you never get over 25 hours a week . good if you wanting it as a part time job or just to make extra money.
good,I got moved from one dollar tree to another. I assisted staging and building stores. After the store were completed I would work the register and maintain the storage room
good,it was company that helped me make a living. i enjoyed dealing with customers and meeting new people. dollar tree gave me my first management position.
good,I enjoyed working for dollar stores especially when I frequently shop and love to save when I shop. Relating to all walks of life when they walk in wondering what else they might find for just one dollar.
good,Really loved my store manager. He was the only reason I worked there so long.Only got paid 7.35 per hour so that sucked pretty bad. They messed up maternity leave so i got kicked out of the system.
good,"Not high pressure. Pay could be higher. Office politics are very real. Managers are just those who have stuck around, not necessarily the best. Hourly employees can expect to be treated different than salary (I was salary)."
good,"Busy store to work. Was trained, description of the job was brief, and the pay was low. Did not find an opportunity for advancement, training was brief, and the work day was productive."
good,Fast and efficient.... Great team players.... Allows opportunity for growth and advancements.... Friend friendly environment..... Management is awesome....
good,Steady paced and well inventored...I just started this week and I like the energetic attitudes surrounding the establishment already. While talking to the manager i was left with the impression that theres plenty of opportunities to advance.
good,"I love working for the dollar tree, but I wish they would expand hours. everything about working at the Dollar Tree is great except for hours. There are no full time positions and you get 16/hrs a week if you're lucky"
good,The overall work week is okay.  Only Management is allowed to work full time.  Can be a little dicey when you have to deal with difficult customers.  Best boss I`ve ever had.  Employees treat each other like family.
good,Working at dollar tree is cool I would just like a higher pay rate being as though I have more responsibilities it’s time to step it up too somewhere that I can advance in the workplace
good,i would go to work and i start my emails or i would find out what is going on with store and then i would go to back of room and start stocking the floor before we open the store then i would take safe moneny to the back then come back to work and if the casher would need anthing i would help them out too
good,"These is a good store, super busy, alot of movement going around. Strick manager, good person, alot of duties to do at the time. Alot of costumer service going on even if your not asign for that position."
good,I can say that I have learned a lot while working here. It is very fast paced and very demanding. We have a small team with a big job but together we get it done. Most people that work for Dollar Tree work hard and go getters but it can become overwhelming at times.
good,Dollar Tree was a slow paced and gave only 20-30 hours . The management was really good and fun working with . The environment and Co-Workers were reallu good to work with.
good,It was a great place to work. They had too many employees trying to be a manager. They had one store manager and about four shift managers. The shift managers didn't know what they were doing.
good,"Dollar tree was not the best job that I have ever had, it could have been so much more better but the management wasn't the best and it just didn't workout for me."
good,"Needs to give more hours"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. I just needed more hours and more pay. I loved the environment. Fast paced and learning new things. Manager was easy to work with.
good,"Not a great life work balance"
good,Dollar Tree taught me a lot as far as my Management experiences but their upper management is flawed and they don't have a lot of employment benefits to gain.
good,"Dollar Tree isn't just work for me, it's a second home. I have been at dollar tree for 5 and a half years and not just at the same one but, about all of them in Durham, and been treated with the same care and respect all 5 years."
good,"It's an alright place to work, relatively calm sometimes. I never had an issue with an employee or customer there. Everyone gets along just fine. Plus the food is good and cheap."
good,"Stock and scan products on shelves, Lift boxes on the shield, Unload trucks,	Sort products in the backroom. Do my work with careless and professional with manner. Helping each other like a family. The hardest part is to operate the forklifts. The most enjoyable is the encouragement of our team members."
good,Does not pay well at all. Anyone is hired which leaves a lot of room for good and bad employees. It depends on your manager whether or not the store you work at is organized and runs well.
good,"Overall great people to work with. You are able to move up quickly towards management. However, they don't give you things as promised. And don't train as they should."
good,"Cashiering for Dollar Tree was very educational and peaceful.  Even during the holiday season, I found this job to be quite easy.  Customers were wonderful along with my co-workers."
good,"An average day at Dollar Tree would include returning product back to it's respective place via ""go baskets."" I learned that a company can cut costs by putting multiple items in one bag. Management was just fabulous. Workplace culture was ok. The job was not hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was trying convince customers to buy things they otherwise wouldn't have thought they needed."
good,I loved working with dollar tree. everyone was very nice and so was the management.. i liked the fact that managers just you to get you work done. When i show up i always see smiles no negative people. The growth of the company is awesome to.. To become something better there by earning your way
good,It is a great place to work if you are on a tight schedule or have a second job. However the work is very stressful. It is not very hard just heavy trucks and light stocking hours cause stress.
good,"My opinion about Dollar Tree is it was very exciting working there. A typical day at work for me was walking in with a bright smile and getting straight to work. Greeting customers, checking out customers and stocking. I learned that teamwork is a key to everything and even though you can do your best a incident that happens in your life is not good enough so you just get terminated and its apart of life. I learn that you continue to strive for better. The workplace was very clean, neat and organized. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers. Without them my day wouldn't be as joyable, and cheerful as it was. Management did their part and was very helpful."
good,"Dollar Tree Distribution is a very fast paced environment to work in.  They expect a lot out of their managers, as they should.  If you stick around a while, and perform they will promote you quickly."
good,"Very nice and warm welcoming customers. Nice employees and management is great and understanding. Always busy , no down time.expect inventory all the time."
good,"The pay is low and you no one is full time. You are expected to work as though you are paid well, by this I mean the workload daily is tremendouse. I had a great Manager and coworkers and enjoyed it most of the time."
good,This job is very easy.  It's mostly stocking and customer service.  Everything is the same price. It's really easy to move up in positions.  I will recommend this job to anyone.
good,management works with you whenever you need off. the work days go by quickly  at times it can get hectic but overall I enjoy the job and my co-workers.
good,"typical day includes, ringing up customers, assisting customers, occasional balloon blowing, completing restock, making sure you aisle is fully stocked."
good,"Nice experience. Learned new things, such as building things. Putting things together and basically interior designing. every one was nice and friendly, just not enough work hours. No real benefits either."
good,I mainly worked at the register. Lots of customer service experience can be gained. Not a hard job at all. Typical day consisted of checking customers out and cleaning up or restocking your area when there weren't any customers to take care of.
good,It was a good place to work i only worked there seasonally but i would work there again if i could i would have rather had a full time job maybe they will hire me again
good,"As it grows bigger, I think Dollar Tree has changed (necessary, I am sure).  As they add more outside people to the mix (at executive levels), it has eroded the culture of the company."
good,"Dollar Tree is overall not a bad company to work for, however managment went threw several ups and downs leaving employees questioning thier responsibilities and customer care was not a first which i disagreed with."
good,I worked in the Caribou and Presque Isle locations while I lived in Northern Maine. Both were fabulous. My work mates were always kind and quick to help me correct any mistakes that I had made. I did over nights here as well as cashiering and early morning. Not a forever job unless your in management where as the pay doesn't get you very far. Would recommend for someone in high school or just out.
good,"I started with the company in October of 2014 and had my own store by August of the next year. Job advancement is awesome for dedicated workers, as they're a very fast growing company. They expect a little much out of the store managers as far as not being able to have that work/life balance, but it's not bad pay."
good,I enjoyed working for the dollar tree I just did'n't like that their was no real advancement for growth opportunity within the company I loved to work with the customers and make sure they had a great customer servicer experience coming and going
good,Being able to help someone. Managers were very helpful when needed. The most part i enjoyed about the job is  i got to scan the items and helping them find what they needed.
good,"It helped me learn how to remember math more than I knew."
good,"typical shift is opening or closing store, following proper procedures, this stores customers aren't always the most pleasant. lots of stocking and cleaning."
good,Always put your customers first . Be open to communicating with them for purchases purposes . remain a professional clean store at all times .
good,"I personally have had a mostly good overall experience at this company. I learned how to comfortably work with money, as well as how to correctly deal with costumers. I do suggest the company invest in security alarms and cameras, since having a lack of security reinforcement does make is a soft target for possible theft."
good,"This is a good job for someone just starting out. Who is just on their own, doesn't have a family to take care, someone who just needs extra cash every two weeks. Its a stepping stone type of job where you can get a good  learning experience and working with a team. You do have chances for advancement if you put the effort in, but i wouldn't consider it as a life long career. They don't take in the consideration of how hard their employees work or get to know them on a personal level everything is just business and if you don't get to such a certain amount hours get cut. Most people work two jobs that work at dollar tree because its not anything you can live off of."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy I learn how to be polite the management is very good my co-workers are good at their job, the hardest part of the job is people missing work and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting great people."
good,"Did cashering Nd stocking.  Had to help with deposit.  It was a good place to work at,  but not to many hours and the pay was OK but could be better for all the work you do there."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree was a great experience in customer service 101 and learning the art of multi-tasking. "
good,"I like my job at Dollar Tree. The hiring process is very simple. It is a very good atmosphere to work, like any other job it get hectic at times but we all come together to make the situation better. The only thing that is displeasing to me is that we get paid very little to nothing, but I don't complain because I'm grateful for my job."
good,"Typical retail environment. Sales floor, Operations, and merchandising expectations are in place. The main challenge to this particular job is Merchandise delivery. You will receive between on average about 900cases and 2800 cases a week. expectations are unloading 500 cases an hour with probably 3 associates unloading. you have 48 hours to get entire delivery to sales floor. The other main challenge is store recovery depending on where your location is."
good,This Job requires patients and extraordinary customer service skills. I began my day with stocking shelves and ensuring that all tills are correct and ready for to go. I use my customer skills to assist any customer and  manage operations whatever that might consist of. I have expanded my customer service skills and have learned how to de-escalate very tough situations. Dollar tree is centered in a heavily populated area so multi-tasking and being vigilant is a most.
good,"On a Typical day at work in the Dollar tree i would walk in, punch in my register get my station cleaned up and if i had customers i would assist them. if not i would make sure everything in the front area was clean and stocked properly."
good,"Involves a lot of tedious activity in stocking and offloading merchandise. Enjoyed learning to read variance reports on product and department sales. The freight team is okay but could be better if certain policies and procedures were left to be enforced at discretion.The hardest part of the job is finding the mental focus involved with handling an overstocked backroom and accommodating 2300 piece trucks every week. If week is slow on output, it could cause for a difficult undertaking of daily tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is being left alone to do your work. There is no cases of micromanaging present and I for one love the feeling of being trusted to do exactly what you have been hired to do."
good,"I have been a loyal employee of Dollar Tree for over 6 years. I love the work and the customers. Due to it being a dollar store and due to increased concern over profits after Dollar Tree bought Family dollar, the company has tried to increase productivity and decrease costs. They have tried to decrease labor hours during the receipt of trucks, decreased the amount of moneys spent on everyday things like carts, sending carts from lower volume store to higher volume stores. These ""cutting cost"" measures have been implemented and stress the employees and Management teams. The increased required productivity requirements stress out the employees and there is not enough financial compensation for the amount of work required. There is career advancement, but the compensation and amount of work required is not worth the advancement. I have been asked by 3 District managers to run my own store, but I don't see how I could have any life-work balance working over 70 hours per week and getting paid bellow 30,000 per year. It is not worth the back-breaking work. The only joy I get is the happy customers and great associates."
good,"Dollar Tree is a good store to have anywhere. The vibe is calm and you can meet some friendly faces. My favorite part about dollar tree is that any food, snack, or drink is $1.00 even."
good,Retail store that requires a lot of time. It's more hands on than managing.  Gives a individual the chance to show his all around management skills show its  experience.
good,"I liked working at Dollar Tree,I liked my co-workers & most of the managers.I think it takes a certain kind of nanager to make the store a success.But the company ordered too much merchandise,ehich often times nade the store room a hazard.When the district officials came they made things worse & they seem to want & demand ridiculous & sometimes unnecessary tasks."
good,You would first come in and get your register ready for the day. Then check the shelves and bins to see if they need restocking before the store opens. Even make sure that items are on the right shelves or in bin; make sure the floor and counter is clean. I learned how to stock shelves and bins. The management is okay. They can be pretty much laid back as long as you do your job. My co-workers were great when you had a little down time. Trying to watch and make sure no one tried to steal items while also checking out customers. I loved meeting new people.
good,Overall it isn't a bad place to work.  Some departments are better than others depending on the leadership.  In general the work/life balance isn't optimal and the expectations are to put the company first.
good,"From when I first started working for dollartree we went through 3 different store mangers, we went through 6 different managers. The store and people were just not a healthy work environment. Managers were stealing and doing things they weren't suppose to do. The hardest part of the job is that I was mainly the one person they can count on to come to work and pull doubles and I was a triple threat."
good,"Dollar Tree is a great job for high school students, but it not a good career. Short breaks and short lunches and also under staffed"
good,It's a job with career potential. New upper management  so things are unstable  right now but it has the potential  to get better  if you can tough it out
good,"I enjoyed working for this employer, because the team was very reliable and helpful. The typical day at this job would be unpredictable and full of good vibes. Easiest part of the job was meeting and greeting customers. The interactions are what makes my day better. Best job so far."
good,"Assist customers on finding certain items in the store. Stocking inventory that come in every Monday that come on trucks. As a Cashier, I was able to handle cash, count it at the end of the shift and take it to the bank to deposit"
good,Dollar tree is a very fun place to shop and work. You can alwats find what you want and need at the dollar tree. The work environment is very nice.
good,"The scheduling system yields a different schedule each week based on the needs of the store and availability of the associate.  During my time here I have expanded my abilities and improved my confidence in interacting with both customers and co-workers.  The hardest part of the job would be constantly adjusting your personal life around the weekly schedule, I would not assume this is an easy task if you have children or are employed elsewhere.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the chance to interact with customers and other employees in what is ideally a positive environment.  There is high demand for adaptability and patience, you will never be responsible for just one single task or aligned to one job description."
good,"the day begins with a department shift meeting. This is where the goals for the day are discussed. Then everyone is assigned to where they will be working for the day. when you arrive in the mod you grab the labels for the level you would be picking, then you begin picking boxes and labeling them."
good,a typical day at work is help customers get what they need. i learned how to handle many. i manage not to get mad when a rude customer come along. my co-works were nice. the hardest part was working at a fast pace. getting people in and out.
good,"I was a cashier and I didn't work there very long but a typical day was running the register, helping to stock shelves. I learned how to run the register there and handle a till. Co workers were ok I worked with the manager a lot because it was around holidays and I was willing to work holidays and weekends. The hardest part of the job was the short breaks for long hours. I enjoyed it there though because I was good with customers and I enjoy people."
good,"I always opened the store. Made sure that store was ready for open. Making sure that my co- workers had a daily action plan, so that they will know what is expected for the shift. The hardest part about the job was safety. The most enjoyable was Christmas parties."
good,During the day the store tends to get very busy. I learned how to be very patient with customers.The employers and managers were very friendly.
good,"Coworkers and customers are the best part of the job. You meet interesting people. The work is easy if you are a cashier or stocker. Assistant managers work the hardest because you are so pressed on time getting things done, especially in a higher volume store. Also for part-timers, good hours are not guaranteed."
good,"great place to work right out of high school  or just to get some customer service experience, people are great you meet so many different people the deals are amazing they have great stuff"
good,Dollar Tree is a company that always has jobs or their staff to complete. This company pays minimum wage to their employees. The management of the store is divided into store and assistant managers. The assistant managers will always make a person smile. The hardest part of the job is trying to get stock from the cardboard boxes they came in onto the shelves that have not completely emptied yet. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely developing better social and communication skills through customer interaction.
good,"A typical day at work is usually slow, as sales are down due to near-by construction zone. I learned how to communicate more effectively by always greeting customers, striking up conversations, and always being polite. The management was hard-working and dedicated and the co-workers were generally friendly with me. The hardest part of the job was that as a result of low sales, management was forced to schedule one cashier per shift. This made work difficult whenever business did happen to pick up. In retrospect, being a lone-cashier prepared me for future employment in high volume businesses. The best part of the job was interacting with the regular customers that come in on a daily basis and conversed with me everyday."
good,I learned how to provide the best customer service on the go as well as keep product ready and available for customers which is what I consider the object of the job.
good,"I enjoy working at Dollar Tree and helping the customers that come in to shop, but I would like to see more advancements in the company."
good,as long as you have a team of fast working ppl the job will get done but there where plenty of night that it moved so slow because the people were moving very slow but overall the job was fair
good,Honestly this was a chill job. But that's mostly because of the store manager and the store I worked at. She was and is still crazy good at keeping the store in great condition. And on top of it all organized. No other dollar tree could ever compare. The pay and hrs are beyond terrible though :(
good,"In all my experiences with retail. I have to say Dollar Tree is the easiest. There was not too much on the registers to learn, but definitely make sure you aren't short on your register, its something you manage at the end of your shift. Generally its not a huge store."
good,"work environment was okay. learned about health and taking care of your body, Management was always changing. Not a very stable job"
good,"Everyday is a challenge working with customers. At any time any type of situation could occur. I learned to stay humble at work , smile , make sure my customers are happy and serve to their highest expectations. A job is not about making friends , but I do like working as a team with co-workers. the hardest part of my job is working with those who don't want to work as a team. The best part is building relationships with my customers."
good,other then the messes left by customers this was a good job. Easy sicne everything was a $1.00 very easy to tell people what thigns cost.
good,6 12-14 hour days are typical during peak season Aug-Dec. There is a lot of associate turnover and there have been 4 GMs in the last 2 years.
good,"A typical day was spent bouncing back and forth between stocking freezers and ringing a cash register. Accepting deliveries was the main focus of Mondays and Thursdays. Most of what I learned was about rotating stock to maintain freshness and accepting freight deliveries. I liked my co-workers and even the management and had many opportunities to converse throughout the day. Unfortunately, it was only part-time and did not provide any benefits."
good,"Dollar Tree keeps its prices low by cutting costs where it can. This includes not hiring as many full-time workers as other retail outlets. Jobs there tend to be seasonal, unless you can distinguish yourself to the management. The workplace can be pretty casual (though attempts at professionalism are made, such as mandating uniforms). For a part-timer, there is almost no chance of easy advancement (the managers I knew had been with the company for a minimum of five years.) Perfect for folks down on their luck or college students looking for extra cash."
good,"Good pay for retail, except for PT associates. Upper management less than desirable. Room for advancement. Benefits are good."
good,"It was a fun place to learn and a good learning experience, I think I have really grown since working there and I would not left if were not for family emergency in another state."
good,"The management is very supportive and understanding of when you need days off, but isn't overly eager to give them. At this job, I've learned how to work better with a team, and all of my coworkers are very team oriented people. The hardest part of my job would probably be when customers ask me where an item is. Seeing as I don't spend a lot of time on the floor, I only know where popular items are located."
good,pretty and smooth day to day. minor cleaning and keeping area neat. management was great to get along with. good pay for a small part time job. fun and enjoyable working  with customers.
good,Dollar Tree is a great company in general. It is a fast paced fun but educating environment. Good people who help you succeed in your goals.
good,"It's a very physical job. Normally I would have to load three doors at once. The pay for the job isn't good, only 3% raises after a year, but the benefits are amazing. This is the first civilian job I got that offers free medical benefits for you and your children."
good,"I really love this job as it is my chance to work with a variety of people."
good,"Work days here always went very fast, enjoyed my customers and assiting with their needs, however, never felt I could advance my position."
good,A job with an easy going environment with friendly workers and customers but with poor job advancement and compensation
good,Dollar Tree is an enjoyable place to work at. Must be willing to put time in to move up ladder of command. Benefits are only received if working fulltime.
good,I gained good managemet experience working for Dollar Tree and had good advancement opportunities to move up to the store management positions.  The hardest part of my job is not having enough time to spend with my family.
good,"As a cashier at Dollar Tree, I spent a good amount of time handling money at the cash register. I learned to be quick, efficient, but also careful with money and ringing products up. What time I didn't spend at the register, I was stocking retail on the shelves, cleaning both inside and outside of the store, making sure that we were presentable for future customers. The management at Dollar Tree was very straight forward, and the co-workers were assertive and ready to get tasks done. The hardest part of this job was long hours on my feet with little to no breaks in between customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking new merchandise and attending to customers who had questions or concerns."
good,"Unload truck, get stock on the floor for staff to stock shelves. Order for upcoming deliveries. Hiring and terminating staff, training staff to show them what is expected of them and teaching them how to excel at their job."
good,"I really like working at Dollar Tree. It's the best job I've had so far! My managers are really understanding and down to Earth. A typical day includes going in and ringing up customers and stocking when there are no customers. The only thing I dislike about the job is the short breaks; they're only 10 minutes. Other than that, the job is great."
good,My favorite day at work is that it be faced paced. I have never really had a problem with fellow employee's or employers of which some are still my friends. The hardest part of the job was the lack of hours offered now by the retail companies.
good,"This company was fair. Break were given when they were assigned and off days were clearly understood.The biggest problem was being short staffed or having employees that did not care. As a manager, I was left alone several times in the store to be a cashier and recover the misplaced items."
good,Peco is very fast pace job and it has a lot of room to grow and it also a place that you will learn that team work can really make a difference.
good,Great company to advance within. They have a great attitude when it come to allowing people who love what they do to advance.
good,.Working at the Dollar Tree was a good starting job to learn about standards and customer service.Had a lot of fun at work but also made sure to complete all duties required. Since everything is a dollar you do not have to try selling the items they sell themselves so you can focus on helping customers and keeping the shelves stocked and straight. This company definitely keeps you on your toes.
good,"The dollar tree I worked for was rarely busy, and offered a lot of down time to focus on cleaning. However it was my first job, and the first place I learned to cashier, and I was very fond of the management."
good,"Monthly planner books to follow, daily emails and weekly conference calls to ensure set dates. Scheduling to get things set is up to individual store managers."
good,a typical day for me is insuring that all customer that is assist are satisfied with the services provide and if any assistance was needed that i would provide professional service. i have friendly co workers and management personal who i work with to uphold all company policies and perform all daily duties. hard parts of the job are sometimes a customer is not always satisfied with how we run the store or about certain polices in place but with the assistance of myself and my manager we strive to find a positive solution to the issue at head without going against the polices. I've learn that success isn't easy but to get where you want in life hard work is the key to success.
good,A typical day at work starts with clocking in and reviewing what needs to be done according to my shift. I like to know how busy it is and any additional information I need to know from the current manager on duty. The amount of work I am able to accomplish reflects from the amount of customers we get that day. I have learned how to communicate effectively with customers and be proficient with money handling. My co-workers are easy to get along with and hard working individuals. The hardest part of my job is trying to do 100% in little time. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the customers and kind staff.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is as typical as can be. You clock in, do your duties, and clock out. There isn't a whole lot to say about working in retail. The usual caveat applies; such as rude customers."
good,"The typical day at work starts with waiting outside the store until the Manager arrived and opened. The 4-5 team members would then clock in and promptly move to the stock room and began preparing dollies and push carts. Empty boxes left by the overnight crew, if any, were bailed and unloaded from the bailer and taken out for pick-up. Once the truck arrived two members would bring out the loading belt and begin unloading from within the truck and sliding products down the loading belt to the remaining 2-3 members to be stacked in the back room. The process took 2-3 hours some days, 4-5 others depending the shipment size and was done twice a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Depending on the number of people unloading and stocking shelves, occasionally towards the end of unloading the truck a member would be sent to start stocking shelves, usually to get some boxes out of the way to accommodate space for the morning's products. This was usually done hastily and regardless of the amount of that product that was already on the floor, we were simply instructed to stock shelves with what we could. Usually after unloading a truck, those members who were unloading the truck were sent to stock shelves, each member assigned a section (a few certain aisles). "
good,"Pay is minimum wage $7.25/hr. You spend most of your day standing at the register and they mostly have part time positions. You can't take more than about 11 minutes on your break, and some of the co-workers are a little tense about the job despite the ease of the job. The hardest part of the job is figuring where money shortages and overages are for management."
good,"great organization with a great cause, management respectful and kind."
good,"I love working in this environment, and the customers. I love helping my customer find what they need and Have a great experience in this store. Stocking is fun and easy for the most part. The hardest part of the job is the long weeks. For 75% of this year I have worked 6 days a week at 55-65 hours a week. I'm salary no I receive no overtime, and my personal life has taken a hit from working all of the time."
good,dollar tree was I good place to work I had some fun but I can get boring if there is a lack of work to do or customers. I didnt really learn too much about being a cashier at that point because I had already done it.
good,Manager was an expert in her job. Friendly coworkers were a big help. Customers were satisfied with all work.
good,"The job was okay. The manager was kind of rude to me for the first day on the job, but there is not much to say about it. I kinda didn't like the job that much because the people were rude."
good,open the store wipe down register area sort product/candy around register blow up balloons then start restocking merchandise and as customers enter the store we attend to there needs and provide good customer service
good,i learned so much with the company it thought me how to  becamed a better sales asso
good,Okay place to work hour are long and work is hard.Lunch break too short.
good,"Most days are typically the same: open, work hard, solve problems, keep smiling then go home. Every now and then a challenge will present itself and finding and applying the solution can be very personally rewarding. The hardest part of the job was getting quick answers from Corp HQ - delay doesn't make customers happy,"
good,Very first job and it was okay. What i gathered from this job was what work was all about. The most enjoyable part of Dollar Tree was the people i got to meet here. I got to learn the true meaning of customer service and how to keep shelves filled for customers.
good,unload trucks and over see a crew of 8 to 10 peoples stock the store
good,"I was a key holder as an assistant manager. One of my duties was to open the store. An associate and I would walk the store to make sure everything was in order. We would then count the safe to make sure it was correct. Sometimes we would have to run a deposit to the bank before opening the doors. I would get our tills ready and set up the registers and open the doors for the customers. I would check e-mails and make necessary phone calls. I would assist customers on the floor and ring their items up. I would stock the store and assign the assistant jobs. At shift change I would take the old assistants till down and do the proper paperwork for them to leave and put the new assistant on the register. I would recount the safe with the other assistant manager or store manager and give them information about the day. I would also deal with the vendors, accept the merchandise and do the proper paperwork."
good,"A typical day at work would usually include replenishing stock within the store, attending to the needs of customers as well as the needs of my associates, recovering the store, cleaning bathrooms, handling paperwork, handling money, etc. I have learned how to provide a service to my customer base while keeping the store looking great. I also learned how to take care of paperwork and handle money with no error. The management could improve and some of my co-workers didn't always put 100% into their work, but that was just another obstacle I had to overcome to become an experienced manager. The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with my workload when I am expected to accomplish so much by my district manager on a nightly basis as I am understaffed and my cashiers are expected to do nothing as I am given a list of tasks to accomplish in a few hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to finish stocking everything I had to and being able to step back to look at the hard work I put into it all."
good,Very strict adherence to company rules.  Excellent customer service required.  Ability to work in fast pace environment. Ability to follow direction.
good,"Open or closing of store ,cashier ,customer  service , process freight,"
good,"Interact with customers daily, management was really helpful and co-workers were very friendly as well"
good,"I have worked for Dollar tree for 2 years now ."
good,"A typical day at work would be myself walking in and clocking in as well. Then i clean the belt so i proceed to scan customers items. It is my job to make sure the customer are happy with what they found as far as items."
good,"Hard work with freight, but managed well with pre planning abilities."
good,"It was a great job if it was the only one you have. You only received 5 hours a day maybe 4 days a week unless someone called in, which was basically everyday. other than that it was a fun work experience because of the customers."
good,". good place for someone to start learning how to have a job"
good,"Store Managers should rotate the day & night shifts among assistant managers but they don't.  It is unfair for one AM to work all the night shifts while every other manager gets to go home to their friends and family every single night leaving one manager to sacrifice their friendships and family time at least 6 nights a week.  Other employees beneath you tend to be lazy and you constantly have to tell them what to do.  There's always something to do. There is no need to just stand at the register and look around.  WORK!! The paperwork part of the job that assistant managers do is pretty easy and don't take longer than 10 minutes. The store where I work, since it's opening in 2010, have had at least 4 different Assistant Managers.  All quit because of poor work/life balance.  Night managers don't get paid enough for that kind of personal sacrifice.  If you do something wrong, you get scolded and not necessarily taught how to not make the same mistake twice."
good,"Management was constantly changing, it did not take much to be a manager, my co-workers were fun to work with. I worked at a busy store so the time flew by fast. A lot of my co-workers complained of hours but I received a lot of hours. The raises sucked, only got a raise once a year and it was only $0.40."
good,"This was my first work experience, which had taught me how the real world works. I enjoyed it and finds that I like the thought of being an adult learning how to survive in the world of working."
good,"Fun and energetic fast pace, weekly pay and long hours great management  team  friendly co-workers"
good,"The Job was easy and great people to work with. It just had its moments when you needed to be off and could not get it off. Also, you really could not plan any family time due to the mandatory overtime which in some cases had you working 30 days straight."
good,"The hours could be better and the co workers could be reliable as well as the assistant managers, every thing should not be a competition work well as a team . all in all if you come in and just make sure your job is done it is easy money. just needs less drama. And the policy needs a little adjusting."
good,"Only thing I would like to see is to get more hours.  I enjoyed my assistant manager, she was fun to work with."
good,My job requires me to maintain control over the freight received and that is put out onto the sales floor. My co-workers I feel do not take the job as serious as needed. Most enjoyable part of my job is customer satisfaction. I do what I can to make sure the customer obtains the product they are in search of.
good,Was hard work to move up to management after a few months. Co workers were great to spend time with at work. Everyone worked as a team fast and easy.
good,"Days were spent cleaning, running registers and placing orders through the computer. I learned proper phone etiquette and how to properly place orders. Management could use improvement due to their nonchalant approach to rude customers and defending fellow employees. Co-workers made the job fun being that many of us were around the same age range. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers who always had to be right knowing the cashier couldn't argue with them."
good,always working hard understaffed so always working double time and never falling behind
good,A typical day at work for me was very productive. If I was scheduled to come in early I would put together a list of task/duties for my co-workers then conduct my duties. The management was kind of lousy but the store manager was great. There was not really a hard part to this job. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my customers.
good,"Hardest part of this job for me: customers not being patient and sometimes extremely rude.  day at work: bank run in morning, fill soda if not done night before, set out newspapers, walk around store facing shelves, check for mess in aisles, boot up registers and then let the rush begin.  my managers were great, they liked to be personable, have a good time and were friendly to both staff and customers.  my coworkers were open and friendly and in between duties coworkers and managers alike relaxed and had a joke or two.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the friendships i made, the connections that i still have with people i worked with years later."
good,"Work well independently or as an active team player"
good,This job pays way to little for me and has no opportunity for me to promote.  Its a dead end job and I need to step out
good,A basic day at work consists of unloading and loading trucks. I've gained a sense of leadership and team work by working here. The hardest part of working at this establishment was working with others who didn't want to work. 
good,"Opening/closing procedures"
good,"Working for the Dollar Tree was an adventure. I started when I was in high school and worked through college. I worked with some great people, but people came and left. Management was not great. My managers at the store were great but once I had to deal with managers any higher than that, it was worthless. I still have retro-pey owed to me that I will never see. I did learn from this job, it was an experience that I am glad I participated in."
good,a typical day at work for me starts with me greeting customers entering and leaving the store as well as cashiering and helping customers locate certain items in the store 
good,"I usually start off working the till and when I'm not busy I find something to clean or restock. Towards the end of my shift I sometimes do some recovery, which is putting things back on the shelves where they belong and cleaning up the aisles. I have learned how to use a more advanced cash register than I'm used to, which is a lot easier than i thought it would be. My supervisor, who is the store manager is really friendly and helpful. All of my co-workers are great and they always help me out if I need something since I haven't been working there for long. The hardest part of the job would be doing recovery because I don't know the store very well yet so i don't know where everything goes. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when a customer comes to the till when I'm working the cash register and I have a good conversation with them and it brightens my day a little and i hope it does the same to theirs."
good,The people I work with are good people love to be busy and not to stand around.
good,* unload truck on U-boats
good,To much work for so little pay but other than that it's an ok place to work at.
good,A typical day at this job was to stock shelves with products/ manage daily tasks. Also assign tasks to employees. Managed large sums of money/ and responsible for money drop off and pick up.
good,-Busy and time consuming
good,"Dollar Tree got very busy, constantly on your feet, there was something always needed to be done. Management was not very organized. The customers were always great to work with. The hardest part would be the constant bending and lifting."
good,"A typical day at work consists of cashiering during the day, and when the store closes putting it back to its original state. The hardest part of the job is replacing re-shop that the customers decided not to purchase."
good,I learn something daily that advances my management and customer service skills. The people I work with are nice and make work a little easier.
good,I learned how to work a cash register. there was no hard part to this job except dealing with the disgruntled customers.
good,nice place to work customer were nice store didnt have a manager so it wasnt being ran like it should have been i terfer from another store that was ran a lot different
good,the crew at dollar tree have a close relationship. the environment is great with friendly people. I like it there but i am a single father of two and the part time job just wont cut it.
good,go into work. Cash out at the end. co workers are nice. management was ok.
good,everything was great until i got a school schedule which they couldn't work around it and then i got told my manager that im irresponsible bc she found out i was pregnant.
good,"Day to day operations ran smooth. With good management practices, training was made easy and efficient. When taking on this position, I was uncertain of the progress I would be able to make due to the lack of inventory processing that had taken place prior to. However, with good support management I was able to exceed even my own expectations in fixing and maintaining inventory and processing."
good,"Wasn't really there long.. I only worked six hour shifts, people were great and friendly"
good,"As a Assistant Manager at Dollar Tree, I've learned how to create a great team, allowing others to work well with each other. Having to stock supplies and control the front of the store was a task, but allowed me to become comfortable working in a fast-paced setting. My typical day at work include clocking-in, start-up cash registers, count the store safe, balance cash registers, complete a daily store walk, provide cashiers with a (To-do List), get started on my (To-do list), provide cashiers with what's needed as the shift goes along and manage breaks/ lunches, Vendor checks, Handle multiple phone calls, Customer service, Count down registers for ending shifts of cashiers and prepare new ones, Discuss (To-Do List) with cashiers before their shift is over, Complete another store-walk at the end of shift, Provide maintenance to ensure the store is in great condition, Re-count safe, Make store deposit, check store sales, End of the day paperwork, File records accordingly, Clock-out, and transport store deposit to the bank. My typical work day consist of a lot, but I enjoyed accomplishing my duties with co-workers who provide great company and satisfaction to the company."
good,"Average pay, long hours for management. Very low budget for staffing. General retail, stock, cash management etc."
good,". Opened and closed the store. Counted deposits and tills, audited registers scheduling, daily paper work, store orders, recovery and assisted customers on the resgister and on sales floor."
good,"Team work, I learned to make things exciting i enjoy meeting new people who came in the store. The managers there were very nice and were reallyhelpful,easy to talk too,as well as the coworkers, had good relationships, easy to talk with. The hardest part was not really anything,the most enjoyable part of the job was getting everything done."
good,Managers were never on the same page and never helped there sales associate.
good,"physical very demanding need to be able to multitask. Work well with AS400,needs to be a hands on manager, be able to deal with different attitudes."
good,"stocking shelves, unloading a truck, and a little bit of helping shoppers."
good,"I did not receive more than 26 hours in 3 months of working, and was not told i was laid off until i asked."
good,There was nothing really in particular wrong with this job is the only thing I had a problem with was scheduling. at the time I needed the money to move out of my grandmother's house and they weren't providing means cost
good,"Stocking items, unloading item from shipment to store floor, make changes with inventory, multi-tasked between stocking and cashier. Cashier job consist of great skills in money management with speed of service being one of the special skills a person has."
good,The job itself is a normal job consisting in helping stores with technical issues to ensure they run properly. Assisting in fixing or receiving help from a technician.
good,Fast paced work environment. They need more cashiers with more hours. In my experience I have always enjoyed coming in and opening the store. I have regular coustmers that I love seeing everyday. The staff is great and we all have become friends.
good,I loved my job I loved my customers I do feel I was discriminated against and  most of the coworkers and management are good there's a few bad apples who like I said discriminate and talk about other employees and a just not professional
good,"My typical day at work go in at 5 am work stock until 10 am. I have one of the best managers in the world, very hard charger and she is very attentive to the needs of her work staff..."
good,Minimum Wage for cashiers and stokers making it easy for the average employee to just walk away from. Great benefits for managers tho.Be prepared to hire someone new every 2 -3 weeks .
good,Be prepared to work for a long while. Always busy on the weekends and during the holidays. Might hit heads with the other workers. Just have patients.
good,"It was a ok job, the other employees were very friendly and helpful ,the hired to many employees and  that thinned down the number of hours you were able to get . Naturally they have their favorite cashiers and they take priory . They have you re-apply each year if you are a seasonal person ."
good,My experience at Dollar tree was good. They show you what it is to work as a team and they help you through everything . Management is easy to talk to and describes everything they should
good,Dollar Tree only offered me minimum wage. Now that I look back it wasn't really worth it. I don't think I would go back. The management makes a lot more than the regular cashiers.
good,This was a nice company to work for I'd still be working for them if the pay was higher. My manager was super nice and I enjoyed the regular customers
good,I worked under a hard working dedicated manager that lead by example and paved the way for me as a person to grow to a point were I eventually became an assistant manger
good,My work experience with Dollar Tree was moderate in my perspective due to the fact that I'd want more from a working environment and tend to continuously to look for a new job.
good,"I like the company at first however, thing have change. The pay to keep hard working people is low. Not being able to order what is needed to help increase your sells hurts."
good,The most enjoyable part about the stocking job was stocking items and merchandise cause it’s relaxed and not stressful . Management was cool but no hours
good,None i just had to make sure the customers found all the items and ring them up. make sure the front end was clean and the bathroom. Make sure the the shelves are stocked with items
good,"Dollar tree was my first job that I had. There was never a dull moment and we all got along. I was a cashier, shocker, and thin unloaded the truck. It a perfect start out job to get work experience"
good,I loved my job working at Dollar Tree. I only left due to personal conflict with management and scheduling issues as well as needing a more set schedule.
good,I’ve been with dollar tree for about 2 years and from day one I know the store team was awesome but from there we had to figure everything out ourselves if you call the higher ups hardly no answer always have to leave a message  not a bad company but make sure you build you a great team to help you all succeed in the stores as one team
good,"Smaller store, generally there are more things to do then people to do them, as is I believe, typical with most retail and fast food type jobs. It's difficult to have people stay, with the amount of hours available to them to work in a week"
good,"I just like working at warehouses or stocking at another store the manger wasnt giving me all my hours so i didnt go back there in she was giving her friend all the a"
good,"Easy job sometimes, but yall need to do better on payroll, starting salary is 8.00. And too strict on certain stuff. No full time unless you're a manager."
good,For a first time job this is perfect.  Easy to make advancement and gain work experience.  You just need to work and never settle.  Makeing asst manager is easier to make as a employee already
good,I clock in... stand there... ring customers up...Id rather be doing dishes...I don't know what to put in here I've never did one before. Please give me a call. Thank you!
good,You have to be flexible as far as hours.  You need to be able to multi-task and listen to directions correctly.  You need to be able to work in a fast paced environment and be courteous to your customers.  All around a good place to work.
good,"Is a good place to work because they need good people to work there and its like working for a family but their your employees. Anyways, they need more people and they need to have flexibility and be able to work there."
good,"I would consider this job to be great for first time job seekers, someone looking for a part time position or in school. None to little hard work for any entry positions."
good,I enjoyed working there but sometimes corporate should really dish out more hours. The stress levels raise a lot when you don't get enough help and the customers can be quite rude but my coworkers were like a family.
good,"Love the people I work with this company can be very challenging to work for. There is a lot things that need to be done on a timely matter, some of it can be very hard to meet without pulling a lot of long hours. Management can make monthly goals and be paid bonuses..depending on your store volume"
good,"If I had not had a reaccurace with breast cancer I would still be working with the company . The people I worked with  were a good group of people.  The previous  manager fixed it so I could not go back to the company, by telling them I didn't put in a 2 week  notice."
good,"When every item costs a dollar, it's not difficult being a cashier."
good,I am an assistant manager. I get 40 hrs a week. I don’t get to see my kids like I should though. I would recommend working here as a cashier or part of the freight crew. As far as management I wouldn’t do it.
good,It’s a great job if you don’t have kids or bills to take care of. It would be nice if they paid more than minimum wage. Managers are way underpaid for all of the hard work and stress they have to deal with. But I will say they are very flexible with your schedule and working with people you enjoy working with is a plus.
good,"I loved my managers at the dollar tree, all of them were encouraging and helpful, and it is actually pretty easy to become a manager young as long as you have reliable transportation. I'm 19 and if it weren't for my transportation issue, I'd be training to be a merch manager right now. Unfortunately, for managers, overtime was out of the question but almost impossible to do the job without. My previous manager did end up working off the clock multiple times to avoid job abandonment. The dollar tree also pays only a bit over minimum wage, but is also very likely to hire despite previous problems at other jobs. I was hired on the spot. Another problem is the amount of hours they gave managers to give their staff was so low, so a lot of the time I only received 15 hour work weeks despite being the head stocker, the longest one there, and the most valuble and reliable (managers words, not mine). All in all, a good place to build experience and very easy to get yourself into a managerial position young, but not very good pay and unreliable hours."
good,"It was a decent part-time job in the summer. however, the compensation was not high enough for me to pay for college. My fellow employees and boss where very friendly."
good,"I wouldnt recommend employment at Dollar Tree. With the exception of having an outstanding store manager working at Dollar tree had very few rewards. In the course of being a merchandising manager there, they always changed the work load and was always a lot more expectations with no pay raise except for the normal annual review that comes with a very small pay increase. Also in the course of working there the CEO decided to change the hours of operation with little or no warning. I loved the store managers at the south Elgin location and at the Algonquin location. There was nothing wrong with the initial managers the actually made the store run."
good,"The staff is awesome in my store, the customers are like every customer out there: jerks or nice people. I'm getting around 20 hours a week which isn't bad for extra money but don't expect it to pay your bills. My schedule is pretty stable and flexible, can always rely on someone to trade shifts with if needed."
good,"how to be a manager "
good,"Work at Dollar Tree was very Physical and fast paced. I learned a lot about management and how to manage stock while i was there. I must say there was a lot of things I loved about working at Dollar Tree, like the flexible hours and the staff. I loved that I could work so close to home as well. My problem was I didn't like their ordering system. It didn't allow for the store manager to adjust when the storeroom was overstocked so the storeroom eventually ended up being out of OSHA regulations which upset me greatly. All I was ever told was to keep stocking but we were never given enough labor hours to stock enough product to get the room cleared out. After a while I just felt like I was being set up for failure and well I don't like to fail. So I went elsewhere."
good,"The hours are way to much it was at lest 70+ hours a week. When you are a store manager, so when you are salary they can do whatever they want. I like the job just to many hours always weekend and holidays. If you have a family you could never work there."
good,"They expect a lot especially in the fall time when there is the seasonal sales. They tell you to do one thing, but realistically we can't, then we get questioned about our decision."
good,This job has managers that are proficient though not always focused. The position of manager does not take much to achieve if you are a good worker that can get the job done.
good,A typical day at work consist of completing store recovery and if not that instructions given by store manager. I learned that it's sometimes best to only do the work you were assigned at to not try to overwork yourself to try and complete a goal that others are not working towards. Management might be better if there was a more reliable staff to take some of the load off of the store manager.
good,really enjoyed the people i worked with some made me feel like family in my 2 years of service but i do feel management tried to over use they power at some times
good,"Easiest job I've ever had, you perform all jobs duties here (cashier, stocker, and just generally cleaning up the store, etc). Job is not stressful at all"
good,Being as young as I am at 20 years old working at dollar tree would be easy. Although for me it was very time consuming and required a lot of hours and hard work which was too much for my schedule at the time.
good,"During my tenior with this company, I experienced working with some of the most respectable people i have ever met. The company seems to care for their employees and getting time off for personal matters was never an issue. I would recommend this as a good starting job for anyone coming out of high school, and a good retirement job. The staff that I worked with were always kind and understanding."
good,"I don't hate working here, however the pay is ridiculously low considering the amount of business (at least my store in particular) has. We work our tails off for minimum wage.. it's a good job if you're just looking for something to get you out of the house, but if I'm being honest it doesn't provide much else. Oddly enough, you have to be 18 to work at Dollar tree, yet I don't know a single adult who doesn't live with their parents who can live off of $7.35 an hour"
good,"I worked for Dollar Tree after I and hundreds of other workers had been laid off from their previous job. Overall it wasn't the most glamorous work, the pay was low, as were the hours, but it gave me some kind of income while I got on my  feet after having the rug pulled out from under me. My managers, however, were wonderful. We were all hard working, but we had fun and I enjoyed my limited time there. That could be more attributed to my location and the people I worked for. The job was not hard. You stock groceries and you count money, which makes it a great starting job for someone in high school. You work about 4-5 hours a day and put a little bit of cash in your pocket. Be diligent and you have some experience to put on your resume."
good,"Loved working here, flexible hours. The management and staff were great and friendly. The customers were regulars. Loved doing my office duties and scheduling employees for the weeks"
good,"Extremely fast-paced, always changing environment. "
good,It was like a family. You could ask someone else if they could watch the front while you go to bathroom. It was a good job. I liked working their because if you needed help finding where something went they would help you find it.
good,"I worked part-time over summer break. I would wake up sometime in the 4am's to unload the truck. Not a hard job if you can move around decently. "
good,"I have nothing but nice things to say about my managers and my Co workers at dollar tree, but a lot of the corporate polices need to be changed. I have been with the company for almost a year now, and I am a reliable employ that comes in often to cover shifts, yet I still make minimum wage. I love the people I work for, I just don't like the corporate office"
good,"As a SM you are always on call. Once you leave the store you are still on the clock. As long as you have a good assistant management team you can do your job like the company trains you for but if not you will basically live at your store. Salary is based off 45 hours per week but you're required to work and schedule yourself 48 hours. Annually raises IF you get a good  review, if not you're stuck with same salary until following year."
good,Dollar tree was a great job to lean customer service .everyday was a different day in this company .i moved up in the company because of hard work .i was always willing to help and had a smile on my face .
good,"Most of the people I worked with at Dollar Tree were enjoyable to be around, and I still stay in touch with many of them. If I ever stop by the store now the Store Manager is always happy to see me."
good,This was my first job I worked there while I was in high school when I first got this job it was fun overall was laid back I really enjoyed working there.
good,This job would be good for students who need a job as it is only 4-5 hours per day. management was good and it hard work which makes the day go by fast which i enjoy.
good,"The hardest part of the job was missing church and working with other employees that did not want to work or show up for scheduled shift. Another part was other employees that did not work as hard as I did or hours received the same pay per hour, but the position was lower than my title. I learned how to be calm when under pressure. The most enjoyable part was getting to help customers."
good,"Dollar Tree has great tutorials regarding the retail industry.  I began as a part time cashier and worked my way to store manager.  I am responsible for schedules, receiving, merchandising, inventory, training and customer service.  I report to the District Manager on a daily basis with bi-weekly inspections.  I am responsible for covering any and all staff shortages; whether due to hourly allotment or associate issues.  Our store runs short staffed and I have had to cover my duties, the duties of my merchandising/freight manager for the past 12 months and the duties of my full time operations manager for the last 2 months."
good,Need more hours and only work two days out the week I'm not making much ...its kinda slow I like fast pace and I really need more hours so I am able to pay for my bils
good,"I enjoyed working here due to the fast paced work environment also meeting new people everyday . "
good,My job consist of restocking merchandise and taking freight of the truck on a weekly basis. I haven't learned anything that I don't already knew from previous employments.
good,"Other than the manager at the time it was a great place to work.  I was assistant manager and stocked shelves, helped out customers and assisted on registers when needed"
good,The hardest part of job was or is labor. There was very little staff working and had to come in when someone didnt show up and the back inventory was full.
good,"This company was a job that I enjoyed at first:  As time went by my hours started disappearing, until I now work only five (5) hours a week at the rate of $9.30 with $1.00 of this being the night shift pay."
good,"When customers aren't around, there are plenty of tasks that are given to be done. Even if you finish with the tasks assigned to you, there's always something to do to occupy the downtime of an employee."
good,I only worked here a short time !!! I was over worked and under paid . I knew I was not going to work their long.. I started off as cashier . I worked for the company for over 3 years
good,"I loved working here. Great team Easy no complaints, basic skills communication is very well management is very understanding team members or easy going stocking shelves cashiering helping customers and cleaning up at closing easiest job I've ever had"
good,"I was lucky to have fantastic co-workers. My peers were like my family. Outside of the workers in the store, the management wasn't all that great. The store I was at was the perfect beginners job."
good,If you have a manager who works with you then your work schedule is pretty flexible. You do not have to formally put in requests off but instead mark your name on a calendar for what days you need off. It helps if your life schedule is pretty hectic and you need certain days or time off.
good,My typical day at work consisted of unloading the dock with the reach truck and relocating them in the overheads. The management team is very friendly and understanding of the pace set for the day. The hardest part of the day is cleaning up the mess left by the previous shift. The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to finish specific zones and helping other zones get their pallets in the overheads.
good,"Although the management was great, cashiering at Dollar Tree seems to be more of a temporary job. For me, it was okay as a temporary job while I was going to school, looking for a new job in my field of study."
good,"Working for Dollartree is a mixed bag, depending on how well your store is operating and what kind of crew you have working for you the days can be anywhere from short to long."
good,"This job as a cashier is slow pace Easy to do, i was originally hired as a stocking person but took on more cashier hours to get more hours. Ive been in retail for over 20 years and always been in management so this job was easy compared to what i use to do."
good,"I enjoyed working there.  I was upset with myself for getting let go.  It was very easy work, but fast-paced.  Employees are all very friendly and helpful."
good,"The pay wasnt grea id make maybe 600 a month if that, but the managers were really helpful for the most part,   the corporate isnt great which is why i wouldnt recommend it they spelled my name wrong on 3 different checks despite numerous efforts to fix it and i didnt get paid for a whole month and a half"
good,Dollar tree is one of the most relaxed and slow paced jobs I have had. My manager was awesome and treated everyone equal. The workplace was very easy going. But I did not agree that the company will not hire you on full time due to not wanting to cover everyone on insurance if a full time employee.
good,Was not able to get stock to floor in time frame given because distributors send too much stock in too little time and understaffed was the hardest part of the job.
good,Help with customer service and helping customers. Restocked store to ensure always had optimal items accessible in a clean environment. Mandated the cash register for a speedy and welcoming checkout.
good,"Tight knit work environment.Hours were good..Team players. "
good,I just came to work everyday counted my draw talked with customers made phone calls. I loved working there it 9is a great company to work for. you stay very bissy everyday and it makes the time go by.
good,"My time spent at the Dollar Tree Distribution Center was repetitive, like most general warehouse jobs. The managers are supportive with any concerns regarding the job or outside life."
good,It was a fun place to work at but i needed a better paying job to get bills payed but i need a new change in my life so i think working at this place im applying at will help a lot.
good,Working at Dollar Tree is very good. There are great work ethics to learn. If you are interested in being around people and doing your job correctly you will like working at Dollar Tree.
good,"I enjoy working for my boss at dollar tree, it's a great work experience, but the company needs improvement. Can never get in touch with our district manager.  Had to go out and buy our own refrigator and microwave for the break room."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of making schedules, money management stocking and customer service.I was also backup cashier and problem solver. there was not enough employees on shifts to complete tasks necessary. I am a people person and work well with others also powerful leadership qualities. Overall I enjoyed interacting with everyone."
good,"Shelves were stocked but messy."
good,"This was not a bad place to work, there was a lack of advancement and the pay was not that great, but the people i worked with were great and it was a very fun atmosphere."
good,"Though only a temporary job to while taking college courses, this job gave me the experience and taught me skills that I can further use in my career advancements.  I learned many insightful aspects to the retail industry that I was not aware of before.  The staff overall was very easy to work with and get along with.  The difficulty I encountered with this job came during the holidays when the customer traffic increased substantially, sometimes leading to days without a break until ten minutes before my clock-out time.  The most enjoyable part of this job had to be working during delivery days and unloading the truck.  Not only did I get days to escape the mundane routine of the cash register, but I was also fitting exorcise into my day."
good,this is a good job to gain experience if you are wanting to be a member of management. it was part time asst manager paid hourly and worked no more then 40 hours per week.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree, I met nice managers that wanted to see us excel. The pay was not worth the amount of work that was required. Other than that everything was great."
good,I loved working there in the beginning. Awesome place. But as time grew on I felt like my hours were not what I had expected and that there definitely was favoritism.
good,"I feel the company is good to work for, but the wages are low and they only hire for part time unless your part of the management team. They have been very helpful at getting my days off when  I request them.  Stocking is everyone's job through out the day as well as the stockers. Have to recover and put back products found laying through out the store."
good,"Great place to work and gain exsperience. While employed there I learned how to properly handle money, become a store greeter, and use ten key. Although it is very fast paced, it was enjoyable"
good,I went from being an order selector to a licensed reach lift driver. I really miss it there that was one of my favorite jobs I have had. if I move back or get another opportunity close by with good pay and benefits I want in.
good,Each store is very different. High volume stores can be very stressful. Christmas time is horrible. Easter isn't much fun either. The regular customers are what make it worth it.
good,"Quick-paced environment. Flexible hours, but they are inconsistent and only part-time positions available unless you are management. Never know if you are going to get 22 or 12 hours a week on minimum wage."
good,"As an assistant manager you were responsible for unloading all trucks, vendor receiving, cashiering as needed, handling customer concerns, employee relations."
good,the best time of the year for me working there was when I set the store up with Christmas merchandise. the joyous vibe in the store because of the time of the year it was is why I enjoyed that.
good,"Starts with opening the store."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Dollar Tree, I love the fast pace and staying busy. They were very helpful with requesting un-paid time off, the only downfall was nepotism. Two of the merchandise managers there were best friends, and would let eachother slack off, resulting in them having me perform duties I was not allowed to due per corporate guidelines... They were reported several times to the store manager, and he never even talked to them about it, so I gave up and quit, I would rather have an ""Unprofessional"" quit on my record, despite informing them several times, that if they didnt change I was walking out, but I would rather have that red flag on my record, than get fired for breaking the rules for them. Not the mention one of the managers was trying to get to smoke pot with her as well. I would NOT recommend working at the Marshfield, Wi location, but I do recommend other locations, it is a great place to work."
good,working at dollar tree has been a very good experience for me. you deal with all kinds of different people. and you also get first look on the trucks and shelves thats always a plus.
good,"Several occasions where management took part in corrupted actions. Some of these consisted of stealing and swiping things through the register, only to void it later."
good,"Great working experience at Dollar Tree. Cashiering and cash handling"
good,Dollar tree employees were very nice and easy to get along with.The store was very homey store and seeing familiar faces helped me get through today .
good,"the work at first was slow as a cashier, and few hours offered, as a Manager it became fast pace and a bit stressful, dealing with corporate goals, personnel, and bookkeeping,  I enjoyed this job because of those same reasons,  work was not ever boring and a challenge trying to surpass the goals set by corporate.  My performance was always knowledge and appreciated"
good,"I liked working at dollar tree, If i had a job opportunity to work at another Dollar tree again,  I would.  I loved to stock the merchandise and cash people out at the register."
good,The place could get busy but you always had help to back you up. Management was friendly and understanding. Customers were friendly and environment welcoming.
good,"A typical day working at dollar tree, is not the normal retail exprience. One moment you may stocking shelves the next you may be called to help guide a fellow employee or an customer in ordering products not in stock."
good,it was a great place to work PT for someone that needs just a little extra cash but I would not work there if that was my only income the pay not enough. was very easy to transfer from one store to another and managemt was very help full.
good,"Working in the distribution center was hectic to say the least. They send you boxes from a conveyor belt and I was to load the trucks. If that was all I would have been fine, but they ended up having me run between three trucks on my own. I simply couldn't keep up the pace. The manager I had did what he could, I saw sympathy in him. But he also had a job to do, I never felt that I was ever under attack."
good,It's a fun place to work at. You can move up quickly if you want management. The hardest job there would be unloading the truck at expected time. The hours are good to.
good,"Typical day of work includes Customer Service, Stocking Merchandise, Cashiering,  Cleaning."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is very fast paste always on the run to get things done.  Most of the time you have to juggle several things at a time. Cashiering, Vendors, Customers,Phone calls, etc."
good,Management needs additional training in all aspects of the retail life. They have hard working people that need to work but because of how they are treated by upper management the moral is low
good,"Working at Dollar Tree has been a nice experience, overall. I enjoy working with my co-workers, as well as management. I have met and build great relationships with customers."
good,"Their main focus is to force freight to the sales floor and to prevent shrink. I feel that they have un real expectations of what can be done in one day by one person."
good,"Not my favorite place to work, hours were never consistent, new people constantly coming in as old ones left or were fired. Employers ok at best, benefits alright. Not a place I would make a career out of."
good,"If you get lucky, and get put in a good store, the job can be okay. The neighborhood in which the store is located makes all the difference. My store was very high volume, located just steps from a large train station. The customers were often loud, rude, and very messy. We had hundreds of dollars worth of damaged products per week. However, they are always looking for new associates/management so you are likely to get hired when applying."
good,You are required to work at least 48 hours per week as a SM. You don't have enough hours for stockers. Management is responsible for stocking product.
good,"Dollar Tree is a typical retail job that entails different levels of job descriptions: cashiering, Stocking and unloading trucks. However the possibility for job advancement is extremely high."
good,"I worked in the payroll department. The workload was very, very heavy. It could be stressful at times. We always found time to laugh and take a break. The company offers free health insurance to full time hourly employees- a great benefit! They have a cafeteria which is convenient for lunch and breakfast- especially since you only get 30 minutes."
good,"•	Open and close store "
good,"A typical day is a fast pace movement of merchandise. Unloading freight from trucks as well moving merchandise to sales floor. Learned how to place merchandise on sales floor for best sale. Learned how to manage and distribute inventory. Managed employees, dealing with bank deposits and opening/closing stores. the hardest part is constant pressure to get inventory on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfied customer service and accomplishing inventory."
good,"As a Dollar Tree employee, your hours vary every week, none of the same days off. There are typically 2 to 3 call-outs a week. They don't offer raises except for once a year; at that point you typically get between 15 and 25 cents. Customers are usually friendly."
good,its a typical warehouse job learned how to deal with working with other people. taking lunch when I was ready was good and driving the forklift and not having to pick up to many boxes was good
good,"great team members that get alone with everyone, help out the best way they can and show great communication skill,do things like for example clean the front area without ask to do so."
good,"This work experience adjusted well to my school hours, something I greatly appreciated. The courteous customers combined with an inviting staff made the job enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at DEAL's a Dollar Tree Company was open the store, start the P.O.S system and count the safe to place each till in the register and start my work day. I would give each team member an assignment which had to be complete by the end of their work day. I learned to follow plan-o-grams which I was suppose to teach each cashier so they could front-face the isles. I also learned to take truck orders and allocate the proper placement of each item. The most enjoyable part of my job was to be a assistant manager for the first time."
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to work for if you get the right manager. I got along great with my co-workers, the manager was rude to everyone. Overall, i'd work here again if I had too."
good,"It's a pretty moderate job. However not enough pay, very short hours. Hardest part of the job would be closing since theres only 2 employees who have to clean the whole store."
good,"A fun workplace, easy to get along with everyone including other members of management. I've strengthened my management skills, as well as my merchandising skills have definitely increased while working here."
good,"Good company. Too much freight, not enough stocking hours, need higher starting wage, need security in inner city stores."
good,"The more productive you are the better for you. Show that you care and are willing to help can benefit you. You must respect all customers. Show great customer service skills buy using G.E.T"
good,"This was a nice place to work and the hours were great. Management was wonderful but, employees were horrible. I moved up with the company only after a month but, the pay was absolutely HORRIBLE. I will never work for this company in the State of Arkansas again."
good,"Managed daily cash handling including taking cash and making credit transactions, balancing multiple registers, preparing and making bank deposit, customer service, unloading freight trucks, putting out daily freight. In charge of opening and closing of the store. Transfers and Receiving of trucks and entering the information in the computer. In charge of am stocking crew, maintain store operations until a store manager was hired and while she was out on maternity leave.	The manager was the greatest . How ever the District mangers were sneaky and very unfair to their staff.."
good,Job Was Fairly Body Draining and very time consuming but hourly pretty fast & not busy but once hrs were spilt problems tend to arises between management and associates
good,Its a job I enjoy the work experience . I also enjoy  working with my co worker   and supervisors . they have showed me news kills in which I can use in the future and advance in my career in customer service and cashier and supervising
good,"I am here to find a job not to advertise for those I have worked for."
good,Stocking really built up !y muscle ... Made me feel more confident. Made me ocd enough to clean up fast and almost perfect as can be.
good,Loading merchandise into the back of a Tractor Trailer. Unloading merchandise onto pallets and operating a Forklift.
good,"If you want to become a district manager, come to this company! If you just want to be a store manager...keep looking. This job is whatever you make of it, but you need thick skin. The HR department is quick to threaten and break laws. My current district manger has broken just about every FMLA law you can break and is still employed."
good,"Days working there was great and busy."
good,"Productive job .I caught unto  the  job in less then a couple of days & was It was a  very constant study job .I Learned how to stock &recover items in the store ,& the most enjoyable part of the job I would say is running the cashier ."
good,the  hardest part of the job was being a cashier I'm not a good people person doing math like counting money change back was difficult anxiety all the time.i learned a little about trying to be patient with customers.i enjoyed be a stocker it's to me relaxing .
good,"Didn't work there long (3-4 days). Terminated for a short register til. I had proof of my innocence, yet still I was terminated for amount unaccounted for."
good,"The store itself is fine so is the management. but he customers you get can be a pain. No requirements easy to get hired, but mostly part timers so not too many hours."
good,I like it to work there.  The environment is fast paced.  What would you expect when everything in the store is one dollar.  The management training is good.
good,Great friendly place to work at. Love our everyday customers that come in. Good foundation to learn  and advance. Dollar tree has great leadership programs for employee that wish to moved up and purse a management position.
good,I do love my job.  We stay very busy and it makes the time fly by.  I am only part time working 8-15 hours a week.  I am looking for a full time job in healthcare.  I miss my job and being able to help people.  I love working with the public and love that aspect of my job.  I get along very well with co-workers and the management.
good,"My typical work day consists of a truck day unloading the merchandise then running it to the floor to be placed on the shelve for purchasing and on the other days I stock shelves with merchandise that cannot go out on a truck day. I've learned a lot from running a register to how parts of the company work through asking my store manager questions about the company and what things mean. It can be a pretty interesting environment with some coworkers. They make you want to leave even though you really need to. I'm not sure there is a hard part to my job I mean you have to lift heavy merchandise and operate some machinery. I would say the most enjoyable is being able to work at my own pace and be in my own world so to say. Plus, those certain coworkers make things so much more interesting."
good,The company is good to work for if your just starting in management not a seasoned manager. You learn a lot by reading and self training
good,"Very interesting job,  J D my manager hired me without any cashier experience. He liked my friendliness, willing to learn and company loyalty. He took a chance and I came through!. The sales break area wasn't very pretty & they had only 1 chair. I like most all of the employees, they all were great workers!"
good,A relaxed working environment very friendly people to work with. a very stress free job. always having something to do which is good.
good,Dollar Tree is a good overall experience for a first time worker. It was easy/fun working in the summer however little difficult on balancing school and life.
good,"A typical day at work was okay but sometimes slow. My co-workers weren't to friendly so it was kinda boring to work with them but I always tried to make conversations. My managers were okay, sometimes rude if they weren't having the best day so it was really hard to work with them because I felt as if I wasn't doing okay but I continued to try my best and do the absolute best I could, another thing I really didn't like about my managers was that they seemed to not care what the store looked like or how hard their employees tried. I learned from working at that particular dollar tree, that even when others are nasty to you, you still have to keep a smile on your face and make them feel like they are welcomed there. Some things that I did like about dollar tree was the items, and how easy it was to learn about everything. I liked dollar tree alot when I first started, but towards the end the managers seemed very lazy and had the attitude that they didn't care about their employees which is the main reason why I quit. I understand that people have bad days, but having a good relationship with your managers and co-workers are a really big thing to me because if it's a permanent job they become your family and going to work is like going to your second home."
good,"Dollar Tree Discount store is a productive and fast pace place, where I get to meet some of the most amazing people there is to come by.  I just love to be able to talk to the different ethnicity's of people that tend to come in the store that say, ""Dollar Tree puts a smile on their faces every time they set foot into the store"".  My co-workers are all friendly and team player individuals that make the job so much fun and love to help one another out, especially on the days the store tends to be extra packed, full with customers.  The hardest part about my job is when it's very crowed and everyone seems to be just having a hard day because they do not want to wait in the long lines, because it makes the cashiers job much harder to keep the customers happy, but usually in the end, it all works out.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to get all the hugs from the small children that tend to come in there and light up from all the balloons that are blown up around the store.  That makes my day because the children just gets so happy and to see them run out the store saying, "" they will come back"", makes my day and all the trouble I go through in a works day all worth it all at the end."
good,"My typical day working at dollar tree consisted of friendly hellos and always putting things back into place. I helped customers when they were in need also offered my help when they were not. I worked at the cash register and sometimes it got super busy but I always kept a good pace and a smile on my face. Stocking while doing cashier was also something I enjoyed to do because I love to stay busy. I learned patience also tidiness. I liked the management very much all were very friendly and caring but very professional at the same time. The hardest part working at Dollar Tree was definitely dealing with an angry customer when you do not have what they're looking for, but I am always apologetic and sweet even when it's really difficult. The most enjoyable part of working for Dollar Tree was definitely the nice customers who come in often and always complimented my smile and looks."
good,"for the most part fast paced short shifts"
good,"Very Short Staffed but very fast paced work."
good,Productive and friendly environment to work in. Direct customer service and providing helpful hints for directing customers to the right products.A work day can be very demanding depending on the volume of products that have to be re-stocked. As a store cashier you incounter many transactions from customers and their needs. Providing fast quality service makes the customer happy and a high volume in customer return. The greatest part of the job is watching their faces and smiles for great curteous service they received that day.
good,"A typical day at work is normally just talking with customers and checking people out. My co workers were all pretty nice, but a few bugged me. I think the hardest part of the job was standing up the whole time and blowing up the balloons. The most enjoyable part was talking to the friends I have made there."
good,"I manage a minimum of ten employees, I can run the register, and do back office requirements such as balancing registers, e-mails, I can make store orders, I have done employee scheduling. store and bank deposits, unloading truck and stocking/merchandising products, can take inventory count."
good,"This place has some of the nicest people ever, especially in management. However, most of the positions are part time, so, no hours means no money for two weeks. Employee's get paid every two weeks, which is a shame. However, they do respect hard work and offers within are common."
good,Well I had to learn how to control my attitude at times when customers would get upset . At times I would have to multi task when the store would get busy.
good,"This is a good starter job to learn customer service, management, and team work. Management is decent. Easy going environment. Sometimes stressful during rush hours. Fun place to work with others."
good,"Fun work place with a relaxed manager but still expects hard work from her employees."
good,"It was a good experience,to learn more in warehouse.Fun stocking "
good,"I took my job very serious.Cashiering was a big learning experience,and if I had to do it again I would with pride.Doller Tree was great."
good,lead more leadership and ways to improve things to make the work environment better a good company with a little more leadership
good,"Stayed busy with customers and stocking the sales floor"
good,This was my first job and I enjoyed it. Co-workers were very enjoyable to work with. Learned to stack properly and used U-boats.
good,Very interesting for a first job. Repetitive but fun. Management was always willing to help if employees are struggling. overall good.
good,"I am a part-time assistant manager. My responsibilities include assigning tasks to cashiers and following up to make sure they are done correctly and within a reasonable time frame. I also assign tills to the cashiers, have them verify the amount in the till at the start and end of their shift. The hardest part of the job is when an associate has to be disciplined. The most enjoyable part is helping a customer with a problem such as helping them find an item, or assisting them with bringing their purchases to their car."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the people I worked with, however management seemed to expect to much out of there employees, who were earning to little pay for the amount of labor they were doing, leaving myself looking for a different job."
good,"Work for me is very fun, exciting, productive and educational.... Since I've been working for Dollar Tree I've had the pleasure of meeting many different peoples. I love my co-workers and most of all I have one of the most amazing boss there is.There is'nt a hard thing about my job or what I do. I can truly say that I love working at Dollar Tree..."
good,"I enjoyed my time here. The only reason why I quit was because I was working seven days a week for 4 months and I couldn't do it anymore. The Management was amazing. I still love them to this day. Unfortunately it wasn't in the greatest part of town so the customers was quite mean. Not all but most. Plus it was retail that alone is a hard job. The hours is what really got to me. I only worked fifteen hours a week when i worked there ""full time"" It was a major struggle."
good,"Dollar Tree was a great place to work, there was always something to do. If there was no one in the check out line I was stocking shelves, which added to my job experience. However, management wasn't the best at this location... I was only scheduled to work 3-4 days a week and everyday I worked was only for four hours. Upon complaining about not getting enough hours, management told me that's all they could do for me."
good,"a good job where it can go easily from. slow to fast. A great manager, who will help you with anything and very responsable"
good,"I like working or Dollar Tree, but there is really no room for growth. As of right now it's minimum wage, no benefits, and you can only work part time unless management. This is a good job for students but not someone who needs a steady income"
good,enjoyed working there and the people i worked with wa disappointed in the supervisor did not want to be open to knew ideas
good,"Greet any and every customer who walks into the door. Stalk items from the U-Boat, make daily announcements. - This job is okay, for anyone who has never done retail work before, it's a great place to start. For those who have retail experience, it's a good side job to work on the side."
good,"Helping customers"
good,I learned great customer service skills. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and being under good management
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace. My job is to open the store, make sure each cashier has their list of tasks to accomplish in their shifts, while giving them the tools to do so. I stock merchandise to the floor in a productive manner while answering questions for customers. When the cashier needs change or the line is long at the register, I help. Randomly do audits on the cashier to ensure the money is correct. At night I clean the store making sure everything is back into its' proper home, while facing the product. I clean the restrooms and sweep and mop the entire store. When closing the store, I pull all the tills out of the registers for them to be counted. Then count the safe and deposit to take to the bank. The most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team. When everyone helps out it keeps the day running smoothly. The hardest part of my job would have to be mean customers. I have worked for this company for  5 years, and though most customers are friendly and understand when I tell them Dollar Tree policies. There are some that will yell in your face or throw things at you, but you have to keep a smile on your face and just know you are doing the right thing by following policy."
good,The people I worked with were mostly nice but I often found I didn't know what to do because specific directions were not given. I learned not to take things personally as much and how to handle money. The hardest part of this job was finding where everything goes and the most enjoyable part was cashiering and helping costumers.
good,Not much to it really. Stock sold out products and checked customers out at the desk.
good,"One day a customer was not satisfied that our policy is we do not refund money, only exchange items of equal value. The customer was then yelling at one of the cashiers, so then i pulled the customer aside, and spoke in a calmly manner to then get the main manager to fix the problem that occurred. The most enjoyable part of my job is when its Christmas season, and we are able to wear a festive hat on while we are cashiering ."
good,"I am a team player and get along with everybody .I enjoy people to much and enjoy making people happy with there shopping experience and giving me money. Even with a unhappy I still agree with customer and do not argue with them I still smile and tell them have a nice day. Yes breaks are short 10 minutes but that's the way it goes . The hardest part of my job is not getting the amount of hours that I need .The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people and talking to them about there shopping if they say that , they are having a good day I say back to them I'm glad that there having a good day because it makes shopping more fun if you're going to shop then have some fun and I always get a big smile in return that makes me feel good and my managers have said that they like the way I handle my customers., I like feeling good about myself at work and it shows my customers I like helping them. If customer needs help and I can't help them myself I call someone right away to get them some help when they checkout they thank me for getting somebody there to help ."
good,"Very fun to work for this company, but making 0.50 more than a cashier as an assistant manager is not worth it."
good,Here i set up and organized a new dollar tree that was opening. Typical day consisted of making sure shelves were lined to correct positions and getting boxes of merchandise to fill them.
good,My review is based on all experiences as a member of Management dealing with everyday stuff.
good,I have enjoyed my time with Dollar Tree. They have provided me with many memories and experiences that I had not found until I began my tenure with them.
good,"A day at the Dollar Tree you running into all types of charters from old to young ,good days to bad days, busy and slow days .What I learned from Dollar Tree is that you will always come out of the store with more then what you come in for, because there are a lot of merchandise that you wouldn't think a dollar store would carry. Working as a team is a must for me to get all the task done on time the hardest part is finishing up within four hours sometimes it gets too busy with the check out line there would be a lot customers in line with only just one cashier"
good,Nice place to work everyone is nice to one and other. Dollar Tree is very busy and we have to make sure everything is in order and everything is clean so customers won't complain.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in, check all doors and alarm systems, setting up tills for the morning, starting up computers, setting up truck for the day, placing merchandise onto shelves, talking to customers, maintaining work flow, if closing then I would take down tills, count registers, check to make sure building is secure, make deposits, take deposits to bank."
good,Typical day was avery busy one. I learned to open  to help when needed.Management was easy to work with. Co works  were also easy to work with.Most enjoyable part of job was doing so many different task through out the day.
good,I loved the store and found it very challenging but there was a lot of stress and head games there
good,"Working here definitely helped me gain a lot of cash handling experience and fast paced working attitude. But, everyday was the same, cleaning and stocking items were easiest along with checking customers out. The most enjoyable part about this job was when packages came in the truck load and I had the opportunity to work fast and move around a lot. I am always active, so being active at work kept me busy and happy. Supervisors were easy to work with as well as coworkers. There was never really any conflict between us."
good,"Hard working are fit easily in,but if not they'll bad talk about your performance behind your back to coworkers,don't really walk you threw the process just throw you in thew pit and expect you to understand how things work..management sucks period..if hurt like i was and other co workers as well they'll get rid of you within a heart beat so you have to suck it up..PS if related to management you are pretty much guaranteed a spot in the warehouse full time but other other wise your hard work is not even appreciated!!!!!"
good,"The work day is pretty much the same everyday come punch in work punch out, management is okay there's some who don't know what their doing and some who do, some hate it some don't because of the pay, the hardest part is when you meet a very disrespectful and unapproachable customer, the enjoyable part is punching."
good,"I am always on night shift, I opens ones out of the week ,I have learn a lot since I have became a manager I have great co-worker I get alone with everyone I have excellent customer services, it is nothing so hard about the job I learned everything in a weeks time the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customer the customers  make my job wonderful."
good,this place here is a good place to start build up your warehouse skills. specially in the equipment department and recieving. i love my assocites there. we all try to work hand to hand. basicly make work more enjoyable
good,"Good place to learn and grow and have a steady job, Feel very secure work wise when working there."
good,"Personally, Dollar Tree was my first form of any employment, so I loved the challenge of doing different activities for the store. Usually, I would fulfill the duty of the cash register because the store was always busy. The co-workers were very helpful because they maintained other parts of the store. I felt the hardest part of the job was that my shift ended so quickly, because I wanted to continue to work more. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and greeting customers at the register because I love to see people smile."
good,cashier/stock not a hard job. had fun and also got work done. wasn't a fan of management where at times i felt it wasn't equal display of work among st employess
good,"Store Managers have to be versatile and efficient, easily the most challenging retail environment you can work in.  I trained several Management In Training candidates that were surprised at how much responsibility is placed on the Store Manager's shoulders."
good,"Good benefits and a strong foundation for early career managers. A lot of lower level management turnover, but those that stay have the benefit of being promoted from within."
good,"I would perform task that range form cashiering, store recovery, stocking and unloading merchandise from truck. I learned about retail and dealing with all different kinds of customers. The job in a whole was very easy, I enjoyed working and having fun with my co-workers well ensuring a clean and safe place to shop for our customers."
good,Good work place environment and great management. Best part-time.
good,"The pay is minimum and unfair considering some of the workers do half the work they're assigned. The management is split in 2: the assistant managers are somewhat lazy and the main manager is often angry and blaming others for everything. The work was manageable, not too hard nor too easy. Everyone was friendly."
good,"I was working at the Dollar Tree in Des Plaines Il. for almost five years. The best part about the job was the 5/6 hour days flew by almost every single day, which was a huge plus. Even though it was only part time, the work was simple just take charge of the register and greet and take care of each and every customer in your line. The worst part about the job was probably the pay you get there and for working there five years its truly pathetic at what the final salary was I had been making there. The management was terrific at this store and they give flexible hours. No point system at the store which is fantastic. Another downside on this job is this is kind of a hard company to work your way up in. After five years and a nice amount of ""employee of the month"" awards over time, you just cant seem to move your way up to assistant manager or store manager. As a hard and dedicated worker for Dollar Tree I am very unsatisfied with the time I put into working for them and could not even become an assistant manager. Its a perfect side job for some extra money, because they will only give you about 15/20 hours a week if business is good. It can be as low as 10 hours a week if their doing terrible with sales, but when Christmas and other holidays come around, they possibly could give you up to 30, still not that great. Like I said before, a great side job."
good,I enjoy talking with and getting to know my customers. My co workers are well to get along with and don't have any problems.
good,not excited about the way the company is run and you as a manager are expected to produce miracles. some days were ok but most not to good.
good,I didn't have alot of patience developed yet until working there. Dealing with all of those people really helped me.
good,"The coworkers were nice, but customers were pretty annoying. Not a lot of money, so if you have a family to support i would NOT recommend it. My location did not give a lot of hours."
good,i learn how to stock new items based on their sku numbers but it was a very good job i learn a lot and the coworkers were very kind
good,I enjoy the work and my customers but I have not had a raise in over a year that ive been there.
good,a typical day at work- Ringing people up and cleaning the store
good,A day at work would be like open the store and stock the shelves and open the cash drawer make sure we have bags enough for the day make sure area was clean. Open store doors and conversioning with new customer. Then the day come to an end. Clean area and restock and come back for another fun day at work
good,"It's a great place to work , you have to stay focused and alert, if you enjoy customer service , then this would be  a perfect place to beperfect place"
good,"Dollartree was a good company to work for, they have their good side and down side. Being a store Manager consisted of very long hours with a tremendous expectation of you. Staffing hours were limited. Mostly depending on the store size. Benefits were good."
good,"i did not enjoy with the hours given to me.But otherwise a great work place to work at if you enjoy great people this the place for you. "
good,Dollar tree was a good job for me but it isnt for everybody it's typically a less than 40hrs a week job unless your in management even then they prefer it be 30hrs or less. Their is room for advancment in the company if your interested and can find an open position. Typically they only pay minimum wage to start and under 30hrs a week by weekly pay as well.
good,I personally don't agree with a lot of things that this company does as far as its employees go but other than that it's an all in all good company I don't feel I was there long enough to give this company of air rating
good,"Love the ppl I work with always nice and they work with you the thing I only wish is more hours and rate of pay, but so far everyone there is nice makes you wanna just come to work, working with nice ppl and managers are A-1"
good,"Lots of little retail and jobs skills can be learned here. Unfortunately, the pay will stop most from staying or advancing. Store management can bounce from store to store without notice. Gm's make roughly mid to high 20k. Not a career unless you enjoy stress."
good,"I mean its an ok job... But dont give them your all because when its your time to go, they wont blink to let you go. Ive seen alot of scenerios there."
good,"As long as you dont mind being called a lot and flipping plans around it is a good work place. There is never a dull moment, you really become one with the community you work in due to how much you'll see old and new faces alike."
good,"This was my first job, so I was just glad to be getting the experience.  However, I don't think you could live off of Dollar Tree wages alone unless you were a manager.  All the cashiers were part-time workers.  We were not supposed to work more than 4o hours a week.  On average, I only worked 12-16 hours a week."
good,Loved working at Dollar tree. All employees was nice. Managment was amazing. I wished the hours was more and also the pay needed to be more with me having the position of assistant manager.
good,People work with and manager are very nice to work with. Do alot of work on my own without supervision. Hardest part of the job is standing the whole shift.  Learned today how to use cash register and took care of customers with a little help and was surprised how easy I am picking it up.
good,"I enjoyed the work hours and work culture. The team was collaborative, supportive and worked well together. The hardest part of the job was the location of the store in regards to safety."
good,Above  average . The girls that have worked there the longest  were the most patience  I worked there part time night shifts it was challenging to do recovery on time when u haven’t had the chance to look around but I learned
good,Productive place to work. I was only temporary but they had good benefits. The managers were very nice and understanding. Very laid back place to work.
good,Everybody gets along with everybody and it is mostly done as a team. Helping one another always makes it easier to do the job and it makes it fun to be around for 4 hours.
good,"Its a great starter job for a teen in high school preparing for the real world work force, the pay is barely enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle for a mature adult. If you are good at register work you will be there constantly and you will be left there to fend for yourself. As a stocker you pretty much have free range of the store and more lenience."
good,Ok place to work. Mostly part time hours like 20 hours a week. Fast paced and there is room to grow if you have a clean background. It is a stressful place to work. The pay sucks for everything the expect you to do.
good,co-worker and I get along great but as for pay it minimum wage and for assistant managers only get pay something an hour and around 25hr guaranteed a week as assistant manager
good,Dollar Tree was one of my favorite jobs i worked. You can grow quickly in the company as long as your willing and able to handle the task. You have to be able to multitask handle a busy atmosphere
good,I really didn't like the hours I was getting and the payment isn't enough to live off of but it's a good job for a person in high school or college...
good,place keeps you on your toes. no down time. must keep up the pace because you have a sheet to fill out every shift and must try to fullfill a quoata. very team oriented though.
good,"Bottom line, excellent place to start out if you are looking for your first job or something to keep you occupied. But if you are looking to support yourself, you are better off looking elsewhere. The pay is worth the work but you'd absolutely need to apply for full-time if you want to start accumulating a decent income."
good,"This company really gives you the bang for your actual buck. Nothing is over a dollar and with such low prices, the customer service was still awesome."
good,It was a really good fun work experience I loved my Dollar Tree team I love my manager I loved working for Dollar Tree and I love doing my daily duties.
good,"Typical retail job. I worked around 20 hrs a week. "
good,I enjoyed working for dollar tree while i was taking classes. The people were nice and the management was fun to work for. A typical day was meeting different people while running the register and stocking the store.
good,"I have been away from the company too long to write an accurate review.  When I was there, it was challenging and rewarding. However, the bigger the company got, the more the culture changed"
good,"I like working with company as a cashier, but there's definitely room for improvements regarding hourly pay, and hours per week for entry-level positions (cashiers and stockers), but like many other people's perspective, I'm better off with a job than not."
good,"I mainly worked as a cashier but I had the most fun with customers and hearing their stories. My co-workers and I got along very well, great communication!"
good,"My job is pretty simple, sometimes i open i clean my work area an do all duties before the store opens , I ring up customers an I stick freight, some of the managers are pretty cool, n the environment is perfect theres other stores connected so it's pretty convenient"
good,I enjoyed my co workers it didn't seem like work. I also loved getting a look at new items first so I can recommend them to other customers. I just didn't get enough hours.
good,It’s a great environment place to work. You’ll meet a lot of people and give great customer service. It’s a great place for a first job. Management is pretty great
good,"Dollartree is a fast pace job they have good benefits "
good,Always something to do with this company. Never time to have nothing to do. Very fasted paced as well. Sometime you would have to do your job as well as others do to the fact of cutting hours at time when sales are down.
good,I had  a nice time working there its just that I never got any help the line will be an aisle long before they decide to do something. But other than that It was good.
good,the job over all is great i lucky got a store with a good team and manger. compared to other dollar tree store with in the area we seem to be the best one even-tho i think we don't really do that much.
good,"I wouldn't work for this company again. No room for growth, not enough hours, slow paced at times and dealing with rude customers doesn't make matters easier."
good,"The warehouse can be very stressful at times, dued to some job tasks. It lacks in cleanliness and their safety program could be better. Great medical and dental benefits."
good,I mostly worked part-time. You have to do quite a lot and it is very fast paced and you get paid barely over minimum wage. When there was an assistant job opening up and I learned more about it I found out that you still don't get any benefits unless you are a full-time assistant manager. It made me not want the role anymore.
good,"Fast paced work environment, annual raises and PTO is pretty flexable, accrual does not take a rwally long time for vacation time. The company offers incentives and perks to spend with the family"
good,"It’s nothing much to say , I was barely there than a month because I had to focus on school but I will say it’s alright working there .. the lunch not very long and you had to clean up the store like it was always messy ."
good,I was a stock clerk and cashier. i did display old and new items. when I did cashier I learn how to handle money. Everybody got a along and were quite nice.
good,"Dollar Tree was a nice place to work at, but the hours were limited and the pay checks did not pay for that much. However, the people there were hard workers and incredible. They taught me so much with this being my first job and I will always be thankful for that."
good,"It was quick-paced at times, especially the holidays. The manager was great and pushed the employees to work to their best abilities. The job had a great work culture and great flexibility with hours."
good,The pay keeps u from staying. Bc the work and pay are not on the same level unless u are a full-time paid manager who gets bonuses. For ASM its skimpy pay too. And cashiers make minimum wage. Besides that love the hardwork and handling the every day tasks that need to be performed
good,While it was fun to work at Dollar tree with my coworkers. The drama that tends to happen isn't worth much. If it isn't one thing it is the next. It is competitive to get into a manager position .
good,"Hard on management because employees are not paid enough for their work so there is a high turnover rate. They kill the stores with large trucks and zero hours to get them unloaded which forces the store managers to work very long hours on salary pay. District Managers are great and most of the time have worked at store level so they are willing to help and give advice. Overall, I really enjoyed the job was just hard with a family at home."
good,The company is very fast paced to work for. They don't give you enough employees to fully operate the store in accordance to customer service. They give you very minimal hours to get the job done.
good,Fun place to work. Lot of hours. Not hard to do. Do recommend working there. Lot of work to do when it comes to recovering the store though.  But it is possible
good,A typical day at work is interacting with customers at the register. It is satisfying helping a customer find the items they are seeking.  The workplace culture at Dollar Tree comfortable and laid back.
good,"responsible for all aspects of a retail store, hiring training developing and holding staff accountable for their jobs being done correctly. A very freight driven company that needs to be worked on a daily basis.If a store does 5 million a year that's 5 million items that need to be restocked and rung up at the register"
good,Great store great prices excellent management fast paced nice customers. Its a great place to work has an  great work environment the employees are great its a good company..
good,"Dollar tree was ok,  I got a lot of hours but it's also times u may not get any hours so it's more of a part time job but overall it's a a good place to work"
good,I had a friendly group of people I worked with and My manager was always willing to help with any questions I had. And we all made n effort to help eachother
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work Busy and steady work to do. Great for school students and older employees who want to work part time. Fun and comfortable work.
good,"Good pay but no appreciation "
good,Too much politics no advancement for job performance more based on who you know or who likes you or you don't upset good benefits training was ok long work hours
good,I was a full time student when I worked at dollar tree so this was a good job for me. I usually did stocking but sometime I worked at the cashier. The manger at the time was nice and was willing to help me stock when short of staff
good,"Dollar Tree is not the best place to work. As a manager, I was responsible for so many things. Luckily, there was a daily action plan. The people are good. Too much paperwork."
good,Dollar Tree is a good 1st job for those who need flexible hours. Advancement is very possible for anyone who wants it but it is difficult to be trained properly for manager. Corporate does not involve themselves in store level challenges or issues. They only look at numbers not circumstances. Associates are paid minimum wage but are expected to continuously work in sometimes overly fast paced and stressful situations. Managers are overworked and underpaid. Not enough hours to make a living. Upper management has no work/life balance. Expected to work 48 to 50 hours per week but only get pAid for 45.
good,The managers are friendly and the associates are hard- working. Everybody supports each other and people are eager to help. There are no benefits because the jobs generally have a high turnover and are part time.
good,Job let you posses room for individual decision.  A lot of room for learning. Management very supportive.  Flexible and Friendly. Low turnover rates; able to make friends.
good,"A typical day at work at dollar tree was being a cashier, restocking, inventory, and helping customers. I learned how to handle money and customer service skills. The management was great. The work place culture was good. The hardest part of the job for me was nothing because everything was easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was having respectful co workers."
good,"I worked at one store in new Bedford and then switched to a brand new store that just opened and it was all over the place for the first couple of month, but we all worked as a team and got it to run amazingly"
good,"It is a good place to work in Gardendale Al,Ron Keith is one of the best Managers I have ever worked with and the most knowledgeable.He is always willing to give you his time ."
good,i have lots of fun working in dollar tree my managers are so nice i love them they are so friendly and fun. The co workers are so nice as well and we get to have lots fun while working there .
good,I liked the people that worked there and I learned how to manage a store and employees. I learned how to face a store and organize too. I learned how to stock shelfs in a days work.
good,"On a typical day, i will arrive at about 5 a.m. and start unloading the truck. After, we stock the pallets and start to stock the shelves of the store."
good,"always something to do, but sometimes the work is more then what you get paid for, great business overall, full time get great bonuses as well as insurance"
good,dollar tree gives everyone a chance. 0gthey do not pay very well though. you have to do a lot of work. bonuses are available but if you are only a part time manager you do not receive bonuses.
good,I really enjoyed this job. I was a cashier and got along well with the people I worked with. I learned how to count money better and improve myself in this way. In addition I learned how to persuade people to buy more. The managers were patient and understanding and kind. They helped out the most that they could. The hardest part was the fact that they couldn't give me more hours because Dollar Tree wasn't doing terribly well. The atmosphere of the job was the best part.
good,"The jobs is easy , the staff is really cool , they don't give a lot of hours , no benefits , we get paid on Thursdays, EVERYTHING IS A DOLLAR , so you really should never be hungry on break"
good,Everything is 1$ what more can you ask for. The stuff was pretty cute. Fun place to work but the work load was a lot. I would recommend the store to any one. It has a lot of different food and products. You can shop everything all in one store.
good,"always busy and always working on either go backs or organizing store."
good,"responsible for opening the store on certain days as well as closing and all the tasks that go along with that such as verifying bank deposit, opening registers, leading a team of people through various tasks during the day. Also did stocking shift So I'm responsible for restocking the store for the next day. Receiving and processing truck all in the same day. I would help on register as well as providing excellent customer service the best of my ability."
good,An ever changing company that should look a little deeper in the everyday actions of their District Managers performances.
good,"Work was simple, only involved moving boxes of items from the backroom to the shelves or occasionally assisting customers with finding products."
good,"Great workplace to join, good hours. Customer service was enjoyable, breaks were a tad short for liking, but in accordance with law, management was reliable, pay was adequate for hours worked. Was manageable with call outs of importance, and managed work schedule well around other non-work related appointments. Management and co-workers were welcoming and inviting  as a new employee and helped well with learning job duties and requirements."
good,"Small company, able to locate different products for customers with no problems. Inventory and Stock was easiest to learn and pick-up. Co-workers were fine to work with. Not enough lanes open to assist customers timely and effectively. No room for advancing to something more. I enjoyed the down-times that were available."
good,"Due to not being able to increase the prices, it falls on the management to do more of the work with less employees. It begins to take a strain on the body, especially, and the joy of showing up. I used to not want to get off of work. I found myself calling or stopping by on my days off, just to see how things were going and to interact with my coworkers and customers, alike. with-in the last 4 years, though, I have noticed a steady decline of moral across the board in multiple locations. Long time employees, especially management, have jumped ship."
good,"Supportive management, who work with your schedule and are reliable. Co-workers were great and a pleasure to work with. Not so pleasant customers."
good,"Its a great company. with many chances for career advancement, great place to work for, the only problem is when you are understaffed and DM's will not hire ASM's that puts a heavy work load on a SM, I worked two months open to close 6 days a week things burn out quickly......"
good,good place to work if looking for a job. Opportunity to grow within company. benefits and 401K plans and stock options.  overtime during peak season August -February.
good,"my work days are long, hard, fun and sressful all in one.  i have learned to use my time wisely. you find that some people are there to do their best and others are just there for a paycheck. hardest part of my job is trying to work in the budget i am given to run the store properly. most enjoyable part of my job is helping my regular customers i see on a daily basis and accomplishing the tasks given to me."
good,"I have worked here as my first job and i have no regrets. It is a great way to earn experience as a first time worker and working with customers every day is a great way to build communication skills. I am truly grateful of the experience i have earned here,"
good,"Enjoy bringing store to top in sales increases. Learned from resolving internal disputes. The hardest part of the job is unloading freight in inclement weather. The most enjoyable part of the day is when a customer comes in distressed and frustrated, I go above and beyond to make sure they leave with a smile and more than what they originally came into store for."
good,The Job was Very Nice..The store manager at the time of employment was very smart she knew the store inside and out. I am glad I worked there.
good,"Dollar Tree Distribution was a great place to start right out of high school. However, those 5AM shifts are hard hitters. They tend to hire on way too many people during busy season and then let ALL of their new hires go. My coworkers were awesome. Everyone helped others and we acted as part of a team. Goals were realistic and exceeding them offered extra pay for that hour."
good,Dollar Tree  is great company to work for they give you a chance to grow you work hard your team will work with you if you give them respect
good,I would look over the store to see if anything needs to be put back in place that was taken out of order. I learned how to handle the cash register. The work environment was peaceful and well managed.
good,"I enjoyed working for Deals (part of Dollar Tree Corp) the pay wasn't the best but the employees and management were a big family..We celebrated birthdays,the store manager bought lunch for the employees on occasion,and we did secret Santa at Christmas. Everyone worked together to satisfy the customers as well as get our jobs done . I would recommend Dollar tree to anyone that's looking for an exciting ever changing environment."
good,Get to work follow all of the daily action plans. Nothing new is being taught each day. Its just freight. Management needs more management training. If it's something they don't like they cut your hours. Some co-workers are good. The hardest part of working at this job is when management is negative. Best part of the job is meeting different people each day.
good,"My duties of work included running the cash register,cleaning,training new employees and stocking. I learned through my experience I learned to be more open up with customers. I managers were strict to the point where it molded me to take my job very seriously. My co-workers were great! We had a bond like family. I enjoyed interacting with customers from new customers to frequent buyers."
good,Typical work day is arriving to work and conducting a store walk to plan out the needs of the business for the day. I learn on a daily basis that no matter what you do the goal is to teach individuals the best practices for customer satisfaction. The most challenging part of the job is the turn of the associates. The most enjoyable part of my day is the interaction I have with the customers.
good,"I did more than the regular responsibilities, fun learning, great people to work with."
good,"Typically a day at DollarTree was busy. Cashing out customers and help finding what they need on the sales floor.We had to make sure that all breaks were covered,giving your cashier change, cashier audits ,damages.We also had to receive truck manage the stocking shifts were managed properly.I learned the ins and outs of being a manager in a retail store.Most of my co- workers were enjoyable, everyone could relate to each other and get along. The hardest part about this job was making sure everyone was on the page .The truck would always show up late. The most enjoyable about Dollartree was that you were always doing something different."
good,"My experience working at Dollar Tree was decent. I enjoyed the employees, I made friends with customers, and I was not stressed out due to the safe environment. Typical days where normal and moderate. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service because I enjoyed helping people and getting to know them."
good,"Great place to work.A typical day is very busy, I enjoy helping the shopper find desired items . There is nothing like the team work of co-workers rallying together to make through a rush .One of the hardiest part of the is dealing with a up set shopper."
good,"we unload merchandise from the delivery truck. organize it in the stock room, then put merchandise on the sale floor."
good,"As it was a small store with only 2 employees at any given time, busy days were quite chaotic with just one cashier.  At times, I felt very stressed with high pressure on me to ring as fast as humanly possible.  Not everyone has the patience that I do and I felt terrible for customers waiting in line.  Co-workers all got along and there was never a dull moment."
good,"a typical work day would be meeting with the crew sending them out with their work duties, working with new employees, manger duties ,making sure the days is fast pace and productive. have employees sign up with make a wish  and other foundation."
good,I loved Dollar Tree it was alot of hours to work over 90 in a work week due to the amount of people you had to work
good,A typical work day at the Dollar Tree consisted of assisting customers and keeping the store neat and clean at all times. i have learned to stay proffesional at all times with both customers and management. My co-workers were good to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to do various things at one time.
good,Dollar Tree is a good job that doesn't pay much. Its easy to learn and very systematic but there are also some flaws in the system.
good,Pay raise not guaranteed hours short. had to work at 4 locations to make ends meet
good,"A regular day of work consist of ringing registers, helping customers with problems, and cleaning the store. Being a high-volume store, we get a lot of customers on a daily basis."
good,The first day i was at work i had to run around the whole store and pit items back on shelves and stock more inventory. I learned allot about how to be a very fast past worked and had a very outgoing personality. The management was good they stayed on top of things. My Co workers were friendly and really taught me allot and said i was a very fast learner. The hardest part of the job was the most boring part of the job which was recovering all the items . Because i am a moving around kind of person. The most enjoyable part of the job was i always put the smiles on the customers faces.
good,i was a stocker who unloaded the truck and put the items on the neccesary shelfs. i learned how to unload a truck and condence items on the shelf or racks. and the management was great friendly managers who treated me right made me have fun at work even tho we was busting our butts unloading the trucks and stocking the store. but they was stirn and still lead us like a good manager should do. the coworkers was friendly and good people who worked hard. and the hardest part of the job was comming in sometimes at 1am or 2am after i had class at 10pm for SEASONAL STOCKING for the holiday items to come in the store. and the most enjoyable part was the friendly community and the nice respectable regular customers.
good,"My work shift lasts four or five hours. Most of my time is spent waiting on customers at the cash register. When I am not busy at the cash register, I am stocking shelves with merchandise. "
good,"I learned patience when dealing with employees under my supervision and customers in need of assistance. Also, I learned how to manage time and tasks in an effective manner, including times in which unexpected events happen."
good,got to be a cashier!
good,"Everyone had different task already assigned when workers showed up. The job taught me to work fast by myself, it also gave me better organization skills. Management was very helpfull and they made sure everything was in its correct place.The other workers were very helpfull also.You just knew you could count on them if you needed help with anything.The most difficult task of the the job was just unloading the truck with lazy people that like to waste time.My favorite part of the job was a chance to work by myself unless it was truck day."
good,"Great people, ok pay, ok hours, customers are usually crabby, you make friends with co workers"
good,Dollar Tree stores in an ok place of employment if you dont mind working part time and haveing your shedule change weekly i dont know if any og th same employees are there when i was but the other employees were very friendly and i enjoyed being around most of them
good,"Stock, Working delivery truck / frozen foods / hardware / cleaning supplies / electric supplies"
good,The company has alot of values and has some great employees. the amount of work for an assistant manager of operations is alot you daily duties is fine but add the uboat of products 2 to 3 of them and you have one associate in the building with you and you have to also ring customer . its hard to run the front end of the store when they make you feel like associate and not a manager
good,"great company but poor pay. Team work is very good, hours our ok."
good,My typical day at work was operating the cash register and assisting customers with various needs. I learned how to process orders. Our management team was good and my co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was when the company relocated and the most enjoyable part of the job was going to work everyday being greeted by our customers.
good,Wonderful people and company. Full time hours are hard to obtain though.
good,The job is ok for a first job thats about it. I worked just about every area in the store excluding management it was a demanding job but workers with me made it a little fun.
good,"Walk the store to verify everything got done for the day before...count money make sure to give everyone there task for the day ..check the proJect sales for the day,check emails to find out is any news about products \,cicle counts,any hold or destroy in general comunication from the corporate...my co-workes are great people ,a good team is the key for a good store...the hardest part of the job i think is the long hours to work...and the enjoyable part of the job is the people,customer is the way you start knowing all of them"
good,"great place to work,people are friendly health insurance no good"
good,"Good Company."
good,The stores I worked for were nice. The company overall needs to pay people better. For the work load we have as managers or assistants does not equal for our pay.
good,Dollar Tree eye feels a very good company to work for you just have to know how much to give and how to balance out your work as well as your personal life with them but overall I think they're very good company to work for
good,"Working at dollar Tree was a very good experience for me and also help me work on some of my skills there like my determination, my pace of work, and more"
good,"The thing about retail is the work is never finished, another truck is always coming.  Loved the job and environment i created in my store. DM was difficult at times.   Work/life balance always leaned in works favor. as the manager it rides on you."
good,All in all customers are really rude at times and so could the employees. The managers seem to have the high talerence of patience. It is a place to be when you need things or a job.
good,"We unloaded tractor trailers stached the boxes we unload on pallets, wrap them up and move them. I learned how to stack boxes on pallets properly. Manager was nice. It is super fast paced environment. They are super strict and you have to make quota everyday. That was the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting incentive pay for your work."
good,"I enjoy dollar tree environment "
good,"Very relaxed job, can get stressful with long lines but they usually have a back up cashier so not bad. Just do what you're told and you'll be fine. Plus very flexible schedule."
good,Dollar was a great company to work for. The associates thrived on great costumer service and the team work was outstanding. The management team was always supportive.
good,"Its a decent place to work, though corporate tends to send more than can safely fit in the back room despite constantly being told by management that there is no room, caused an onsite incident due to over stacked stock with nowhere else to put it during my time with the company."
good,"I worked as a manager did stocking, cleaned up everything, locked store, cashier, maintaining, managed employees, damage and shipment, overall everything that had to be done I did .. I hope you guys get back to me"
good,It was great working the dollar tree from pershing ave the one by basset center fired me for supposley drink in the job which it was not true that day i couldnt sleep and had to leave out of town
good,It was hot only got a 11 to 11.30 break did do the same job everyday and alot of walking u pack alot of stuff and clean it's just to much and they just put u on a job.
good,"They have become too micromanaged. I have become disillusioned with the company."
good,"-Attend to customers needs & concerns"
good,"Fun , easy place to work. Have to have good communication skills and good work ethics.need to be able to lift over 50 pounds and able to bend. Loved to manage people and work together. Need to know how to work an register and work with people."
good,It's a good job if you like to use your mind with problem solving and customer care. There is always room for advancement. I started as a cashier and within one month was promoted to part time assistant manager and within 6 months of that I became full time. Each position came with a raise.
good,I enjoyed it while I was there. I prefer faster paced or more productive jobs. It was pretty simple and easy though. I did pretty good working there and a job is a job.
good,"Just need better management iThink but , that's just my opinion. iReally do not have too many cons about them. The best thing is the benefits to me and the people are ok."
good,"It was a good place to work the employees were friendly and the store was fun to work at. The Manager I had was not qualified to be a Manager. He was not nice to his employees. Overall the store I worked out was very shopped and always a need for stocking , organizing, and helping customers."
good,A typical day at work would be 5 to 6 hours of work. Was a cashier I really love meeting the people. I got a lot of compliments on how my customer service skill where. Customers are always right.
good,I loved working at dollar tree but I quit because because I wanted something new. But when I quit I got marked as unrehirable but someone else was hired back in after they were non rehireable unfair
good,"Management was very good, I had flexible hours and worked around illnesses. I mostly worked behind register or cleaned the store and only left because of severe illness and disability"
good,As a store manager i felt that there was a lot of moving in order to make sure your sales where up. Productivity was usually good. Truck was always late and that brought your sales down if you didn't have the product people wanted pr couldn't seem to get. Not every place had a certain spot so there was a lot of shifting things around in order to have the product make sense. But it seemed very laid back until the holidays.
good,"I love to work there, but i am not getting enough to payoff all my bills. my manager was trying to give me more hours and still be fair to everyone else. but I am at the point that I need something that can pay all my bills. working at the dollar tree has giving me so much more experience. i love how busy it is and always kept me moving.."
good,"Most of the time I have a morning shift in which Im normally the cashier and stocker at the same time. While I don't have customers on my line, I do a U-boat full of merchandise. As well I help any customer that needs help or has questions for us. I also answer the phone calls when customers call. "
good,"working here was pretty fast paced, i learned a lot from as far as cashier and working customer service, it was a good learning experience. and good way of dealing with people with attitudes and working under pressure"
good,Working at Dollar Tree has been great. I have been able to grow as an individual with my work skills and I am able to use my customer service skills in other areas of my work.
good,A lot of long days and rude customers. I worked with a great group of employees that made up for most of it. This review is getting on my nerves though because I am just trying to look for another job and I haven't worked for Dollar tree for over 2 yrs. This is annoying!
good,as an adult Dollar Tree is not a place to work unless your apart of the management Team. its a job for a high schooler not a person with rent and bills. however my store manager and her management crew were awesome
good,"normal day includes cashiering, stocking shelves, management was pretty good, the hard part of the day was when we would have slow times and there isn't much around to do, the best part was customer interaction."
good,"come in and stock the front and cashier, blow up balloons, enjoy the shoppers, had fun with the co-workers............................................."
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work great pay good OT mng nice help if need be place to grow good benefits very safe place full of love and fun dont lay off workers at all
good,Dollar tree is a horrible place to work depending on your District/Store Manager. Cant get a hold of them and its urgent and not hear from them until a couple days later. They work managers almost 80 hours a week at times 6 days a week and get paid for 45 hours. Offers 1 compensation day for 5 extra days worked during the holiday season. They expect you to get all this freight out but not enough hours or employees but expect you to work extra hours cause your salary but no extra pay no compensation at all. Most dollar trees backrooms are very unsafe. They overload your backroom and naturally the manager is going to start stressing cause its their store.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves and over packing them with certain products"
good,"I would open or close, I would start up the store system and computers, then I organize stock room and fill in all the product that sold. I was also in charge of money management, responsible for getting change for the store and bank deposits,"
good,a typical day is being told everything you do wrong and nothing you do right if there is something you struggle with then your harassed about it. your not allowed to befriend any of your coworkers either.
good,"Have to work a minimum of 48 hours a week. 10 hour days 2 days off. Work all holidays, Have to stay past 5pm no matter how early you showed up. Pay is okay but they ask way too much for what is given, Higher ups do not know who you are they just look at numbers and judge you off of that. you will work rain or shine, through terrible life harming weather they do not care they want the store open to make sales."
good,"This was a fun place to work, the employees helped each other and worked together as a team. The management staff  was flexible according to the needs of others.  If I had not gotten sick and was not able to continue working I would have stayed with them.  I am currently looking to go back to work with them on a part time basis maybe as a cashier or stocker."
good,"Im not quite sure what to say for this review."
good,"A lot of moving."
good,Dollar Tree has as great comunnity aspect to it. You will learn skills that are applicable to future jobs. Scheduling may be a hassle. Always stay happy.
good,My experience at Dollar Tree gave me a first look into the working world. Great management and work culture. The most enjoyable part of working there was the co-workers
good,You got to be friendly hard working and respectful. I enjoyed the job the customers was not disrespectful. I was always on time went in everyday with a smile on my face and I got my job done.
good,I worked here while in highschool for work experience it was fun and really easy I work there again and it was just the same I had very nice employees and my manager was really nice I liked working here hours are ok
good,Good company to work for and it is a very great experience. Management is great and they are good people to work. I would highly recommend others to work for them.
good,I have enjoyed my expierence working with the Dollar Tree corporation. Great group of employees/store managers that work hard together as a team. Friendly customers.
good,"The pay is only minimum wage with no benefits. However, great for a second job or college students because of flexible hours, easy work and good management."
good,Retail is something I like to do. Assisting customers with their product needs and helping them check out the merchandise efficiently is what customers look for.
good,"Didn't get enough hours, but the management team was wonderful to work for, stocking and cashier work to be expected. Minimum wage only"
good,"Unbelievably flexible scheduling, perfect for college students who need to be able to call in on a whim. Minimum wage and simple work, shifts can be 4-8 hours depending on the task. For example if you're cashiering during a weekday it is likely that your shift is four hours, while weekend cashiering shifts are five hours. You may have truck shifts that are 5 hours and stock shifts between 5 and 8 hours."
good,"Working with the DT Distribution Center was a very exciting and challenging time in my professional career. A typical day at work involved identifying the tasks to be accomplished, gathering the resources and manpower necessary to accomplish the task and leading the team to exceed the expectations in order to be successful. I learned how to both lead a large group of managers and associates and also to understand the P/L portion of the business itself. Co-workers were very interactive with my leadership style and educational to the point that I learned to respect their KSAs (Knowledge, Skills and Abilities) that they possessed in order to create a atmosphere of success. The hardest part of the job was to continue to push hard everyday but as a part of Senior Management, not feel completely included as a Senior Manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the associates and the front line managers achieve and exceed departmental and company goals. This was very important to me that the team was rewarded and appreciated for their successes, individual or team."
good,"customer oriented retail dept store. employers were direct and to the point, and always spelled out the expectations of being an assistant manager."
good,"Dollar Tree is a great environment and productive place with amazing staff but the corporate sucks. Pay with no benefits at all. You can do an amazing job and one slip will lead you out the door. They have no care in the world how good you're doing until you slip up on something so little. They never hire, they only hire from within and you get no hours whatsoever. They expect you to work your tail off for only 4 hours and pay isn't even something you can live off of unless you're really desperate. Managers take up most of the hours anyways and some are so lazy and only like to boss others around. I will definitely never work for Dollar Tree ever again even if it was the last job on earth, they treat people horrible behind closed doors."
good,The company don't appreciate there workers. They use your expertise to train other people and don't move you up in rank to be train.
good,I learned to give great customer service and work with others as a team. Coach and develop others.
good,"Good job with the flexibility I need as I continue my education.  Retail requires multiple skills that include interpersonal relationship skills, attentiveness to customer needs and complaints to provide stellar customer service at all time."
good,for the past years i have learned alot of different things since this was my very first job. dealing with customers i got to learn how to be patient and calm on stressful situations.everyday is a new challenge because you never know who or what type of customer will come through that door and what problems they have.
good,I wish I was able to work more hours. But the short time I spent working at Dollar Tree I enjoyed it. I worked with other great employees and had decent management. Best part of being a seasonal helper is being surrounded the by the holiday spirit.
good,"Good hours, management was kind of bad, but overall this job kept me busy, and active. The only downfall was the hours."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fun, and full of laughter and smiles from employees and customers."
good,"So dollar offers easy work in a friendly place."
good,"Dollar Tree is a very interesting company to say the least. Nothing in the store is over $1 and surprisingly enough, not too many people know about the good deals they have. However, Dollar Tree will over-extend their employees. Its not like other retail stores where you have a designated stock crew, designated cashiers, maintenance, separate management team, and so on and so forth. Dollar Tree expects you to do it all. It wastes time with unnecessary things and expects you to get a million things done. Cashiers have to stock, cashier, blow up balloons, and clean up. Managers have to manage, do all the office work, go to the bank multiple times, stock multiple areas, unload the truck, order the truck, and all kinds of other stuff. It can be very overwhelming especially in a large store. Don't expect to have a life if you work here because the night after EVERY holiday you have to come in at three in the morning to set up for the upcoming holiday."
good,"Great place to work at, very fun and outgoing environment, the abiliy to work with customer and getting to know a few of them is very exciting."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is very busy. Thanks to Dollar Tree my interpersonal skills have advanced. The management was awesome. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the customers during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part was the management and co workers, they made the job enjoyable."
good,"Sometimes a day would include unloading the truck, then proceeding to stock everything. Customer service was always top priority. If needed, I would run register, or whatever else needed to be done. My coworkers were all great. I enjoyed to be able to get the customer what they needed, also help them with ideas. I also enjoyed making displays."
good,"Work short hours, got a chance to strengthen my cashier and store associate ethics. I just overall enjoyed the job"
good,"good experience ,meet nice people , work was always different ,like the fact of time management list for the day try and squeeze it all in kept me busy."
good,Very slow at times but was fun learned how to zone work a cash register. Co workers and mangement were cool alot older than me but were very quite. I mostly enjoyed loving close to my job.
good,"hardwork, low pay, great benefits great program for moving into management"
good,it was a good working enviroment
good,"Ordered store merchandise, unloaded trucks, stocked shelves and operated cash register."
good,"My typical day at work was to come in, start stocking shelves, or wait on a manager to tell me to do some other things. I learned how to put boxes of merchandise in the right place and I learned how to stock shelves. The management was great and my co-workers were great too. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck every Tuesday. The most enjoyable part was stocking the shelves."
good,"I started as a cashier and after a short period of time. I was learning skills of an assistant manager. Always there when I was needed. I was always willing to learn new skills to advance in the company. I was afford a assistant manager position. After a few years, was afford a store manger position. I loved working for this company."
good,I learned how to stick and handle money. Mainly better if your looking for a part time position since they don't offer many hours but overall a great company to work for.
good,I enjoyed my time at dollar tree but its not a place to make a career. The people you meet are really fun and my manager was EXTREMELY understanding and was willing to work with me in regards to my work schedule.
good,I liked doing the work a dollar tree and I liked the people working there and would love to do it again if given the chance to I would def do it with good spirits
good,It's a good place to work at first then goes down hill. Not alot of pay for the work you do for the company. It can be very stressful at times. Has good benefits.
good,"I enjoyed working here, the workers were all close and very helpful when someone needed help rather it be customers or other workers, i loved the mornings since it wasnt to busy so alot of work was able to be done before noon."
good,"I worked with this company for a little over two years. If you are willing to work whenever needed and carry yourself in a professional manner you can make management which only pays roughly $1.00 more than MINIMUM wage. So essentially you are expected to hold the keys to the store, and be available for opening and/or closing shifts, as well as most holidays, and be responsible for any other chaos that may happen while on your shift for a meager dollar more than your associates which you are managing. Then to add insult to injury, they only want to schedule you for ( at my store ) between 15 - to - 25 or 30 maximum hours per week DEPENDING on volume of sales!!"
good,I would work back there if they would let me get my job back. I would work back there. I really enjoyed my job. I also enjoyed working with the public
good,great environment and there are opportunities to learn new things especially in the management field. only thing bad is that is not great pay. good for maybe teenagers or first job but definitely not for a career.
good,"You will get great benefits as far as dental , 401K for your future but it takes dedication to sacrifice most of your days to the job. Overtime is a big part of The distribution center because they try to get as far ahead as they can each month, when working there just stay on top of everything so you won’t be a problem to the supervisor or your co workers"
good,"It was a great place to work at , nice hours the people were great to work with the really showed me all that dollar tree have to offer the breaks wer kind of short"
good,Dollar Tree hardly pays their employees anything. I was part time and worked more then 20 hours a week and barley made two hundred. 8 dollars an hour is not enough for the work your doing.
good,Hardest part is keeping help being paid min. wage. Getting trucks out and keeping up with planners are not too bad. company has a very good training program for managers.
good,I have great managers who work with me and will only ask of me what the will to themselves. The work with me in hours and will be fair and are trustworty.
good,When you clock in you are given a section you have to stock and you are given a task sheet you have to complete by the end of your shift. Sometimes you will have help on your task.
good,the management that i worked for was awful never again will i work for that certain location typical day was fine it was just the co-workers not all but the ones who would act like they your friends and then secretly wanted you out the dam door. can't trust them at all at the on candler rd.
good,I liked working there I just didn't like the hours I was given. I would work four hours for two day so I only had 8 hours a week. usually I took other people days if they didn't want it.

good,"The Dollar Tree in Palestine, Texas is filled with great workers who have all been there for years. They are a family and I was happy to be a part of it. The management team was wonderful and made sure everyone was happy."
good,"The company overall is not the best, the store I worked in did not have a working air conditioner during the summer and did not have proper ventilation. The bathrooms were also almost always out of service although that could be due more to the constant waves of customers using them than store maintenance. It is very easy to get hired there, you're almost guaranteed to get a job if you put in an application. They have a high turnover rate, but if it is a temporary position it is fine. The customers were not the greatest but that is to be expected anywhere. The management were nice but I did not like having to ask them for simple things like opening the register if I needed to fix change. There is not a lot of freedom there, which could be good or bad depending on your personality. Personally, I never want to work there again."
good,"Good management, and the right customer service is right there. The right people that are there will support you at an anytime period. But it's the right job for young ones to start at."
good,"A typical day at work is working hard getting things that need to be done, done. Helping Customers with orders. However, sometimes it can be a little stressful dealing with rude customers but overall working there is a learning experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers. Some customers can come off as rude, but some customers can come off respectful and fun to communicate with. For as the Management, the management is outstanding."
good,I unloaded trucks and loaded trucks by forklift and hand.The bad part  about working for Dollar tree was my manager seem like she didn't want me to move up in the company she just wanted me to keep working to departments for her.

good,"I am very happy to have worked for Dollar Tree the past 3 years. It was my first job and I was so passionate about it. I was granted independence from the start because my managers saw how capable I was on my own. They saw that I went above and beyond for my job and were happy to promote me. I worked for the Kennesaw Dollar Tree for 18 months under a great manager. She left and many different sub in managers came and loved my work ethic as well. They were interested for me to come work with them but I was living closer to that location at the time. Soon, we were assigned a permanent manager whom shared different views than I did for how a company should be run. She was later fired. I transfered to another wonderful location where Charles Graham was happy to take me. I worked at the Marietta Dollar Tree until July 2014 when I left due to pay."

good,My job at the dollar tree gave me cash handling experience I also learned the computerized cash register as well as gained more hospitality skills and problem solving to ensure quality customer service.
good,"I was hired in June of 2017 as a part time cashier. I get 1-3 days a week, 4 hours a shift and only get more hours if they need me early or someone calls out sick. It’s good as a second job. I work nights only so I can keep my 9-5 day job"
good,"most enjoyable part of work was to get to have the chance to help customers with their daily shopping, hardest part was the cashiering perspective of the job"
good,I had awesome managers .. Work was sometimes overwhelming but its do-able. I learned about team work and what hard work really is. I had my bad days and had really good days as well.
good,"Help Crew members speed up pace when we have multiple trucks to unload,good customer service,good with managing cash/credit on the register, stock items on shelves in the aisle,make sure zone area is clean,always on time, hardworker, respectful"
good,As a assistant manager was never a just doing one job. We gotta two trucks of the product in the store every week plus a frozen food truck. I worked all shifts and I stacked and did whatever we needed to get done to my the business done. If we made the sales the store manager bonus as well as the assistant managers.  Begin to become restless and gain weight. Went to the doctors because my blood pressure was dropping. Then I got the exciting message that I was carrying a baby girl. Had to stop working because of my health problems.
good,Dollar Tree was a fun small place to work with employees. It was my first job that I really enjoyed. At times it would get crowded that would keep me busy.

good,Nice work Environment great Benefits Reasonable wages most Enjoyable part Is working early mornings Having the rest of the day To do whatever
good,"A typical work night as a recovery employee you stay occupied with putting products in place, picking up products off the floors and that are out of place, making sure all the go backs are placed back in its home and facing products forward. Working at Dollar Tree I have learned time management and observed organization skills. To keep the store a pleasant and friendly place to shop all the employees work as a team member to provide great customer service. The hardest part of the job is recovering the store 100% with thousands of products within three hours and a half. However once the store is organized and clean as an employee you feel great about the store appearance."
good,"very good work place lots of fun, people were very nice and i learned about different types of products and multiple other things, when i worked i stocked many shelves and refaced shelves to make sure everything was filled, the hardest part was sweeping the entire shop floor and the most enjoyable was when i was able to work the cash register"
good,"I was in charge of the back room, unloaded the trucks, made sure the paperwork was correct, I also put the merchandise on the shelves had about three coworkers under me doing that also."
good,"Great Mangers Work With Schedule "
good,"Started out as cashier, but then was replaced by younger teens who did nothing but chat while standing around, when I was doing alot of hands on laber and returns."
good,"Fast pace,enjoyable workplace,great benefits. Great brand name items! Very friendly staff,ready to help the customer have the best experience while shopping the store. Keeping the shelves stocked is the hardest part of the job because of all the great values flying off them! Knowing that you have satisfied your customers and that they will be returning to your store is the best feeling you can have."
good,"When you come in, first thing to do is count the register you will be working with for your shift. Once it is counted you then open your register and begin taking customers. If no one needs help, you being to restock the shelves or put unwanted items back in proper place. I learned how to work a cash register at Dollar Tree. Management was good, co-workers were enjoyable. The hardest part about the job was finding the right spot for all the unwanted items, the most enjoyable was being able to help make the customers experience more pleasant & moving at a fast pace."
good,"stocking, cleaning"
good,Customer service and keeping the store clean and safe for customers were first priority.  
good,This is a good company to grow with if it is something you want to do I wish I could of stayed instead of moving I would still be working with this company.
good,"This was the best job I ever had! I just messed up three times, on my register. I lost my job. She couldn't keep me because there were no other positions available. It's good. I learned to be more conscience about my money. The co-workers at least with me, were not friendly, at first. There were no hard parts of the job, except when my shift was over, the most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,"My typical say at work includes recovering and cleaning the store, cashiering and some times stocking. I have learned how to be organized and how to handle money safely and accordingly. The management is great, and fair. My co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part is being nice to rude customers, and the most enjoyable part is getting compliments on how clean and neat the store looks."
good,"I have been there for a coupleof years. Had some good times and done bad times, but through it all if you don't mind a little hard work. This is a good place for you.. I look at it like this.. They are posting you just to see you workout!!!"
good,Need a part time full time job soon as possible let me know about the interview and if I gotta the job or what I really need a job know let me know something about the interview and the job
good,Great company to work for. I learned a lot when it comes to dealing with money. It also challenge me to think more outside the box when it comes to merchandising. Had a opportunity to open a new store and teach and train new associates. I also able to promote associates to management.
good,Pay isn't great but the hours aren't restricted you can work 40 hrs a week meaning you can get up to 80 hrs resulting in a $400-$500 paycheck if you want & they appreciate that instead of overwork you

good,"my type of day was busy, how to deal with people, management is different, co-worker was friendly, hardest part was rude customers, most enjoyable part job was the health benefits for the part time employees.."
good,I feel like the short time I spent there and the awesome co-workers made it suck less.
good,On a typical you work with various customers some will ask for your help most know what they came in for. Customers are pretty knowledgable about the product and will sometimes ask for new items making the day fun. I learned that off brand cleaning products work better that the more expensive name brand. My coworkers were great people to work with we all got along wonderfully. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks.  
good,"I enjoys working with people,I'm a very fast learning and hard worker, also good and problem solving many issues. I've don't every from janitorial work, clothing sales,food, and sales managmen."
good,"Dollar Tree is a good place to work, the people I work with are great and it was a good opprotunity, but they only offer part-time unless you are a manager and  I need full-time work."
good,"Dollar tree is a wonderful place to work, for me it was a temporary job but for others they have worked there for years. Everyone is very easy to get along with!"
good,"The job overall had a warming environment, but there were issues with the management team. If there were improvements on accountably and autonomy there will be a great increase in work morale."
good,I have been a manager for Dollar Tree for over 5 years I love my job but I'm ready for a new one to advance my skills inability to do better thank you so much
good,Dollar Tree has an advancement program that will help you to improve your skills and self esteem. The staff was very considerate and was willing to help anyone who wanted to learn and develop skills to move up in the company.
good,"I loved the management. It was an overall great environment on a typical work day. Things were great. There were always opportunities to advance. I'd love a second try,"
good,Dollartree is an ok company to work for i just think they need to increase pay for their managers because the cost of living has gone up and im a single mother and its hard making ends meet
good,"good environment, good customers, great opportunity for advancement and trainings"
good,"The work place was fun, I learned new things every day, see a verity of people, management was fun to work with, same with co workers. Didn't have a hard part of a job. was working for a company i love to shop at."
good,"Dollar tree was a good job for teens coming into the work face with basic math and reading skills as well as listening skills , it’s fit for working students also"
good,Very poor hours. You don't get paid nearly enough for all the things you do. My manager was a creep. He hit on every girl that would walk in the store and that including me. Employees were awesome and very easy to get along with. most enjoyable part was clocking out to go home.
good,This was my first job I was really young this job give me my first experience of everything but at times the job could has been stressful and irritating cause of the hours and pay but I had make everything work and last
good,"It is fun to cashier at the Dollar Tree. It's fast-paced and time goes by quickly. That's about it along with friendly co-workers. The pay and benefits are pathetic for a company that makes billions per year. Obviously it all goes to the top tier of management while their subordinates get paid wages that are not conducive to the cost-of-living. "
good,Don't really have much to say.
good,when i worked there i was the only male employee and the youngest.  when employed i had some instances of issues with my managers who were no wheres to be found when i needed them and couldnt lift a box above fifty pounds.
good,The company overall is not bad I unfortunately had a rather bad manager. The store was simple to run. Smile and be inviting and the rest falls into place.
good,The over all work place is pretty good but the management could use some work. There are some employees that are rude to the customers and even to the management.
good,"I believe the head bosses should come into the stores more often to see what is going on in business. And if there's going to be a manager and two assistant managers on floor at same time ,the store should be kept stocked, Were there to work. Not good off and 20 cigeretes breaks  in four hours"
good,"I would maintain store inventory levels.such qs duties i unloading shipments, arranging storage room areas monitoring inventory levels, and filling supplies on the floor"
good,"They don't let you have very many hours, they are firm on what they do. They expect alot out of you. They wont work with you on your schedule even tho you are only part time. you can not make a living off of it. you can not rise a family on it either."
good,"great atmosphere to work in, but pay is low and hours are scarce, benefits are not an option. "
good,It's a great company to work for if you are in management. As an associate you don't get scheduled very many hours but there is opportunity to pick up extra hours or shifts by working freight and picking up shifts no one showed up for.
good,"They have you work way more hours than you are paid for, they move the district managers around to much, very high turnover rate especially corporate level, hr and higher. And they get rid of people with no write ups or anything"
good,Well working at dollar tree it was not the best of best but i would not complain i was working..The DM at this job was not even concerned at all the managers sucked and we was working in hostile place of work...
good,I have worked my way up from a seasonal positon to freight managment its not what i thought it would be. Thepay is way to low  for all that is expected
good,This is a fair place to work. Customer's are nice as well. Pay could have been more.  Overtime would have been nice as well. Nothing more to really say.
good,"I have nothing to say.There is nothing I can say about this company. The customers feel entitled, they are stuck up, and think they are better than everyone else."
good,"I worked here for 3 years, never got a raise, never was recognized for my hard work, and the manager was petty and only bettered herself. They do take advantage pf you, especially if you're younger like me. The job itself is easy but not worth the low pay with no raise. as for benefits there are absolutely none."
good,I like the store and certain associates but I do not like management. It was an easy job to learn and do everything about it was amazing it was just managed poorly.
good,always busy but somehow never makes money. managment changes evey year. no advancement. no extra compnesation. to many egos
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was a relatively fun job to work at. I stayed busy either waiting on customers or stocking the shelves. My co-workers for the most part, were helpful with good spirits.The management at Dollar Tree was not the best. I feel there could have been better management there. The hardest part of the job I would say was when you were on the register by yourself and the line gets backed up.  The most enjoyable part of the job was looking at all the new products that we had to stock the shelves with."
good,"I enjoy working for Dollar Tree, meeting the customers with encouraging words to me, and I to them."
good,It's a half way good company I'm just part time no benefits and not enough pay I've liked working at dollar tree but I can not grow there 1just need benefits and this company does not offer them.
good,"It is a good job, but not one that I could make into a career. I'm looking for a long term and that's not what they showed me. The management was nice."
good,This job is ok not the very best but some customers were great and others not so great I always wore a smile for people so I try to stay happy some employees were not nice at all
good,Honestly my review wouldn't be all too positive concerning the location I was employed at mostly because of the lack of courtesy and professional decorum from the current store manager.
good,Normal day went smooth  opening the store  giving cashier breaks talking to customers helping them . Answering the phone . Receiving delivers from vendors. Stocking product. checking temps on coolers and making sure restrooms are clean. doing the store orders on the computer. Checking zero sales and emails. Making change for the cashier.
good,This would be an excellent job if they cared for their employees and offered either part time and full time hours. More benefits would also be a plus and some type of health insurance.
good,"The store I started at was wonderful, I loved my job. I transferred and was miserable from then on. The management was terrible and only looked out for herself. She ran off so much help that we never had workers left for the holidays. She also refused people time off, when given a very good and reasonable reason for needing off, because she didn't believe them..but she took off whenever she wanted without a word to anyone."
good,"It's all about customer service . Greeting and assisting customers. The worst times are during Holidays everyone makes a mess. The Manager takes away hours even if you ask for a day off or so. No vacations no benefits. You clean the restrooms, sweep, and Sundays you mop."
good,I was ecstatic in working at Dollar Tree and went above and beyond my duties to show how capable I am. 
good,I really liked working at Dollar tree. I would work mornings and be out of work by 2:30 pm-3:00 pm. I would also even have my weekends off. The management was great and understandable until they changed it. As soon as they changed the management everything was turned upside down. I was forced to work weekends and even nights something I was not used to. That's when I realized it was time to go and find somewhere better to work even if was nights.
good,"Very easy to understand expected work requirements"
good,"Really enjoyed working there. It was fun as my coworkers were very friendly.  I learned how to work with the different personalities that came in the store.  You would have certain customers that were rude and just arrogant, but I learned how to keep a smile on face and made sure I didn't stoop to their level.  I was a treasure to the store.   I had customer call the Corporate Office speaking very highly of me, it was rewarding to me."
good,"I enjoy going to Dollar Tree because it is non expensive and well organized. But, they change everything so often it's hard to know where everything is. Also the workers won't know where stuff is either."
good,"I really didn't learn much working for them, nothing that wasn't common knowledge.  There really wasn't any job advancement unless you were best friends with a manager already."
good,The stocking is easy you really just take the item and see if it fits if it doesn't its overstock if it does put it out. the unloading isn't hard just found it confusing or running out of space and/or carts most of the time. I always had to call in before i left in the morning to see when i worked because i never had a schedule due to a lack of a manager in training.
good,"It was an okay job, it wasn't the best thing ever. Honestly, i would probably never work there again. I loved everyone i worked with, but i hated the management. That was the worst part of the job."
good,"I learned how to make  displays, How to put shelving up on walls It was a good job for a short time but did not provide enough hours."
good,"Dollartree is a great store to shop at but as for working there. It all depends who and how ur managers are. I only recommend working here if you dont have any experience or need a quick temporary job. Besides that they dont provide you with hours usually 10-20 per week and schedules are never secured they always end up getting cut. No benefits, sick leave or days u ask off are never an option unless your manager favors you."
good,"It was very intense work environment. If you aren’t a quick learner it makes it hard for you to work there. The work pay isn’t they best, the company doesn’t really increase pay as much as they should."
good,Managers are not friendly. Hours and pay are horrible. I worked there 7 months and for the last 3.5 months I tried to advance myself and the manager wanted to drag it out. Than fave it to someone who didn’t know what they were doing.
good,Other than during the unloading the pace of the store was pretty relaxed. I enjoyed the customer relations especially at this store because a reoccurring customer was common.
good,I was there when the store first opened but has the weeks went by things started not to work out due to no hours and poor management. as well co workers  started talking bad about each other and other co works decied to not show up to work. Do then I went to work for some else due to better hours and better pay.
good,I was a store manager there for several years and the salary pay was very low for all the job tasks I was suppose to perform. There was days I had to stay over hours and extra days when I had no other employees to come in and cover shifts which would leave me with mandatory overtime and I never got paid any extra. I liked the employees I worked with but I didn't like the constant management changed and rule changes there was every year that made my job even more stressful
good,It was almost military like. We knew our job and what needed to be done and got it done without being told. I loved my job here just wish they paid more that 7.25 an hour and gave more than 20 hours a week.
good,Always a Very busy store. Managers are reasonable. Great products for just one dollar. Great Friendly environment to work in. Easy and liable job for anyone.
good,"Relaxed environment with plenty of room to grow within the company. What I learned from this job is how rewarding it is when stocking from a U-boat, and seeing your handiwork when complete."
good,Opened the store assigned other employees their stocking jobs than ran the cash reg. Counted down the cash registers and the safe. Unloaded shipping trucks with a group of 5 or less.
good,"You learn so much from a retail store but a lot can happen when you do more than what is expected. However, the workers there can be very competitive and to get to the top, the manager has to think you are worth."
good,there were things that could have been changed the management was not always considerate of its employees. the neighborhood didn't really make it any better but it a good company to get your foot in the door to working in the real world. it did teach patience.
good,"I would like to move forward in this company but I don't see that happening. I would to move onto something where I can grow in the company, so I'm on indeed lookin for something different."
good,"I love to interact with the customers as I do while I am at work.  I have learned that even in the midst of a bad day, I still need to smile.  The management and co-workers are good to work with.  The hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours to work so that I may take care of my family."
good,This is a nice place that for me is a no stress job. They have been always flexible with the hours I need. The customer service has been a great part of this job. For the most part management has been great.
good,Working there is not a full time career choice. Besides the low pay and short hours it is a good 2nd job.  My co-workers are very helpful as we are all a team.
good,"Very fast and easy paced work environment. easy to work with new people. Organized work place. Wish pay was higher, mangers are good and make sure you know what you are doing prior to putting you onto the floor."
good,"I had a lot of fun working for this company, but the hours were very short. I worked from 15-20 hours a week which was not good since I was about to start going to college and needed money for school. I enjoyed the co-workers. They treated me like family and they will always be my Dollar Tree family."
good,"This job is a good stepping stone or for people who are in school. Chances of getting full time are really slim. The process on decisions to put managers in place is... I have to say, Unfair, and its not well thought out. The district manager over Logan Utah, numerous times tried to advance on my boss, then made her life miserable  because she declined him."
good,"The location I am currently working at is a great location but the management is not the greatest. Pay is not good at all and you would need to have a second job if planning on having enough to pay bills. For a sales associate, we only get up to 2 to 3 days a week! That's less then $300 every two weeks."
good,"Great place for a first job"
good,"Seeing new faces everyday was fun. Then seeing the same faces was exciting aswell. Selling new hot items for a low price was awesome. Having goals to greet the customer,Exceed the customer's expectations and thank the customer. Was something I enjoy very much. All my co-worker and I were on the same page as customers came first! The hardest part about my time at Dollar Tree was when we closed the store. It was so much fun working there I didnt want to go home."
good,Working at dollar tree was kinda difficult .I lost my mother two months before me getting the job . I learned how to stay strong while working at dollar tree I had alot going on in my life at the time. I really didnt talk to anyone I kept to myself . The hardest part of my job was to put a fake smile on my face what I did like was that meant alot of nice people while working at dollar tree
good,"Checking out customers, Stocking Shelves, Blowing Up Balloons, Vacuuming Floors, Counting Drawers."
good,There was never any chance for advancement. It was a minimum wage job.
good,"Helping customers find what they want."
good,"A typical day at work would include counting the safe float , making sure all tills are set up, getting the cashiers set up with till numbers using the office computer which is connected to our POS tills.  Cashing the tills out for each individual cashier and making sure the excess funds are prepared for the evening deposit.  "
good,"i just stocked shelves,and the co-workers where great to work with"
good,"Co-workers were nice,very easy,i learned a lot,was a cashier and stocker."
good,"This job was my first job experience ever through a program called One Stop Arbor Training where they places me to do 200 hours and i would get paid every 50 hours I would complete. I worked as a team member and I mostly stocked store items, did go backs everyday. My co-workers where friendly, management was not my managers they people from the Arbor Training where my supervisors."
good,working at the dollar tree was a learning experience that i very much enjoyed i liked my co workers we worked as a team the management was good.
good,"General small retail chain issues include high turnover of poor management, no security personnel=danger from regular shoplifters and panhandlers, bathrooms often filthy, pressure to coerce customers to give to charity drives."
good,"I enjoyed my time there for the first two years, then I seen the downfalls within the company and why its impossible to succeed with the company. So many changes were made and tasks add for little pay."
good,"Just show up to work with a great attitude and know that stores that look great because they take pride in their workplace. When you love where you work, it shows on the inside and out."
good,Dollar tree was my first job. I made my way up to become assistant manager within a few months. Left due to better opportunities. Would recommend as a starting job. Really helped me become who I am and prepared me for other work.
good,"Although the job was fun and my coworkers where amazing the management at the Jacksonville,Tx Dollar Tree was lacking she was mean and made fun of fellow employees and would talk openly about them in front of customers. She was never understanding of single mothers and would scheduled me when she knew i couldn't come in, and i didn't get paid for the hours i worked."
good,"Management rotation a problem New Management came in Current crew is will there for a while. Some could be promoted due to their great work. I would return for 10 dollars an hour,"
good,good workplace nice customers. manager is always getting things done and making the store look nice as possible. nice customers and good coworkers. good hour as well
good,"Its just a job. Really there is nothing special about this place. I took the job as a way to keep so.e money in my pocket, but I'd I had Bill's to pay, there is no way I could have done that."
good,It was okay. It really depends on the manager and if they decide to work with your schedule.  But if the manager is cool. they make the job fun but if they arent you woke like the job.
good,The Manager there are Rood and nobody never last there in order for people to have the proper hours . But it's a laid back job you have to move quick working here but the customers are loved and treat u with respect
good,"I really enjoy working at my Dollar Tree not all are the same. I original was hired 20 to 25 hrs., however I only work 12 hrs., and if that doesn't improve I will have to look else where. I have learned that we keep hiring different people who leave shortly, and cannot understand why we cannot give the original staff more hours??? My manager is very fair, professional and very nice to work for. She tries to give regular staff hours when she can. I could go on but my characters are up."
good,"Very busy location , none stop costumers in line to check out , fast paced"
good,It is a mess  its a very stressful place to work at. sometimes they don't have the stuff the customer need out and sometimes the store be real packed and they dnt have but one cashier
good,I really did not like the job because they was unorganised and unprofessional. They don't get the job done the correct way. I felt like they was't giving me the  right attention as for me being a first time worker
good,This was the first job that I have ever had. Typical minimum wage job. Nothing that was strenuous. You were always able to get hours. My other coworkers were young so I always had someone to talk to.
good,I enjoyed working for the Dollar tree all though when I worked there the management wasn't good. The only thing I didn't like was that the schedule was always changed and that was the reason of my termination.because I have children I couldn't just work all these random hours they give you every week.
good,"Dollar Tree sits in a vicious cycle of having many problems and little to no solutions or care to fix any of the issues, therefore they grow and escalate and it's the smaller title employees that end up having to pay the price, but we are the ones who work our butts off with the smallest pay and smallest margin of hours given. No structure, and even the management teams at these stores are stretched so thin that it is ridiculous. "
good,I was working for this company for a year and very productive always had something to do in my opinion I enjoy working. There’s good people I would work there again but I’m more currently trying to get a home job for customer service repesentative.
good,"The work load isn't too bad. you must be able to multi-task, as you have to run a register as well as stock the shelves around you and directly in front of the registers."
good,The management at my particular store was great to work for they where willing to teach and encourage you for advancement. They had great attitudes and caring about actual employee.
good,I would not recommend dollar tree to anyone. The manager does not care to give their employees a break. Their schedule is not consistent. It is a very stressful environment.
good,"I loved my job, but no room for advancement and no full time positions available. I can’t survive off $7.25 an hour. Fast paced and very entertaining."
good,The district manager never help out our location due to it's area which was a low income area. Poor upper management led to poor workers. Upper management had no knowledge of how to run the cash register or had proper training which led to untrained staff.
good,"Acquired through ivrop. Great source of work experience. 3 months of customer service. Was working at 14. Learned to stock, use air machine, learned to communicate with people."
good,"Good place to work, slow paced, easy going enviroment. Nothing major with the job description at all. If your looking for something part time this would be the place to go!"
good,The work was OK but I was not told when I got hired on that it was a temp job. They work you hard and expect a lot from you with little appreciation. I didn't like that job.
good,"It was a great job very hot, but the people were friendly it was also good money and as long as you did your job they didn't really mess with you. Pre shift every morning"
good,Management was poor and hours were low. Employees were always quitting and leaving from the lack of consistency. Making transactions were easy for small and large purchases. Co workers were somewhat friendly but it is just a job.
good,Management was horrible at dollar tree. The other people that I worked with there were amazing. I had so much fun there. The manager and ASM bullied the cashiers and treated us all poorly.
good,"I was in high school, this is the perfect 1st job. Very flexible hours able to balance family life work amd schooling. Pay is minimum wage. Managers are salary."
good,"I have only been working here for about 3 months, and I do like the people I work with, but there are some rules that are just ridiculous. I'm not sure if its just the overnight manager, but no music is allowed. (Overhead music) headphones, I understand. But no background music. Also, the day people mess things up when they're putting stuff away, and the overnight people have to waste our time fixing what they did, and it takes away from out output count and if you dont have a certain amount of boxes done, you start loosing hours. There's not really any time to make your area look nice and neat and presentable sometimes because you have to get these boxes out, and nothing is allowed to go back into the backroom. You better find a spot for it, without making the whole thing look bad.If you try to explain this on your sheet, you're just told, the DM doesnt care about the why, they just see numbers. You get on a ""list"" if you go over or under a minute on your time. You cannot clock in early, it must always be on the dot. same with clocking out. and hours are hard to come by. at the most overnight people bet 10 or 15 hours a week if it gets really crazy. also the schedule changes so much, but you do get a call for a heads up."
good,"Lots of customer interaction. Helping people find what they need."
good,This is a very good company to work at if you have many things going on around you and just need that bit of extra cash. They always hire people. I actually started working right after my interview which was amazing.
good,I learned lots of social skills working here and also learning new equipment. very fast and stressful work but i always had a great time doing it.....
good,"The pay could be better, management was good, and they were fairly reasonable with my hours which was good because I have a5 year old son that I take care of."
good,shifts are often cancelled and or given away. Communication doesn't really exist with some. Inconsiderate to outside lives. There is room for improvement but anything is a start.
good,"A typical day is running the stocking crew while trying to stock shelves, build displays, be the front end manager, act as IT all at the same time. Its fun if you're a workaholic, exhausting if you have a family, if you want to advance it takes forever to move up outside of your store."
good,I was a stocker. I would stock selfs and make sure my isle was straighten up and looked presentable. And would help unload trucks and do whatever else they wanted us to do
good,"It was usually very busy ,start to finish . but I mainly worked the busy hours,because I was fast. people were generally pleasant.they put out their holliday decorations way early,and its first come first served.We went through quite a few managers in the year I was there.training one,and then the other .every body was pretty nice to work  with,good attitudes. the hardest part was dealing with unruly costumers. The best part was...meeting nice people ,their kids and their pets."
good,"My shifts are usually only four and a half hours per day with an unknown number of days per week. I have learned that sometimes it is so busy that there is a need for four cashiers at the same time. And other times it is quite slow. But it can still be productive by helping to sort and place items on the displays. Everyone gets along really well. The hardest part of the job is at the end of your shift and you have to count the till, not knowing if you'll be over or under by too much from day to day."
good,Dollar Tree was a fast pace environment. The Customers were always friendly and I loved my Regulars. The inconstant hours were a huge con. If it had regular hours it would be better.
good,I worked for two years . I like how they worked with my school schedule but this job is stressful in my location there's only two people working which is the manager and the cashier the manager goes on lunch and leaves me alone to take care of a huge line customers are rude and not understanding of the situation. Some managers are lazy and see you struggling and offer no help. I only put up with it to finish school . I believe this job is good for highschool kids and college kids because it's little hours and you get work experience.
good,I love the people but there are no benefits for anyone unless you are full-time.  I work full-time hours but I don't get benefits or any weekends off and those are the two things that I want in a job/career.
good,If you are looking for a place to learn customer service then Dollar Tree is the place to be.It is fast paced and teaches you more than one position at once.
good,"The Work is steady, but not overwhelming. The workers and Shift managers were for the most part wonderful. The overall store manager was rude, careless, and downright disrespectful. She is the only reason i left. She would change the schedule without notifying the employees. Other than that the store was great!"
good,"Easy job as long as all employees are on the same page. When communication is open, everything runs smoothly. This retail environment can be very seasonal, with highs and lows in productivity and sales."
good,Great place to work just not enough hours the store should be stocked correctly and the way it should be if I was managing it it would be customer approved...
good,At times I was able to do overtime even though I was pregnant at the time. Which made it a little challenging. Other than that the hours were great and the pay was reasonable.
good,Good place to learn the world of retail and advancement is encouraged. always looking for prospective employees to fill management positions. room for growth
good,"I was cashier but we as cashiers had to do pretty much everything we were in charge of restocking , charging customers & of cleaning & keeping the store clean . it was to much for the amount I was getting paid."
good,"I enjoyed working at my Local Dollar Tree in Sherman, Texas. It was an amazing environment, very welcoming and open. I had a good relationship with everyone there, and had hardly any issues what-so-ever. Sure, a little work drama. But there's always some somewhere. Besides for that, it certainly is a wonderful work place. Also, since a lot of newer jobs are start and move to another work place, there's always a chance to become management due to seniority."
good,"The hardest part is putting back all the restock people has left."
good,"Great place to work, always busy. Employees are friendly. Like to see my time and dedication go to a company that appreciates a hard worker and dependable person. No raises, no incentive to stay. Not much to show after 6 years."
good,"Managers need to pay closer attention to what is going on with employees. When the cats away the mice will play.. and sometimes right under their nose."
good,A lot of times i would be the only one there running the register and stocking. the manager would be outside smoking and would get mad if the line got backed up and they had to help. a lot of times they wouldn't. There is really no part-time insurance well it not really affordable.
good,Not the greatest place or safest to work they abuse you on when they want you to work. they dont care if you have a family....only they are important
good,"Help customers, ring up asap, and help locate products as needed.  Co workers work as a team. Hardest part was slow parts of the day and doing put backs."
good,"My day are well ,but sometimes you have them customers that will try and make you have a bad day but I'm always smiling. I learne that people will try to disrespect you as a cashier."
good,hard have a life outside of dollar tree. the upper management plays favorites
good,Enjoyed seeing all the new items that came in! Probably the easiest job i ever had and management was real flexible with my school schedule :)
good,Great place to work for students (18 and older) not many hours offered. but flexible with school schedule.
good,This would be a great first time job for anyone. Each position has it's own duties and everyone has a good relationship with one another.
good,"A typical day at work would be pretty normal depending on who you were working with and what day it was."
good,I enjoyed this job with early morning hours. There was always something to do and gave me alot of pride in stocking shelves and watching the products fly off the shelves!!!
good,"the atmosphere is okay, the staff is friendly and the consumers are great."
good,"Depending on the manager working depended on whether it would be a good experience or not. One was a thief who did inappropriate things (Mike), but the other two managers were enjoyable to work with and for."
good,"Ring customers items and bag them, when we were slow we would restock items back on shelves and clean the store. This place gave me more experience on how to handle a cash register. Managment was not that great one of the managers stole money out of my register at the end of the day after getting done counting everyones register. My co-workers were reliable and helped me out when it was needed. There really was not a hard part to this job. I enjoyed seeing customers faces always walking out of there with a smile on their faces knowing they got a good deal and excellent service."
good,as long as you do your job and stay busy there really are no issues.
good,"Used to be a great place to work, easy to stock, plenty of staff... I don't know how it is now, but there is never enough staff in my local store..."
good,A typical day was checking out customers and recon of the store.
good,Dollar tree is extremely tight with payroll. If they could hire more staff and get more stock on the sales floor they'd be even more profitable than they are now.
good,"This Was Also another Place That Had just Too Much Drama For Me, And All The Lies And Gossip That Management was speaking was unacceptable! Overall it was a considerably good place of business to work."
good,Management could have been better.  Overall the it was an easy job. Stocking and making sure we kept a clean store was not hard while maintaining great customer service and keeping the fast pace going helped a lot with satisfying the customers.
good,"Easy place to work at, fun enviroment and people to be around. stocking shelves was easy and fun to do. Running register was easy and fun to do, filling balloons was fun too."
good,I enjoy working there but I feel as if I need something different. I have 4 children and I need more than they pay me. I would like to have a different scenery.
good,Was easy work jus stock your U-Boat (cart) assigned to you and keep up your pace and you were fine really enjoyed this place got payed pretty good and was left alone
good,Still employed at Dollar Tree and not looking to leave. Staff works cooperatively especially with the lack of communication from manager regarding shift change requests approved then rescinded. More manager presence out in the store rather than in their office would be a huge help to the cashier who is the only staff the customer sees in the store. I enjoy working at Dollar Tree.
good,I really would have loved to stay at this job and do what i did. But some employees called in at the last minute and made it difficult for only 3 employees to unload an entire truck full of merchandise.
good,The district manager was not giving my store the same support as the other stores in the district. She told me my store was too far from her and would dismiss my requests for help when I didnt have but one assistant when other stores would get sent help from surrounding stores i would not when normally overtime was approved for the assistant i did have to help give me time off thatwasnotdoneforme either.  off
good,"I don't really have anything to say about Dollar Tree. Except I Suppose I Could Say I Honestly Did Enjoy Working There. The Customers Were Awesome. But I Do Not Feel That $7.25 An Hour Is Worth Working For Any Kinda Job, Because I Have Three Beautiful Babies I Have To Take Care Of &That Is Just Not Going To Cut It. And Only Get Ten Hours A Week."
good,Be ready to be dressed the right way in a dress or laise. Have a resame. Be honest with them about your schedule. Be able to work weekends a few times a week. Do your job when they ask you to do more then you are prepared to do. They went you to keep up with the cleaning of the store so that it is clean for the people who come in the door. The store must be stocked well and clean.
good,You must be a people person must be able to left 25-50 pounds it could be slow sometimes and very fast pace at times most be able to read lables to put things where they go on the shelves
good,"This job was very impersonal. Show up for my shift, stay late if needed, go home. Management always seemed over worked, an very stressed, which made the atmosphere tense. Although, with that I learned to deal with many different types of stressful situations. I became very quick at loading, and unloading freight. Learning the floor planning of the store gave me opportunity to help out in other locations.  Then was promoted to working at the warehouse in Ridgefield."
good,"I have been working for dollar tree going on almost 2 years. Part time Seasonal management as well"
good,Dollar tree was a good job although the pay could be a little better for as much and as hard a they expect you to work expeculy if you work over time there would be many days for the week where I would work all three shifts and still get up and come in the morning to do another do to some of the employees being a little lazy and just not wanting to show for work
good,"I enjoyed working at dollar tree it was very easy money.  Relaxing not to much drama.  Met a lot of nice people,  even ran into people I knew and also had customers come in just to see me personally just to say hello because they enjoyed my energy as one customer told me."
good,"I counted the safe first thing, put tills in drawers, stocked shelves and designed displays throughout the store. Corporate does not care about the employees at all. The management, employees, and customers were the best thing about that job. Pay was terrible, hours were terrible and the DM doesn't care about that store or the employees at all."
good,Enjoyed working here was able to show case my talents in different areas of the store being recognized for my hard work and dedication to the job. Maintenance of my time and understanding life situations. Fun friendly place to grow in
good,More team work needed and a better break plan.Dollar Tree needs more than two people in the store at a time.t he trucks never have a set day or time .
good,"unloading 2000 piece truck"
good,But if you're not receiving hours to work and they keep hiring new people for lesser pay. I personally like unloading the truck and placing pallet in storage room  good excersize and overnight stocking of shelves
good,This store will be a great store for those who are starting their work career.  Great opportunity to learn retail skills for later life. Or to help make you ends meet.
good,"Gather equipment needed to enter freezer dept to stock frozen food in a specific order to fulfill space."
good,The co-workers are nice and friendly but the pay is not so well. The customers were nice. I loved my job except the pay of course the District Manager is a jerk
good,I enjoyed working there but the pay as an associate wasn’t worth it with no benefits. Only allowed one 15 unless you work two shifts then you get a 15 and 30.
good,"I had wonderful managers when i first started working there, nearing the end of my career there the store manager was awful but he is now gone.  I am still friends with one manager there who is amazing.  I enjoyed working there doing stock, seeing customers, and the people i worked with."
good,"Enjoyed working for Dollar Tree, Would love to work there again and Advance in Placement. Easy going and Good Management, Definitely were Great with problem solving and getting the job done."
good,Working at Dollar Tree was productive in my personal opinion. It helped me a lot in a way where I learned more to communicate with people . Also how to manage the  cast register
good,"when i worked for management , i worked more then i should , company didn't care as long as the store was open. They did not compensate for the duties that were required."
good,i learned how to stock fast. clock in stock shelves clean a bathroom help cusomers when they needed help and cash people out if i need to because the front is swamped
good,it was too much for me work there also they paid everyone check after 2 weeks and its not worth it. every employees only work for 3 hours or 5 not more then that. also slow and too  busy and mess all the time.
good,"Super physical job.. this company is all about production and numbers. If you are not in standard they will fire you. good people to work with. the managers suck, choose favorites, doesn't team all team members equal."
good,"This job was okay. I like the people i worked with a lot , but the pay was awful. I couldn't work full time, so that sucked too. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. There are too many better opportunities out there."
good,"The Store is well organized. It's Clean, and eye catching. Everything is easy to find. They have public restrooms and good clearance sales. The bad thing is there are no Refunds just Exchanges."
good,All cashier positions are part-time and usually work two 4-hr shifts per week. Some stocking and putting merchandise back where it belongs. Staff is friendly and try to help out if you need to change shifts with someone. Since I'm an older retiree the hardest part is getting on the floor to pull the older merchandise forward when restocking with new merchandise. Enjoy talking with the customers about what plans they have for the things they bought. Management is reasonable and I really enjoy this job.
good,If you are looking for extra cash but not good for long term. My manager was cool but co workers had bad attitudes. I would work for Dollar Tree again but most likely another location.
good,almost all of the assistant managers are having affairs in the store and cause drama when they are there. they also try to get just about everyone fired that doesn't kiss their and the store manager wont do about it...
good,"Nowhere near enough hours or pay to make a living. The store is normally a wreck and stresses me out more than it's worth. Good as a part time job for people who need extra cash, but not a stand alone job."
good,"During my time of employment, I had to endure a lapse in hours making it hard to pay bills. I was promised hours I didn't receive."
good,"Ive only been there a few days ,but iI like the friendly work environment..It is a busy place and shelves must stay carefully stock ,must be care when handling glass products and remain friendly to customers."
good,This is a good job for first timers. Learned valuable cash handling and basic computer functioning skills. The most enjoyable thing about working for Dollar Tree was seeing the customer’s smiles at the end of every day.
good,It gave me a job. It wasn't too bad working there. Most of the employees were nice which made working there much easier on me. They were understanding with personal situations.
good,"Good to work there nice people and customers. learn a lot just not enough hours, they all where great team players. They need are better delivery plan but team work was very good"
good,"It was a good work environment, fast paced and plenty to do. It is a good first job for someone starting to look for work. You mainly provide good customer service."
good,a typical day at work would be arriving on time being dressed for work properly with store apparel and clocking in on time and getting my stuff in my locker and then getting my cash register ready for customers . and while not buy i would stay busy by cleaning the store and arranging the store items . i learned that people like it when you are nice and have a smile and answer them with a response to a question exactly hoe they asked you . or if they are looking for a product you show them where it is at . my management team was very nice but professional. the workplace culture was very outgoing and was very big on advertising the store and the store products.the hardest part of the job was nothing it was super easy the most enjoyable part of the job was getting a discount and break
good,"I work early moving stock from the stock room to the sales floor."
good,"little chance for advancement enless someone gets done.  Will hire outside instead of advancing employ. co worker were very pleasent to work with.  expect alot for short hours.  customer interaction was enjoyable.  all jobs except manager and as merchandiser manager are part time, 20 hours a week or less. distric managers and managers from other stores very helpful. give each store the tools and help they need to be successful. if you like fast pace you will get it here."
good,"Dollar tree was a okay job. While working at the job , it helped me improve my customer service experience. The job was fairly easy but I honestly didn’t like the manger."
good,"very rapid, busy, customers return sometimes daily, management was over worked, workplace was fine. The hardest part of the job is there was not enough workers. One cashier, one manager, in a busy store. Enjoyable part, helping customers."
good,"Primary focus is cashiering - get the customer's checked out in a timely manner. "
good,"Very busy store, friendly atmosphere, hardwork, I learned that you have to be respectful and nice to customers. I greet them and try my best to give them the respect they deserve"
good,"Really enjoy working with the other employees, but the hours and pay need a lot to be desired. Not great training when you start and a couple of the managers do not do their work which makes it harder on everyone else that does care about the stores appearance."
good,"hours are not even part time hours there is no consistency with schedules, no benefits what so ever.Overall i liked working for this company for as long as i did but there wasn't a chance of me going anywhere or moving up and i the company doesn't give enough hours"
good,Working at Dollar Tree made me realized what a great passion for customer service I have.I learned that no matter  what color you are your a human and should be treated all with respect.All classes go shop at the Dollar Tree.The hardest part of the job was stocking all drinks and at the same time recovering all the store on a Friday night.The most enjoyable part of the job was watching kids be so greatfull because they got that toy they so dreamed of for a buck.
good,Well the one I worked at the storage room was very very dirty and manager wouldn't let me throw out the trash bags even though I offered to do it. I didn't last there to long place was a mess. It's all about the management though I'm pretty sure there's some great dollar trees out there
good,Good company but hire up management don't look out for employees far as wages  an relatonsship new manager in store and she gets things done very hands on ...she help around the store trys to keep it stock up real good keep the store neat.she what we needed cause last manager did nothing but tell people what to do and that wasn't working for us glad Ms.Sjhannob turned it around now we meeting sales an getting more customers..
good,Always really  busy especially on weekends and holidays. Store needed to be more organized . There was lots of drama and gossip between management and co workers.
good,It's a great place to work if u are still in high school or are attending college. I would only recommend  this place to students  not for someone who already has a family it is not worth the pay.
good,The job wasnt bad. They just dont give you any hours. You work 2 days a week. So you know the pay isnt that good. If they gave more hours it wouldnt been as bad.
good,"Took the job for Holidays and was asked to stay on for the most part is a Good Company, work ethics of some of the other cashiers is not the best, a lot of call in"
good,"Enjoyed being busy"
good,Good job for young workers who are new to working or need a part time job while going to school. Easy to learn and pick things up. Can be hard to get more hours.
good,"Fun, diverse, and different. Needs improvement in the OCD expectations of the employees on the clock at time which there were never enough hands I would say there was always need for at least one to two more sets of hands in order to complete all the tasks required of us employees to the perfectionist type levels that were wanted. However, still delivering the perfectionist expectations and wants to the employers was my personal goal no matter what."
good,"At first it was great could not wait to go to work. Then things changed. Management would be nice to you one day then the next stab you in the back. To much drama there witch management should have taken car of but they were a lot of the problem. Promise a position to one person then offer it to someone else as if they never asked the first person. They would have favorites right  some people up for things that everyone should be written up for, but did not right up some people at all. Dont get me wrong I did love it at first but when you end up in the hospital and told you job is safe because they know you are on disability. Then being told you have no job when you get out."
good,all the roles of a cashier. I count money. Help people check out. Ring people up with their items. It is a great store to be employed at. The only thing is the raises are not high. No room to move up .
good,easy but boring. Not much to do once the shelves are restocked and the floors are cleaned merchandise is put back in it's rightful place.
good,The one i was at some of the management wasnt hitting on to cents thats the main reason i quit... it was a part time job with little hours but it was worth it
good,I was doing jobs that a manager is suppose to do. Since the managers didn't want to do their job right my store manager started to train me to become the next assistant manager.
good,"At dollar tree I worked well with my co workers , and also worked well under the supervision of my manager. Every task giving to me were completed on time , and sometimes before my shift was initially over. I loved everything about my stocker position at dollar tree. No bad complaints against me,or from me about this company... Thank you......"
good,a typical day should consist of you getting the job done a timely fashion but to the best of your ability. you should also be able to learn something the task at hand for the day.
good,"I started off with 30 hours per week but after a year I had very small hours, 8 hours per week, after a while it wasn't worth the drive anymore for just 8 hours a week."
good,Not getting enough hours for working harder for miniumim pay rate..Nice boss I have very reasonable to talk to and work with your schedule.
good,Dollar Tree does not have it's employees backs. They pay part-time and full-time assistant managers terribly. Our current store manager is incompetent. The job should have gone to the full time assitant manager.
good,"Helping customers, stocking shelves, running a cash register, filling out necessary paperwork , counting drawers and safe for opening/closing. I learned leadership. How to handle different situations. I liked working with the customers more than the management they have there."
good,easy people to get along.work is very challenging and gotta be fast at the cashier. hardest part was restocking the shelves when they were already fully stocked of product. management was very nice ans strict and knew what they had to do to get the job done.
good,Stressful and Exciting.I learned how productive and responsable .management  is not no walk in the park you got to be focus.sum of my co-workers were cool n others didn't need the job
good,"If you don't have a family it's a great place to work but if you have a family it's expensive to keep insurance, and be able to pay bills."
good,"At Dollar Tree I would help out the customers by ringing up items and well as helping them find what they need. Also, restock, answer phone calls, and maintain store neat and tidy."
good,"Management is not doing their job.  Not a team player!  My co-workers are great but people leave all the time.  Lifting is the hardest part of the job.  In spite of everything, I Love my Job!  It is always FAST AND FURIOUS!  Makes the time go by quickly.  As a manager I/We work through our breaks because it is so busy.  There is always something to do.  I am a bit OCD!"
good,This job was okay until they dont need you then they fix it so they can fire you. So unfair to people especially when you like your job.
good,"Clock in, count register, stock bags, greet customer, clean around my register, put go backs away, deal with mostly rude customer, take ten minute break, mainly work by myself because there are only 2 cashiers and the other one is cleaning around the store, clock out and go home."
good,Working for Dollar Tree Stores is way different from working for the Distribution center in my opinion its better to work at the Distribution center in Joliet IL.
good,"I will go to work sign on and organise the lunch breaks for staff working that day, ask store manager what he wants done and I do it. "
good,"Dollar Tree stores by all standards produce a heavy clientele. A typical day starts out busy and ends busy.  Opening consists of setting up diagrams for floor and setting up store. Heavy cashier volume at all times. My co-workers were friendly and hardworking. For myself there was no task to difficult.  However, at times it called for much physical labor.  It gave me the opportunity to meet many interesting people.  I enjoy the rapport I had with all my customers and still continue to have although I am no longer employed by this company. It gives me great satisfactions in helping and assisting others with their needs."
good,"If the correct management were in place, and all the employees did their fair share, the company would be a better success."
good,I would clock in and start stocking. I learned to do just you need to do. we only had one manager she was barley there. I love my co workers. the hardest part was doing truck by myself I didn't mind it but would of loved to have help the enjoyable part was seeing interesting people.
good,job was a little difficult. management was always picky about certain stuff and if u don't follow the rules u will get wrote up. its alright working for them but u always have to deal with rude customers. wouldn't recommend for people that get impatient easily. basically its a good job for college kids but not for long term.
good,"on an average day I started my day checking in with my supervisor to find out in what area of the establishment I would be working. Duties included setting up tables, counting tills, ensuring area was clean and suitable for customers, facing and/or restocking shelves."
good,"I was a cashier, My typical work day would be count my draw make sure I had enough bags on the front line. Excellent customer skills was a plus. I mainly worked evenings, at the end of my shift I had to count my draw, the Manager would make sure  my draw was accurate. I would then have to put away all items that the customers did not want at least 6-10 baskets of items and then vacum the carpets and restock the coolers with soda's."
good,Loved working here! All the coworkers were full of energy and were tons of fun to be around. Always made customers feel welcomed and they always seem to appreciate our hospitality.
good,"A really comfortable place to work. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people everyday, sometimes the usual and helping them find or suggest something they might need or want."
good,My co workers were nice and friendly its just I accidently had 3 dollars over in my counter the 2nd day i worked there and had a immediate write up no warning or anything.
good,Manangemt was not in control of the store like they should of been and the workers would do just as the want to
good,"Overall my experience at Dollar Tree was very productive, I gained a loyal bond between so many customers. This job has given me a better outllok on life, it has taught me to be more gentle and docile in a hard world."
good,Great place.to.work. Time went by quickly. Co.workers were great to work.with. Always busy and had something to.do
good,I want to work back here
good,Dollar tree is a stable company that will always be around. A decent work environment but definately underpaid.
good,"This work place needs security, better hours, better managment, along with better pay."
good,Its a nice place to work. You get to see new products come through the check out. Easy place to work. Nice people to work with. Great place to shop for the holidays.
good,The pay and hours sucked. Had to leave my job due to $8.25 per hour and maybe 15 hours a week at most. Other then that I really loved my job. Nice and friendly atmosphere..
good,I worked there for a month. The staff is friendly and most of the customers were too. I worked the cash register and cleaned the store. We did recovery the last 30 minutes every shift.
good,"I made two attempts to advance in the company once I felt I was becoming too advance in my position, but my managers turned me down both times insisting that I wasn't ready. The third time I attempted, they hired someone else and had me train that person for the position. I felt it was time to leave."
good,Management needs a major overhaul to much favoritism there. Warehouse is not kept in a neat manner. However the work is steady and there is plenty of overtime.
good,"Was a good temporary job, flexible with work hours. Nice co-workers and management . Standing for entire shift usually decently busy during day time hours"
good,My position was enjoyable yet somewhat stressful at times. In which i was often Times so busy helping customers or associates(cashiers). I had little to no time to complete my tasks
good,"Overall is a good company. The store was under new management so times were a bit stressful just trying to get the store back to a better , more functional store. Where customers felt safe and comfortable shopping."
good,"You'll always have something to do. Take out trash, greet and help customers, cashier, stock shelves, gather carts. Schedules are flexible and usually a decent amount of hours per week."
good,I work my butt off and I go to other stores that need help because its hard to find good help these day. If you work hard and take pride in what you do no matter the paid is you show you hard work you can move to managment fast and that is where you can get paid good and get benefits. I think all employees should be able to have a choice for heath care. We all need it these days.
good,"Working with them was great, the employees was very respectful and helpful if we were busy or something came up. I would recommend this job to someone looking for a part time job."
good,It was very easy but under employed making truck days painful. Needed more space to store things and harder to find things to put on the floor. Finding things to stock was hard because you didn't want to over stock one item. I really feel if Dollar tree was given more hour to people they would come to work more.
good,"My experience at Dollar Tree has been filled with mixed emotions. The company expect great service from employees, but the pay does not match the amount of work and quality of work from each employee. Dollar Tree need to increase their pay rate in order to keep good employees."
good,Dollar tree is it friendly place to work but doesn't give very many hours unless you're management it's only 12 to 14 hours a week at minimum wage! You can move up fast
good,"If you are only looking for extra money or a part time job while in school, dollar tree is great. Unfortunately, no full time positions are available unless you are management."
good,"Easy pace going, how to stock the products in the backroom in a timely manner, workplace was decent, being rushed by the drivers and co-workers. Getting off at a decent time of the day"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. Wouldn't mind working there again. I am available to begin working with this company again. Re hire me. I am a great
good,It was really great to work with customers and the team work that was there was amazing. My co-worker and managers had a lot of respect and they were able to teach you new things if you were willing to learn them.
good,"It's a pretty simple job to have. You stick shelves, cash out customers and clean in between. There were times where the store would be exceptionally busy and a little stressful. But, all in all, it's not a bad job."
good,"When I worked at Dollar Tree I enjoyed all of the staff I worked with. The downside was they didn't offer full-time to staff when I was an employee, but they allowed me to move from position to position to see what I enjoyed the most."
good,the job was simple and easy to get the hang of. the systems are extremely outdated and often had issues. the management at this particular location was not so good in hygiene and had a lack of respect for the store.
good,"Inconsistent schedule and not enough hours."
good,Good job bad schedule easy to do shipping and receiving and easy to learn computer and paper work strict but easy rules and regulations to good training and co workers
good,They'll tell what you need to do during the interview  and not let you talk they really hire anyone because if the consistent quiting . They are really caring and friendly and easy to get along with your coworkers
good,I liked the job it just wasn't enough hours or pay at all I was getting the smallest about of hours like 14 every two weeks on minimum wage I couldn't afford anything at all
good,"Working here at base isn't worth it, hours are less than stellar, pay is what makes it worth it, customers are a hassle but that's to be expected. Trying to advance is difficult,  a job full of empty promises"
good,are an okay job for a second job to help you with change money good hours also and flextime good manager relation always but not benefits not discount
good,"I like dollar tree but it's getting to the point it's not helping me survive in this world I have 2 kids to support plus my boyfriend's 2 girls, dollar trees not cutting it any more. And I also need 3rd shift hrs witch dollar tree does not have"
good,"Was a good place to work: Nice, friendly, reliable, outgoing, always willing to help staff. Easy flexible hours (until I became a part-time assistant manager)"
good,The best employees and management at the store are great to work with and work hard. They also keep a safe and clean work environment. I feel that the store was a good place to work but lacked any advancement.
good,"Dollar tree is a great place to work for your first job. They only give out shifts that consist of four hours, with the mandatory three days a week to work. Good if you need a second or first job."
good,Certain managers made the work day not so good. The job was very fast paced for the most part. There weren't enough workers to keep up with the customers on most days.
good,I am just trying to figure out why you guys are so worried about Dollar tree having such a great job I wouldn't be looking for another jobI really do not have anything good or bad to say about the company I'm still presently working there
good,Has very high standards with no recognition or acknowledgement of a job well done only what wasn't done and it kills morale doesn't pay that well can barely even get a 25-cent raise when minimum wage goes up a dollar as a full-time manager doesn't believe more responsibility deserves more pay and  would probably pay everybody minimum wage if they thought they could get away with it without everybody quitting
good,Working here was amazing loved the management and employees. There just wasnt enough hours. I would still be working there as a second job but my first job did not want to work with me.
good,"When I got hired before Christmas I was working 20-25 hours a week, and now I'm lucky if I get 10. Co-workers create unwanted drama, and get into everyone's business."
good,It was a nice place to work but when there was new hiring those who were there before hours were cut. Management was not working with the schedule of students.
good,This job would have been a good one had the manager actually follow through with his promises to schedule you for the work week.  I left because he never gave me any hours to work during the week.
good,Everyday is fast paced. you have to put out as much product and the company doesnt matter how as long as its out. Management depends on the store. not all stores are the same vibe.
good,Over all  i liked working there and like the people that i worked with was very nice and helpful and i probably would have stayed there if i would have working at a different store  but it was the Manager that made it to where i didn't want to be there.
good,good place to work for students and people who want a part time job. the pay is not what i would work for but it is a job. the store needs security for the people who like to take things and not pay.
good,Great place overall. But not a place to grow a career in. I wanted to stay as long as possible things just didn't work out. My family was growing so I had to find work elsewhere.
good,"Over all I have enjoyed working for Dollar Tree. Always bubbly staff, an great communications. Very upbeat surroundings, new obstacles an questions everyday. Hard not to learn something new. Ide have to say the hardest part of working for dollar tree would have to be keeping up and staying out of the way of the hundreds of costumers going though the store daily. Most enjoyable would defiantly have to be the communications of the staff always upbeat, charitable, an all focused on the same goal. Greet the costumer, Exceed the costumers expectations, an Thank the Costumer."
good,"good place to work for someone looking for part time job, meeting different types of people, some friendly some not so friendly, management is usually pretty fair about needing to switch your hours and making sure you get your breaks."
good,"Nice place to work. Wish there were more hours because 10-15 hours a week (average) is VERY hard to try to live on.  Mgmt was good, work was fun, and customers were awesome."
good,Working for dollar tree was a part time job I had while finishing highschool. It was a great job and I got all the hours I wanted they also worked with me when I was sick.
good,Management does not allow for much family time. Personality effects work culture and being a friend not a boss makes employees act like children when not given their way.
good,the worst part of the job is that they give you very few hours per week and the pay is only minimum wage. it is very hard to support a family with part time/ minimum wage work
good,You needed to have excellent customer service and good math skills. Management was good The store was not always to keep up with but it was easy and you get to meet new people everyday.
good,Dollar tree is a great first job for someone i suppose just not a forever job. Pay is very wack. Hours are complicated. One week I’d get 29 hours then the next week I’d get 20 then it would drop to 15 then back to 29 all over again. Lots of work but little pay basically.
good,"Productive, and accelerating physical, fast pace, You have to enjoy making people happy, be familiarized with the stock and willing to initiate and help assist the customer to be informative able to emphasize that you're there for them.  You must be a good listener well-cultivated most important ability to count money."
good,"My time at dollar tree was an above average entry level job. most of your employees are in their late teens which means they are a bit inconsistent as far as coworkers, but they're usually pretty fun to be around. Management is stressed by the inconsistent nature of the employees and business, so they can be a bit blunt, but overall I'd say they did a good job teaching me what I needed to do and encouraging me."
good,Started working on the night crew. Job consisted of unloading truck while stocking items on pallets. Setting up floor displays and restocking items on selves.
good,"Dollar Tree is good for the college kid who's back from school for the time being, not for a man who's starting a family. If I was offered Assistant Manager, I would stay."
good,"While dollar tree is a decent company to work for I would say that it is best for young people who are starting their career and are willing to stay with the company long term, i would not recommend it to someone as a mid career choice. you learn how to operate different types of equipment and to pick orders for the stores. while most of the management is good there are opportunities for improvement as with any company. the hardest part of the job is learning how to do the job. the most enjoyable part of the job for me is the ability to learn new things."
good,honestly since i work maybe three days a week and 4-5 hours a day its not that stressful of a job at all you. you go and do your job. the staff is really nice and its kinda like a family  but you do have a uniform there. you get ten minute breaks instead of 15 but it ok.
good,"It was a great experience, I needed more than 5 hours a day. It has a lack of organization . I am a determined worker. I will recommend anyone to this job"
good,We have to put together the back room and organaize everything before the truck is in possition to open the door and in  my opinion is not a good option to open the door until everything is ready.
good,"Liked working with the people there, stocked shelves during the morning, plus checked out customers. Unloaded the trucks was the hardest thing sometimes it was 2 or 3 fully packed. Working with the stockers made it go by fast, and quick because we pulled together to make our production 100%."
good,As my first real job i felt very welcomed and capable. I was the youngest employee but was always recognized for my achievements which was nice but also motivational.
good,Relatively a good place to work but schedules should be more consistent along with better pay.we are told specifically when stocking shelves in dollar tree that we are to push out as much as we can regardless of what it looks like after we are finished.
good,"Its a good placer to work for,  fast paces enviorment, learn new stuff, its a good placer to be yourself. Alot to learn exspecially if your just starting out In the work areas, good to work if your still In high school they work well with you."
good,"While I love working here, the reality is that middle management is not very hands on and the ""talent"" that gets sourced here as of late is lacking, to put it mildly. Advancement opportunities are few and far between and the salary bump for taking on the litany of responsibilities that will fall on you once you do get that much desired promotion is miniscule. Everyone here is good natured but that doesn't excuse the inefficacy rampant in the building. Middle management is comprised mostly of people waiting to retire who are just doing the bare minimum to not have to explain anything to upper management."
good,This was my second job and I had worked on and off for 3 years. This job kept me aflot when I moved and it was decent work. I had to leave because I was layed off.
good,"I loved being a cashier and assistant manager. I enjoy working with people. I have learned that in a business sense, the customer is always right regardless."
good,"The pay was $10.75 hourly could of been a bit better when working night shift doing stock , putting items on shelf's was kind of heavy but very simple and quick."
good,"It’s very smooth and fast pace working "
good,"i loved working at dollar tree. enjoyed the coworkers and customers. it was a steady place, there was always something to do when it was slow. always kept me on my feet and busy so time went by fast"
good,I didn’t stay here long but it’s not to bad . When your stocking the shelves it’s just little things . I think anyone would do great working at dollar tree.
good,"To much work, low page range. To much work  to do and projects included in just less than 5 hours per day. The possibility to rise your salary after a year are really hard to get. wide variety of products and good prices, but poor customer service culture"
good,Scheduling was convenient worked full time fast paced company always kept busy liked set up according to planner helped with receiving open availability overall excellent opportunity to work with customers providing exceptional service
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work if you wan to earn extra income only. I t would be nice if the gave there employees full time . I love working with the public and everyday is something new at the store
good,"District Manager is not sociable or customer friendly.  Some management in store works well with other employees, listens to them and helps them with schedule and other areas."
good,"its a busy store, learned to deal with people better.  Management can be better, by firing people that shouldnt be there anymore because they dont work and the ones that do have to pull their weight.  Also by giving the hard working ones more hours instead of cutting them.  The hardest part of the job is getting people to actually work , the enjoyable part is making friends ,getting praised"
good,"it was an ok job for me to start off with after I graduated high school and was getting ready to start at Pickens tech college. Other than that, they only did drug testing if they can tell you were under the influence of weed  or if they smelt alcohol in your breath. I got pretty much all the days I requested off. Cons: I had people in management who just acted like kids as in if you had to ask them to void items more then twice and the customer even said I just don't want it they'd start yelling at us workers and slamming doors and only making $8.50 wasn't enough to deal with adults who acted like that plus dealing with rude customers"
good,Nobody was doing there job on time or correctly. Breaks where not being taken on time. A lot of stealing was involved between the costumers and employees.
good,"A typical day at work includes cashiering, recovery meaning cleaning up the store at night. Some of the management sucks but others are fine overall they work pretty good with us."
good,"Thursdays and Friday's were the typical work days."
good,no comment it could be better and if they paid more I'm sure the employees would stay longer or would not have second jobs however the management was very nice and always supportive
good,"This is a fast paced and hard working job, it is worth the pay but the hours are not enough for anyone to live off of. better suited for first time job seekers and applicates"
good,"I really enjoyed working for The Dollar Tree, the people i worked with was encouraging for my schooling and very supportive. The customers that came in was great to talk to and easy to help them with their needs. I made great friends with coworkers and customers that came in on a regular basic. For a person just starting out in the work environment The Dollar Tree is a good place to start out in dealing with customers service."
good,"I applied for the job and got a call back a few day later, I had received a promotion to assistant manager but the store manager was super mean to their employees."
good,"Since it was my first part-time job, I learned how to deal with customers, how to stock the shelves and how to work a register. Because I was upfront working the register a lot, I could only stock or condition the shelves where I could see the register. I couldn't do a lot of socking because the items I was supposed to stock were still full on the shelves. So I'd just walk around making things were in order and saying hello to customers as they came in."
good,fun place to work. because of all the customers that come in. and employees are great and kind to one another. pay was not great and u definetly need patience to deal with all the customers.
good,"Was there for 4 years, was fun to meet people, and help customers. But there is no advancements, and Low pay. There's a reason why I served under 5 mangers in 4 years."
good,"great job to work at, fun environment. It was my first job as a teen. learn a lot for the management staff that help me grow today. It was a learning experience."
good,It was a good place for a first time job. Although I wouldn't want to continue working there. The manager would always hire but never had hours to give.
good,Not much room or motivation for advancement. Seasonal times tend to be extremely busy and sometimes you have to skip taking a break to appease customers. Management is okay.
good,"This job s decent for a part time student or someone looking for a full time job, although there is really nowhere for advancement in the company."
good,"Understanding coworkers, flexible hours, but there's not enough hours. The job is easy, sometimes it's quite boring."
good,"It's a great place to work at. The store is more for a student that still in high school or college. It is on the go. You will never be standing around doing nothing. I am constantly on the go. Cleaning, greeting customers, and at the end of the shift your count your till. and go home. I only work 18 hours a week. I got more training in the management area. The hardest part of the job was dealing with our regular customers especially if the didn't see what they needed the it was a problem and it would go to corporate. The best part of my job was the shift that I got and the people I work with. It made my job so much easier."
good,"Keep a smile "
good,"It was very fun to work here with fun, nice people. The hardest part about the job was figuring out where everything was put in the stock room, but other then that it was really fun."
good,learning to work in any type of environment of customer service can be tricky but being able to understand and meet their needs as well as figure out the problem is a sure way to succeed in any type of situation concerning the customer.
good,"It is definitely a good place to get experience that you may need for another job. A typical day at work would cash out customers, stocking items in the aisles, putting back go backs, cleaning register area. I am more open to other people where I am not shy. I have also learned to be tougher because there are people that extremely mean for no apparent reason and you can not react to them. My co-workers are very nice. We keep it work related and professional."
good,"A typical day at work was average. I enjoyed working at dollar tree. I've learned how to manage A different schedule. My manager wasn't quite the best. My co-workers taught me to become A faster Cashier , I haven't came across any hard parts of the job but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work and earn money."
good,"typical day would be stocking and being cashier. i learned how to operate the cash register there, and how to setup displays. it wasn't any hard parts to this job, i enjoyed it while it lasted"
good,Working here was a rollar coaster but i enjoyed the short amount of time i had here. I learned alot from this job & I hope to be able to put the new skills i learned to test.
good,"Dollars Tree need to pay more money at least $8 to $9 hour"
good,Management will change your schedule without notice. High Turnover. Little sensitivity from management for employee needs. Little training.
good,this is a great company to work for if all you want is just 10 to 15 hours a week. if you are looking to raise a family you would have to have a second job.
good,"Work days consist of daily tasks giving to be completed by the end of your shift. I learned to work at a steady but somewhat fast pace, and the management was very friendly but demanding. my co-workers got along very well and didn't mind working together to get a task done in a timely matter. The hardest part of the job is unloading the large shipments from trucks.The thing I enjoyed the most is the friendliness in the environment from customers to co-workers."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job what that I get to help customers and see some old/new faces. Management was Ok but it could be a lot better.
good,"Being a care giver is one the best jobs to have. In most cases your working with family ,getting paid to take care of someone that you would most likely take care of anyways . So the extra income is a major help."
good,fun and great people to work with. typical day go in unload truck stock few things and go home.  the hardest part  was not e njoying how easy it is
good,The starting pay goes for all departments which I think is unfair. This company is very production driven.
good,"During a shift at Dollar Tree I do my best to help the customers find what they need and make sure they are happy with their purchase. I've learned how to deal with situations with unhappy customers. The  management does a good job of leading and directing the team to help people find what they need, keep the store up and running like it needs to, keep the store stocked and make sure that all the workers are scheduled accordingly. The hardest part of the job is handling situations with unhappy customers but with the right attitude, it's doable. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people I get along with and who encourage me as a co-worker and a friend."
good,"I like my job, specially because I can interact with people.  However, Im looking to expand and improve professionally.  A high pay rate and hours increase are a must."
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing up customers, trying to put out freight, and to keep the clean and recovered."
good,"We work closely with the public, especially during the holiday seasons."
good,its a very good company to work for if everyone did the same amount of work as everyone else only two manager really works with everyone and makes it feel like a workplace the others just sit in the office for the most part.
good,"A typical day at work was very routine."
good,"It was pretty slow there and the co-workers weren't very talkative so it mad my work experience kinda boring"
good,"*Dollar tree has provided me with skills that i will keep with me for a life time, it was sad when i had to relocate , but it eventually had to happen. "
good,"Customer service,cashier,cleaning.Liked management still talk to them every time I see them which is still quite a bit.Some co workers stayed awhile there but moved on to other carriers.Nothing really hard,I enjoyed working with people.Love helping and making people shopping experience the best it could be."
good,As an Assistant Store Manager I didnt make allot of money plus it was only part-time. My old manager was un professional at times making inappropiate comments to me and other employees.
good,hours were short but you had regular customers and things to keep yourself busy to make your day go faster.
good,Great company to work for besides management. Loved my job here friendly customers and co workers everybody knew me by name like a small little town would. Would assist stock crew when not busy cashiering to help out.
good,I wasn't there that long to tell you very much. I would get all the shopping cart and bring them to the front. Greet people as the walked in and check out. I would put lost innovatory back to where they belong. Fill up bolloons when needed.
good,"Lots of customer service, sales dealing with money and stocking of the store"
good,"It was okay. Nothing special but working the registers, helping customers, and helping co workers"
good,"Management is very flexable, and understanding, Co workers are wonderful, I enjoyed my job"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of organizing my register, restocking the shelves, and being a positive addition for the customers. I learned how to work on a register, how to be organized, and customer service. The hardest part of the job was having co workers who were a tad disorganized and having to do mine, and their job, but I managed and it made me faster and more efficient. I enjoyed the personalities I got to encounter; some pleasant and some not so pleasant, but that is what made me so adaptable."
good,"I ran a register all day plus other little duties such as cleaning, stocking, greeting customers."
good,"As I was an AM for 7 months at this location with all intent in becoming a SM. I learned nothing on becoming a SM, due to the SM refusing to do his job. All the co-workers were GREAT employees and friends. Where the SM was just completely worthless, with constant customers complaining about him and his people skills. But the DM just keeps does nothing to help the employees that are just so unhappy working there because of the SM. I would love to work for another Dollar Tree just not under him or her."
good,A typical day requires the cashier to take care of the customer. The shelves have to be restocked during times when no customer was in line to serve.
good,"work started at 9am , had to make sure the store opened at 9am sharp , and employees were there, then then we would start putting out frieght , taking care of the customers keeping the store clean and neet , doing deposits and placeing the order for the next shipment , doing the schedule for the next week , receiving the order when it came in and making sure it was all there ,, and doing inventories once a week ."
good,cleaned and kept the store stocked its a very awesome place to work friendly enviroment
good,"very busy place, constantly busy, running cashier and stocking, sometimes gets hectic. pay is low for the work. convenient to home and free parking. managers are nice"
good,"The job is very fast paced. You must be willing to run the register, stock the store, and clean the area around you. I use to love when we received new items. overall a great company to work for just does not pay well."
good,I would have stayed if they were willing to give me more hours Manager was great team members were great and it made me happy having a job I enjoyed very much
good,Mostly cleaned. Store manager always did the best that he could with what he had and the people he had. The second assassant manager needs to be switched out. She is not a people person. But I think that she does the best she can. Other then that place was a wonderful place to work for.
good,I feel like this is an ok place to work temporarily to help get by or get on your feet. Not a place i feel you can stay years at and make a career of.
good,"There is always something that needs to be done.There are a wide variety of merchadise. I love working at Dollar Tree, however I am unable to maintain my household with this job alone."
good,"I was over qualified. So this was a nice part time job. I kept the customers satisfied, made sure all my tasks were fulfilled. I had an overall good experience."
good,work was busy but some manangers didnt know what to do or treat there employees. lack of hr and pay but Good for first time job.Sometimes very rude customers but as long as you can handle yourself in a professional manner you will be ok. not the right company for me.
good,"I was the closing shift leader. I was accountable for making deposit,stocker."
good,I loved working at Dollar tree but hated the store manager. I was always going far and out for the customers. I love helping people. Dollar tree is a fun and respectful environment. The people can be complicated at times but I still held my own....
good,"The customers and employees are what made Dollar Tree a amazing place to work at. Terrific and patient Managers along with really kind customers that were always really enjoyable, especially the regulars."
good,"A typical day at work was busy and productive. Customer service was something I learned a lot about because you ave to learn how to help different customers. Management was pretty nice and worked with me on hours. The hardest part of my job was working more than I was getting paid for. The most enjoyable part was being busy, I was really good at my job and helping others."
good,"Very good first job opportunity for beginners learning communication, stocking, and customer service skills. Slow on most days but very easy to understand the work and what needs to be done."
good,Not many workers work at the same shift so you would have to multitask. Greet costumers and be prepared to know where everything is at to help costumers with all merchandise.
good,"No way was I aloud to advance . She went through so many Asst. Mgrs. But I stayed a cashier, I wanted to stock but she wouldn't let me.  She was a bully and went through Alot of people cos of her be attitude.  She constantly put me down n yelled at me. I put up with it cos I loved my job.  Lasted 6 years the last 2 years was with her .n I just couldn't do"
good,Everyone was very helpful and had a great attitude at work everyday. Can be a fast paced environment at times then the rest of the time is very slow paced.
good,Fun fast paced work sometimes with only 2 people you multitask all day never slow a lot of work they expect you to do cashiering stocking and unload truck all in one
good,"Its a good place to work if you arent looking for a full time job. You are usually only scheduled 4-5 hours a day."
good,"I enjoyed working there at dollar tree, the staff was kind and understanding and the managers where positive and optimistic. The store may have been in chaos at times but we got everything done and left with a smile."
good,"I got fired for having strep and I couldn't talk so they fired me."
good,"This job is great if you just want a little extra cash,  I was not able to make a living from this job,  the management was nice and worked with you if you needed off or more hours"
good,"it's a fast paced work environment.  although there is an abundance (over abundance really) of training material the on hand training isn't as thorough or complete as I would think, at least in my area."
good,Fun place to work but the hours given are poor and pay is laughable. You would make more money as a paperboy or a fry cook. If your looking for bare minimum part time and dont care about pay you can have a good time working there.
good,I would work there again. Other than the occasional crazy person the job is pretty relaxed and straight forward. It's a good company to work for if ur just starting out in the workforce.
good,"Handling Cash, placing merchandise in correct places and answering customers questions also unloading truck heavy items and scanning items customers buys."
good,Management has a serious lack of communication amongst each other. There have also been multiple calls to corporate by employees who are unsatisfied with the way they have been treated as well as consistent scheduling conflicts.
good,"The compensation is terrible, little to no communication, understaffed."
good,It was good in the beginning but once the manager left it became horrible. Once we got a new manager I didn’t want to work there anymore. I worked long enough for a raise and only got 10 cents.
good,not bad but not enough money for what they ask you to do I am in charge of the money and many customers throughout the day and its not enough pay for what we go through
good,The Dollar Tree had plenty of business to keep me busy. I enjoyed the customers and properly stocking the shelves. The work was not hard but dealing with certain supervisors could be.
good,depending on if you work for the warehouse or store I have worked for both. I like the warehouse setting and how you perform your job there but if youre looking for a more relaxed environment then work for the actual store
good,"Managed staff, prepared work schedules and assigned specific duties. Performed sales floor work, such as greeting or assisting customers, stocking shelves, and taking inventory."
good,It’s a pretty easy job. I learned more about customer service skills how to run a store and how to manage large amounts of money. I learned how to stock shelves as well.
good,"Dollar Tree is a relaxed first job to have, and for only minimum wage it has perks. Only nothing is guaranteed in our store. Drama and childish manners hinder days of work and no one is on the same page, especially management. For sure a temporary job."
good,Great team to work with. Its welcoming and inviting. They hired great people that are friendly and hard working. The hardest thing for me was the hours that I was provided because I had to take public transportation and there was no way to get to work as requested due to no transportation running at those hours.
good,I only worked there for one holiday season.  It didn't feel much different than working for other retail companies.  High expectations that sometimes feel unrealistic.  The manager at the store I worked at expected a lot from her employees but she was very fair and didn't expect them to do anything she wouldn't do.
good,"My experience at Dollar Tree taught me that a place of employment could be more like working with Family. It was safe, secure and friendly. I valued what I learned there. The only thing I would change is their barevement policy."
good,Working over three was a really nice experience my co-workers were nice and everybody was always smiling. I will definitely recommend someone to work there.
good,I have work here for about 2 1/2 months .wish i have more then 8 hrs a week so i don't have to search for another job opportunity.over all i enjoy working at Dollar tree.The people are very friendly and coworkers are awesome.
good,With no direction from above our store from regional managers we were left to our own devices for solving issues which was always critiqued by regional managers. Otherwise staff got along well and made it work considering.
good,Loved working at dollar tree. Only thing was we never could keep a GM. Wonderful customers as well a excellent merchandise. Most employees are great with positive attitudes. Only thing was your raised and schedule were based of daily produtivity reports that were the managers responsibility to turn in after shifts. Some did not get in in a timely fashion.
good,Days went by fast. Fun enviroment to work in. Employees were fun and worked hard. They always worked with me on my schedule since I was working two jobs.
good,I really enjoy working there great experience customers were great I love the customers I love my co-workers attitudes everyone help each other the management with pretty great they worth with you they supported you it was a fun environment to work around great holiday
good,"I enjoyed working here the people were great, just did not get enough hours and the pay was not nearly enough to cover my living expenses while I was attending school."
good,It's very fast paced and the store I worked at was very busy no matter the time of day. The employees were great some managers were more willing to help...
good,"I wish their hours was flexible, and they will pay you more then 10 dollars an hour for an Assistant Manager full time. They expected so much from their employees but don't appreciate et reward them enough"
good,It has some very busy moments but overall you have multiple tasks you can do to help the day go by. The workers are polite and a well laid out floor plan.
good,Dollar Tree is quick paced and only stressful when it is very busy. They are willing to work with your schedule but the pay is very bad. There is a lot of verity in the work.
good,"This is not kind of job that you can fully live for it, it's more like job that you can do on nights or weekend to have little bit extra money. Sometimes you can experience how people are not greatful for that kind of store and leaving store in huge mess by not putting staff on it's own palce but on another side of the store. Hours jumps form over 30 hours one week and other less than 20. "
good,This company is a great starting point to anyone seeking employment. It is a very high demanding job that prepares you for any job advancement. Therefore I have nothing but good things to say about this company
good,"When I was employed at Dollar Tree I started out as a part time cashier and I worked my way up to an asst manager...I enjoyed the structure,the type of work etc"
good,It was going good until we started to have managers get fired and others. Then it started to become a little to much he say she say talk around the store. Started to be stressful and unprofessional.
good,"This is a great place if you looking to make extra cash, but not a place to build a career out of. The pay somewhat okay, but not enough to live off of. You only are a part time employee unless you are one of the managers. so if you are looking for full time work this is not the place for you."
good,There's only benefits for full time employees. At my current location there are only 3 full time employees. The pay increase isn't that great and not worth the expectations required of you.
good,"i experience alot at this job , it wasnt a hard good job it was quick and peace. the most important about the job is stay working and dont lose focus."
good,I enjoyed working there as a cashier. I made friends with fellow co-workers easily. The pay is very low (minimum wage) Few hours given to work a week.
good,I enjoy my time at dollar tree. As of right now I mainly work on the stocking. They do schedule to work on the register or work customer service by helping anyone who needs help. Honestly I would say the hardest part of my job would be never getting properly explained what to do. I recently started stocking so not getting told what I needed was difficult. I have managed though.
good,When I started to work for dollar tree did not have more than 15 hours a week never got more than 25 hours a week didn't get a raise during my time there cut my hours to 10 a week
good,Greet customers and assist customers needs/wants.  Cash reconciliation and credit card handling.   Scan and bag of purchases.  Maintain cleanliness of store and aisles.
good,"I really enjoyed working there, but they cut my hours to only 4 hours a week. So, I had to seek other employment. I would like to have my job back, if I could ."
good,"Dollor tree was a fun work place environment.. I love seeing my repeated customers everyday, I was starting to build a relationship with them.. Serving them with there needs met made me happy and love working.. There were some challenges however I got through it.. I have learned a lot to carry me on where I am today.."
good,I started as a part-time cashier to help pay for college. The environment was fast paced but relaxed. As soon as I became a manager everything changed. I was expected to be the only back-up cashier and only stocker in addition to my manager responsibilities. I would be running around so much that nothing would get done in a day and I'd leave for the day feeling defeated. Too much is expected out of the managers.
good,Constantly busy either helping customers or stocking shelves.  Friendly customers.  Flexible scheduling.  Management easy to talk to and work beside.  The hardest part is Company limits how many staff can work and most days we could use 2 people running cash registers.
good,A good work environment and the co workers are nice and helpful. The pay is not really that good. Probably the only concern of working with this company. Not any benefits.
good,"It's a fun place to work. I enjoy the work, and the people I work with."
good,"A typical day consists of as much stock as possible, helping customers and any other tasks in between. I learned how to handle deliveries and stock properly, as well as more on how to handle customers in all types of situations. Management runs well."
good,I learned good customer service while working for this company. Also good cash handling techniques.  On about a everyday basis it’s pretty smooth running.
good,"I learned skills here, skills that will never leave me.  Values of leadership, what comes of hard work, and what comes of planning ahead.  My co-workers had my back, and I had their's, and there was no real competition among us.  Promotions were awarded to those acknowledged by the manager, then subsequently the district manager. It's a slow grind to get the pay raises you know you deserve, especially when you reach a certain level of quality with your work.  Though I suppose such a wait only helps refine what you already learned, which in my case was a lot.  Hiring process was fast and easy, the ease of setting into a position was not stressing, and the co-workers I had the pleasure of working with were for the most part great company."
good,"where to begin,, The manager I have is a good person, the employees I get along with. The location I am currently working at is constantly busy and you are always moving no matter what. You are either stocking, running register, helping customers, or cleaning; always on the move."
good,"Manager gets irritated easily and takes it out on myself and workers. "
good,Mangement is very nice and helpful. I love working at dollar tree the only problem is the low pay for the amount of work. Other than the low pay this job is a great starter job.
good,All in all it was a pretty.good.place.to.work. I just wished I had gotten more hours to support my family. I would ask for more hours and couldn't get them.
good,its an easy job for someone with that much expirence. You just have to work a cash register and stock. You also need to be fast paced at the register and neatness is always required.
good,Working there was very easy. only problem is there not enough people working thru the rush hour times. the lines get really backed up all the way to the back of the store. but other than that not a bad place to work. all managers are really nice and understanding
good,"When I was hired, there was a extreme ""buddy system"" with most employees being friends with the location manager outside of work as well as among themselves as employees, being outside work party pals."
good,Advancements and experience. Good manager. Stay busy. Character building. Flexible schedule. Steady business. Low prices. Friendly environment and customers.
good,"My manager didnt have to worry too much because I was able to get the customer checked out quickly and make time for the family that was needing balloons and stock the aisle or checkout quick grabs in between customers and drawer always seemed to be correct most of the time that I worked and I was also able to take breaks and time off if I was to come up not feeling well after lunch... the other employees all seemed to pick up the slack of the others who were not scheduled or called it,,,, it was really smooth teamwork and funny at times,,, It was like a family of people who loved what they did for a living!!"
good,"I've observed for the past six months that the associates of the work place were out of there positions, and did not work based off of schedule were rude, late without write-ups after various warnings. completely out of control with tolerance."
good,Good hours but I felt like I did not get paid what I deserved. I came in on my off days way too often to still be getting paid minimum. Management was good at first until my store got a manger.
good,"A typical day at work for me was always busy, i would come in and immediately grab my till and start my shift. I learned to be more patient, how to stay calm,and remain professional while working for dollar tree.Management was pretty decent.The hardest part of the job was trying to help frustrated customers that acted out of character. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers, helping them find what they were looking for, and also working as a team."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is one of the easiest jobs to get, everything is a dollar making it easy on the cashier and all you have to do is stock when no one is at the register. afterwards you just sweep and clean and your done."
good,"the job is an ok one my experience here is a normal one, nothing that stands out about this workplace in particular. this is a job, not a career to follow"
good,"I have held a few jobs in retail, and Dollar Tree has been the best, by far. The environment is nice and the management is great. The hardest part out of my job is dealing with many things at once and having to be over-the-top nice when I am stressed."
good,"its ok what I do is very easy and ok wouldn't mind it if I worked fulltime, but its a great start to improve and learn new skills this is a job for teens who go to school."
good,"was hired as part-time assistant store manager and at interview I voiced that I would love to be full time to get health insurance benefits. Since I been hired the store has gone through lots of changes and I like to think I am a big part of the good changes.  Store was filthy and unorganized when I started, new manager been in and out due to illness;(her's and her husbands) and doing work out of other stores for the District Manager. Since I been hired two people have been promoted to Full-time Assistant Managers."
good,"easy going job, can get hectic sometimes mostly during holidays but you get more hours, can be fun with the right staff. constantly short staffed most times, some work more harder than others,  hard to get time off. no benefits if you're part time obviously"
good,Dollar Tree can be a fun place to work. Very easy work if you know how to do things and how the manager wants these things done. I suggest this job for high school kids. But the pay is not meant for single working mothers/fathers.
good,A Fun work place very easy to balance your outside life and your job life. easy to keep them both seperate. themanagers are nice and easy to talk to. A very easy but serious job.
good,"Employees and customers are nice. Hours and days vary weekly, not consistent for someone who can only work set hours. Starts at minimum wage but the work is overall easy"
good,"Counted money, stocked shelves, did announcements, Assisted customers, kept store neat and organized, ran the cash register. I really enjoyed my co-workers and management."
good,"Work the register, process payments for items that customer wants. When not busy, clean the area in the front of the store.  On some days, I would stock product from weekly truck deliveries.  At nights I would go around store and pick up items and put them where they belonged, organized the items on shelves."
good,"Work environment is dull, overtime it becomes a drag repeatedly doing it over and over. Managers are never around, employees are very social and cool."
good,"Although I only worked there temporarily as a Grand Opening stock person, I can honestly say it was definitely a job I'd work again. "
good,"The Dollar Tree, in Lindenhurst, is a great place for someone who needs a part-time position and to work around your school schedule.  I have been working there almost 4 years and I learned a lot from working the cash register, serving people of all ages and nationalities, and with my co-workers.  I value my time I have and will spend with this company."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers they are just amazing. Everyday I see a blessing passed on to every customers,  good people doing great deeds."
good,"The hardest part of this job is money wise as a cashier. No money should be lost or reduce. The most enjoyable part of this job is working around with the customers, because the customer opinions and dedication are what makes the store available."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company and learned a lot about it. I had the most cooperate co-workers and enjoyed working with them. My manager was a very nice person to work for. There was nothing hard about the job, and the most enjoyable part of the job was to get up and report to work."
good,"Great company to work for if you have a good manager, they have great benefits for full time employees.  Some of the managers need work. I would recommend this company."
good,A very family oriented work envirement. Great team work with the coworkers an managers. I would enjoy working there again.
good,DollarTree is a good job if you are looking for part time job the hrs. are usually 4 hrs. shift so really good for people who has kids and don't want to work many hrs.
good,Very good place to work. Friendly employees and great managers. I got hired on fast. From my fist day to my last i enjoyed coming to work with a smile.
good,It OK typically day fun at work fun some days short and some day long what I I learned from working there  people have very good communication they respectful and honestly
good,I believe the South Bend School Corporation is a great place to work. I was able to learn many things as a substitute teacher. The most valuable skill I learned was working with the students.
good,"This was a very productive and laid back work environment however compensation was low and hours were scarce, management was very friendly as well as helpful."
good,"Dollar Tree is a fun easy place to work you just can't get any hours in. You mostly ring up customers, but you also keep the front of the store fronted and clean when it is not busy. Dollar Tree is usually busy so we have a 30minute time period to fix up the front of the store while somebody else rings up the customers."
good,Dollar Tree was a fun a place to work out for awhile. One of the main things that was bad was I was a lot younger than everyone and got no respect....
good,"I loved working at the dollar tree down here in Williamsport. Its a very nice paced work environment. I love working with people and I always did my best to answer any questions that a customer had. Some of the downfalls for working there are; most times your the only cashier there until your shift ends. Then the managers wanted to have their only cashier stocking as well and that gets to be a huge challenge. Aslo, the hours are not what I needed. Most weeks I was only getting 10 or 15 hours and that's not enough to support my family."
good,"Dollar Tree expects a lot of responsibility from Manager staff but does not want to compensate. I did, however, learn a lot about back office tools to utilize on sales floor for customer presentation. Also, I learned things about myself being in charge of multiple employees at once. I had to work quickly and make split decisions on problem solving."
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job was .stock up merchandise.working at that company taught me how to be organized.a typical day at work would be clock in, unpack left over merchandise. while waiting on the truck to unload more merchandise and tried to unpack as much as we can before sunrise."
good,"New management is needed. The new store manager is lazy, doesn't care about the appearance of the store, also doesn't care about the coworkers as much as last store manager did."
good,The staff is wonderful! but I don't get as many hours as i would like to. My typical day at work is cleaning and facing the store as well as providing the best customer service and making sure the customers leave happy. The management is great! my manager is everything I would expect of one. You can tell they really care about their employees and can take really good care of managing the store. My co workers are great as well they are always happy and smiling they are wonderful people to work with. The hardest part of my job is making sure that all of the customers needs are met as well as trying to help them find exactly what they came to our store for. The most enjoyable part of it would be the customer service and talking to the customers as well as having great staff to work with which makes the job that much easier.
good,"I enjoyed this job but it is lacking in experience of the management positions.. I personally would have made more careful selections in who was hired to ""greet"" the public."
good,Dollar Tree was my first formal job. The job helped me to learn how to treat customers and adapt to any environment. The only con would be the company doesn't offer a high salary.
good,This job was a great place to work. The management was fun and helpful. We were required to work  at a high energy level so there was never a dull moment. The only complaint that I could have against this job was that it was part-time.
good,"I enjoy working at dollar tree very much, It may has it ups and downs but what normal job doesn't. I have learned how to close the store, counting the money for deposits and cashing out our tills. Working freight and recovering the store while learning the products that we sell. Anytime I work I enjoy my co-workers the most because we are  like a little family and its always a good day when I get to work with my family."
good,"I like some of the people , the hour were short and the pay was okay all in all a great store for part time work for students  if I was the CEO i would give more full time hours to stockers and cashiers"
good,"Cashier, sales associate, freight, recovering and fixing merchandise making store look presentable. Learned to be punctual and have good customer service. Co-workers were nice and friends out of work. One of the hardest part was putting up with upset customers, so I would try to be understanding and find a solution and if I couldn't find one get help from the manager."
good,The Dollar Tree is a great place to work. I would love to be full time but here I am currently working part time. I learned a lot about the company and the store. My coworkers and managers were fantastic. Hardest prt of the job was knowing that I may work between 10-16 hours in a pay period. But I do love being a cashier.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree consisted of making sure your designated check-out lane for the day is neat and organized, restocking items as they run out and putting items back in the correct place. Coworkers and assistant managers were very friendly, there were never any interpersonal problems in the workplace. Most enjoyable part was getting to have enjoyable conversations with customers."
good,You have a abundance of emotions working with the customers face to face and it's definitely more enjoyment with communicating with the customers on a one on one basis.
good,I have worked at dollar tree and still do until i am gifted with another job i only receive 2 days a week and i am paid every other week but the staff is nice.
good,"My co-workers are nice and dependable, the work isn't super hard, which is good for a college student like me. I have family who work with the company in a different state, so it's interesting to see what they work with."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree was either stocking or being on the register. Management was very respectful and helpful, they could have been just a little more professional. My co-workers were awesome. Whenever I had a question they would help me with no hesitation. The hardest part of the job was doing recovery because Dollar Tree is a VERY busy store especially around holidays so 70% of the time the store was a mess. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers satisfied and happy when I would ask if they needed help or just being a good employee."
good,Placing product on the shelf unloading trucks reorganizing stock room late night stocking helping costumers find what they are looking for.
good,a typical day was like based on the people and enviornment we were staffedin so if it was an afternoon then of course it was busy . id work there again .
good,"this is just your normal retail job"
good,Everyone works together in the effort to produce productivity. There is a shortage of workers and sometimes it could be a little over whelming when you become busy and that can happen as fast as you blink.
good,"I loved this job due to the location of the store I was at. A typical day at work was doing a lot more than I was supposed to be doing. I was a cashier but a lot of times it was just the manager and me so I was stocking, cleaning, running the register, helping customers, blowing up balloons, answering phones, plus more."
good,"The work environment wasn't all that good, you had the manager yelling at the employees, and calling them names, the manager and assistant manager wouldn't work with other employees if they needed to work around their schedule."
good,working for Dollar Tree was also a fun environment. worked with great staff...we all got along well....when things needed to be done we worked as a group to accomplish the tasks before deadlines. working as a service rep I was out on the floor stocking shelves and able to help customer with their needs. Communicating with customers was always fun....stories were told.. laughter and making the customer the number one priority when they walked into the store. at times we had dress up days...which always made it fun for staff and customers!!!
good,"I loved working at that location. Fast paced, busy store .Enjoyed making it look fantastic. Enjoyed the interaction with the employees and customers. Would've liked more leeway with my merchandising. I like to customize, not be a cookie cutter merchandiser. Seemed to me, corporate had us waste a lot of time moving things around before they needed to be. I don't like to waste anyone's time, it is too precious."
good,"I loved my local Dollar Tree because it provided me with array of customers with various stories to tell. The job of Sales Associate is rather easy. You keep the front area clean, you work a cash register, and assist with new workers. The people there also worked with my schedule while I was in school full time."
good,"Opened the store ,closed the store. I learned how to manage a large team of employees ,deposits, scheduling, store order, Cashier Audits, Processing Freight."
good,"My duties were handling money as cashier, stocking the floor, preparing and help count the safe and place in into bank deposit bag, and cleaning and vacuuming floor."
good,You are always busy there are many types of people looking for quality cheap item usually to decorate with.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree would be busy . I learned a lot being there : such as , stocking , boxing , & working the cash register . My management at Dollar Tree was okay , I wouldn't say that it was absolutely outstanding but I can say that they did what they had to when they needed too .. My co-workers were very funny at times , but times when we were busy , they handled business . The hardest part of my job was doing truck work , which is taking what the store ordered & putting it in the ware house . The most enjoyable part of this job was cleaning up , I am such a neat freak ."
good,"Customer service, stocking, balancing all in store cash, ordering merchandise."
good,"work to hard, they not for there worker, okay, okay, working in the cold/heat, pinic"
good,i learned all my management skills at this company. i learned how to be a store manager and what it took to be a good one. i had to put in alot of hours but having a good visit made it worth the hours. alot of times this job could be very stressful because they ask alot from one person but it helped build me into the hard working fast paced person i am.
good,"costumer services. cash register good coworkers, the hard part is when the truck was came but I loved to do it."
good,the work environment was very friendly and busy but very unorganized. Employees would just sit around doing nothing when there was work to be done.
good,"Cashier is my main responsibility, aside from general maintenance."
good,"Good atmosphere with good people. Customers were hard to deal with because of the area it was in, management was well kept. Most enjoyable was the flexible hours and actually enjoying work"
good,"I declared myself a ""non"" people person and requested a stocker position at my interview. I was told to be there the next morning and was ammediately sent to the cash registers apon my arrival. My new boss must have seen something in me that I didn't know I had because after the annitial terror wore off I began to really enjoy my job. I have always been an energetic worker and I also discovered I possessed a knack for problem solving.I like to stay busy on the job and embrased new responsabilities as they were given."
good,"cashiering, and cleaning starts off the shift."
good,A great place to start a carrier. Nice people to work with. I was a freight Manager and It was different hours to work . The Management there was great and very Professional .
good,"Worked Dollar Tree during Christmas Holidays.  Very busy store in Lake Orion.  Store is well stocked with surprising amount of products, co-workers friendly, managers productive.  No hours after xmas."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, but can be full of laughs. I get to meet new people everyday. Ive learned that everyone is different, and want things done in a different matter. The management is a little confusing, most co-workers have nothing nice to say about it. The hardest part of the job is keeping everything in an orderly fashion, but it is doable. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see how happy kids get when they are able to get more than one toy. I notice it a lot and it warms my heart."
good,Overall it was my first job so i enjoyed earning a paycheck but the unprofessionalism was unacceptable.
good,Everyone is hired in at part time and the guideline is to give only 15 hours a week max to everyone. I was a store manager and didn't feel that the company took care of their people. The hardest part of my job was know that only scheduling people 15 hours a week they were not able to provide a life for themselves without working an extra job. I loved working with the associates. The were the reason I stayed with the company as long as I did.
good,Liked the fact that I got to interact with customers on almost all my shifts and learned how to merchandise and rotate stock.
good,"it was a partime second job, meet friendly customers, good for a second job."
good,"My typical day at the dollar tree was counting in my till, helping customers, paper work, and cleaning my area.  I learned not everyone is understanding of medical.  management was give and take.  co-workers were very nice and helpful.  I loved going to work and doing my job."
good,Over worked with out over time pay. Too many responsibilities for little pay.
good,"The company itself is not bad, the pay is not good.  It just depends on the individual store and who is managing it. The location that I worked in had a very hard working Store Manager who did her best to keep the store in order and to give her employees as many hours as possible. After she got sick and passed they got a new manager, who did not seem to care and going into that store now...it is always a mess. Even at 10:00 am."
good,I enjoyed going to work. I had a lot of wonderful coworkers and it made work more enjoyable. The most difficult part of my job was getting time flexibility. 
good,"A typical day at work is filled with giving great customer service by greeting every customer with a smile, and to help them with any questions they may ask. I also keep my work area clean and stocked in between customers. I have learned alot of things since i started working with Dollar Tree. I have learned how to stock shelves, peg, create displays, and expand my knowledge more on customer service. The management there is great and always very understanding. The co-workers are very friendly and i get along with everybody there.It is just a very friendly place to work. The hardest part of my job would be to deal with the customers that come in that are just not happy with anything. Its hard to deal with customers that just want to argue no matter how you try to please them.Its just hard, not impossible.I just keep my head high with a smile on my face and do the best i can in situations like that. The regular customers that come in smiling and laughing would be the best part of the job."
good,would stock shelf anf the talk to the customer and handle monies for purchasing
good,"It was a fun job, I enjoyed going to work everyday my co workers were friendly. I learned to work at a faster pace and to enjoy myself and to always be happy"
good,Working with people and the companey. needs to pay more for what they do.
good,"I spend mostly my whole shift on the register, when I can get out of the register I usually straighten up the front area where I can still see my register to see if any customers come up. I've learned cash handling skill and customer service skills. The hardest part of my job is when I occasionally get rude customers, but I know how to handle that situation. I most enjoy my job when I can talk and laugh with the customers."
good,"clock in ,get my cash drawer, start interacting with customers,co-workers and manager's. We have great laugh's."
good,I learned good assistant manager skills. the co-workers were lazy and the management sucked.
good,"Was great meeting and working with a diverse group of people. Co-workers start to steal money from diffrent tills, became hostile environment to work in."
good,"I worked for Dollar tree for almost 9 years. During that 9 years I was able to get promoted from a Store Manager to a District manager and then to Store coordinator. I accomplished all of that based off of my hard work with only a High school education. So with any job there are positives and negatives. I would say overall Dollar Tree ia a good company to work for with unlimited potential in the market share for the future. They offer competitive wages, balance work schedule and Pretty decent pay to start."
good,"loved this job for the most part. manager was okay, and co-workers were very nice. This was my first job, so i learned a lot working here."
good,"This was the usual deal for me. I came in, walked the straight and narrow, busted my bottom working, cleaned up, left, made minimum wage, and got accused of theft because when a quick change artist hit our store, I discovered our cameras were fake. Thankfully a few other stores had real cameras and my description of the events matched the other footage. The store manager was great, the regional manager was not a very friendly or caring man. He was about self-promotion and was not much for caring about the people and stores under his area."
good,was really liking my job here was actually enjoying the people i work with and then today had a family emergency and wasn't going to be able to make it in and the manager on duty was very rude and acted very unprofessional and unacceptable about the issue and am looking for a new job now.
good,i loved my job at dollar tree overall .   slight issue w management.    but otherwise fun place to work.   great customers.   amazing prices and great products.
good,Nothing was really hard. I just always kept a positive mind set and busted my tail to get my duties done right. And always be respectful to customers.
good,I loved being here. There were opportunities where I was taught new things. I worked one on one a lot with my manager. The only thing wrong was transportation became an issue.
good,Responsibilities included ensuring customers had a friendly welcoming experience at the store. Conducting front end operations as well as maintenance when needed. Operating the register in an efficient manner for an excellent customer experience.
good,"This job over works you , for very little pay. They only pay there regular associates minimum wage, so nobody takes their job serious they pay minimum wage so you get minimum work from employees, so everything falls on manager."
good,Hard work for minimum wage stocker. It's very close to home so I'm not spending my time and money to travel so I am gaining on my take home pay every 2 weeks.
good,Overall it was a good and easy job. They were not offering enough hours to their employees. There was not much room for advancing but other than that the job was satisfactory.
good,Good place to work good staff customer service is important good first job pay is decent if you enjoy talking and helping people while also being isolated to work great environment for that
good,"Dollar Tree is a big company and very fast paced. I enjoyed the people and my team. Everything is a dollar and register is basic. Customer Service is most important and having shelves stocked at all times. Loss prevention is big factor for inventory. Company only offers part time employment with work shifts under 20-25 hours per week. I was offered more pay and 10 hours more per week at Fallas. Overall , if you have less responsibility the hourly pay is ok."
good,"It isnt a too difficult job, the people that work there are all nice and will answer any questions you have and help you learn. I think the hardest thing to get used to is how rude a majority of the customers can be or how must stealing goes on."
good,For your first or even second job I would recommend working at Dollar Tree just to get your foot in the door as far getting some type of work experience you won’t be there for long in some cases well I wasn’t there for long so yea
good,Had a good time but overall need something more moving and way better pay because of all the needs someone at this time and age need to keep moving in life
good,I was a cashier and stocker the job was ok but the work ain't match the pay I was great I got to work on time no calls out no late days the manger was great every customer loves me I will alwayswke them feel welcome
good,I was a night stocker. That unloaded the trucks and stock the shelves. I also attended to customers in any way i could to make the experience pleasant.
good,"It's an ok job, but ever since I transferred from one location to the other. They often forget I don't know exactly how things are done and it gets me into trouble. I also wasn't told it was a temporary job at first either."
good,"I have only worked a couple days at the Dollar Tree Store.  Everyone has been really nice and encouraging.  And, I feel that way about staff and the customer's."
good,"I am conflicted about working at dollar tree because the customers are peasent, the work is easy, but the pay was way to low and the management were isolated from the employees. They usually sat in the office, acted immature, and didnt listen to what the employees said. If they encountered an angry customer they tended to be rude to them or not listen."
good,Loved this job met a lot of people good employees. Hated to quit but I was moving out to Vallejo California and could not afford to stay in Indiana by myself.
good,"It is a good job, with fun people to work with.  The staff is friendly and easy to work with. The hours are flexible as long as they know ahead of time and can arrange around other things."
good,I was one of the ones willing to go whenever called so i got a lot of hours but scheduled about 13-18 per week.  My manager was amazing but advancing was near impossible for some. The DM chose who advanced even though SM referred who worked for promoting.
good,Worked there as a stock associate for over a year. Stocking and costumer service job. Management was acceptable. Workplace environment was typical for this type of work.
good,I enjoyed my job at Dollar tree is was part time not enough money so I moved on from this job but it's was awesome while I was there I would recommend this job for a second job to other employees who need work.
good,Management was great at understanding getting sick. Great at working around other jobs. You don't get all the hours you would need to just have one job though. So if your trying to support yourself on one job this is not the job for you. But if you just need side money to make spending money this would be it.
good,"I feel that this is an okay place to work because, the pay is less than suitable unless you are an high school student with only one or two small bills. Not recommended for anyone raising a family unless you are married or something of that sort."
good,fast pace and hard working in the eviroment it was hard to work there because you were left with very minimal instructions as to how they exactly wanted it.
good,If you like to have a very relaxed work environment then I suggest working here. There is a lot of dry spells where all you will be doing is reorganizing the shelves.
good,"I was a store manager with Dollar Tree, while i loved working for the company, I did not care for the new DM they brought in, she did not provide the same support as my last DM."
good,It's a nice place to work if you have the right people. It's mostly stocking and helping out the customers that come in. If you have a nice team to with you are able to get more things done.
good,It was a nice place to work. Family oriented. Very fast pace and hands on! Had a good experience and customers were great. Management was a challenge but u love a challenge.
good,"Crazy long hours with no extra compensation.  Cant have a life outside of work. However, great benefits for store managers. Horrible turnover due to lack of pay for regular employees"
good,I miss my job.  I was very upset how things were handled by new human resources department and its seemed heads were turned to rid me out.  My husband is a Marine and got very sick which needed my attention to help doctors diagnose him.  This caused me to be absent that resulted in suspension to let me go.
good,"Great management, fun-filled work environment, teamwork, great learning opportunities. Paid sick time, Plenty of hours for employees who hustle. Overall great place to work."
good,I go into work get my register and go to my register. I greet customers as they come in and ring them up. I would have to help clean the store. I've put up stock.
good,"I only work ,work , have met some nice people. I have some messy customers. My managers have been very good to me when it comes to some personall stuff that I've been thru."
good,"I like my job, helping customers find what they need, putting a smile on ones face and helping other store associates complete their assigned task while they helped other customers was rewarding in itself."
good,"Wasn't my desired job, but it was something productive to do at the moment. It was also very competitive and fast paced. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, unless you like to stock."
good,We all worked together as a team. The customers started to recommend people to come to our store. I also kept the bathrooms cleaned and neat as part of my job.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the calm and slow-paced atmosphere.  I worked the midnight to 4 or 5 in the morning shift.  I loaded and unloaded merchandise.  I also placed items on the shelves.  It was quite and peaceful.  I worked with 2 or 3 other workers.  We all got along well and worked hard to ensure that all merchandise was accounted for, organized and placed in the store as instructed by our supervisor."
good,Dollar tree was a nice place to work!  The schedule was very flexible! Any problems or difficulty management was very helpful in showing you how to help you solve the problem in showing you how to solve it!
good,I get along with most of the employees and managers.It can be fun at times. It's clean. Sometimes really slow other days are really fast. Talking and helping customers as much as i can.
good,"This company is a solid job/career starter for the right self-,motivated manager. i enjoyed my time with the company and it prepared me well for the next management steps. blah, blah, blah,blah,blah."
good,"I enjoyed the work atmosphere at the Dollar Tree , it was fast paced,and their was always something more to learn, the customers who shopped their were a joy to get to know!"
good,"easy job for ringing up purchases, handling returns, and stocking. a good job for anyone needing experience. management was nice and since i was the most senior employee, in terms of time working at the store, i was named head cashier too."
good,"Dollar tree is a great environment to work in management is good just needs some work , they do need new computers because they are really slow but other than that dollar tree is fine there are great deals everything’s a dollar and there are great items to choose from based on feedback I get from customers"
good,It was alright to work there. You had to stock shelves and work with customers. theft prevention. Every night floors where swept and mopped. registers are cleaned and the store is straighten out.
good,"It’s a fast paced work environment but if you need someplace to start off, dollar tree is the place. The management is great, as are the customers and it’s a great place to get experience."
good,The company it's self isn't a bad place to work for but the particular store i worked for it had it's issues with communication and things of that nature
good,Needs better upper management and stock persons. Cashier's are helpful. ASM is better handling store than upper management. Deals with people better!!
good,"A typical day at work is usual for any retail/cashier position. When it's busy you never leave your register and in between you work on stocking shelves. There is 1 cashier scheduled a shift with 1 manager/ assistant manager (except on truck days). The people that work there are really great and come together for the most part and do have a sense of humor and understanding for others, but the higher ups give no hours or care about how the store needs to be ran or what needs to be done. They say one thing and expect this- then turn around and say something completely different with a whole other list of expectations. They expect 1 employee to do the job of an entire crew and it's just not realistic. The hours are cut down more and more every week but even with all the nonsense- it really is a great place to work and i hope things change because i do not want to have to leave. The crew is great- the usual customers are great- you're usually pretty busy so the shift's go by quick. It's a laid back environment as long as you're doing your job and what you're supposed to do."
good,"I enjoy working at The Dollar Tree--my manager is excellent and I enjoy my co-workers immensely--however, we all share a common desire to have a higher wage and benefits.   I love my customers and have been blessed in establishing awesome interpersonal and customer service relationships with all."
good,"I stocked shelfs along with running the cash register, helped customers find items they were looking for, the lines would sometimes get backed up but id work as fast as possible"
good,"Stocking, unloading the truck,  cashiering, checking in vendors, bank deposits. Making sure all employees had their work assignment for the day and fowling up on their work"
good,"It is a good job for some one that wants part time for a cashier. "
good,I loved working there and the management was great. the most I could work was 20 hours a week. No one except management can be full time. I did not make enough to stay where I was and had to move out of state.
good,"Worked here while I was in school. It was easy enough work, but was frustrating when you wanted more hours and they didn't have any available. The public really disrespects the store so it made cleaning a huge part of the job and I was just glad that I was not the assistant manager so that I wasn't required to clean the bathrooms."
good,Overall dollar tree is great. The new corporate office we work for is strict.  No flexibility what so ever! ALL. the managers need more training.  & so do employees.
good,"Dollar tree is an alright place to work. If you want a part time job it is great. Flexible hours, but the only thing is there are not health benefits."
good,"it was usually always a busy day, never really anytime for free time which is good in a way. Never really felt like I could excel there and so that's why I decided to leave them."
good,My typical work day was running register and making sure customers where satisfied and found everything okay. I would help them if they couldn't. I also restocked shelves and conditioned a lot.
good,Loved my customers they always made my day better i learned how to deal wirh differnr types of people management was great and my job is what i enjoyed
good,"Standard work day. Duties are consistant daily."
good,Its fun and friendly i enjoy working there but its the wages that i cant be ok with it also has no benefits. I do enjoy meeting new people everyday. And managemnt is cool.
good,I enjoyed putting product on the shelf and helping customers. It was also fun seeing the new items that we had. It stayed busy so time we t by reay fast.
good,"Dollar Tree is a fast pace environment that works you very hard, for little money. You’re on your feet the entire time without any breaks. It would be a great place if they provided more money for all the work that is required."
good,The work culture sucked. I got advanced in the ranks and one of the employees had a issue with it. Got up in my face and placed her hands on me. The management did nothing but i was suppose to take it. I was sick with the flu for a week and couldnt call out to rest. Even when i did i was told by my store manager i had to go in or i get written up. So i worked with the flu for a week.
good,learned alot for customer service and stocking shelves nothing hard at the job i enjoyed working there some days the manager was mean but just did my job
good,"If you're looking to finding your first ever job, Dollar Tree is a great place to go. They work a great pace for beginners and you will learn a lot of about how to work with people."
good,Dollar tree overall wasn’t a bad place to work I just had a manager that was overly strict. She expected more than what was physical possible to be done while she sat in her office.
good,"i was an asst manager, i had to work like i was 4 diffrent people. no one helped me out, even when i ask if they could help me with it. i was always closing, so i was always cleaning up after everyone."
good,Sometimes you have to wait on the manager to come from the office to use the restroom or wait until 12:30 cashier come in. Sometimes you will have team work when you know the good workers/employee are there with you.
good,Was very flexible and I enjoyed the time I spent working there. The management was very friendly and the staff was as well. Hardest part of the job was that there wasn't really that many other people there to help out. But the ones that were there were very friendly.
good,"Had its ups and downs"
good,I would apply here again. Dollar Tree was a great place to work. Just lovely and beautiful management. Thankful for the experience Dollar Tree had to offer
good,"Easy going day to day. A single manager could be disrespectful, which was never addressed by the other mangers. Hours were not  handed out fairly,or consistently with the favorite employees able to pick and choose hours worked and jobs performed."
good,The workers have a bond with each other and get along with everyone including the customers. It is a good feeling when you walk in the building like you are welcome
good,It varies. You typically only work 4 hours a day.  The employees are great to work with for the most part. The manager is great about working with you if need be.
good,This was one of my first jobs. I loved working here until my hours were cut down to litterly nothing. I loved my first boss then she moved and didn't like my second job.
good,There are times it can be stressful. If You don't have the right team then youre not going to make it. Job is ok. Just wished I could advance more but my gm won't acknowledge the fact that the assistants want to go further in the company.
good,"I stocked shelves and was on register, open and closed store, loved my everyday customers. holidays were hectic but busy,  made schedule and counted money and deposited money.  did price changes, i did as much as the lead manager would do."
good,"Like Any Place Of Work It Has Its Ups And Downs.  Some Customers Are Great Some Are Rude. But In Every Job You Find YOUR Rhythm, Something That Makes Your Job Easier On You."
good,I have worked many years for Dollar Tree and enjoy my job but the hours are based on sale s not on experience. It is great for someone whom needs part time hours.
good,"Busy place and it takes everyone working together, along with the participation of the customers. They have been very loyal to me and so I am loyal to them. I like people so it's easy for me to be friendly."
good,This employer is in need of some overhauling.  The staff all though they are all respectful but the way things are done could be done different with a little organization of job duties the Dollar Tree could give their employees a pay raise.  Good starter job for Teens
good,"I was promised a raise at my one year evaluation, I was trained for a supervisory position and was overlooked when the time came to promote me and provide the raise so I moved on to seek better opportunities that would appreciate my value as a asset to their company."
good,Dollar Tree was an enjoyable place to work there was also always a lot to do to stay busy. Customers and management were friendly. I enjoyed working there but there was not a lot of hours to work or room for advancement in the company.
good,"I loved my job , I just didnt have a reliable baby sitter at the time thats all , I enjoyed working tbere I just didnt have anyone to watch my kids while I went to work"
good,"usually flexible hours"
good,"The store I worked at is rather small, but it was stocked with a lot of items. All of the other employees I worked with were enjoyable to be around."
good,Stocking and facing shelves.Providing customer service and answering questions.I learned how to use a cash register and count back money. Management was very understanding and friendly. The hardest part was getting product on the shelf while also ringing up customers.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and gaining new skills.
good,"The store I worked for in particular had a very capable and helpful management staff, all of whom were available to assist me whenever I needed it and were highly receptive. The location of the store was on the edge of a quiet neighborhood so business was usually slow-going and relaxed."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. It’s only a 5 hour shift and they want you to do 8 hours of work in the 5 hour  shift plus take care of customers checking out. But, overall it’s good for a first time job or a job to have a little money  though not enough if you have a family to take care."
good,"Fun company to work for but no benefits, unsteady hours.....goes through alot of employees.....easy company to manage.......friendly workers ........."
good,The job is a great job if you’re trying to supplement your income. The management is also great. The shift go bad quickly because you are serving customers or stocking shelves. The pay is not that good but for the amount of work you do it’s OK
good,"Everyday Mon/Friday,7:30 am./12:30 am. like clockwork 6 1/2 years.            I learned that every customer that enter in to Discount store . is the reason why I had a job without customers . Management they counted on me as I counted on them, I worked there for 6 1/2 years and had 6 managers. Work place culture it was good we were employees , we all had a purpose working for the company our store.   The hardest part of my job,is not able to stay and grow with the company and ensure our customers that when they come to our store they will benefit from it . With a good shopping experience .Most enjoyable is when the customers would enter the store and i would greet them with good morning and they would greet me back by my name ."
good,It was a good job and good customers. I like the customers but district manager was not nice. I like working for dollar tree but the management was not good. They showed favoritism
good,"fun atmospphere very fast pace but pay needs improving, management thanks you and positive she praises you for good job done, hardest id meeting goals while on register, and being bon my feet for 9 hours enjoyable is my co workers"
good,Stocking shelves with product off truck twice a week.  Helping customers find items.  Presentation of items on shelves.  Being a back up cashier if needed.
good,"Fast pasted, never slow, always something to do. Not good for a family oriented person. Manager positions are Lots of hours and Long days.  Great if your a person that thrives under pressure."
good,"Need more hours for the pay, nice people, no set schedules, great starter jobs, does have 401K, not sure if they match.  Can transfer to relocate which is a plus."
good,"Management was horrible, but the job wasn't bad. It was pretty easy and laid back, usually pretty slow. Pay wasn't great, but was minimum wage. Not a bad job."
good,"Not a bad place to work , I will never get enough hours to be there and only have one job. no benefits there as just a employee. no paid vacations there."
good,"As a Sales Representative, your typical day will consist of greeting customers and cashing them out as they go to your register. "
good,"I loved my job but salary wasn't great and not enough employees to accomplish all duties, stocking, freight, cleaning, recovering, cashiering, supervising, opening and closing store etc."
good,"Fast paced enviroment, most of the time I was the only cashier working some days and that’s when it became stressful because the lines would be so long."
good,The manager at randleman dollar tree is the absolute worse. She’s 2 faced. She doesn’t give a darn about you what so ever. She needs to be GONE.! And just maybe that place has a chan
good,"It's a great place to work. I gained a lot of experience there with ordering, scheduling, and hiring. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in customer service."
good,"Everyone is very friendly to work with, and they are very understanding with work scheduling. I definitely recommend working here, especially for a first-time job!"
good,"This job was honestly really simple. I did a lot of restocking. I worked with customers daily. A lot of organizing, and a lot of cleaning! The staff was great for the most part. Although, the manager made me very uncomfortable!"
good,"Depending on your location, working here can be good or annoying and you dread coming in everyday. My experience was a bit of both. pay was not worth all the crazy customers you have to deal with"
good,Minimum wage is no fun for anyone but job is not bad. Fast paced. Not a bunch of inventory to continuously stock. Registers are simple. Management is mediocre.
good,"ringing up customers for five and a half hours a stretch was alright and gave me a chance to interact well w/ customers and other people. It has been pretty basic work, blowing up party balloons, stocking shelves and moving around freight. Easy work, too. Instruction and being assigned work and such by management was easy to do. Management has been good to work with. Good, easy people to work for. If only the pay were better."
good,I love working with people I enjoy customer service I'm very loyal to responsible reliable respectful and I put my all into everything I do love working
good,"Depending on coworkers, work can be fun and entertaining. The hardest part would be how easily the line backs up because there are loads of customers in and out of the store. Overall, people, customers and employees alike, are friendly and appreciative. I quite enjoy helping customers decide and find items. Many times customers ask for your opinion or tell you how much they love shopping there for their projects or just everyday life."
good,Dollar tree is a professional co. That has room for advancement. Store managers are sallary based and work very long hard hours. They actually become your home away from home.
good,"Dollar tree is a laid back job for the most part. Until the seasons roll around, and then its a mad house. Depending on the day and what your manager assigned, you will either be a cashier or doing recovery. Of course you know what a cashier does. Recovery work is when you go threw the aisle and pick up the item(s) out of place, straighten up the item(s) in place and proceed to put the item(s) out of place back in the right area."
good,not really enough time to get other tasks done so always has to go to the person on the next shift. manager was amazing and understanding and enjoyed working for her. the hardest part of the job was the not enough time to get other tasks done in between cashiering as there was usually only one cashier and one on backup cashier
good,"easy job to learn and not hard, had to make sure you knew where the merchandise went and knew how to stock shelves. somewhat accomadating to your needs"
good,I enjoyed this job! Unfortunately i wasn't to pleased with the way things were managed. My favorite part of this job was getting to work with  friendly and respectable co-workers and customers.
good,My boss was a good role model for me. She had a great work ethic. I enjoyed interacting with customers but also the down time of stocking shelves by myself.
good,it is a good place to work just wish it paid more and offered more hours and full time  they will work with you on when you can and cant work and when you need time off but it would be nice to be full time and have benefits
good,"slow paced, easiest job ive ever had got paid pretty good as a young adult allowed me to advance to management quickly growing my job experience allowing me to leave and acquire a better paying job"
good,"Some managers were fun and exciting to work with, while others were rude and lazy. Loved my co-workers. A typical day was busy and fasted paced but not stressful."
good,"I clock in and from the time I start to finish, I an expected to hold my station at the register as cashier and stock or do go backs or recovery. Some additional expectations are to vacuum and do light tidying up of the store. It can get hectic in waves and some  hours are very chill."
good,It was a fast paced job we always had to do something. The managers were always on top of us. WE had to keep our work place clean and put everyhting we recovered back.
good,This company is nice for someone trying to get on their feet or in high school. They give lots of opportunities within the store. They allowed me to learn management skills for the future.
good,"I enjoyed this job, but I do not feel its a good job to make a career from. I was a third key assistant and did not receive benefits worthy of a management position. the work was very physically exhausting with the constant stocking, rearranging and unloading the delivery trucks."
good,The best place to work if u are full time dont give many hours co workers are fun they help u when u need it some of the mangers can be a pain in the neck
good,"Working part time at Dollar Tree is fun and exciting. The pay is limited, but the culture of the place is a great fit for me.  Training is right from the beginning."
good,"I had a great time working here, I enjoyed the work environment and helping the customers. I just wish I was able to work more hours and there was more opportunity for growth."
good,"Good coworkers/company to work for, it can be stressful and fast paced but it keeps you busy. The days go by fast. The pay was minimum wage, and its hard to get raises but overall I enjoyed working there."
good,my manager at the time didn't know what she was doing she was always messing up the schedule and having us not get enough hours and she would leave all the time and make us close with us not fully knowing what to do
good,"Seemed pretty normal to me; I've had almost no issues with customers, co-workers or management the entire time, which from what I've heard is excellent by the standards of a cashiering job. Besides having to stand on my feet for long periods, the only problem is limited hours and minimum-wage pay."
good,I was a stocker. Did more but got paid less. Help customers find different items throughout the store. Also stock the frozen food cases and that wasn't my job.
good,It was ok. I only worked there temporarily needed the extra money.  I wouldn't go back bcause they had no kind of benefits.... but they were ok overall.
good,Dollar Tree had small 5 hours shifts so you didn't receive much of a break. I was apart of a really good team. I think we all worked extremely well together. Retail and customer service can be very stressful at times but I could always depend on one of my co-workers to make me smile and make the day better. The manager always expressed how good of a job we did. Sometimes you would be ask to confront customers that were stealing and it was a bit uncomfortable but it part of your position. I would return to this job if they paid more and required longer shifts.
good,I learned how to do assistant management work. The  most enjoyable part of the job happens to be the customers.  The hardest part is lack of team work presented from others.
good,"Manager and assistant managers were nice. Learned a lot about a work environment at the time when I was in high school. "
good,"This is a great place to work if you're in school or just want an extra income. The pace is pretty much fast all week, so your day will always go by fast."
good,The Dollar Tree charges one dollar for every item in the store. This is most likely the reason they do not pay salaries that one could live on alone. Long hours for management with very little recognition.
good,"Overly dirty store with an unhealthy environment, and. security in the store complex was not seen.  Employees had to do everything with no cleaning service."
good,Overall was a good part time job as a teenager but not a job you could rely on for to support yourself fully let alone a family. If you're a teenager looking to make some extra cash this would be a pretty good job for you
good,"i have been work at Dollar tree for three months, actually there is fun to work i always communicate with customers, but they don't give any full time job. but I learned and tried new things in my life, so actually i like there."
good,"This job was okay. I wasn't a fan of how much work I did and how little the pay was. I unloaded truck, stocked shelves, and also worked out on the floor as a cashier as well. I enjoy working there because I would see lot of the regulars."
good,For a while I did like working at dollar tree but it got to the point where it was just not worth my safety. And other employees would try to walk over me just because of my age and it just wasn't fair.
good,"you learn every corner of the store, you learn to stock, to cash out, to do inventory, eventually you work your way up to manager in no time. the hardest part is the holidays, the stores get full and very very busy, although co workers all communicate and get along, it fun to work and enjoy yurself, and smiling is very important, got to keep your spirits high, you may have customers that are not very nice but never let that bring you down. look at it this way your still getting paid no matter what."
good,"This place stunk! I hated it here! They forced me to leave after ten months, because they ran out of hours to give me! The people were nice, though. And I some of the managers"
good,None. Just need more workers and need more pay. It's cool working here don't have a problem with working at Dollar tree it's very layed back and u can do whatever on your own time.  Just make sure u work and get it done.  Being a cashier is cool u get to interact with the customers.
good,Fast paced environment working with all different cultures.  Would like more hours on a regular basis.  Learned how to balance money drawer and could schedule employees work schedules if given the opportunity.
good,Great company to work for. Learned a lot from working here. Everything is pretty smooth running no problem at all. Perfect first job. Easy enough job not hard at all really busy during holidays
good,"Hard work.  The opportunity to advance in this company is there, but the hoops you have to jump thru will be plenty.  The pay could be alot better, and during their busy season the opportunity for days off are few and far between"
good,I enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree.  The management was great. I started off as a cashier and worked my way to a stocker.  Everything was pretty simple.
good,Stand at a register and bag items all day. Meet all kinds of people. Become familiar with isles to provide better service. Managers respected me for always being in a good mood and making everyone happy.
good,Can be a very nice place to work as long as theirs no one causing drama. Not really flexible with your hours even though she says she will before she hires you.
good,"A typical day at work was very pleasant."
good,"It's a fun work place depending who you have as a manager, not enough pay for all the bs you have to deal with. It's a good part time job, after school or just as a second job. You will have to work weekends, but the plus side is Sunday's time in a half. It gets busy, those are the good days time goes by so quick. On the slow days the time drags but there's always something to do to keep you busy."
good,"employees fun to work with ,atmosphere ,great culture busy off and on always new merchandise clean well stocked friendly  some of management need employee and customer service training other than that a fun part time job . best part of job is customers"
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is quiet, but busy. Never a dull moment. What I learned at Dollar Tree is how to interact with costumers.  The hardest part of the job is doing truck and standing at the lane for hours. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is the friends that you make."
good,I enjoy talking to the customers and helping them find what they need. It is important to me to keep my manager happy. I started out as a temporary stocker and I am now operating the cash register. My least favorite part is when it gets too busy and also not given enough hours.
good,Its a great company to work for i love to meet customer and put an smile on there faces.  Also make show you tell them to come back to see our daily week items.
good,worked a line system unloading the truck learned how to peg and stock isle's correctly also this job was the first time I worked with other people and coustumers
good,"I check in vendors, make store orders, and close and open the store. I assist in everyday duties and delegate job duties. The job is okay a good chance to learn how to be a manager and a good person."
good,"Little to no hours,  cranky store manager (now retired), little to no hours and little pay. Friendly people and very easy job........................."
good,"It's not as many hrs as a normal part time job and it's only a 10 min break. It's a lot of work with no benefits. Co-workers are great, everybody helps everybody. The hardest part of the job is finding a new place for stuff left over for seasonal. Typical day is cleaning and ringing people out."
good,"I have learned a great deal about retail management working for Dollar Tree. It is a great started management position. A lot depends on your DM. I have had some really great ones and some pretty bad ones. The bad ones threaten you. The goods ones encourage and mentor you. It is difficult to hire and keep employees because of low wages and inconsistent hours. Overall, it was a good experience but I am looking forward to working in a more upscale environment."
good,Clock in start stocking for about 2 hours..then I worked the register for the rest of the day..the most enjoyable part was learning new things that will help me progress in the work force..
good,"I found this to be an enjoyable place to work. Management was friendly and understanding."
good,"It was a good experience friendly people and a good work enviorment. The customers are real friendly, it was a easy fun place to work it was easy to find things to do to stay busy."
good,I work very hard and had a great team so I had Lot's of fun I pushed out HBC help customers and was back up  cashier in till one day Thay came and the us where going to be a dollar tree okay things got crazy and the team was gone we had to much no help and I Left after two years Love what I do but with a team so I hope u can be that one to do it for me new change was not y time
good,"The enviorment and people are nice and are willing to work with your schdule. They do over work you when they are short staff and the hours are hard to get. Sometimes, if your lucky, you can get max 20 hours a week."
good,"It's a fun, friendly environment to work in. The managers work with you when there's a schedule conflict, but it doesn't pay much, and the ""raises"" are low and not very often."
good,"	Greet and assist customers "
good,I love my job it keeps me busy my coworkers we always make the day fun while working. My managers are easy to talk to and fun to be around every job has the up and downs if I could make a little more money and get more hours I would be PERFECTLY content but thy just don't do that i am currently looking for a second job to make ends meet . That saddens me I might have to just find a another job altogether. I really enjoy our store clean Always stocked full  actually got great stuff  to buy very pleased
good,"•	Draw on extensive experience in order to proactively solve complex management problems and improve the flow of operations."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and had s great customer base.  The Tate of pay was very archaic.  Had to leave to breath easier. The training was pretty much non existent.  Theft was enormously high.
good,Its my second job and it can be easy to move up if you know what your doing... I moved up from cashier to ast manager within4 months... It's a neat environment
good,"I have learned to manage associates, complete tasks in a timely manner, I enjoy working with my co-workers, most days are fast paced and can be stressful, recovery is detailed and neat."
good,I learned how to deal with different types of people a typical day would be to stock sales floor and handle all transactions. management was awesome. Co- workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was not knowing how the day was going to be and the type of people you were going to have to deal with. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with the public as well as great  management
good,"A typical day at work for the most part is fairly easy. Even though I am proficient in all duties except management, my main job is cashiering. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers and long lines with no help from other cashiers but I always stay professional."
good,My review on dollar tree is that they are a great company to work for but not enough hours to do what they expected us. Some people put everything they have into keep their stores clean and easy to shop but we just don't have enough people or hours to do it. I love working here at this store and I love the people I work with but it's just not as fun with no help or little pay.
good,"Filling the U-boat with product. Speed is my main concern. I try to push out as much freight as I can in my hours in the day."
good,Working at dollar tree is fun and you learn the ropes pretty easily. I do enjoy working with my coworkers and managers. The hardest part as an associate is probably putting back the merchandise on their corresponding aisles.
good,"A very productive and fast paced environment. Fulltime 40 hour work weeks with benefits, free medical etc. The management main goal is to get the work done at the end of the day, so their focus is on productivity and volume. You have to be mentally strong and be prepared to give 100% every day you come to work."
good,There is always something to do and learn. It is fun. As long as your on time and dependable you can really get ahead in this company. You will never be bored and always be busy.It is fast paced.
good,"I was with Dollar Tree for approx. 12 months. In this time the store manager and district managers showed a complete lack of competence in their ability to do their jobs according to company policy. I quit after a disregard for my concerns was presented. The store manager from that time has since been terminated for harassment to myself after I quit, and her own lack of ability. The store itself shows no real signs of improvement, and as a customer it is still visible as to which company policies are not being adequately followed."
good,"Great place to work and get some retail experience. However, hours are not flexible and not a good place for advancement."
good,It was a decent job to work at for someone without children. Now that I have a child it would be be feasible because it was only part time at minimum wage. The people were great to work with and meeting new people everyday was great though.
good,"A typical day at work, is just like any other job. You have your ups and downs, highs and lows. Do the main tasks that you are assigned daily. See some regular customers, and some new faces. Help those that need the extra help and direct them to the correct location of what they are looking for."
good,Very friendly environment. I enjoyed the people i worked with. Early hours for unloading new merchandise and stocking. Fast paced check out for a better experience for our customers.
good,"Dollar Tree was my very first retail job. I did learn A LOT about stocking, cleaning, handling testy customers. It really gave me my push for wanting to be in the retail setting. My co-workers were awesome, managers were great too. The only down side to working here is the pay is very minimal, the hours are less than 25 hours a week, there are no benefits unless you give 5+ years of service. Like I said, great place to start at, but not made for permanent status."
good,Overall a good company to work for. The company needs to be more fair and flexible with scheduling. Very good products and good customers.
good,"cashier clean and filled shelves "
good,"As the marketing manager I handle all the store design and cash."
good,"An excellent Manager and great team members. Fun place to shop and work and time goes by quickly.  However, it is very part time, depending on corporate and expected amount of business.  "
good,"I was only there for one summer so I feel as if I couldn't say much about it.The management that took over when I was there was terrible, cut my hours down to nothing and hired a lot of girls, which was for not so work related reasons. The job as a whole was ok, but I wouldn't recommend it long term."
good,"I love the customers there, its just the scheduling that makes it hard to work there. I started with a great team but people left because they were not put on the schedule."
good,"I was quickly promoted to Assistant Manger after being hired on as a Sales Associate. I was told I would have 2 weeks training for the position but was not allowed to take home any training materials to help prepare me for my job more efficiently and it only ended up being a day of training before being put on the floor and told that that's how Dollar Tree does their training. I liked the atmosphere and my coworkers, but I believe the Store Manager was overworked, putting in 55- 75 hours per week, leading to poor management and mistakes. This was my overall employment experience with Dollar Tree, however, I feel that if I had stayed a Sales Associate, I would have thoroughly enjoyed working for their company."
good,"Very busy, fast-pace environment,Interacting with customers is the best part of all. Assisting Customers, Cash Handling, Processing Freight, Supervise overnight stock crew."
good,"If i was asked to return I would take the job, the only thing i didn't like about this job is that the management after so long fell off."
good,"I was a closer for the entire __ years I worked there. For the first 3-5 years, there were always enough people per shift that things went fairly smooth. We were able to get all the closing chores done (more often than not!) and those I worked most often with, we knew how to work as a team! With one mgr and two associates, no one was stuck one the register all night, or recovering the floor all night. We were allowed to switch off, so neither of us burned out."
good,"Working for the company was always fun, the atmosphere was exceptional. Management was really good too, co-workers are always friendly and understanding."
good,the job itself was simple and very straight forward run registers and stocking. I learned about organization and setting up a store. management was ok but very friendly. co workers were very different person to person most were very friendly but some were pretty mean and moody. hardest part of the job was the short hours and short breaks. the most enjoyable part was the friendly work environment.
good,Most days are Entertaining. You never know what to expect. The management tries to be as accommodating as possible. Coworkers are helpful.
good,"I usually start the day off by checking in with the managers and greeting the co-workers. Then I start by sorting through the go backs, recovering the isles and helping customers. After I complete these tasks it is usually time for me to switch to the cash register where I make daily announcements of our item of the week. I end the day off by cleaning the store. The hardest part of the job is sweeping recovering every isle. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers."
good,"A typical day at work at Dollar Tree, was usually busy. I basically Knew my job when I started at Dollar Tree being have previous  cashier experience. My co-workers were pleasant and enjoyable. There really was not a hard part of the day; well, times when business was slow. I prefer to stay busy at my work place."
good,The best part is that every single item is only one dollar (or less)! Now my personal favorite part working for the store is the interaction with my loyal everyday customers that come in. some of my more difficult parts is when crowds come in and the lines get backed up.Learning how to knock my lines down at a good paste is my most valued skill that I took from this job keep that smile and good customer service.
good,"My day would start out slow, but good for me to get some of my things going and put up. I would make sure my area is cleaned and I would have my register ready to go. The management that I had was really good. She worked with me and my schedule cause of the fact that I have kids and I had to get them to school. At times I felt that  with other co-workers around I wasn't included cause everyone has been there longer. The hardest part about my job was to handle the upset costumers. Some would be very rude. All I can do is say sorry for whatever the problem was or try my best to fix it. I did love when I had the nicest costumers come in. It made my day so much easier and a lot my enjoyable."
good,"A typical day punch in, and grab a till once the 1st hour passes your in the groove. Can be crazy busy, the time always passes quickly."
good,"Every morning arrive at Dollar Tree at 4 in the morning to start the shift. Immediately clock in and head to back to load the U-boats,large containment carts for box loads. After U-boats were loaded, they were to be taking to the sales floor to stock the shelves and fridges when product supply was low. "
good,A typical day was bringing out freight from the back and stocking it on the shelves. A lot of customer and employee interaction. There really was nothing hard about the job except at Christmas we were bombarded with freight. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the employees.
good,cashier helped customers with what ever i could and did a little bit of stocking
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to start your management career and to learn and develop hands on experience in order to see if this field is right for you.
good,"-Nice/Friendly co-workers"
good,this job was ok but no good for me its was not organized and the did not pay good money
good,"During my career at Dollar Tree, there have been a few people who have believed in me, molded me into the manager I am today. There are ups and downs to any job. The ups I get to work with a good group of people everyday, see local regular customers that know me by name. The downs are balance between work and home(not much time for home life)  and the stress level. There are MANY deadlines to meet every week that are at times hard to attain, meeting these and succeeding is often times very draining work. I guess at this point in my life I am looking to possibly lower my stress level."
good,"seeing customers day in and day out buying things they need for events school or even home. is great what stories happen in this place."
good,Pay is low even if you move up and no chance for full time unless manager of store. Even assistant managers only get a dollar raise to move up and still part time hours.
good,A typical day would be just greeting and helping customers.The management was great.
good,"Dollar Tree in Sturgis is a great place to work. The store manager is a great leader, and never asks too much of you."
good,this is a nice professional workplace that has a good humor and fun nature about its self i the work is never to overwhelming and there is always something to do.
good,"A typical day at work consists of  ringing at the register, stocking shelves, recovering aisles, answering calls, assisting customers, and cleaning."
good,Great co-workers. Fast paced environment. Great customers.
good,It was pretty much always nice going into work. I learned how to successfully unload a truck. I learned how to count large amounts of money and document it. My co-workers were always really hard on me cause I was younger then them as a manager. The hardest part was unloaded boxes cause some of them were pretty heavy. My upper management team were great helpers and taught me things I didn't know. I tried to learn all that I could. Good learning experience.
good,Enjoyable atmosphere and enjoyed going to work to interact with the customers.
good,"I loved working here and the customers were great,a lot were repeat customers that new me by name some even requested me by name."
good,"Going into the Store setting for opening and running into things that have not been completed from the night before and being added to your daily responsibilities.  If you can handle added assignments and taking charge  it is a good place to work.  I am that type of person however being promised advancement and watching them bring in from off the street and or promoting others with less of a work ethic became tiresome, and that is why I left their employment."
good,"Dollar Tree is a very productive place to work, there is always something to do. It is not always fast paced, but you are on the go the entire shift. If there were to be less gossip and people putting their nose in others business, the environment would be more pleasant. There are a lot of young people that work there (just out of high school, first time job, etc.) that do not yet understand the meaning of hard work and tend to be lazy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to constantly move, as I do not like to stand still."
good, 
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is very busy and patience testing. I learned that working with the public is a very challenging task. Managment is well organized and understanding. My co-workers and I get along great. I have a special bond with each of them. The hardest part of my job is dealing with unsatisfied, difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to have a nice conversation with my customers while I assist them. Being able to make them smile and satisfied with the service I've provided for them, makes my day."
good,"A typical day at work was steady paced and could pick up at certain hours of the day. I learned more and more every day how to deal with different situations and different personalities. My co- workers they have come and gone, I was there for three and a half years, for the most part they were cool. I didn't find really anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part about the job was dealing with different customers on a day to day basis."
good,"A typical day at work is going in and counting the till, and letting customers know when I'm open. I've learned to be kind and helpful. The management is ok. The co-workers are a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job is not getting breaks when I ask for one. I refuse to take breaks at the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and co-workers."
good,"Dollar Tree was fun i enjoyed going to work, I operated the cash register and helped customer find items in the store that they needed."
good,"typical work day, loading trucks continually. I learned I didnt enjoy that kind of work for that long."
good,"When I was hired on with this company, I was unemployed for over 2 years before and was very very excited just to have a job again! Things went great for a while, until I started noticing little things. Certain employees would walk out the store with merchandise, other employees did half of the work they are supposed to complete, management started choosing favorites, and no disciplinary action was done to the employees who were constantly breaking the rules. No matter how I tried to tell my boss what was going on, from my point of view, he acted like nothing was happening. In my opinion, he was just a little guilty of doing the same things and in my opinion, I believe , he started to realize I was catching on too quick to what was really going on there, and had to find ways to let me go. It was almost like he was trying to find any excuse he could to write me up. Working there 9 months or so, and never getting any counseling form or disciplinary action form, and in one week, getting multiple write ups is what made me lean toward the way I feel now. And lets be honest, yes I did call in a few times within those nine months, but when I would return to work expecting a write up, I would hear, <<<""girl please! Dont worry about that"">>> and then all of a sudden, I call in 2 days in a row, being sick, have a dr. Excuse when I returned to work, and followed callin procedures, making sure that it was well over at least 3 hours before the start of my shift..And return to work the tuesday after I went to the dr the monday, I hear <<"" it doesnt matter if you have an dr.Excuse, its still"
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was an alright kind of job it was like a family store, stores like $.99 cent stores,etc; in which I replenished empty shelves and stocked inventory of goods. What I have learned in that short amount of time was to cultivate some customer service skills in that short amount of time so I can say I have some knowledge or training dealing with customers. Management and co-workers were friendly hard working showed me the ropes of their daily operations. The hardest part of the job was that I did not really learn to much to go out and do everything on my own again it was a short school program so could not really get into quite yet. The most enjoyable part on the job was being able to be a part of a team being able to utilize the training and skills I have to promote growth for the company and soon realizied that the company did grow from me being there not by a lot but just within that short time."
good,"This job at times got very busy and you need to be a hard worker to work here. Some people couldn't handle it, therefore quit on the spot or never showed up. I became very close to one of the assistant managers. Most workers, including assistant managers, were nice to your face but talked bad about you to everyone. On a personal level I didn't mind much, as I was there to work and don't associate myself with drama. However, it finally got to the point that two associates messed with my hours so I had to confront our new manager about it. And that was that. I worked mostly with one person, which was enjoyable. There are customers who are regular and thieves who were also regular. Overall, however, this was an enjoyable workplace and there is always something to do so time goes by quickly. I would still be working there if I hadn't relocated. As long as you are there to work and don't get yourself caught up in drama, it is a great place to work with decent hours. You are on your feet all day so you do feel sore once you go home. On a personal level, I liked that because you know you worked hard and did your best."
good,"A day at dollar tree was a very repetitive, pay started out very low but room for advancement even though it took a great deal of time to move up the dollar tree ladder. Co-workers seemed to be in the same old routine daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see a task complete and completed well..."
good,"The work is satisfying. I am able to work in all feilds of the job. I am able to solve almost any problems that arise, customer, associate, computer. Other companies that I travel to if needed for help or stocking or managment."
good,getting workers to do what their supposed to do.not getting done what needs to be done for the store
good,"Very long and busy work days. I learned to manage time, mutitask, deal with customers, take on lots of responsibiliites, and to take control and be the leader when needed. Management has a lot of responsibilities and does thier best to keep store in order. Findingand keeping hard working and dependable co workers. Hardest part of job was keeping up with inventory on the shevles and dealing with shortage of staff. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing about all the great deals the store had before they are gone. Even tho there are no employe discount."
good,"Starting at 12p.m. weekdays, 5a.m. on weekends for morning stock."
good,"Dollar Tree is a wonderful company with great products and lots of selection for only $1. However, I make an average of $200-250 every two weeks. The hours are too inconsistent and the the manager at my particular store is constantly dropping shifts and then expects people to come in to work whenever he calls and needs extra clean up. So it is very hard to schedule personal life around work when you are basically on call. The job is not hard except when too many tasks are pushed onto only a few people at once, which does happen often."
good,A typical day at work would be a slow to steadily fast pace environment. I have learned how to maintain a cashier while lines fill up and customers are asking questions. Our manager were quite uniqueeach had ther own preference and style of working though it work it got us through the days. Co-worker made some awesome people to work with always willing a hand if need help. I would say the hardest part of the job was keep the customer happy with the return policy . Enjoyable part is having a great end of an accomplish day at work .
good,dollar tree was a great place to work managment was alright depending who was working advancments are there
good,"A typical day at work off checking customers out. Then stocking a U-boat, and recovery. And checking customers out throughout the shitft."
good,"Passionate about exceeding customer expectations to building loyalty and retention. Payment processing, Stocking, Credit card transactions, Retail sales, Accurate money handling"
good,A friendly place to work for good people to work for and very helpful in showing you how to do it right the first time and under standing about every time
good,"you'll work many different positions , gaining valuable experience ."
good,Fast pace was very good but there was never enough to keep the store up to good standars.I would do the best i could to keep bathrooms and store clean
good,I enjoy working here i get along with all my co- workers my manager works with me always .ahes a great manager she is there to work with all the employees.i always have something to do if not i find things to do..we all work together aa a family ..always things to put away u- boats are usually full and ready to be put away
good,"Really enjoyed working at Dollar Tree.  Received a lot of experience in many areas working at this location.  Very busy store, enjoyed the customers at this location."
good,It’s a easy job but the hours aren’t sufficient enough to have as a full time job honestly. But a good part time or for someone in school honestly.  Decent hourly
good,It gave me good hours. It kept me busy. I liked the management. The people that worked there were easy to get along with  I enjoyed talking with the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working here part of the time, everyone was welcoming and friendly. Only reason for quitting was no hours and lack of money. You can not afford a living with this job, but it would be a great first job for others getting out of school."
good,I enjoy cashiering and helping customers in the store. It really makes me happy when I know that I have helped a customer and I know that they would return.
good,"The manager has alot of b.s to talk there is not enough hours given"
good,I loved stocking and employees were very nice. I would arrive at night load up my stocking cart and get to it. I would restock all items in my area and make new displays.
good,"I liked the environment but not enough hours , very family friendly  the goal was speed and customer appreciation,  i tried to keep my area and other area clean and sustainable"
good,This company is a fun and fast place company to work for.  The customers always come first. The management team could be better.  The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be customer service and communication with customers.
good,A typical day at work is interacting with customers at the register. It is satisfying helping a customer find the items they are seeking. The workplace culture at Dollar Tree comfortable and laid back.
good,They paid biweekly but there was always more hours to gain. Good environment and good coworkers. I would recommend them for teenagers or people with open availability.
good,"Overall the job isn't too hard as far as your daily tasks, but they definitely should pay their employees more. I work full time and barely have enough to pay my bills and IM A MANAGER. So that can be disappointing. And at certain stores there isnt much teamwork, but some stores have a great work-family thing going! All depends on how the head manager runs the store."
good,Fast pace busy everyday easy job need to work on management staff and give more feed back to employees of how good they are doing more recognition other then that a good company
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work for people who have a desire to move up in a company. Starting small as a closing cashier to Store Manager in no time if you're dedicated to your work.
good,"The pay isn't much but the people I worked with were nice. Its a good place to start for your first job to gain experience or if your a person who doesn't depend on  Dollar Tree as your sole source of income. Hours can be flexible which works well for some, but can also cause an inconvenience if store needs you to come in at different timesdifferent"
good,Being able to connect through customer service with people in your community and provide them with the personal things they need paves the way for development
good,"I worked cashier, helped the customers out when needed and stocked items .. I also kept the floor clean and organized. It was a pleasure working with them and would love to see if it's a way to be part of the team again"
good,I personally love working with people so it is a great Job opportunity. I also like staying busy and you definitely wont get bored at the Dollar Tree.
good,Working at dollar tree was okay at first until I started being over worked and getting paid part time and was working full time and was closing every night. As a manager there you’ll get taken advantage of and they’ll over work you and won’t care about your health
good,It was a great first job but still really did not enjoy it. The customers were jerks and left the place too messy to maintain and the back storage area made me feel like the boxes would avalanche on me at anytime walking thru them
good,i have worked there for almost 4 months i enjoy working for them. the shifts are short so your not bored the work is easy and the customers for the most part are great
good,Fast paste decent company to work for enjoyable staff and boss hours go down a lot in the winter only thing that sucked is you get payed every two weeks
good,Nice experience I was made an assistant Manager in less than 4 months it was a lotta work I had to put into the job but the promoting work quicky comes with great responsibilities
good,It’s a good company to work for but it needs to pump up the security in most areas ppl can’t make a living off the salary they giving to employees management team can get stronger with the associates as well

good,I’ve learned a lot at Dollar Tree. The team that I worked with were amazing. I was 19 at the time and was giving great recognition and the opportunity to become a manager. That showed me that I was capable of doing more than I could ever.
good,Dollar Tree I a good place to work. I've gained alot of experience in the almost 10 years I've been working there. I've meet alot of nice people working there.
good,Great Opportunity after graduating from high school in 2014 before starting community college and when i graduated in 2018. Its a flexible business for people that are working on their education.
good,"While working at my store, managers were kind, understanding, and did not put excessive pressure on employees. For employees that could manage themselves and their responsibilities, this was an enjoyable situation. However, some irresponsible employees would take advantage of the lack of surveillance and discipline and start to slack off, making more responsible employees compensate for them."
good,"I am passionate about serving others and eager to take on new responsibilities and leadership roles. Handling customers transactions , address customers needs while quickly moving them through the check-out process."
good,I found it great working at Dollar tree ppl after nice and welcoming.i would love to go back but they don't have very many hours which b really blows but if they ever need me I'll be there.
good,"fun place to work , liked working  with people in the community , great boss , made friends with employees . its nice to greet our customers and help them"
good,"The Dollar Tree is an equal opportunity employer. My manager was easy to work with during the interview and hiring process. As a cashier I was responsible to assisting customers at check out, inflating balloons, and some stocking."
good,in the morning time as the guest walk in i tend to greet them. also i count my draw to make sure theirs enough money for my shift to begin. towards the end of the day i sweep and mop the entire store.
good,Working at dollar tree is perfect for students or parwnts looking for part time work and there is always room to get extra hours if you need them. It is some stress on the body sometimes due to lifting and moving heavy items.
good,The hardest part of the job was reorganizing the shelves every week. Unloading the truck in the hot warehouse and working with only three people on the truck.
good,It was a wonderful place to work . I loved all my regular customers that came in . I knew them all almost by name . The only thing was that there was never enough time in a shift to do everything that you were supposed to do .
good,"The atmosphere was quite relaxed most of the time, customers can be inpatient sometimes but that's any customer service job. I enjoyed my time there, the management was very relaxed while also being attentive to the needs and concerns of employees."
good,I loved working here great place to meet all kinds of people. Somedays it was tough somedays it would be slow every team member always help each other.
