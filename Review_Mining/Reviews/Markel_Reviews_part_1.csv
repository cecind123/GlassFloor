rating,review
bad,No room for advancement and treat employees terrible. Micro manage time and employees. Not interested in any employee feedback or even questions. Terrible environment.
bad,"Awful pay, extremely low raises, they cut put bonus program, very high deductible health insurance. Promote employees on probation and those that do not meet requirements for promotion, hire friends and family with no insurance or management experience."
bad,"Markel cares very little about their most important resource, their human resource. It was left up to me to fill my day with work to complete while I had to count and track every piece of paper and envelope I touched with an expected percentage of completed work on a minute by minute tracking spreadsheet. Some daily tasks are assigned but, not evenly among those on the team. I had to find work on a daily basis. A good was not getting reprimanded for something quite insignificant, such as an error made by management on calculating productivity and performance."
bad,"Markel struggles to find its place as a Fortune 500 company. It speaks of diversity, but has terrible parental paid leave programs, and the C-suite consists solely of white men. Work hard and try to innovate or don't work hard, you'll keep your job either way. If you just need a paycheck and don't care about personal or professional development, this is for you. Tenure is what is valued above all else, not potential. Chances for promotion are only available for the lucky few who know the ""right"" people."
bad,My manager there was just after a divorce and she thought that I will be her next partner. She was taking me to every business meeting and paid for meals until I told her that my wife is coming and we will look for a house to buy. After that she become terrible.
bad,"Markel could have been a great company to work for but the people they choose as supervisor and managers are the worst. They show favortism, treat you unfairly, and seem to be a bit raciest. It could be a good place to work but the supervisors and management makes it hard to wanna be there."
bad,The company has lost their feelings for the employees and only care about the bottom line. They have been reducing staff in their offices steadily for several years. They usually target the long term employees that worked hard to build the company. No job security no matter how hard you work. Management in the local office was weak and depended on the favorites they created to get the job done. No strength in managers or local officers. The only good point is the great investment capability of the Markel family members that are left in the company producing the great stock prices.
bad,Would not recommend working at Markel.  Lousy management mainly focused themselves.  Work / Life balance is non-existent.  All of IT has been outsourced.  Constantly having to worry that your job may be eliminated.
bad,"Successful regional family owned company thrust onto Forturne 500 list, now at tug-of-war with how to proceed . . . maintain the ""folksy"" Style of a smaller company operating in the wholesale arena but continue to grow in the retail arena. Management unsure of who their target markets should be and are confused with how best to proceed into the future."
bad,"Lacked serious commitment to Business Plan.  Resource investment required to support growth initiatives was not supported.  "
bad,The trainings is horrible. I didnâ€™t get trained properly.  Was told they were going to figure out a different way to train but never did.  When put on a new task was expected to make 80% of your quota. If you do less your frowned on.
bad,The manager I had played games. Strung me on to believe she wanted to hire me. She actually thought SHE was the president of this company. Too big for her britches.
bad,"Everyone seems nice , I saw them lay off entire departments when a temporary worker , Then I was made permanent right after they left, "
good,"IT is totally in chaos, and trying to figure out how to best adapt to a fast paced environment to make the business happy."
good,"Good pay and benefits, but unethical treatment of employees"
good,"Most other employees (non-executives) do all the work, get underpaid and get little to no recognition or opportunities for advancement. The motto of Markel is to do more with less. The problem is there is nothing else to cut and it is down to the bone."
good,"I was employed for 6 1/2 years. I applied for several positions in other departments, but the managers relatives and friends were hired. My manager asked 1 rep to work 10 hours overtime every week, never asked if anyone else wanted overtime."
good,I almost felt like a robot working there. Production production production was all they cared about. I loved the people there but no flexibility & no advancement opportunitues made me look elsewhere.
good,I feel like a robot here. They want you to get to know your fellow workers but as soon as you talk more than 3 minutes with someone you are looked at funny or told on. There's not much room to advance at all and most positions are lateral. Lose lose situation pretty much.
good,Low pay for industry standards.  Prefer to develop young college graduates than to hire (and pay for) experienced underwriters.
good,Fast paced company with good coworkers. Lousy middle management and politics. Low pay (vs. industry).  Benefits are good.
good,"I just don't understand how I come in everyday, hardly ever leave my desk, eat through my lunch where I'm given an hour but am made to put down that I at least took 30 minutes but somehow someone manages to find fault in someone that does absolutely nothing to anyone.  I earned everything that I worked so hard for at this company and did this because I wanted to word my way up that ladder to success as my dream to become an Examiner was at my finger tips.  I had many Managers who would and will still write a reference for me on behalf of the kind of person and job I do.  How do some Managers get away with a family member working under them when the company policy doesn't allow it because of it being unfair when it comes to raises and bonuses?  Well, this Managers daughter-in-law does and therefore something should be done about that.  That's a fact."
good,"Their are many great people working at Markel and the compensation is fair, however the workplace culture has significantly changed over the past 3 years.  They are struggling with how to become ""big"" company, and still keep in line with the ""Markel Style""."
good,Very intense work atmosphere. A lot of company reconstructing. Most coworkers very easy to get along with. Most employee's are team players. Most management is supportive.
good,"If you are not part of the ""in crowd"" you won't get anywhere here.  Low pay compared to industry.  Favor young inexperienced workers. Great place for  a young college graduate to get training and education (paid for) and then move on to greener pastures."
good,"Everything was great until the unexpected closing my my product line, thus the closing of my department and layoff."
good,Challenging and eventful. Had the opportunity to meet many different people from the financial industry and the entertainment industry.  Attended out of the office functions.
good,small company trying to adapt and ramp up into a big company but lacking experienced and adept middle management. Culture is nice and some departments have it a lot easier than others.
good,Markel is a great place to work but there are very little advancement opportunities in most departments. They are looking for very specific things for advancement and those are not available to workers working lower in the tree. The IT is very lacking and far behind the times.
good,"Good place to work as long as your in corporate office."
good,I have no comment...I currently work at markel..It is okay to work at.  Overall its decent.  Markel cares for its employees and shows appreciation frequently
good,"A lot of good employees and managers. Transitioning to new President and a lot of pressure from head office which is making the employees uneasy and insecure about their present and future. Many good employees have left in the past year, with very few being replaced. The company needs to decide whether they are a hard to place or standard market and find their identity. Products and wordings need to be brought up to industry standard and premiums are not competitive thus making it difficult for underwriters to hit their goals and targets for which they are being criticized. Communication from management needs to improve to help moral and prevent the loss of good people from the organization. Look internally to fill vacant positions and stop taking 8 to 9 months to replace those that have left. There are good people working on contract that are not only being overlooked but in some cases completed ignored as viable candidates. "
good,"I have found it to be a great place to work overall, however, they make some empty claims about prospects moving forwards."
good,Worked with great people and learned a lot about the equine insurance environment.  Days could be long.  Great culture.  Direct management was wonderful.
good,"Markel is a great company to work for but lacks a defined career path. There is very little insight into ""what"" it takes to get to the next level in your career."
good,"The hardest part of my job, before I left, was my manager.  He was unwilling to deviate from his own ideas, and did not value the contributions of my team."
good,"It's a great place to work if you come in at a decent salary, and would be an excellent place to retire. There's not a lot of push for change or growth, and management is very hands off."
good,"Nice work place, great people, low pay. Bonuses are great. Nice work environment. Close to restaurants, more room for job opportunities. Christmas parties!"
good,"This was my first intern and first job at 15. They helped me adjust to the work force.  I enjoyed both summers working there and the people were so warm.  They checked on you and made sure you were understanding what you were doing, if you were having a good day, etc.  The environment was easy going which allowed me to relax, and not be so uptight."
good,Everyone gets along at markel corporation. Management is good and a great work environment. Management gives you your schedule and donâ€™t hover over you .
good,I worked for the VP of Sales for Markel Services who was a devoted employee. This was an interum job for me until I was able to find work in the medical transcription field.
good,"Lot of bright, friendly, sincere people work at Markel. Good working environment, especially for a 'cube farm' that has a lot of professionals in workspaces much different than used to."
good,Your experience at Markel will depend greatly upon which location and department you are in.  The company on the whole is well run however and you will have opportunities to advance.
good,"Markel was a rapidly evolving company, fast paced and demanding environment. I found it exciting and energetic, and the team was very focused on success. They were warm, welcoming and driven to succeed."
good,"Enjoyable work atmosphere.  "
good,Markel is a great company to work for.  My only complaint is that the responsibilities promised were not delivered.  I went from a managerial position to a senior underwriting position because I had to relocate for personal reasons.  I was told that marketing and broker relations would be a large part of the position and it turned out not to be.
good,"Awesome team of great friendly people. A company that encourages development and growth. Compensation is not always adequate; however, the bonus structure helps."
good,My experience working at Markel was good. I learned a new line of business that I wasn't familiar with. My only reason for leaving was due to compensation.
good,"While working for Markel, I have been given opportunities to learn different areas of the company. I have made great friends and had some excellent mentors. Although some parts of the job were more challenging than others, I enjoyed the challenge. The hardest part for me is the lack of advancement in my career.  The most enjoyable part is learning to use different skill sets within the various positions."
good,"Business casual environment with a strong commitment to communities and a pursuit of excellence.  Good benefits, stock, PTO, but low on the salary scale. Difficult to advance in mid-level non-management position."
good,"good company to work for, typically a 9-5 position where there is little sales..  Profit focused.  Good atmosphere and a fun company to work with."
good,Good place to work where the business has great direction on its markets.
good,Collaborative work environment. Intelligent and motivated workforce. People lack a specific agenda and would prefer to work together to come up with  a solution.
good,"Its a very fast pace environment, stressful at times but you stay busy.  The management could use some help with how to encourage people and their goals."
good,"Best company I've ever worked for until they reorganized and laid off most of the existing work force, replacing us with younger, college graduates."

good,Engaging and productive tmosphere; active learning environment. Multiple opportunities for development. Workplace culture is very welcoming and friendly.
good,The transportation market if exciting and requires a high level of the transportation business.   Attention to detail is critical and the company needs to have a very knowledge claims unit who understands this line of business
good,They are changing how things are done around here in the IT department and some of us are getting laid off. Unfortunately I am one of the people losing his job. I will say they are giving us a very good severance package and making sure we are well taken care of while we look for something new.
good,Markel has made available a VDI system that allows for work at home.  The VDI is applicable for both company net books and personal computers.  This is a great for Markel employees with families.  Working from home is at the discretion of individual departments but is seen as one of the benefits of working at Markel.
good,The overall work environment is very open and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the independence of thoughts.
good,"Work day is from 6am to 2:30 pm. Markel assisted me with getting my ITIL V3 certification. "
good,"A great place to work, only bad experience I had was they hired a supervisor that didnt know how to manage, she was very corrupt. She wasnt knowledgeable about the details of the jobs she so called supervised, she fired good strong people who had great work ethics,bc they didnt fit in with her."

I had great supervisor, worked well with other priers, friendly environment. I had opportunity to train new employees. We had flexible hours and casual Fridays."

good,"Although they are below the salary average, the culture definitely makes up for it. Love who I work with, love my boss, love all the morale boosting activities that Markel has throughout the year, love that they will help you grow as an individual and mold you into the person that you want to become."

good,"Employees were friendly and considerate."
good,"A typical day included doing a variety of general office duties and multi-tasking. I learned a lot about the clerical support of the company and insurance terminology. The management at Markel is probably the best management I have ever worked for. They were cordial, fair and thought a lot about the welfare of the employees. The co-workers, for the most part, were team oriented and helpful to one another. The hardest part of my job was sometimes having to lift heavy boxes, the most enjoyable was working on the computer and helping people."
good,I loved this job. When I worked there I felt like part of a family. Because I had a lot of family working there but the whole company was small and we all worked together and as a whole
good,I really enjoyed my time with Markel Corporation. Everyone was absolutely wonderful.  I was very sad to have to leave as a family event required that I end employment.
good,The company provides great training material and really makes you as comfortable as you can get. They are great at showing their support if you want to move to other departments as well.
good,"For the most part, management adheres to the company's guiding philosophies. I never felt there was inter-departmental contention - everyone seems to work for the good of the company. These are the best people I've ever worked with. Fantastic bonus opportunities and great 401k match. Generous time off. I never had complaints about salary.Decent work life balance. Good benefit options, PTO on par with most other comparable employers. Pay was decent for the work, but not particularly in line with other employers in comparable positions. Overtime offered often for hourly employees, but only due to ever increasing workloads."
