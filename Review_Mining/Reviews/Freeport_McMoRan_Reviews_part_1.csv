bad,dis place at freeport people turn on you.talk all kind of stuff bout you.like they know bout ur life.i left com-pany i feel much better.i got fulltime job with differnt company. i feel alot better.i dnt feel like i being attack.i dnt work to scared
bad,"I worked at Freeport macmoran for 13 yrs, horrible management, they violate osha/MSHA constantly and if you bring up safety issues or unsafe and unfair acts by management they single you out and head hunt trying to get a paper trail on you.. HR is totally broken at this company.. they violate employee rights, proceed without proper investigation... This is a bad place to work..about"
bad,the town is a mine camp / prison/ theres nothing to do no where to go and the people will stab u in the back first chance you give them if you werent born here and dont have friends here you will never excel at this company .. good luck and god speed...
bad,Not a good place to work at. People judge and if you do not get in their little group then you will be terminated without proper reason and don't care if you lose everything.
bad,"Good training facility but low pay. Company preaches ""safety first"" but strongly shows PRODUCTION above everything else."
bad,"The training is 3 months long, you spend the first 2 months doing general labor, picking up trash around the mine, they provide a bucket and a pick stick, you sweep side walks, you wash and detail managers cars, wash employees vans, paint , move furniture between offices to prepare for meetings or if a secretary moves from an office to another, anything labor that needs to be done trainees are called to do it and Pledge of Allegiance to the flag every morning, you start training on trucks the third month."
bad,A typical day at work is being able to make it thru your shift. I learned to not make any friends here and just mind your own business. Co-Workers and management go hand in hand here. Hardest part of the job is staying quiet and not being able to voice your opinion.
bad,co-workers are ok they show to much favoritism management sucks I learned to run different equipment
bad,"Poor management "
bad,I never worked for an outfit that doesn’t pay for certifications  I was the only ase certified mechanic in the whole shop and my boss was a construction labor four years before he became the shop boss because he was drinking buddy’s with the senior superintendent of rw garage! The buddy system is in full effect with this company. Reviews mean nothing how hard you work will get you know where In That place. Only shop I have ever worked in where harbor freight tools or no tools you can still be a mechanic. The hr program is a joke most the hr people are new in the field and don’t have much experience or can help because there hands are tired. In the end it was the worse company I have had to deal with maybe they are to big to care about employees issues.
bad,"hard place to work for poor Sr Supervisor Manegment not a very organized place no rotation it's a very hard  work enviorment for FMI  "
bad,"Don't work in safford,az unless you are mormon (LDS) it's a mormon town and upper management is mormon so if you are not mormon you will get shunned out and skipped for promotions even though you work 100 times harder and safer than 99% of the people that work there."
bad,It's very hard to live and work in Morenci. There is a 2 year wait for housing so your on your own for the most part. This really only allows for people who know someone who already has housing to stay with a real opportunity to work there. Most people drink a lot and don't really care if they bother their neighbors. Freeport has a very hard time keeping skilled workers. They don't do enough to provide a balance between work and life. It's all about work. The culture is friends and family and they really don't like anyone from out of town much less from further away. Your only shot at advancing is if you went to school there or are related to someone. The management really reeks.They don't care about any of their employees. It's more of a culture of there are plenty of people waiting to take your job so we don't need you as much as you need a job. They will shxt all over you if they're done with you. The only positive I have is the pay. It was better than most places in the past but the pay isn't that much more that you will make anywhere else. I just isn't worth it.
bad,i really enjoy working with my group the reason that i choose to leave is due to poor management wages are ok depending on what you are looking for insurance benefits are good the company is very enviromentally concious   they support the surrounding community schools parks and recreational events
bad,For experience miner not good to many new hires  keeps the company  in bare minamul on province not safe always starting over with each unexperianced miner. Never a profectional job
bad,All they care about is getting Copper out of the ground. The mid-level directors are flakes and liars.
bad,"Normal work days include line out, along with a safety conversations. I learned a lot about different types of ore extraction and procedures. Unfortunately i have nothing to say about management. Culture is ok. the hardest part of the job is getting upper management to allow you to do your job. I enjoyed training my personal to be the best they could be with a lot of care and building a great foundation."
bad,"The job it's self was o.k.,but the the work was very hard , due to the fact that it is 12 hrs shifts or more and it is shift work....The only thing that made it harder to do than the shifts would you sit in a haul truck for 12 hrs. and had to let dispatch know ever time you stopped to go to the bathroom and have cameras watching you ...And people follow you watching you ever minute while working.....You had to eat your lunc while still driving , no lunch breaks or any breaks unless you when to a outside bathroom.....it was evry hard job, and demanding on the body itself........Breathing the air due to the sulfuic acid in the air and dusty...."
bad,I performed data checking and helped with a new software implementation.
bad,"cash out customers, clean the store, break down machines and clean them stock all the frrges, count down drawers, and prepare for the morning shift to do nothing when they come in."
bad,"Good pay, Very impersonal. This company is an absolute mess. Supervision has less authority than hourly employees do. The philosophy and attempted culture is excellent but the backing behid it is cutthroat"
bad,"The training is 3 months long, you spend the first 2 months doing general labor, picking up trash around the mine, they provide a bucket and a pick stick, you sweep side walks, you wash and detail managers cars, wash employees vans, inspect bathrooms, paint , move furniture between offices to prepare for meetings or if a secretary moves from an office to another, anything labor that needs to be done trainees are called to do it and Pledge of Allegiance to the flag every morning, you start training on trucks the third month."

bad,• Delegate travel and hotel arrangements for employees.
bad,Largest project in the history of the mining will fail due to poor contract management. The supervisory oversight of this project is managed by a former human resource and procurement employee with no contract experience. As a result of their incompetence Freeport has had to hire numerous overpaid out of state contractors with minimal contract experience.
bad,"Work environment, putting it lightly, less than agreeable. "
bad,Very stressful environment. Management was not supportive of minority employees. The hardest part of the job was being yell at on a daily basis by current and former employees.
bad,"The manager of staffing is hostile, petty and vindictive.  The organization is great as a whole. However,  certain departments are a nightmare.  Be advised."
bad,"Way too understaffed in finance section.  High stress.  Too long hours worked during day, evening and week-ends.   Year end closing brings on extra hours and stress."
bad,Not a really good place to work............upper management was mediocre. Although my coworkers where very friendly and cooperative. Good Supervisors.
bad,bosses and supervisors always on your back. micromanaging is a big problem. my fellow employees are really cool and really help each other out. ...........
bad,"We were just a job function and not people. They didn't consider us as people just cost. Morale was really low, but they didn't seem to care."
bad,"Management caters to their friends. Management does not let employees rise to their potential. Management does not even know their employees education or experience , or abilities so do not accordingly place them in appropriate jobs. Management shows disrespect. Management does not respect military experience or rank."
bad,People placed in manager positions are not screened and are not qualified to handle people and technical aspects of the job. HR staff is not your friend and will throw you out any chance they get.
bad,Freeport is much like crabs in a bucket. If you try to better yourself there is always someone trying to pull you down.
bad,"Freeport townsite is a joke."
bad,"While the local site management was very good, corporate oversight had no clue what actually goes on at the site, and had no concept of site specific concerns.  Corporate management was often in conflict with local management and would often change guidelines/KPIs without consulting the sites or even notifying them of changes made.  This led to an overall hectic work environment."
bad,"I reported numerous issues that were in violation of the company's policies. The investigation that ensued was a joke. Leaders sleeping with hourly employees, HR professional in a relationship with a Sr. Manager. Employees were treated terribly and there was no path to follow to get that corrected."
bad,"Kepada "
bad,Company is not well ran.  Copper and Gold is king and the reason oil & gas division was sold off piece by piece.  Coworkers were very nice but upper management in Phoenix was horrible.
bad,"I hated the position I was in, I tried for months to transfer to a new area.  But was consistently denied.  In the job I had I never got adequate training for the position I was in."
bad,"long hours, challenging work, ability to work intentionally"
bad,"Twelve hour rotating shifts. Pressure to get results quickly and accurately. Management was a revolving door, as were many of the lab positions. Would not recommend."
bad,Company is selling assets and plans to remove itself from the energy industry. No room for improvement or advancements. Lay offs happening often.
bad,"Sometimes the work environment can be overwhelming and It can be very hard to find a path to promotion. Even with having a degree, its been hard to promote here. management can be hard to deal with sometimes but it is a good job."
bad,"Great place to get started. Yearly performance reviews are evaluated by the site management after your supervisor submits the evaluation. Then they normalized it based on their interaction with you, depending on where you work it can help or harm. Good ole' boy system or everyone is related. Does not enjoy change even when the positive ROI is shown. Not family friendly, to move up you need to rent, and be able to go to any site in the company as soon as they ask. If not you get a black mark and they will tell you that. The ""towers"" determines who are the chosen ones."
bad,"Management is very poor, not proactive, bullies. There's no training. No investment in employees education. "
bad,Henderson operations for Freeport McMoRan is a job that pays the bills but that is about it. They have good medical benefits and a 401K that is vested the first day of employment. There are a lot of politics and lots of the same family work there. In my opinion the job could be a great place to work but it is not that way now. Everything runs through Arizona and the headquarters there and that never seems to work to good being so far away from the decision makers.
bad,Have not been allowed to work at a job that I have applied for except for the first 6 weeks I was employed
bad,"start day with safety meeting then head out to pit and inspect pumps and runall pumps,always learned something new about pumps and tools"
bad,If you want to log drill core and do all the technical aspects of creating a model than this is the office to work for.
bad,It was a fun place to choose a careeer. I chose to be on the IT side.
bad,"When I started at the Climax mine, it was not producing. They had started building a new mill then stopped due to the economic collapse. The site still required maintenance. I was one of only two mine electricians. They eventually finished the mill and restarted production. The new management that moved in was so cutthroat and back stabbing. The only remaining management from the prior operation was in the safety department. Their adoption of zero tolerance regarding safety should be called zero intelligence."
bad,"Stressful place to work. It is hard to get any kind of promotion due to favoritism and the ""buddy system"" "
good,"A typical day would consist of a safety meeting in the morning. Then racing out into the mine to find my haul truck. I would then procede to sit in the haul truck for twelve to sixteen hours driving all day, breaks were discouraged."
good,"Experiencia en El Abra. La compañía no aporta con pasaje ni alojamiento a trabajadores foráneos, gastos que debe solventar el trabajador. Mantienen con contratos a plazo fijo por 1 año o mas para no dar incentivos del contrato colectivo. Bajos sueldos."
good,"the company is great.when copper prices are high,but once the prices fall,u lose ur job,"
good,"Working for Freeport can be very rewarding or it can be very difficult.  Much of the work is very stressful and high speed with no room for error.  They demand a lot of their employees, particularly out of the Corporate Office.  The expectation is job first, anything else is irrelevant.  The work environment is better in the operations, but do not expect to advance in your career very rapidly.  Career advancement and promotion tend to be based upon who you know rather than what you know."
good,"I worked on industrial machinery. The work was good, well benifits. The managment is very unorganized and unprofesional."
good,The moral is very low.There is a strong disconnect between management and employees.  There are a lot of secrets and mystery between management and employees.
good,clock in work your shift to the best of your ability you will get plenty of thank you's and management appreciation but don't expect to see that reflected in your paycheck or by promotions. but overall the job is only as demanding as you make it
good,The company provided a good paycheck and great benefits in an area where it is difficult to find a well paid career. Some departments are better than others. Office politics can be cut-throat. Be wary of inexperienced management.
good,"Just like any other job but with too many engineered rules. Rules designed to keep you safe but are not well thought out and made by people that have never performed the job. Also a company owned town. They have you over a barrel, you lose your job over a simple mistake and you lose your home and if your not prepared, you lose everything."
good,"Exposure to chlorine gas and cyanide gas and sodium hypochlorite was too loosely supervised.  Procedures were not standardized and getting the job done any way possible was encouraged.  Old school, good ol' boy practices of shift supervisors were abusive."
good,"quite an interesting and somehow great company to work for, no doubt about that.However, it feels pathetic to see how politics plays a role in rewarding work base on favoritism rather than merits. Well, this is base on my opinion and observations concluded from past employees. Kind of makes me wonder what the future holds."
good,"I learned all functions of the millwright trade. Show up to work, generally fix equipment that broke due to overworking the equipment. My co-workers are great, management is okay."
good,Typical over promised and under delivered with not much opportunity to get paid for the more responsibility you take on. Haul truck drivers make the same as guys who operate every piece of equipment out there and do all the projects. Management is poor and consistently changing and there is no value in senior employees. All in all we bite the bullet to make a pay check and pay bills. It’s a job!
good,"Benefits are excellent-management is not, no room for advancement. Pay is not that great. asked to do work above your pay grade. No advancement unless you ""know"" someone where you are applying."
good,"Working at the CLP, you have smaller crews and less stress than you have at the mill. CLP is more safety orientated and mill is more focused on the production and numbers side."
good,"Management could be better, help employees more.  Employees are good to work with, very helpful and willing to go the extra mile.  Pay could be better."
good,was never a day when you would get complemented always put down and told there were 2000 others waiting for our job. a lot of favoritism. never advanced as they say you will.
good,Lack of management. Lack of team work. Lack of good employee relations. The location i worked at was in a company owned town. Housing is available to employees however there is a very lengthy wait list.
good,"Good pay and benefits, but at times safety will take a back seat to production. Very hard work schedule 4 / 12 shifts high pace...but room for advancement to safe workers without attendance problems."
good,"Good job security, very slow advancement. It's a great place to get your feet wet in the mining world and to learn your way around equipment and the mining lifestyle but advancement is nearly non existent."
good,Day to day the job changes which is good. Rising to meet those challenges but receiving no compensation for overtime to meet those needs is unfortunate.
good,"Great Benefits, and school in town is great for the kids. Lower management has many problems, and pay never stays the same."
good,"At the site where I work for Freeport McMoRan is a high production fast pace work site. We work a Super 7 schedule that calls for 12 hour days, however each month we get 15 days off too. It tries to be a safe work environment but there is a lot of congestion with all the production equipment. Where I live it is one of the best jobs around."
good,Phelps Dodge was better!
good,It’s a good place to work good money n a good learning experience. Long hours tho jobs can get stressful but all jobs r that way.. I’d tell others to work there it can be a good place some time.
good,"Management was terrible, HR did nothing to help the situation. I was not even allowed to ask questions on how to do something and I had just started. If I was not an intern, I would have quit on week 3. Boss was verbally abusive and extremely condescending. Absolutely no motivation to show up to work besides getting paid. Such a big company that you are just a number and very replaceable."
good,take it if you have no option. Good for a career starter but look elsewhere for career advancement if you are competitive and care about your career. Not the best of job culture and management style. Pretty archaic
good,"Arrive for work one minute late and you WILL BE  sent home with a write up."
good,"Only Job in Area With Decent Pay and Benefits."
good,"the company seems like it is not careing for its employees like they once did"
good,This company is a production oriented company with a safety culture that is very important in the workplace. The job position that I’m in however does not have many opportunities for advancement.
good,Supervisors/Managers/HR show favoritism. It doesn't really matter how good of a job you do but if you are well liked you can get far. Pay is unfair.  Someone doing the same job can be paid substantially more than a person doing it longer.
good,Limited training opportunities. Hard to progress technically because of the limited training they offer. I'm comparing it to other companies I've worked for.
good,"Yep, this job is for you. If you're a hard worker they'll ask for more and more without any move up other than the yearly Cost Of Living raise. The benefits are top notch and the matching 401k deposits are great but don't go to management with any complaints because you'll just be talked down and told that's just the way it is. This company is stuck wishing that it's people would perform better, but never pay them better. I feel like the performance they demand is off-set by the management that the workers are under. The hours and stress is often made worse by being told that each worker can be replaced within a week by someone off the street. Often, we work may extra shifts with no incentive other than more pay. Advancement and training to move up is slow in coming and only if you have a very good relationship with your supervisor. Overall, its a really good company to use as a stepping stone to get experience in the industrial field. Otherwise, avoid if you're not willing to work long hard hours and many days in succession without time off."
good,Mining is not for the faint of heart. It is a very dangerous and challenging environment. Production is above all else. Pay is excellent but would not recommend this company unless you have experience in an industrial setting
good,como lo dije esta empresa esta a buen nivel para competir  en todas las empresas  mineras. de   prestigio. y  ser líder a nivel  nacional
good,"typical day includes steady paced production."
good,"The company is a good place to work.  There is a broad range of people, some who care and others who do not.  Overall it is the best company to work for if you live in the mountains and choices are limited."
good,The job itself is fun and exciting.  But anytime you have a problem and report it to management nothing seems to be done.  Laziness in encoraged.
good,"Working in such an unstable environment, workers and management are forced to look out for themselves regardless of the consequences to others."
good,work in a mine 12 hour plus days and nights. Management dramatizes everything. you have no room for advancement if you don't pay your dues as a grunt for the current boss. your boss changes almost every 3 months and you can not get a straight answer from anyone because they will be transferred soon.
good,When everything was going well there was no pressure but once plant was down and equipment breakdowns there was a lot of implied haste and at times safety procedures overlook some of management would put peer pressure on workers and/or supervisors as to what to do and how to do it.
good,This was an ok company till they downsized. I think management could have done better in how then let employees go and the severance pay could have been better.
good,"Pay is good , noise and dirt is pretty bad too many Generations of Family employees"
good,Been there 7 years been trying for 2 to become supervisor. New hire came in with no supervisor experience and was promoted in 5 months. Decent place to work if you avoid the political atmosphere
good,"Claimed to be safety orientated but walked a thin line on this subject although was a good job.  The mine location there at climax, co had poor management.  Worked long 12 hour shifts with built in overtime up high in the Rocky Mountains.  The weather conditions in the winter were brutal and very dangerous.  The employees at this mine were very easy to work with.  I think that we all just wanted to do our job and return home to our families"
good,Slow growth yet important commodity. The culture is more focused on safety than productivity which hinders growth and innovation. Slow to mage necessary changes to remain competitive.
good,"long hours, dangerous, great benefits, continuous education provided by company, good pay with lots of overtime health insurance the day you start. have to be on time no exceptions"
good,Safety is spoken of time and again...then you get on the field and something is broke down and supervisors want you to violate safety rules.  Good money though.
good,Its an ok place to work if you live there all the time. Morenci has really cheap houses for rent if you work for freeport.
good,"12 to 14 hour days"
good,Always felt like an outsider even though I had all the training and education to perform the tasks for this job I was just never made to feel welcome.
good,"Worked on pumps, cylinders  used equipment for hydraulics. Worked 8hrs a day. Enjoy meeting new people. Had difficulty with math skills and testing. Looking forward to employment opportunities with freeport"
good,"Very poor management, not enough experience, or placed in managemnet because of who they knew, not what they knew."
good,Freeport has a lot of opportunities for the employees to develop.  They prefer to promote from within.  They recognize the benefit of workers with diversified experience.
good,I’m not happy with Freeport mcmoran. I feel that they don’t take as good of their employees as they claim to do. Supervisors are in organized. I feel like it’s hard for career growth opportunities.
good,Freeport has several great benefits and the environment was a great learning experience about safety. Yet the hours of working for this company take away a huge portion of time away from family and other life events .
good,Good place to work with good people. The work schedule was great and management was always willing to work with you for days off. Laid back environment for the most part.
good,Its tough work. Not everyone is built for it. Production is the most important thing. Schedules are set in stone. Has some great benefits but it is a working life. Applying for this job should mean that you will be here for the rest of your life and you are comfortable living in a small mining town until you die. Stay away from certain places. Baghdad mine the  town is not even a village you will not enjoy living there. Silver City Tyrone mine really small not much there. Chino mine horribly outdated with production over safety. Stay away from crushing and conveying and stay away from the Mill. Also Driving the haul trucks is not that fun you have been warned.
good,Good job awesome people. Great atmosphere. People are willing to teach and help you learn new things. Security plays a big role in everyday activities
good,"need better equipment and better training for new employees.shift coverage also a problem, work conditions also another huge problem for that company work condition not good"
good,"As manufacturing companies go, it is not a bad company to work for.  I knew what had to be done and I had complete autonomy over my work production.  I loved the hands off approach by management.  There was nothing hard about this job."
good,"The company itself provides excellent wages, benefits and bonuses. The management and supervision from senior on up are not Worth their title get any proper training to further your trade hard to get parts you need."
good,"I completely loved this job, everyday was a different experience. had it not been for my divorce and the mine closing I would still be there. awesome."
good,"FCX is a goal oriented organization that puts safety of the environment & it's employees as a top priority.  FCX employees are encouraged to meet ethical standards both inside & outside of the workplace.  Overall, FCX is a great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company when it was PXP.  Unfortunately, things went downhill when we became FMOG.  I started in the Accounts Payable Department and moved to Property Administration in Houston, TX.  The company is selling off all of its assets at this time."
good,"Good places to work and raise a family, with locations in Arizona, New Mexico and in Indonesia, you are certain to find somewhere that you can call home"
good,they will pay you a lot but they will drag you through the dirt and not help you up. benefits are great but you with need to see a doc after the management gets done with you
good,The average day includes 2 hours of meetings starting at 6:00am then by 7:15am the plan for the day has changed about three times.  All in all despite the hectic mornings we have a large challenge to keep a massive plant running and all the equipment ready to run.
good,"Freeport McMoran Safford is a great place to learn it all.  You have many opportunities to be well rounded in all networking, process control, desktop support, MESH and 2-way radio support as well as specialized equipment used on the heavy equipment.  Not the best Family/Work Balance."
good,Working the in the warehouse was great.  Great management and they treated you like family and willing to work with you.  Pay was also ok.
good,Felt like most of my managers were always under stress. They would then push that stress down to our department.Probably because of being bought out.
good,"I worked in the radio shop in an open pit copper mine, which was usually dusty, especially in the summer and would turn into a quagmire whenever there was heavy rain.  I had to board electric and hydraulic shovels sometimes and there was thick grease everywhere that I had to be careful not to get on my clothes but sometimes would anyway.  "
good,"Provided Centralized Strategic Planning for Chino, Tyrone and Morenci Mines. Also worked with International operations."
good,"Able to do daily routine that never changes to obtain a good sample analyisis."
good,Working at the local copper mine exposed the employees to the elements and drove there employees hard
good,"Good paying Job, close to home, good benifits and great Culture"
good,"My co-worker's were cool! As for the company,I would not work for them any more at all. I did'nt very much like the expirence,nosecurity."
good,"Job itself isn’t bad, decent pay, good benefits, but depending on department the management is very poor with little to no opportunity for advancement."
good,Work wasn't hard and the employees were great.  The town was small and needed services were 60 miles away.  No recreation available.  Job site very hot in summer.
good,"The job is not bad, but management can be rough. Good old boy mentality in an incredibly small town. If your not liked, then your not liked. Company has good benefits and PTO. Good training program and knowledgeable employee's for most part."
good,"Work place is unique in regards to engineering challenges, like buckling and dynamic loading. Unfortunately the development of engineers in-house is limited to more of a project manager. I feel that this place hurts the development of engineers and focuses on project management. This is shown in the fact that P.E.'s are not required for senior engineers with new engineers to work under. This then slows the development of the new engineers."
good,I learned a lot at the company. Lots of knowledgeable people around with years of experience. Management are open to new ideas and changes. Depending on where you work it could be different in terms of work-pace.
good,Was a great company to work for with great pay and benefits. After working there for 10+ yrs. I was terminated due to poor management and company policies. You would think working for a company all those years they would work with you. I was just a number!
good,Days were busy and sometimes long. Co-workers made it a place you wanted to be. Environment was best when it was a stand alone company.
good,"Start the day with line out, to know what the day is going to be like. I was the lead in the area. So I had the responsibility for everything that goes on in my area. I had to line my co-workers with the day to day work responsibilities for the area. Management worked with me to make sure everyone is working safe."
good,"A great place to work when it was PXP...not so much as FM O&G...to much interferrence from the mining side of the business.  Benefits & equity lowered, culture changed significantly."
good,They have there ups and downs. The people I worked with really made the job the job. The underground life turns ordinary people into family and people you can rely and trust. Management has ups and downs as well. Sometimes making your feel like there head hunting but they make safety there number on priority which is a plus. You always work 12 hr shifts either 6am to 6pm or visa versa so if you aren't capable of long hours then its probably not the job for you.  It pays well once you work there over a year and you have a lot of time off.  I can say if they didn't have to do a reduction if force I would still be there.
good,"Attitude reflects heavily on management, but I enjoyed working with the Operators and getting out in the field. Learned a lot about mining and the ups and downs of the metals market (unfortunately)."
good,"Shift work (12 + hour shifts), equipment maintenance is low to average, job stability is average with copper prices up however if prices drop layoffs are a real possibility, management styles are not consistant, employees are viewed as a large majority of the cause of workplace incidents when in fact faulty equipment and procedures play a significant part in workplace incidents, best part of the job is quitting time."
good,"Bagdad is a company owned town so things are a little different there. The housing issue is the biggest problem, more employees than places to live. The benefits are great, and also only working 15 days out of the month is awesome."
good,Good pay and benefits not a great place to raise a family in morenci. Bosses aren’t very adequate some things are not handled very well and issues are hard to get resolved over all a good place to work though
good,"Haul truck was like a 3 story building.  The 12 hour shifts very tough physically & mentally.  The hardest part of the job were the endless hours alone, in the dark on narrow roads.  The most enjoyable were the salary & benefits."
good,Freeport was a good company to work for. Maybe some day I will go back but everything happens for a reason. My experience while i was there the few years was very beneficial to my advancement to where I am now and I will say this they were always happy about people who wanted to come to work.
good,"The safety environment is very highly promoted. Management is ok."
good,"It's one of the biggest open pit mines in the world but it's the lowest paying in the world yes great benefits but the don't care about there employee they say it but no just no."
good,"At Freeport McMoran, we were a team. We relied on each other to get each job done, as the work was very intense and could be dangerous at times. Working with this company highly refined my sense of purpose and taught me how to work smoothly and efficiently in a group setting."
good,"We become jacks of all trades and masters of none, supporting the multiple divisions of production. Though, there is not enough time to delve deep into design work for any of those divisions, and it is partially discouraged to devote time into becoming proficient at any topic."
good,"the people on the job are great, they really make you feel like family there. especially since we worked on holidays, birthdays and even during our children's birth."
good,Great corporation. Push Safety as #1 which was good. Management was ok but lacked proper way to treat employees ecspecially on the back shift.
good,Great benefits for you and your family. Housing is available but long waitlist. It is extremely beneificial to know someone in human resources to get hired.
good,"A lot can be improved upon and could be one of the best places to work at if the pettiness, unnecessary politics and favoritism will be curtailed. Not a lot of value is placed on level of education and experience, the site for some reason is run like a family business. It's a shame."
good,Many different varieties of issues and concerns to assist employees with.  Never a dull moment.
good,"great benefits, hands on learning. learning in class room and field work. very hard to learn something other than what field you are hired in. its ok."
good,"Management lacked technical knowledge and visibility of remote sites, but other than that the work environment was great until the oil & gas division went out of business. Just to clarify, that is the division I worked in."
good,"Typical day varies depending on skills learned & projects assigned."
good,I was given the freedom to perform the job as I saw fit as long as it was in service of the end-product that the management was expecting.  There were often times that short notice deadlines based on knee-jerk whims by upper management.
good,"Great pay for interns, really low work volume. Spend most of the day trying to find work to do as to not appear lazy. Everyone was pleasant to work with, just not enough work to funnel down to interns."
good,"What I learned was to operate one of the largest pieces of equipment in the mining indust.lifing/training. A typical day started with the pre-shift of my shovel from the ground up the point sheeves, 3 rotations of the shovel to lube my circle gear, inspection of the face and high wall, move shovel into dig face, clean toe  and call for trucks, view ore bodies on CASE, load trucks, move shovel as needed. Management to me on the shove was time managment. Between loading trucks, moving the shovel from one ore body to another with out delaying the trucks and keeping production up was my main concern, besides Saftey that was the main concern, to do it all saftely.  After diong this for so long, your realize that your co worker's become your 2nd family.  So much time is spent with them that they become acustomed to how you work, and you know how they work, what to expect from them as you work in unison. The hardest part of my job was when i would load my trucks out, get off my shovel, run across my shovel pit, get on a rubber tire dozer clean my  pit park the rubber tire, run back to my shovel and load the next truck assigned that arrived with out delays.  The most enjoyable part was the respect of all my co-workers that was given after  loading 200+ trucks in a 12 hr shift, knowing that it was done saftely , and all my co -workers were going home ."
good,My review from Freeport Mac ran was good at lasted about half an hour to 45 minutes the people that interviewed me were really good and really professional and  nice
good,The work and life balance was the best for me by far as there were the same amount of days at work as there were days at home which was a good balance as I never felt exhausted.
good,"operate cranes, and other heavy equipment"
good,"Typical work day started in stocking and cleaning of all 12 kitchens, sort and deliver mail, and maintenance of conference rooms equipment. I worked with three wonderful people who were helpful, friendly, and always willing to go the extra mile for co-workers and management. We worked as a team and made sure we left work knowing we accomplished a lot and more. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day (only got to sit during lunch hour) and being on my feet daily was hard and the enjoyable part was I got to loose weight (fun thing for me) and because I enjoyed working with three amazing co-workers who made my job enjoyable and challenging."
good,"Good place for employment however no chance for advancement. Steady to hard and fast paced workplace on all equipment....all blades, dozers up to D11’s, loaders , as big as 994’s, rubbertire dozers, Rick hammers, excavators, and I was training on shovels but I opted out."
good,quite and productive. the people are cooperative and very helpful. the work hours are flexible. they also help with public transportation in and out of the city.
good,"Over all very rewarding until accepting a management position. Opportunities to excel and expand upon my skills sets as a tech.  Upon entry into management, way to much in the way of politics for entry level."
good,"Working in maintenance you will work your tail off, hard long hours all the time with management always looking over your shoulder all the time. They have the best benefits package that I’ve ever had, and have a great 401k match as well. It’s sitting nice!!! Depending on your department and job duties, will determine how much you can and will make. Everyone there makes different amounts. You will be paid on your skills not across the board like other compounds which I liked!"
good,"Lots to do, not enough time to get things done, excellent benefits package.  Great compensation, free bus pass, six summer 1/2 days, generous 401k and vacation incentives."
good,The industry is always changing and keeping up to date serves as an informational and challenging experience different than those experienced in my previous careers.
good,Long shifts that rotate once a week between day shifts and night shifts. There are two overlapping shifts for positive turnover. 4 crews. The benifits are great. Especially once you get off the waiting list for company housing. Very cheap. Average work of about 15 days a month. Long shifts make for having more days off.
good,"Just understand that long-term employment at Freeport, on equipment, will most likely cause damage to your back. Also, working up the ""ladder"" is difficult unless you ""wine and dine"" the bosses."
good,The likeliness of being laid off is extremely high. The overtime can be abundant if copper prices are high. The management is not the best but it is what it is.
good,"I have nothing bad really to say.   I do wish management would allow for more advancement within the company, but I’ve seen many qualified applicants turned down including myself, that’s a bit of a problem here.  Otherwise, the pay is fair for the work we do, but the summers are hot here in the mill and maintenance department.  As with every other place one would work there is backstabbing and people that just can’t mind their own darn business."
good,Great company with potential to grow as company grows.  Ability to work independently to to report financials and improve processes in a productive and friendly work environment.
good,"the work life is nice at times "
good,"I got many management skills from the project."
good,Great Place to Work. Learned a significant amount. Management was helpful and supportive. Always an exciting job as no two days were ever the same....
good,Freeport is a great place to work. I have always been treated well with the company. I have learned a lot with my time here. The training classes are great.
good,"In order to hone effective management skills, I have participated and achieved success by managing projects & personnel associated with construction and maintenance projects, EH&S permits, ISO, ICMM, sustainability projects. Develop and implement various plans that require a direct relationship with managers, teams, supervisors, engineers within various industries. "
good,Decent place to wr\ork. took voluntary lay off with incentives to ensure I would have money to support family in case of layoffs later down the road
good,"Worked at Freeport for the summer, great people and great office. Highly recommend although revenues might be down this year and stock prices are plummeting. Would of accepted a full time offer if they were hiring Civil Engineers."
good,I worked for Freeport for almost five years. Being in Southern Arizona summers were very Hot. I learned alot about the Mining industry. As a Mine electrician I was exposed to different Departments and different situations.
good,Kept you busy doing eveyone elses job. Everyone needs to give this company a try a least once. That would be all it takes....Period!! P.S. just dont tell them you are thinking about quitting. Just do it!!! Other than that....good place to work.
good,"Gathered requirements from infrastructure department on compliance policy and measures to generate compliance reports"
good,"This company allowed me to expand my knowledge as an operator.  I started as a Haul Truck driver and when the mine shut down in 2009, I had just moved up into a Shovel Operator position."
good,I would enter time for 400 employees each day (Monday-Sunday). I would work every other Sunday to enter time for end of payroll weeks.  Worked with the supervisors of each crew and enjoyed my job.
good,it is an alright place to work with good insurance and job security
good,"Good Job, But very long Hrs. Management is fine. Co Workers fine. The hardest part of my job driving the Haul Trucks everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is i guess working with my co workers. It was Nice!!!"
good,Day starting with safety focus. Tools and training are available.  Work load is manageable with some personal sacrifices. Company is stable in a cyclical commodities framework.
good,Great benefits life Insurance  the pay really depends on you as a what type of experience you have don’t pick up any bad habits from the people that have been there for awhile most of them just going through motions letting the new people do all the work but is really a good company to work for
good,"The pay at this company is almost always good. Even at entry level. The benefits are also very good. They are generally safety oriented and have plenty of help overall. "
good,Learning all jobs in the Mill.  Creating the culture of Safety first aswell as creating a high quality product.  Checking reagents and maintaining a safe work area.  Doing the job according to SOP while keeping production goals in mind.
good,"good people and good opportunities"
good,"Love working here it takes care of all my family members. Love working with people, love training people but in morenci I think they lack on training , they don't  let you work on equipment they you work with. They don't let operators due their job they are always telling you how to run tour equipment, and supervisor can't  make no decisions they have to ask upper management if you are on shift you should make that decisions wether it's wrong or right you have to make an executive decisions . The supervisors have a lot of favoritism, they arw5 not equally fair to all employees."
good,"Good place to work with great benefits and pay, can be stressful and fast paced but definitely a workaholic dream come true. Good incentive to stay when you get started."
good,"Good company, fair pay and benefits, they also offer employee housing, the shifts are days and nights so they will switch back and forth but it also depends on your position."
good,Salary employees are very overworked and under compensated.  The corporate policies make is such that supervision is at a major disadvantage when it comes to interacting with hourly employees.
good,"Very little work/life balance. Vey stressful atmosphere, upper management is over aggressive. Deadlines are never met because you cannot depend on anyone"
good,"Good benefits & salary but as a supervisor, due to start up & shut down scheduled maintenance, the hours could be challenging weekly."
good,"A big hole in the ground, there is many projects ahead. Many different positions and job titles, there is a lot of people to meet and work with."
good,this place has been a good place to make good money. it has taught me a lot about work place safety and has showed me where I want to go with a  career. it has been an excellent provider for myself and my family for many years.
good,"The engineers makes reasonable benefits but when I learned that some technicians makes more that the engineers, it left a bad taste about the company."
good,Don't recognize experience vs. college degree in most exempt positions
good,"Daily events, grab and run samples, adjust flows, temps, valves, and rectifier setting to maintain setpoints for copper grades and plating in the tankhouse. As operator 2 I had the ability to make calls and perfom duties that I saw fit for the overall performace of the plant. I enjoyed working with my operator and ensuring that he was the best he could be in the event of a power bump or gunk run that could potentially bring the plant down and cease the production of copper. Manegment was good about pointing the direction that was needed and let the operators/supervisors make the best possible calls."
good,oveall it was a good company to work for .lots of benefits plentyf work there was always something to do.managers were knowlegeable in all aspects .
good,This is a good company to work for. The compensation and the benefits are great. They care about their safety culture and the work environment. They also care about their employees.
good,"It is an excellent place to work, but in Peru there are not a lot of opportunities for all the professionals; however, you can improve your skills and feel a good worker."
good,The company has a great internal program to identify talent and promote it; your progression will depend on your appetite to advance. The hardest part of working for the company is it's remote locations.
good,"On a daily basis I would track shipping and receiving of equipment. I would log crew boat hours worked, liquid tank volumes and condition of tanks for scheduled clean out and restoration. I interacted and was manager of 5 dispatchers. We had a very cohesive and positive working relationship."
good,"If you are looking for a company that offers amazing benefits along with great compensation, and plenty of room for advancement this is the company for you."
good,"They provide great benefits. It isn't ideal to live in the mine because of lack of things to do. They did, however, install a new community center which was nice."
good,"The fast pace industrial atmosphere is a daily challenge to keep employees motivated and focused on all aspects of the job to include performing their duties safely. The company places safety as our main objective and supports all initiatives to maintain a safe work environment."
good,"-very laid back"
good,It's an exploration company.  You get to work with amazing and intelligent people.  You get to learn and experience new things even though my position is just an encoder.
good,Advancement is not easy unless you go to a mine site.  Very big on educational degrees. Credentials.  An event calendar with suites at all the arenas and stadiums. Company bonuses.
good,Great place to work but had too much debt. Worked a lot of different areas including conventional and unconventional resources. Forced to sell all oil & gas properties and laid off all 1500 employees
good,"This job really teaches a person about safety and working as a team to accomplish goals.  It's a fun work environment, but it isn't for everyone as the jobs can be difficult."
good,Freeport McMoRan is a good company to work for.  Compensation is good and bonuses reflect safety and production.  Corporate is at times oppressive to sites.
good,"good people on the right facility"
good,"There are many sites for this company and for the most part, the company cares a large amount about its employees. They pay good money, but of course depending on the site, it could be worse or better."
good,"I was hired as a contractor to provide experience and leadership during the initial stages of an EPCM contract for a very large copper mine expansion.  When that role was complete, my contract was terminated"
good,Typical day at work was great learned new things every day.
good,"I Operated a 793 C Haul Truck transporting copper, ore from Industial Shovels to various dump sites for copper processing. I operated the 793 Haul Truck in a safe productive mannor. I recieved a safety reward for completion of one year with no saftey incidents or complaints. The 793 Haul Truck is a 315 ton haul truck when fully loaded.In the Leach.Field I replaced broken leach drip lines,performed routine checks, looking for acid/water puddles or broken lines."
good,Good place to work .  Some favoritism is involved and if a manager does not like you they do not treat you fairly.  But overall the company does take care of their employees
good,"Long shifts, excellent benefits. Company really focused on safety. Huge company lots of employees. Ability to move around to different jobs. Great PTO plan."
good,I worked in the middle of nowhere. the best part was the rent was cheap and affordable. I worked a lot of overtime which made up for the low start pay but soon advanced.
good,Great place to work. as long as you work hard and have good attendance Freeport takes care of you. Great pay and benefits. The sky's the limit if your willing to work for it.
good,"My time at Freeport McMoran Was alot of fun and plenty of chances to take CAT Classes I worked as a field Mechanic, the shop was alright to work in but I preferred the fast pace of the field its a 80 square mile mine"
good,"Great upper management with nice work life balance.  Typical day not too stressful, ability to work well with other departments, high call volume but not too many meetings.  Executive assistants and administrative assistants worked well together and no drama."
good,Great projects to work on and great people to work with.  Able to work on your own and have to ability to ask questions of the seniors.  Room for people to advance and move around the company.
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for, with competitive benefits, although everybody has a different experience depending on your luck and skills. I have seen many do very well and others not so much. I would recommend anyone to give it a try and see if it is a good fit for them. Be ready to bail sooner than latter if you get stuck at any level, and cannot change jobs inside (which is true for any job). Start seeking other opportunities on the outside early if that is the case. It is a good company to have on your resume, particularly if you are interested on working on the resource extraction business (i.e.: mining, oil, gas)"
good,"Good paying job with a lot of advancement in different departments. 12hours shift work typically, but plenty of days off. The environment in some areas are highly dangerous to health, but protection is available."
good,Originally Plains Exploration and Production with great opportunities and management team. Bought out by big mining Freeport-McMoRan and things went downhill fast.  Lost my job due to full divestiture of Oil & Gas business
good,Big company with big company ideas. With safety a priority. If you want to travel you have several countries to choose from and a variety of careers to choose.
good,The company overall is a great place to work if you're looking for a long-term career somewhere. The downside is that the company is having a difficult time due to the economy.
good,"9 hour days, improved labor law knowledge, arbitration.  Not enough focus on employee engagement"
good,"Good compensation and benefit package.  My current position provided me great experience in employee relations.  There was no such thing as a ""typical"" day."
good,"The management and culture of work is changing to a global standard. The idea of a global company standard is not a good or valid conformation for diversity. Every location on earth will not have the same functions, so standards for work and management, should be locally applied."
good,The start off pay is great. The opportunity to grow is there and its up to you if you want to. Just have to work hard and show dedication.
good,"Team meeting before every shift. Get to assigned truck. Preform safety and maintenance checks. Look up assigned rout on the onboard GPS. Transport cargo safely. Management was always available, team members worked well together. With shift work schedule we always got 7 days off every month."
good,I work in the maintenance department as a diesel repairman. Freeport is a great place to enhance your skillset and build a career.
good,Company has great benefits. Long hours. Job sometimes depends on the copper market. Would be great to work for if they didn't put such Micro managers in charge.
good,"An organization that strives to produce copper in a safe and efficient way. Provides a lot of opportunities for individuals to learn and adapt to the business need. "
good,"tend to control chemical changes and reactions in the processing of industrial consumer product. Equipment used includes ISA vessel Monitor and Record products to ensure that specified conditions are maintained.Patrol work areas to detect leaks Record operational data, such as temperatures, pressures, ingredients used, processing times"
good,"Line out."
good,"Very lucrative pay and benefits, but your always walking on egg shells due to the rise and lower of copper prices. The safety culture is to be commended and all should feel very safe working there."
good,"with the cost of living so low in new mexico, the pay we recieve at freeport is great. the benefits are good as well - health insurance, vacation, bonus programs, 401k match. the town is very small, which is nice, but it can be a challenge to infiltrate the ""brotherhood""; in some instances there are generations of guys working at the mine & that can be hard when you're a new guy."
good,"Freeport is a good place to work  like any, it has its ups and downs.  Lots of young kids with degrees get moved up pretty fast, but experience doesn’t have as much merit. It’s a good job though, pays good as long as you’re willing to work. Offers apprenticeship programs every couple years as well."
good,The people at this company make the sometimes long and dirty days worth it. The camaraderie among employees is second to none and I would go back in a heart beat.
good,It is a good place to work. The culture is good I just want to learn new things. I would like to see how things work at other companies or sites. Overall it is a good place to work.
good,"In my 6 years I have learned a lot of new job duties. It has got me out of my comfort zone to try new things. The Accounts Payable Dept. is fast paced, constantly changing and always moving towards more efficient process improvements."
good,"Focus on safety and production, some chance to advance, depending on how hard you want to work for it. Need to have a safety and production mind set, not just one or the other."
good,I had fun working there until my health got in the way. I suffer from RA and working in that environment put a strain on me. They're a great company but I wished they were accepting of employees who have a condition and are willing to give them time off for doctors visits no matter if there's no leave allowed.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was coming to a job where I was happy. I really enjoyed the work I did. Most important the opportunity to work some of the smartest, and nicest people I have had the pleasure of working with. It worked with a great group of people."
good,I enjoyed working with competent individuals. The company was great to offer bonuses even during difficult times. The company did a lot to keep people but was not genuine in caring about individuals beyond their ability to make the company more profitable.
good,"Great place to work,very safety oriented workplace. I would love to work there again.The people are friendly and professional."
good,i would have to say working 13 years with this company i am very pleased. They have always taken care of their employees. They have great benefits and wonderful schedules.
good,Company gave me the opportunity to travel and experience other cultures and work experiences.  Worked with a large variety of outside vendors and they valued my tough requirements to adhere to contracts.
good,Very busy and challenging.  Lots of personnel to train and nice place. management was good to work with as well.  Learned how to train challenged employees.
good,"Typical day at work was trying to stay alert and awre of ones surroundings , safety was very high priority. You learn to trust in the people that work aroound you."
good,Best company I have ever worked for . I feel valued for my skill set and have been recognized for positive achievements . They offer relocation packages and bonuses etc. . The companies HR department has a strong role with the company where most unions would usually provide some job protection there is actually an employee board randomly appointed for arbitration on firings etc. . I have seen multiple people get fired and then return to work after the arbitration process . It's a steady job that pays well with good benefits . Enough said .
good,"I have been with Freeport for over 10 years, they have treated me well, however due to the economics of the prices dropping we are cutting back personnel and production at the Sierrita mine."
good,"Operated tractor with concave blade to gouge out level and distribute earth and to push trees and rocks from land, preparatory to constructing roads and buildings, planting crops, mining, quarrying and lumbering."
good,FCX is a multi billion dollar company which provides great benefits and competitive pay.  Unfortunately when copper decreases the mines are affected a great deal and layoffs start to occur.
good,"I love working for Freeport. The company offers great benefits and lots of opportunity if you work hard. However, there locations are typically not in very desirable locations."
good,"This is a very large company with a vast amount of different types of work. Depending on your qualifications and your desire you could go from a laborer to skilled worker or management in a few years or so."
good,This may have been the most boring job I have ever held. I drove from collecting a load in my assigned truck and took it to the dumpsite and then back to get another load.
good,I really enjoyed working for Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc
good,A typical day at work was reviewing the leases to make accurate royalty payments. I had excellent training and good direction from management. I learned how to pay attention to small details. We had a very agreeable work team. I enjoyed assisting clients on the phone.
good,i all was gave 120% to my job and i put in long hr at work and i all ways did what i was told to do and did my best
good,"Work rotating shifts, days and nights, twelve hours a day.  Work can be physically demanding, and there is potential for getting hurt if not paying attention.  Company compensates well with excellent benfits."
good,work kept us busy and management helped and worked with us on our schedules. It was a good place where we became close and worked really well with each other and always tried to help each other out when we could.
good,Interns are paid very generously compared to other companies. Many of their locations are in small mining towns. A great place to intern overall and a good company to work for.
good,I worked here for 8 months it was all good till I got a new supervisor then it went down hill but I had great coworkers who were like my brothers an more it’s was great place to work
good,If i can join to PT Freeport i say thanks to Allah and i must work hard for freeport until i can give benefits for a company and also i can take benefits for may future.
good,Freeport is a great job for minimum entry requirements with good pay.  Freeport is very safety orientated and the management is quite involved don every level.

good,great job to work I lean a lot about the mine I went on medical leave twice great pay a lot of safety things log work days love the days off didn't like the 7 nights
good,"Good company to work for.  Great training, good family/work balance, good pay and good benefits.  Will definitely consider going back given the opportunity"
good,"como toda minera, tenía buenos beneficios. yo solo hice mi práctica ahí"
good,Excellent company to work for benefits good pay easy going supervisors and team work was great at Freeport-McMoRan lots of time off and payed sick days
good,"Freeport is a survivor. Lean, agile, and adaptable.  You are expected to do your part - if you see something that needs to be done - do it.  The company and its leadership is forthright and consistent."
good,During my employment I believe that Freeport expressed a genuine interest in the safety of their employees.  I did not like the annual review process it definitely needs improvement.  Pay for performance is a plus.
good,"A typical day would be interaction with team members and other departments.  Ability to multi-task, rarely able to concentrate on just one project.  I learned when estimating a time line for a project include time for unexpected projects that were moved to top priority. Management allowed me to work on my own, project assigned and I provided updates or issues as needed.  Management was able to defined employees requiring guidance or those able to work on their own."
good,nice place to work and live.  Need more room for growth and development.  I would have liked to eventually develop management skills that were not offered.
good,"workplace culture was very diverse , generous compensation and medical and dental benefits. overall great place to work. military friendly was also a huge bonus as well"
good,"Morning meeting, shift line out and keep up on what the employees are doing in the shop. I learned that a mine like this is different than anything else I had done but enjoyed it. I had a very good supervisor and learned a lot from him about this business. The work culture was different in that the supervisors were to be supervisor and not get to involved in the work the employees were doing unless they asked for help. Was not being at home. The best part was I had two great crews that worked for me in my time there."
good,It was a good place to work .  A very large copper mine was fun and exciting with many different challenges.  The people were good to work with i really enjoyed working for them
good,"Freeport-McMoRan is a great place to work. Freeport McMoRan offers good pay, good benefits and opportunity for advancement.  I would recommend this job."
good,Freeport has a great safety culture. They are a company that genuinely cares about their employees and the environment. They are a very large operation.

good,"A lot can be learnt at Freeport. It is very good for beginers. College graduates get to learn quickly on the job. It is a place that has thought me a lot. Everyday, everytime and every year, new things are thought by way of improving safety and enviromental issues. There is also continuous improvement of the skills of employees. Only few managers and supervisors make it hard for employees to stay longer."
good,Great place to work at and a great place to learn skills as an intern and provide value back to Freeport. I would definitely recommend people to apply at Freeport-McMoRan.
good,We have a pm crew that performs lube and minor repairs on various equipment associated with open pit mining.  Learned to work well alone and with others in a safe and productive  manner.
good,At the location I work at there is a lot of nepotism. The best way to advance here is to be a friend or family member of a high positioned person in the company.
good,"Days are long, but the pay is good. I truly liked the schedule at this company. I had a mini vacation each month with 7 days off in a row. You work alone mostly with radio communication as your prime source of interacting with co-workers. The hardest part of the job is staying awake. The enjoyable part of this job was very good safety practices so you can go home to your loved ones."
good,Instruct classes on safe operation and guide lines for Heavy Equipment/Forklifts. I have good rapport with personal.  The hardest part of my job it to be sure I give all the information that has to do with the equipment that I and instructing.  Is making sure that the employees understand and are safe at their jobs.
good,"Nice place to work. Approximately 30,000 employees and 50,000 contract employees which follow the same code of conduct and expectations around the world."

good,It was a good company to work for but its not for me.So im trying to find a better job!
good,"Good pay, great job work balance. Plenty of room for advancement. Only con is it is a mining company so must be willing to live/work in remote areas."
good,Working in a mine for the past three years I have learned a lot about open pit mining. I am currently working on the blasting crew and I will say that this type of work is really sensitive with safety. One must keep in constant contact with all the team members along with other departments with in the mine.
good,"Safety meeting"
good,"12 to 14 hr work day, company offered college scholarship and paid hands on training"
good,"I was able to stay busy, able to work overtime living in Morenci."

good,"Freeport McMoRan is one of the largest companies you've never heard of. It is the largest publicly traded copper producer in the world, and as with all other mining companies, moves at an incredible speed. If you are interested in being immersed in your work, an open pit mine is an unbeatable experience. As a technical employee, I handle multiple projects on a daily basis. I oversee purchasing, planning, design, contracting, and construction. It is extremely rewarding work, since my ""end customers"" are my coworkers in the mine. Most projects last around 6 months from start to end, so there is never a monotonous day. Expect to work very long hours and live in very remote places, the company does operate mines after all. You will get dirty occasionally, and that is one of my favorite parts of the job."
good,Excellent company to work for. Committed to promoting a safe working environment for the entire workforce as well as sub contractors. Ability to communicate with human rdourcrs and upper management with confidence
good,Everyone was super friendly. Very balanced workload and the management style is great. Normal hours are from 7am to 4 pm. There is a gym on site as well as a nurse.
good,"Worked for company for 8 years.  Great Company along with great benefits.  However, my job duties while there would change on a daily basis depending on what project I was working on, therefore I had to make quick changes and constantly prioritize.  Freeport McMoran is a fast-paced company."
good,This was a good company to work for. They are not in business anymore because of the low price of sulphur on the market. Most of the employees were easy to work with and very helpful when help was needed.
good,"The company has a lot of locations in several locations, also tasks safety very serious and encourages people to support their efforts, also takes the time to train employees in tasks and working cultures. "
good,Cool work place with friendly employees. Fun place to work and gain new knowledge. Worked alongside with my colleagues.
good,"FMI offers a great environment to grow and progress in one's career."
good,We worked 12 hour shifts six to six lots of days off. Great benefits. all of the coworkers were great to work with.  Management could use some change to better the company.
good,A typical day at work started off with talking with the dispatcher that's on shift at the time i got to work. I have to speak to him about what material we are mining for the day and how many haul trucks we were operating at the time. I have to then log my entire crew in and give each one of them an assignment such as what haul truck to operate or which piece of equipment they will be operating for the day. I sit up in a command center and dispatch the entire mine with nine different computers. making sure everything is running efficiently and correctly for the day.
good,Pretty good straight forward job. Not too many people hassle you. Not a lot of complaints I can have aside from the nepotism that clearly occurs.
good,The people that work at this company are very friendly and great to work with. The management really tries to help you achieve your goals.
good,"Great work environment and not much stress at work environment. Overall, I would say FreePort McMoran is a descent place to work."
good,This was a fun place to work.  you worked hard but you also played hard.  You were well compensated for your work. Worked as a team.   Felt like you were working with family.
good,This job is by far my favorite. They Have great health plans and they pay pretty decent. In Safford there are basically only two places to work that have amazing benefits and that is the mine and correction. I chose the mine and never regretted it.
good,Very supportive environment that encouraged professional and personal development. The company as a whole was dynamic and exciting. Outside activities with co-workers was encouraged and proved beneficial to overall morale.
good,"Pros"
good,looked forward to go to work totry to learn something new everyday. like the people i worked with and overall just a nice place to work
good,"At Freeport you will automatically be given PTO and benefits with great pay when hired on. This company gives you a realistic opportunity to make a career out of your job. The benefits are probably the best part of this job as well as the work/life balance and out-weigh most of the cons."
good,"Great company to work for. Amazing training program and phenomenal safety training. The pay and benefits are more than fair for their jobs. The supervisors and administration are very friendly and considerate, as well as fair and personable. The benefits are all there and then some, including healthcare and school reimbursement. I started as an operator and moved up to Planner/ Project Manager, so advancements are definitely achievable in this company. All-around great place to work in my experience."
good,All employees were very well paid at a first facility owned by a first class company.  Long hours and high standards were expected.  I would have stayed but the facility I managed shut down.
good,"Bank Reconciliation"
good,The supervision gives you the tools you need to perform your job. They are very committed to safety on and off the job. And they work as a team so they become like family.
good,"Great experience, can't wait to get back. Learned the fine elements of how to respect the principles of minerals and how they were processed which I had never knew it could be done possible."
good,Could be there now if manage was different with me. Was let go because of lock out try out when the machine was locked out by me at the breaker. Was asked to remove my lock from the machine so they could use the machine on the next shift. Poor managers.
good,This has been a good company just no room to advance in my position. I would consider staying for hope of advancing in my field yet the positions I seek are not available onsite.
good,A very diverse workforce and provides a challenging environment that stimulates growth. Projects assigned were very vital and it was good to work on vital projects that can help the company improve its operations.
good,Challenging work in many ways. Great pay and benefits! Good people. Management at Central Analytical Service Center could be better.  The CLP was a awesome place to work.
good,"I think Freeport McMoran is a great place to work, they have excellent benefits and great pay. Freeport will send you to the necessary training to get you to understand your task"
good,Great co-workers and managers. Many opportunites to learn and grow within this company. Managers always very understanding and appreciative of their staff.
good,Don be a lazy person if you want ti work here. you've got to self motivated and willing to do jobs that nobody wants to do. also if your'e late bring donuts for everyone.

good,"I really enjoyed my job. It was the management that sided with one over the other. It became a very depressing and dark place to work. If one person didn't like the other, it became "" Lord of the Flies"" leadership."
good,Good management and culture. Hours are a little long for full-time workers. I worked as an intern and it was a great pay so I think the pay is great for full-time.
good,Gained experience in both sales and marketing fields. Became very adaptable in the workplace due to the high diversity of day-to-day tasks. Culture varies greatly from corporate office to mine sites.
good,I felt that each day during my internship I was productive and learned valuable skills from my co-workers about how the company keeps their accounting records and compiles them into a monthly accounting package for their shareholders. The company's culture was very welcoming and productive.
good,Everyday I am learning something new. Just like with any company there are ups and downs. Working here is very positive.
good,"I work for Freeport for 3 Years, doing different jobs. I mostly ran the bar. I learned how to do all inventory and I did all the ordering. The hardest part of the job was deciding whether or not I needed to continue carrying a special kind of liquor or not. The easiest part of the job was working with all my customers. I got to meet new people every day"
good,"Strong management team (CEO/CFO combo).  Good family type atmosphere, but as with any large organization, there are idiots walking around.  The international aspect of the mining operations is very interesting if one takes the time to understand all the operations."
good,"Responsible for inspecting welding and coating activities of PLET's and Riser Guide Tube Assemblies. "
good,You feel very safe in your different day to day job sites by doing area inspections.  It is instilled upon your hiring that every place where you may work needs to be thoroughly inspected for dangers and those dangers need to be mitigated and controlled.
good,The people are good and caring for each other at work place. you have the opportunity to learn and network.The pay is also good.
good,"Consultation and support of a pro-active team ensures the successful outcome for all.  Learning and understanding each team members social skills enhanced communications and led to better understanding of objectives.  As a team player myself, I was able to earn the respect of my team along with my co-workers as I understood the duties and responsibilities of those I supervised and worked with.  As a multi-tasker and an individual who is desirous to utilize the full range of my capabilities, I may find my eagerness exceeds others expectations; therefore, I have learned to ""slow down"".  Being the responsible Manager of a committed team with an infectious enthusiasm level is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Project Work, Data Management, Geologic & Geophysical Mapping for Hydrocarbon Exploration"
good,Great place to work and allows me to see the world.  Would recommend the company to everyone.
good,Hard work.
good,Good for the most part. Elevation above 12000 ft cold long winters.
good,"The company has great benefits and job security is amazing to work for.  The hours are a tough at first for a truck driver, but you have 14 days of a month with 7 days straight. Overall great company!"
good,la escuela de todas las mineras faena minera el abra todo excelente lo mejor es el compañerismo
good,"Review emails, coordinate meetings with suppliers. Participating in weekly meetings to report status of expediting, critical and urgent PO´s. Discussing and proposing recovery plans when fabrication is delayed for unforeseen events. Supporting logistics participating in continuous meetings with supplier to ensure everything is aligned to ship materials and equipment to site"
good,"This was my first job in accounting.  I loved working at the job site and learning about the different aspects of such a large project.  The days were long and the work was endless, but it was enjoyable and the people and management were fantastic.  It's unfortunate that the job was only a contract position.  I would have loved to continue my time there."
good,The management and my co-workers are great.  I have really enjoyed working here.  It is a project and it is coming to an end.
good,If you like the wild west good pay and company housing for dirt cheap this is the place. If your not used to the area it may be alittle tough the Job great!!! The town folks leave much to be desired also during the recession their was quite the layoff. But id say do it as long as you can handle a redneck hillbilly area where the people are strange to say the least and the police are very crooked. Then this can could be a great area for you i would suggest living in safford and driving the 45mins. But the housing prices are phenomina.
good,The work here is fairly easy and there is no problems otherwise. When it comes to manager is where is everything fails. Disorganized and lacks communication among other key traits to be a decent leader.
good,"Sometimes working under ground is hard as it is you need good people to work with. "
good,Great Company to work for but hard on family life!  Great opportunities for advancement and all the training you need to be successful!  Very demanding but they compensate you quite well for it!!
good,"Every one is friendly, all were our brothers keepers, like one big family."
good,"Long shifts, you only work 14 days a month and have 7 days off in a row every month, medical is the best for the price you pay, hard to move from everything in the world but well worth it, over all would of retired there is i did not have family medical reasons to leave."
good,"I am a South African, female, currently employed at Freeport Mcmoran – Tenke Fungurume Mining as a Commodity Manager"
good,The only bad thing about work here is they take favoritism towards certain employees and like to show it and will outcast employees if they feel a certain way about the culture
good,Fast paced job that is based off of production goals. Very safety oriented. They make sure you get the training needed for your job. Very minimal career advancement.
good,"Great company.  I have loved working here.  As I meet others in other departments and hear how things are there, I hear nothing but good things.  I have been to many mine sites and hear great things.  Unfortunately, I am in MIS at the tower where things are rougher.  There is a treadmill of projects that never end and there is never time to do the right thing and maintain or improve existing structures.  the goal is to always close the project on time, keep the lights green.  If you have to, open a new project to move the work you did not finish to and claim it is a new effort.  Never claim you  did not meet time budget or scope budget.  Gets old after a while.  Very little room for advancement, often they would much rather hire from outside than promote from within."
good,"Freeport is highly focused on goal attainment and empowering management tools and budget to achieve them."
good,"Good job, benefits are excellent. Lots of training available. Mine environment is fast paced and safety is paramount. At Freeport safety is number 1 priority production 2nd."
good,Swing shifts and crazy long shifts but great benefits and good money and training. I would probably go back if needed to.
good,Work never ends . Always on the go to haul rubbish from the roads. Weather plays a huge factor too much rain or fog can make the job at times harder
good,"labor physical"
good,"Freeport McMoRan is a great company to work for, just need better management to improve leadership and instruction in training and operating equipment."
good,Freeport is a great company that truly values safety and employee retention. They are leaders in the industry and really take care of employees. They promote overtime and it is often unlimited.
good,Good place to work. I think they treat employees fairly and honestly. A lot of the positions require shift work but it is manageable. Pay for performance.
good,"From the time I was there it was great work Experience. The safe at Free Port was high plus the paid was good but the time away from family was hard. The schedule was set but not that much time to see family because it was a set schedule.. But the paid and benefits were there, So you couldn't come plane.. Overall the paid is good and the work it Great... great work Environment"
good,"Get use to the safety in everything you do. Like the company,  hard to move up without a degree or speciality trade. If you thinking of a trade, electrician is in the way to go."
good,"Benefits are great, but the current Political Administration hates the oil and gas industry and you will miss your family and Holidays with an offshore job. Then you are not considered for onshore jobs because your salary was so high."
good,Freeport is a very good company to work for they are just lacking in retirement benifits.  The work offshore is a family culture and very good to work with.
good,"Worked on the shelf of LA and in the GOM targeting deep, sub-salt deposits. Very exciting work, but as with every other similar company, you could be let go at anytime based on oil and gas prices."
good,My experience at Freeport-McMoRan was overall good.   The compensation and benefits were very competitive.  I would recommend working for them.
good,"Problem solving on invoice issues, and receiving issues. Placing orders, expediting orders. ISO 9001 review, customer service, supplier relationships, supplier file updates, price negotiations, fixed pricing, PIR creation."

Safety and health initiatives, both on and off the job, are a critically important investment in our employees."
good,With the nice pay comes long hours day and night but is rewarding with the work schedule.  You are able to do a lot with family.
good,bastante entusiasmo y responsabilidad y cumplir con los objetivos de la empresa.
good,"Great place to work, Great Company. Very dedicated to employee safety and training."
good,"A typical day was often fast-paced, but laid-back at the same time.  I learned that working for a large corporation presented some challenges like a lack of communication between departments, particularly MIS, often resulting in stressful situations, requiring ""work-arounds"" to complete tasks which should have been easy.  Several changes over the years, including what I would call management-by-committee seems to have slowed down the decision-making process.  Otherwise, the day-to-day interaction between me and my counterparts, in other departments, was generally a worthwhile experience.  And, was one of best parts of my position."
good,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. is what you make of it. Yes, it can be stressful and hectic at times with plenty of on-site drama amongst the employees, but that is, unfortunately, the nature of manufacturing sites. If you can have slightly thicker skin than average then this is a must-have opportunity to work for them. Their pay and benefits are phenomenal and the support you receive is in-line with most Fortune 500 companies. They also do a great job of promoting you when it is appropriate and providing raises and bonuses frequently. You can really take on as many responsibilities as you want, just be careful of what you wish for. If offered an opportunity to work for them, I would take it."
good,Great place to work with alot of opportunities. Supervisors are very helpful the trainers will point you in the right direction for success!!!! The company provides everything you need for a safe and relaxing work environment.
good,"This is one of those places where you get what you are willing to put it in.Training is top notch and saftey is very important. Sometimes getting things approved can take time due to centralized corporate decision making,but day to day operations are smooth and everyone is great to work with."
good,Great company has a lot of benefits would definitely recommend working here. They have many locations in the United States with great safe environment for you to work in.
good,Getting use to shift work and operating of large equipment was interesting.But dusty.Learned a lot about working around large equipment and copper minning operations with a lot of nice people
good,The Upper Level Management was setup as an Marcomanaging style management. Which allowed me to have a relaxed work environment. This style of upper management would assign project then let you work without question until you present the finished project.
good,I worked for this company for years and would work for them again. I drove a haul truck and water truck and made great money. This is the perfect job for someone who wants to work and retire young.
good,"fast paced from start to finish,plenty of work,bonuses given almost 3 times a year management assisted with loading,unloading trucks and railcars at times"
good,Gathered samples for assays. Performed assays for copper and acid content. Made appropriate adjustments to keep copper and acid within parameters. Loved working with the people I worked with. Was more like family. Management was always changing. New interns coming in with new ideas. Some of which we already tried. The hardest part was switching from nights back to days. Most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. We all watched out for each other. we were like family.
good,Excellent company that provides great benefits and pay to employees. The benefit package is exceptional and the bonuses are great as well.
good,"buen equipo de trabajo y relacion con las personas, la presion es minima aunque a veces tensa por cuestiones de resultados de geologia."
good,"I love working for Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold.  This is a company that tries to take care of their employees.  They give a generous bonus every year to ALL employees.  When they have a layoff, management does their very best to help employees get placed somewhere within the company if a similar position is available."
good,This job entailed working 12 hr shifts 4 days on 4 days off within the reclaimation project of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold. The job duties included reclaiming of tailing site with the pushing and maintaining dumps cutting 3:1 slopes with the aide of a GPS Carlson system and the operation of various equipment was used to obtain our objective.
good,Great work environment with chance for advancement including international assignments. Challenging work and cutting edge technology grow confidence and knowledge.
good,"Very good company to work for. I have been there seven years, like my seven days off each month. Good benefits and decent starting pay. Put your time in and you can do anything."

good,"The Drive the co expects is,adventurous and a new task in every job assigned. The day will end with how much dirt was moved,everyone satisfied to say we worked together and able to perform what is known world wide one of the most"
good,Wish I was still there but full recovery from injuries took years. But the company stuck by me and bent over backwards to keep me on as an employee for as long as possible to allow me to have my company insurance help with my medical costs. Great company!!! Cant say enough good things about Freeport.
good,"Absolutely loved working for FMI. The environment was friendly and open, and the work was always interesting and cutting edge. Unfortunately once FMI merged with PPX our entire office was laid off."
good,FMI is a great company to work for.  For the most part they care about their employees.  Of course there are a few managers that feel the need to micro manage their people.  But all in all they are a very competitive and collaborative company.  I have enjoyed my 13 years with them.
good,"Freeport is a great place to work.They have a great culture and ready to help you achieve you aim as an intern. Their system is more flexible, do well to accommodated families and military duties."
good,"jaminan yang di berikan sangat memuaskan,, serta pasilitas kesehatan paling di utamakan"
good,Job was a high pace close community the atmosphere. the location is 12000 feet and weather thru winter is rough but the overall job has 10 pros to one con.
good,Freeport McMoran is the world's largest copper mine. Plenty of jobs/departments to choose from. Pay is reasonable. Chances to advance and transfer to other departments is very high.
good,"Good helpful atmosphere, employees help each other. thing are adressing issues.accordingly.safety is the ultimate goal to any task Vacations are Good at the start. encouragement from top officials. Bps is alway there. Good housekeeping practices encouraged"
good,There are almost endless opportunities with this company if you prove to be a hard worker. The benefits with the company are outstanding. If they had more work in my current location I would still be with them.
good,"Nice coworkers.  Casual, relaxed atmosphere. Hard working company culture.  Lots of perks.  Employee development is  supported by lots of approved training."
good,Very interesting and engaging work. I learned all about the mining industry and how everything happens. The people were very good at teaching what I needed to know. The hardest part of the job was shift work.
good,"Good place to work.  Long hours.  Great Benefits.  I just wished it would have lasted.  They are being very decent to us, even at the end."
good,Very professional work environment. Extremely focused on employee safety with production in mind. Amazing benefits. Poor job security (based on price of copper).
good,i wowuldve loved this job how ever when i finally got hired i was going threw child custudy and couldnt afford the travel back and forth from my home town and work and i had to miss a lot of days cause of it which lead to my termination

good,"All the above shows my aliegeance to a company I've strived my best work practices though never in a salarly position my good health has allowed me to work considerable hrs.not needing a a salarly position, will fill in any loose if need be."
good,"Every day at work begins with a brief discussion about safety. All work at the mine site is driven by safety and incident prevention. The Company is dedicated, from top to bottom, to making sure everyone returns home from work in one piece."
good,Busy days with a lot of equipment to up keep. Working on Electric rope shovels and blast drills. Safety is a top priority at Freeport which I like. Everyone works well together.
good,"The company had to do wide spread layoffs due to oil prices, but prior to the layoffs, was truly a great place to work.  They did a good job of balancing work and family life."
good,"Wonderful culture. The people are a joy to work with. Varied systems to work on, and upgrades are always being added so you can always see something new and modern. Line managers are reasonable and easy to get along with. Upper management doesn't know you exist off of a spreadsheet. Benefits are the best I have ever come across."
good,Had the great experience working with an amazing group of co workers which are like family high in the mountains of Papua Indonesia. Many challenges were overcome by hard work and great team work.
good,Great place to work great pay however hr lacks the ability to treat everyone the same and some get by with things because of your name while others get fired for the same little thing
good,great place to work and learn there is always a challenge around the corner hours and money are good work with people from all different experiences  willing to teach
good,"Most enjoyable job I've had. I didn't have many dealings with management above my department, but at the location level I have no complaints. I also understand no company can completly control market conditions, but decisions made at corporate level caused a major lay-off for our entire mine (and others). I was one of the many who was  part of the layoff, so yeah, I can't say I'm too happy with those at corporate. Besides being laid off though, great company who seem to really try to take care of their employees"
good,Knowledge of your job is very important this company.  Training is usually available rather if you want it or not.  They truly believe that knowledge is power.  Their safety culture is second to none and believe there  is always a safe way to get the job done.
good,Not micro managed but everyone expected to be accountable for their work and performance.  Excellent pay with yearly raises and quarterly bonuses.
good,Great company to work for. They try to anticipate drops in the market and accommodate employees for such times. But at times the market is just to much and they have to do what they need to do to survive.
good,Having the independence and confidence to operate the type of machinery at this job was immensely satisfying.  Working with a great crew in an ever-changing environment taught me a lot.
good,"Had over 26 years with the company"
good,I was able to gather knowledge relevant to my field of study and establish work experience towards future career opportunities.
good,After graduating I took the internship with Freeport to start my career in Mining Engineering.  While working there I was given a project to complete that was an analysis of how they measured there reserves.  I had many questions and was always assisted by the full-time engineers who made sure that I understood the important points.  I really enjoyed that there was something new everyday and that the other engineers were so helpful.
good,I enjoyed my job I learned something new everyday and taught something new every day.  the mining industry is an everyday changing business one day copper is at its peak and the next its fallen to an all time low
good,"Schedule was 4 ten hour days, relaxed dress code.  Opportunity for advancement through cross training.  Co-workers made a great team and worked well together.   "

good,"Aggressively managed company. Excellent benefits, strong performance expectations."
good,It's a great place to work.  Most of the time if want overtime it is there for the taking.  The benefits are top notch.  You get all kinds of managers. I believe extra training for management would help. I wish that I started 10 years sooner
good,It is a very organized operation. Relaxed environment with set goals and objectives. Training could be better in regards to new hires being brought up to speed. But all in all the employees jere are very helpful and friendly very nice being home every night. The rotation is odd but gives you plenty of time off
good,This company is big on safety and there are opportunities for advancement. It has a diverse culture. Everyone is always willing to help. Freeport is definitely a great company to work for.
good,Freeport-McMoRan is a great place to work and give its employees a lot of opportunities to advance their careers. They also provide excellent benefits to the workforce. I am proud to work for a company like this.
good,Requires hard work but plenty of room to move up and advance. Great benefits provided. There are a lot of good people that help you grow in your job. The company stresses safety above everything else.
good,"It's a Mining company,  learned a lot of safety practices, including consequence thinking. "
good,24 hour production in an aging facility requires continuous maintenance and upgrades. There is always room for improvement and equipment or processes that can be improved on. Projects are endless. Learning is endless. Safety is the number one priority. Sites are remote but compensation and opportunities are abundantly provided to help attract and retain talented individuals.
good,Worked alongside engineers daily and learned a lot. I was impressed by management and was treated fairly. At the end of the summer all interns are sent to a company wide conference and I was given the opportunity to present about my work.
good,"They go above and beyond to take care employees and family. "
good,"There is nowhere out there that beats the cost of living and the hourly wages, nice quiet town. The company puts a lot of time and effort to have family events in town and make upgrades to the town, they invest in their employees and community."
good,"For many years, Freeport-McMoRan has been a strong leader in the mining industry as well as oil and gas.  Management understands its most valuable asset is the employees. This certainly encouraged loyalty by all of its employees."
good,"Safety/Security of the people is the most priority. Ensure the first hand Safety/Security information are properly distributed to employees. "
good,"A typical day would start 30 to 45 minutes early before business hours, to prepare and ensure the daily vendors and guests were greeted and received with a warm friendly pleasant atmosphere to start their business day with Positive energy.  The management team supports the same positive energy which makes my job and the workplace Team oriented."
good,Great team leaders. Company offers great benefits. Company housing is very convenient due to it being in a rural area. Kept busy all day which makes the days go by fast. Working 3 days a week on average but making money that someone would make in a 50+ hour work week.
good,I came in at 6am and everyday was different. I loved the environment and the people I got to meet. I have learned a lot safety. There was nothing hard unless you made it that way.
good,"The pay for a haul truck driver 1, which is 6 months minimum is over $20.00 an hour. You can't beat that anywhere around Grant County. The 12 hours take time to get used too but the days off that come with it and the benefits make up for it. Good supervisor at Chino Mines... I'm very happy and will continue to work for Freeport McMoran..."
good,"In charge of running your own area, your crew quickly becomes your family from spending so much time with them. Like any work place there are good and bad days. You will learn a lot and you may get dirty, its part of the job. Always be ready to have a 16 hour shift even if your regular shift is only 12 (scheduled days, 8 hours on overtime days)."
good,It's a very good place to work a friendly environment big trucks every where and just a pretty good place to live with your family. I would definitely recommend this job for you especially in morenci arizona
good,Had great benefits and good working experience. They keep you busy and working all the time. Great people to work with and alright management. I would recommend anyone to get a job here.
good,Supervisors and co-workers work together as a team. It was difficult to leave but needed better job security due to lay-offs. I would return if I had the chance.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, siempre aprende algo nuevo, trabajo en equipo y mucha seguridad"
good,Freeport provided the opportunity to learn and develop various skills within the trade. The most important thing that I learned was the true importance of safety. I was given that chance to move around departments and roles to develop skill set.
