rating,review
bad,"When I reported misconduct the manager I reported it to made fun of me with the other workers and used all kinds of tactics to try to run me out.  Personally I was attacked professionally by managers who tried to put me in roles that were way beneath level of education, experience, and skill set."
bad,Working here didn't enable me to learn anything new at the workplace. I felt that I wasn't developing my skills towards a future job or goal. The management was disorganized and out of the loop towards work objectives. A toxic work culture is present that deters individuals from wanting to work there.
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. Pharma packaging 1st shift is a dumpster fire. Team lead has no control over his own team. Very high turn over rate. Every poor decision of his that is more hurtful to the team or individual employee, he explains away with “business needs” and offers no other reasonable explanation.  Safety, morale and recognition take a backseat to drama, gossip and harassment. This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Job requirements, expectations, responsibilities are too high for the rate of pay. Mandatory overtime and 12 hour shifts lead to poor work/life balance.  The “training” is terrible. They pair you with the oldest crankiest person who clearly does not even WANT to be training anyone, let alone BE there, and then wonder why there is tension and friction. HR is just as bad. Every time you ask her a question she tells you to call a 1800 number. Lots of very illegal and immoral things happening here. She says she will “take care of it” but nothing gets done. I’m not even exactly sure what she does all day? Obviously not her job. Last but not least, cheating on your spouse with a co worker here is the company norm. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place"
bad,"Unless you like being a brown noser, you will get no where in this company.  Management does not like to do their own job, so they make the suck ups do it"
bad,"I started out as a temporary employee. Was granted permanent status within several months, upon proving myself as a worthy employee. Senior employees bullied me, was referred to as, hey you. I would tell them my name, but to no avail. I was picked on and sabotaged by coworkers. Misogyny and xenophobia were prevalent."
bad,work work work that is all you did at Zoetis.  They were always looking to cut jobs and save money when Zoetis in a hole makes 4 billon a year.  Would not recommend working there
bad,Poorly managed team where training and advancement require a person to suck up to the supervisor. Highly stressful and lots of favoritism shown. Back stabbing environment.
bad,Horrible management in Lewisberry Pa. No training for new contract workers. Work from 6a.m. until 8p.m. due to lack of workers and no management of the floor and people.
bad,"No chances at all to career advance.  The salary is very low in comparison with other industries as Zoetis. We work in ""Survival Mode"" all de time. The management doesn't care at all about the employees. Terrible place to work."
bad,My work day started at 5am to 1:30pm. I had to set up filing room equipment. i do environmental motoring. I filled out paper work. Get equipment ready for filling the product and do more paper work. Hooked up sterile tanks for filling products and more paper work. Start filing vile and check fill in bottles and then more paper work. Begin filling process and start the procedure for the day.
bad,"Zoetis, Inc (former Pfizer, Inc., Animal Health), Brussels, Belgium, 2013-Present"
bad,"I had a couple more months left on my contract, and out of the blue, they cut it short. You can't trust these people. "
bad,This could have been a good company but inept management --all imports from Pfizer---has led it to become a seemingly inevitable takeover target.  The culture has been decimated after the recent 20% cut in the workforce.  Not a good place to work!
bad,"Boss who poorly communicates, if at all. No room for advancement.  Department head knows nothing about me or my function. Marketing can be petty and vindictive,"
bad,"Processing and packaging pharmaceuticals for livestock and Veterinarians with outdated equipment. Safety is not a concern from my experience, rarely saw management (beginning of the day and maybe the end of the day) 12 hour shifts 6am to 6pm. Co workers had no sense of safety in the area we were assigned to. The hardest part at times was performing maintenance on the regularly failing mill operations Leaving for the day was the most enjoyable part of the day."
bad,"Leadership is poor at best. They ask for improvement ideas and express the opportunity for advancements. When you communicate ideas for improvement within your area, management will answer your idea with a generic “we will look at it” response with zero results. Advancements are available, but due to being short staffed with high turnover rates, the ability to train for the next step in your career progression isn’t available."
bad,Management had no communication skills employees not good at giving diection or training  train urself     Easy work when there was work  full time employees dont like to work together to get the job done  no team work too many chiefs  very unorganized
bad,The company pays well and is growing every month but they work their employees to the bone.  Not much room for advancement.  Most employees are locals to the area.
bad,"As a contingent worker, you will hate this place. They offer nothing of benefit. They will dangle a golden carrot in front of you and yank it away as soon as you think progress in your career is being made. Chances of getting hired in as a temp are slim to none. Good luck."
bad,Never get a pay raise. Never got anywhere while working here. Wouldn't recommend for a long term job. Only good for something till ya find a better job
bad,A lot of highly educated and passionate people.  My colleagues are good people and are very collaborative.  A lot of office politics.
bad,Have one senior leader who is a bully/tyrant.  Get rid of that person and this would be my dream job and company.  Unfortunately this individual was able to reorg me out of the company.
bad,"Management is very unorganized. No corrective criticism, the suporvisors act like children. Very caotic work environment with double standards for different employees."
bad,"Although this was my first time working a third shift, I didn't think it was too bad until I came to see that there were some slackers and trouble makers that no one seemed to want to do anything about."
bad,"Ich wurde 2011 nach Übernahme des mittelständischen Unternehmens Synbiotics in den Großkonzern zunächst eingegliedert."
bad,"Been here just over a year. Was told some weekend work. That has turned into every weekend for last 4 months. They won’t let you move to a different shift even if there is openings. They care more about saving money. And care more about their customers rather than employees that help them supply the customers. Only thing this company has going for it is Vacation time (if they let you use it), and benefits are ok"
bad,"The management is clueless. In production, your usual day will consist of doing the work of three people unsupervised and unassisted. The work is repetitive, mind numbing, and very difficult on your body. The managers are not interested in providing us with equipment that may ease the labor, and the mantra ""safety first"" is for liability purposes only. Colleagues on the work force are generally hard working if not the brightest, but the management is the worst I have ever seen. Cannot recommend to anyone except those that absolutely cannot find another opportunity."
bad,"I was a aspetic Technician I the people were nice, but they talked and went behind each other’s back. Seemed like the management cared for the most part. Paperwork that you have to do is way overboard! You were told screw up and they terminate you! Procedures were not kept! They say the rooms for procedures are suppose to be air tight and no one in and out because of air and no cross contamination. Well I had lots of people come and crack doors open to talk to the people in the procedure rooms. Cross contamination happened on a daily bases!!!"
bad,Opportunity to grow if you are willing to work hard and put in a lot of extra hours.  Pay is good for industry standard. Very sales driven and focused on numbers.  There have been a several reorganizations and some job reductions which have impacted morale.
bad,Cost cutting efforts are underway.  Major layoffs and those remaining having to do more with less.  Management decisions are very short-sided managing to wall-street.
bad,Organized chaos.  Not well run by management and company cannot deliver certain goods in a timely manner that meets the clients needs.
bad,"Zoetis pays poorly, no career development.  The workplace is inefficient and disorganized."
bad,"Zoetis provides adequate work/life balance, decent pay and great benefits; however, the (CCY) leaders do not develop their employees, prefer to hire their friends into the company rather than promote current employees, argue with each other rather than work together to accomplish the goals to make the site successful. Some production employees are overworked and some are just plain worn out. The culture of employees appears to be - in one word - frustrated. The company boasts of no retaliation and equality and many site leaders do not adhere to company policy.  "
bad,learned how to set up and run all machines. Always learning something new.  great co-workers all one team. Shift leads were fair.
bad,I have found overall this is a good place to work. It is a fast paced environment with many opportunities to learn on the job skills.
good,"Zoetis was created as a stand alone company, after Pfizer separated its Human and Animal Health branches. While Pfizer is still a good work environment, specific management priorities have made Zoetis an absolute nightmare for its colleagues."
good,"Low morale, and very toxic place to work. You can do 20 great things in a day but you will only hear about your mistakes. You are literally only as good as your last mistake. Career advancement is none exsistant, management has no time to do any team building or give any incentives to get better performances.  Miserable working environment. The benefits are the only mediocre positive but those are slowly getting worse with each passing year.  I would NOT recommend working for Zoetis Lincoln site."
good,"This job is extremely stressful due to being responsible for multiple sites in multiple states and being on call for all sites. Each site runs at different times, so you never know when you will be called out to fix a problem on top of having a set weekly schedule. The pay is average."
good,"A Empresa tem uma ótima qualidade para se trabalhar, porém o departamento financeiro deixa muito a desejar quando o assunto se trata de qualidade de vida de seus colaboradores, o departamento é desorganizado e isso acarreta mais problemas a serem resolvidos."
good,"great place for animal lovers"
good,"I had to clean the Labs and Office's and bathrooms and locker rooms that includes Sweeping, Mopping, Dusting, Auto Scrubbing.. And Changing out the paper products."
good,Overall good company to work for but avoid working in the Logistics operations. The company grows but the operation does not adjust with the growth of the business.
good,"Zoetis is a pretty good first job. It's easy to get in the door right out of college, the pay is average, and the benefits are very nice. But the work itself gets mindnumbing, and most managers have no training or experience.... so development is limited and a lot of time is spent just cleaning up other's mistakes. But they do (or did) offer 3 weeks of vacation from day one, plus kidcare days, and offer some of the best tuition reimbursement in the city. It's not a waste of time, if you're looking to better yourself. But if you don't use your benefits, or are looking for more than factory work, you'll probably be better off elsewhere."
good,"Zoetis has the industry leading product line in animal health."
good,"I can get a $18/hr job anywhere, I just like it here. People are cool, and unlike previous employers they know what they are doing. I wish more opportunities were available as my skill set is being wasted but as of right now I like the place."
good,"It wasn't bad. Somethings caught my attentions which would make me stay, but their were small thing that made me want to leave. As well as, lack of good pay amongst other things. It provided me great opportunity to grow my self mentally and physically. It allowed me to gain knowledge of greater sciences, and greater world colleagues."
good,Very culture driven environment and unique business segment.
good,"Pro's : good benefits, reasonable salary."
good,Empresa sem política de desenvolvimento de colaboradores.
good,"There was very little regard for contracted and or temp workers. In many cases after a short time you may experience a sense of being overwhelmed by those who abuse authority, or either granting authority to non authoritative personnel."
good,"They continually expected us to do more with less.  We generally had less people to do the job than we needed and forced us to rush to get the job done.  Then when mistakes happen (as a they invariably do when you are rushing), the managers held us responsible for the mistakes."
good,Lab work in a production type environment.  Aseptic technique is a must and is heavily stressed.  Set schedule with occasional weekend work.  Great co workers and great benefits.
good,"entreprise faite d'individualités, avec très peu d'esprit d'équipe"
good,"Zoetis is a decent company to work for if your are hired full time instead of a contractor. Contractors are not viewed in a positive light, there is an indifference towards contractors and colleagues."
good,"- A typical day: get into office at 7 am. Have breakfast while I process the first urgent payments of the day. Review email. Troubleshoot. Prepare gain/loss reports."
good,I was not informed of some critical things during the interview. I am not happy that i have to review every company i have worked at in a 150 character summary.
good,"Uma empresa boa, líder no mercado que atua. Ponto de atenção: a empresa de dois anos para cá vem passando por muitas reestruturações."
good,The job expectations were never consistent and it seemed that people that did the least work and were most toxic to the work environment were the ones who were given opportunities to advance. We were all supposed to have the same expectations around attendance and quality but it was blatantly obvious that some colleagues were not held to the same standards as others. Leadership and Human Resources have all been made aware repeatedly and no changes are made.
good,"Zoetis has great paid benefits and vacation. The biggest issue within the company is the constant changes in employee expectations and company policies. Zoetis is a great company to start with, but an employee can quickly become stuck at their level due to the lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"The communication is truly the underlying issue of all problems with the employee/employer relationships at the company. It seems as though there is an unspoken rule of silence when it comes to sharing information from the top, down. It is a shame because the company is filled with fantastic people. I think if the upper management was more open with their staff, many of their retention issues would disappear."
good,"Work 12 hour shifts."
good,"Zoetis offers an average compensation and benefit similar to other companies around Research Triangle area."
good,"Just like with any large company, satisfaction with the job depends on the group you work with, what you put into it, and your ability to do the job. Zoetis offers a large variety of groups with a large array of skills needed."
good,"seeking more pay, so my family can live more comfortably. With the pay that I am making I am barely making it. The company that I am working for they are not hiring, so they are overwork us."
good,you never new what time to come in are what time you got off. The temp was treated better than the permanent people. Everything started changing for the worst.
good,"The workers were great, we all worked the best we could to maintain a stable environment and job."
good,"Budgeting is always way off. With the budget being off, the workload ends up being doubled with the same amount of technicians and the same hours. Advancement is hard. Management has a tendency to talk poorly about their colleagues behind their backs which causes a toxic work environment. Lazy colleagues seem to get the most praise while the hard working colleagues take longer to get advanced in the company. The whole environment in the production area is ""I don't care it's not my problem and I don't want to help out""."
good,"A challenging position that suits my qualification for work. Reliable, honest, dynamic and flixibles to aim the qualificstiom of company and managent."
good,Looking for a new opprotunity as lay offs are occurring again for the millionth time  it's an unstable place to be currently
good,this is a good place to work but there is little chance of advancing in the company.  As of right now they only hire temps. good clean facility.
good,Majority of the co-workers are very kind but there is a significant amount that love to ruin other's days. The people that are above you can do no wrong and you are always at fault.
good,"Good place to learn with supportive management, where there a lot of projects on going as the company went recently public so there are many opportunities to implement projects to lean processes and optimize resources"
good,Always something going on very face paced and time line oriented. A large company with a small town feel.
good,Driven organization for results and customer satisfaction
good,"A typical day is going over all the WO's in the system,"
good,Solid company to work for.  Limited advanement opportunities.
good,"Benefits are good. The work is good, you do the same thing everyday but yet its different because you make different medias for different departments everyday."
good,"It is important to know that I was contracted through Aerotek for Pfizer to work at the Zoetis location during a transitional period for the companies.  "
good,"allowed to work independently, excellent training and resources.  great atmosphere and co workers."
good,"Uma boa empresa para se Trabalhar, bem estruturada e com bons benefícios"
good,I would get assigned to a line. Do my work. Set up line and clean up lines.
good,"Overall Good company to work for  "
good,"The amount of business that goes through this company requires a great amount of man-hours. The company is staffed with a skeleton crew that requires 50-60 hours a week. "
good,This has been a good company to work for but they recently announced a major reorganization and job reduction. Morale and production is currently low but I believe once the dust settles this will go back to a positive environment and a company we will all be proud to work for.
good,"Salário bom, benefícios, e oportunidade de carreira."
good,"Good, working with the couple of guys I do with is good.. Got to know them. there ups and downs and how to do my my job and what works for best for us all.. Yay.. go team go!"
good,Overall positive.  And no serious negative. Stable work and for a company that has sold and changed hands several time in recent memory the culture remains strong and draws talent.
good,"- Nice atmosphere with a young and multi-cultural crowd."
good,"- Very nice workplace with a young and multi-cultural crowd."
good,"Empresa com vários segmentos, com excelentes incentivos para se aprofundar na nossa experiência profissional."
good,I would come in at 2 O'clock and do my job for the next 8 hours.  I'm not really sure why i need to write this review for the job i left 3 months ago but here you go.
good,"Zoetis is a growing company.  They provide great training.  They have a huge product portfolio.  The size of the product portfolio can be a pro and a con from a sales experience.  Overall, if you are interested in working in the animal health industry, it is a great place to work."
good,Everyone is very welcoming and nice. However the departments don't exactly get along very well. Great learning environment and management is extremely nice and helpful.
good,"Most Enjoyable part of the job -Products were Excellent. Enjoyed & feeling Proud in Having Scientific Products. Respects to the Product & people.  Learning- Scientific Products needs Scientific Knowledge & detailing to the Customers , if not the Result of Such things, could be vice-versa. the Hardest Part of the job was to Prevent infiltrations. co-workers-They are all good & Co operative."
good,"It is a great place to work for people who loves animal and study of animal in general."
good,Very well-balanced environment. Always something new going on that aims at benefiting the company. There are a ton of learning opportunities.
good,"During a typical day at work, I communicated with 15 or more people, I developed various forms of data and media and presented them to varying levels of colleagues. My main interactions were with an equal mixture of middle and upper management. All of my co-workers were quick to assist and to enlist my aid, and understood priority and timeliness. They were all nice and helpful whenever and wherever they could be. I would say the hardest part of the job was having to react to sometimes inconsistent and incorrect communication among the team members, regarding project requirements and requests. The most enjoyable part of the job was the everyday interactions I would have with my friendly, neighboring colleagues."
good,"Experiences and happiness I've learned are greatly influenced by your manager. I've observed a lot of great ones, and they are the ones that work with you and develop you and have strong values and care about who you are and work with you around personal needs.  Zoetis does a lot to help develop managers (at least they did in the past). Yet there are inconsistencies amongst managers, which makes for challenges.  There are also often changes in some management areas, which makes it difficult for continuity."
good,"I worked 3rd shift i liked my job and coworker we got along fine our work atmosphere was nice until it came too our morning pass down. shift change issues."
good,Overall they're decent. I enjoyed my work environment for the most part. Some of the people made the job irritating because they were very catty. Depends on what you do and don't like at a job.
good,"A typical day at work would be pulling boxes.  Sometimes they are heavy. You must always wear a coat, pants, long sleeves, because this location is ln a cave."
good,Uma empresa muito agradável de se trabalhar na qual contribuiu para minha experiência profissional.
good,"Après la séparation d'avec Pfizer et suite à la restructuration mondiale réduisant de 25% le nombre d'effectif, Zoetis est aujourd'hui chamboulée et bcp de travail (et de beaux projets) reste à accomplir."
good,This company has really helped me stay focused on my goals and I've had the opportunity to meet and work with some of the most talented individuals in the Pharmaceutical industry.
good,Fast paced but innovative products and dedicated employees. International presence means there are a lot of opportunities to learn and collaborate across the globe.
good,Advancing company in the midwest. Leading brand of human and animal health care. Able to use the latest technology in packaging. Fast pace and ongoing for future products.
good,My name is manoj kurdekar.  I am 18 years experience in know tyre as a sr commercial officer in mumbaI area . Handing 2 depot and one cnf agencies. Verify the invoice and credit note. Vendors reconciliation statement of account.  Taxation and get return filling and other statutory audit verification.
good,"Good company to start as a stepping stone to further your career. very little promotion from within, very focused on college education vs real world experiences."
good,"Typical day is rushed and full of meetings. This is due to my desire for professional development, but definitely feel that there could be opportunities for more balance. "
good,Overall positive.  I would describe the experience as good for me and my daughter..  many good people to work with and grow with.  I can only say goodbye things.
good,"A Great company too work for, very good Management"
good,"Zoetis is a very solid company to work for. With the right mindset and work ethic, it is possibly to move up from within. However, lack of discipline often times created a difficult work culture. Many experienced employees can essentially do what they please sometimes with little to no repercussion."
good,"Relatively dysfunctional, running a multi-million dollar operation we should not have to stop processes for a ten dollar piece of equipment that we should have plenty of in stock. Adding to this multi-million dollar organization, I feel that we should not be in need of constant reformation and sense of urgency that has cost hundreds of thousands just in this past year. Co-workers are great but management has its hand in every aspect of the processes and yet its grip sways unpredictably from a strict adherence in FDA regulated policies to virtually none at all. I do not feel that we should be able to pick and choose which policies we follow more or less based off of a personal preference."
good,"Excellent company with good culture and benefits. Excellent work-life balance.  Advancement is difficult, and things are constantly changing as Zoetis stands itself up from Pfizer"
good,"Os benefícios são atrativos, tem vários cursos na área, são rigorosos com procedimentos"
good,Learned a lot about working in a large multi-national organisation. Most enjoyable part was working and training multiple colleagues from different backgrounds across the world.
good,"The colleagues are very nice to work with. Work life balance is good, but some timelines are unrealistic. You generally have all the tools you need to perform your work."
good,"Carteira de cobrança  em media 3000 clientes , por isso um dia bem agitado de trabalho."
good,"lots of technical products, great pipeline, lots of marketing support, great people, loved the collaborations, enjoyed my time there.  Well respected in industry"
good,"Nouvelle structure à mettre en place de A à Z, énorme challenge.  Malheureusement au bout du challenge une restructuration a été entamée, ce qui me permet de partir à la recherche de nouveaux défis"
good,"I was to maintain a fully operational unit, reaching all my production rates. Keep hourly checks on my product and machines while maintaining a clean unit."
good,"collaborateurs sympas , travaille varier ! être polyvalente , gérer sont travaille seule , sur la journée faire plusieurs production différente et gère le changement de planning !!! et le plus difficile y en a pas !"
good,"Tracked multi-million dollar projects annually. Extensive training on safety, SOP's"
good,The management style is a little bit not adapted to the local culture.
good,"Minhas atividades desenvolvidas são muito dinâmicas, envolve toda a fábrica e todos os colegas sempre são super prestativos. A Gerência é bem exigente mas super competentes."
good,"It gave me the opportunity to learn and develop my skills with enough time understand the product and without unreasonable deadlines. It has flexible work options, work life balance and a fun team who enjoyed working hard."
good,"Most people don't leave companies because they are bad companies. Most people leave because of poor management. This company seems to pick some of their management team because they are friends of theirs, not because they have the skills and personality it takes to be a great manger! Other than that, Zoetis is great overall."
good,"Colleagues are great people to work with.  Great benefits."
good,Quantum is a small but promising project management company. There is a good management-employee rapport which gives a sense of belonging to the workers
good,"My responsibilities were contacts with clients, consultation, visiting farmers, work with database.  I learned a lot from my co-workers, team working. I achieved good performance, time management and learned how to establish good and friendly relationships with clients."
good,"I worked before it became Zoetis.  There were issues aplenty, but so long as you got your job done, everything was fine.  Not sure if it is the same now."
good,"I work as a scientist and chemist and in the lab, I learned the ELISA and follow the SOP. Also, I get more experience in lab work and work as a team. the job is easy for me."
good,The work to home life was very well balanced. The time off was amazing! To receive 3 weeks paid vacation is pretty much unheard of. The work place was for the most part very professional and respectful
good,"Spend many years working in the company because of the workplace culture was very implemented,a family oriented culture in the workplace and we were working as team and value safety among workers and we earn good money in the company depending on our experiences, we level up in earnings according to our work experiences."
good,"I work in a department that is constantly changing, and it is difficult to organize the chaos, though I try."
good,Good company with the potential for a long future. Depending on your background there is the potential for opportunities. The company is really focusing on colleague development right now.
good,Large pharmaceutical company pioneering animal health products and technology. good working culture with plenty of career opportunities available with competitive compensation.
good,Had a wide range of opportunities to take.Offers a family - friendly benefits.Has an open-door policy that gives employees equal treatment .Nice environment.

good,"one of the best animal health company to work. good work place, good culture. better compensation. decent work load and job security."
good,"Good work, enjoy working & more than 8 hours of work. Co workers very co-operative. brushed the odd skills & enjoy the working"
good,"Every day poses a new challenges at the corporate headquarters office where we are managing expectations from all areas of the business--customers, leadership, field force, and other functions and stakeholders. Work/life balance becomes a challenge at times due to the sheer volume of work and since the company has just acquired its IPO last year. The people really make this company and differentiate it from other workplaces."
good,"É uma ótima empresa a se trabalhar, porém no meu caso não vejo perspectivas de crescimento ou efetivação pelo menos não na área em que atuo. Tenho um ótimo coordenador sempre disposto a esclarecer dúvidas."
good,"Good people, great benefits, great place to work. You are treated fairly and are recognized when you do a great job. Opportunity for advancement is there if you are dedicated and work for it."
good,"A typical day at work was never typical. Everything starts the same working with my staff and research but then there are always things we discover, challenges and opportunity to learn and grow from our observations. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Zoetis. Great people and a small group so it had a good family feel. Management at the site genuinely cared about the employee but Management at the corporate level did not .Over all a great place to work with  exceptional benefits, The hardest part of the job for me was working in the cooler."
good,"Apesar do grande volume de trabalho era bem tranquilo, os colegas de trabalho eram bem profissionais e nunca tive problema com nenhum. "
good,"Zoetis is a very family friendly workplace.  As long as you get your work done, management is very flexible with colleagues' schedule and supportive of colleagues having a good life outside of the office."
good,"It was my first industry experiece. I got to see and know how this happens in pharmaceutical company. I was assisting scientists in R&D department with vaccince prodution. I leaned GMP , GLP practices and FDA regulations. I learned about upstream and downstream processes during vaccine prodution."
good,Fairly young leadership through out.  Appreciative of colleagues contribution to the overall vision of the organization.
good,"Great opportunities, technical and non technical. Great colleagues, and Good work culture."
good,"I had a great manager and very nice team of the department."
good,"Trabajo en equipo, altos estandares de integridad y una fuerte cultura corporativa"
good,Good place to work very good management and nice cool conditions. Fun place to be home away from home good pay and chances for overtime slow to advance up in company but good place to be
good,"Empresa com ótimo clima e com os desafios de uma multinacional, mas com profissionais qualificados."
good,"A typical day at work would be some employees would just be standing around in the morning hours then after lunch they would work hard, I learned that there are people who don't care about their job."
good,"Salary and compensation it was fair but flexible work hours , project was very interesting and challenging that demanded lot from the employees and through we learned a lot, at the end imagined lot of experience.."
good,"I am a contractor. This would be a great place to work if offered a permanent full-time position at Zoetis. A typical day at work is secure. I have learned SAP since employed at Zoetis and I am able to navigate through the system to perform my job duties and still learn more. The hardest part of the job is change of job assignments that upset the customer. It is not hard to adjust as an employee, but it makes the customers  very dissatisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning and knowing what I am doing and why I am doing it. It is good to understand your job duties and how to make good use of your tools and resources to perform your job at the highest standard for quality and management.."
good,I am contacted by Zoetis to provide lectures on a variety of topics at local veterinary hospitals as an added value service for being a Zoetis client.  Mngt is always very grateful to have the opportunity to provide free CE to their staff
good,"Ótima empresa, gestores competentes, respeito ao empregado."
good,A typical work day was based on workload and priority. I learned SAP while working at Zoetis. The Management at Zoetis is poor. The workplace culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is seeing people not do their job and try to push their work on other people and try to get credit for a job someone else did. The most enjoyable part about the job was doing what I did and loving what I did.
good,"Gran abient de treball i una bona feina, molt recomanable per tot aquella persona que vulgui introduir-se en el món de l'empresa farmacèutica."
good,c est une société  ou il est très agréable a travailler
good,It was a nice place to be. There were always a lot of stuff to learn. The trainings were really good.
good,"Each day at work consists in trying to resolve technical problems in SAP and provide support to the 2 teams I lead. I get to work with the IT team and am constantly learning to troubleshoot system. Management is very supportive and co-workers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the work is the close since I need to give support to team that submits financial statement to HFM, close Fixed Asset Module and continue to provide support to organization related to the system. The best thing about the job is working in conjunction with IT team to find solutions to technical problems in system especially when I come up with the solution. Zoetis is a very good company to work for as it offers an environment for personal growth and good work/life balance. My overall rating is that Zoetis is a great to work at."
