rating,review
bad,"great job to work and great health care , but the management is terrible and will talk about you behind you're back , they have all there little pet people that they give reach arounds to . they give raises but the raises are based on if a customer calls back for anything , and I mean anything! you're percentage will be cut at the quarter raise time. then when you get a raise it will be 20 cents . no body will say anything because their all afraid to deal with management ."
bad,"you had to bid for your hours to get a shift.  If you did poorly you got a poor shift.  If you did great you got a great shift,  which i think is unfair"
bad,It's a corporate job which is simply not for me. The works i was given as a intern was very mundane and taught me nothing as far as the job was concerned.
bad,"we were over booked all the time, causing extra work for everyone. When extra work built up everyone had to stay over and work to clear backlog it was draining."
bad,"Hprrible company, boss, location, people, salary, products, bathrooms, lunch rooms, heirlooms, brooms, cars, trucks, and planes, lunch was cold, people were old"
bad,"A lack of consideration for clients."
bad,They changed the whole structure of the business model. Demoted people was able to keep pay but will no longer receive raises at the end of each year.
bad,This company is horrible to work for. They were better as time Warner and all the management people are unqualified. The pay was good and now we are being moved to bi weekly and commission has been reduced.
bad,this was the worst job to every work at maybe different now I would work for this place at all maybe be better now is has a different name I wouldn't work here
bad,"PM on several Compliance, security and Regulatory  and Internal Audit projects."
bad,"Nothing one of their ""employees"" on the low end of the totem pole could say to change their mind or make a difference. They are a greedy, money hungry, savage, unethical group of people and I would never consider working there again."
bad,"Have to complete a up on in 1 hour yet responsible for all the equipment and certifying house. Rarely got lunch or 15 minute break..Hardest part of the job was being blamed for repeat trouble call,that is not your faught. Example customer has internet only you fix problem and after you close job someone calls customer sales them tv package and tells them tech will be there tomorrow to install of you come and pick up equipment today. They then put in a repeat trouble call to rush job. Now previous tech gets a repeat counted against them. This hurts tech ranking and pay increase and possible and production write up."
bad,"This is the most unorganized company I have ever worked for. Policies & procedures change almost daily with no standardized roll out method. mandatory ot from one day to the next, change pay structure without notice, micromanaging at its worst!"
bad,"Very paper driven, outdated systems, poorly trained management. Be ready to teach your bosses excel basics and how to navigate through the databases - this will be 90% of  your job."
bad,"The management of the company is very poor, and they choose favorites and let it show. Not a good place to work. The managers there did not properly coach you on things and then write you up for things you were not coached on."
bad,My supervisor was the only reason I didn’t leave sooner than I did. Made some good friends but customers literally hate your guts. Explaining situations that you can’t control to people puts you in situations you shouldn’t be in. Field techs are literally just a number and are disposable.
bad,Great money but that’s about it. Super competitive and unable to advance unless you want to drink the kool-aid. I can also say there was no work/life balance.
bad,"Good salary, benefits."
bad,"Hands are tied while trying to assist and retain customers.  Service was constantly going out for customers as well as equipment failing.  Service refunds were at best POOR. Customer frustrations are felt by the employees, but the employees are powerless to do anything of value for the customers."
bad,Time Warner Media Sales gave me my first exposure to Peoplesoft.
bad,"Slashed salaries, slashed benefits, slashed giving a darn about the people who worked the hardest. Very PC, will hire to check boxes over experience and qualificatione"
bad,TWC/CHATTER never bring the sevice attitude back to company culture. Everybody is crazy on making sales instead of offering customer waht they really need.
bad,"Worse job I ever had. Constant turnover.  They cant RETAIN employees in Retention. Training really sucks. You can tell they prefer younger people."
bad,"get equipment do repair or install with sub par equipment . had short time to do them in after multiple repeats usually , learned that management cared very little about techs , and more about the numbers .culture was very stressful"
bad,"I worked at The CMI Group full-time (More than a year)"
bad,"Wasn't enough money and any good benefits for my family. Never talk about the problem we had truck driving, always made us go straight through with out a stop only for gas"
bad,"Local management doesn't have a clue on how to keep good people. Sometimes you spend so much time looking at numbers, you miss opportunities to cultivate good people. This was what I found to be true. Was much better company when they were Time Warner Cable."
bad,"This is a very competitive, money driven culture. The training is poor and the customer service is terrible. Management did not really care for you as a representative. If you are being spoken to in an abusive manner by a customer, you have to stay on the line and take it. This culture eventually causes the representatives to be abusive toward the customer."
bad,"This was an internship opportunity through the program Year Up. While the program was helpful in assisting me with computer knowledge and corporate business readiness, I did not enjoy the environment as it made me feel claustrophobic and trapped. The IT department that I worked with were great people and very laid back despite the stuck up surroundings. The rest of the company was full of very pretentious people and sour attitudes that made the job extremely unappealing. I was also given very little variety in my work and was given very little guidance in anything else."
bad,I was not happy with the work environment. The training was rigorous and unfair. The hours were lengthy and the shifts were unmanageable and did not promote family lifestyles.
bad,"Time Warner Cable was a wonderful company to work for.  Once Spectrum took over, everything changed.  Insurance cost too much and high copays made it impossible to use.  The company as a whole seems to care nothing for employees or customers"
bad,High stressful.  I worked in tech support and they wanted you to sell on top of everything. They had a scorecard on your performance. Some management didn't care.
bad,The only thing good about this company are the benefits. Management is so busy playing boss and riding the reps that you feel insignificant. No one has your back. Constantly making changes and your lucky if you find out two weeks later.
bad,It was fast paced overal calm setting. The team leads didn't to much to help unless you were in danger of not going by your scripts and your call level grade was low.
bad,"Senior management sought to add value to the lives of their subordinates, however middle management was less incline to follow suit."
good,"Time Warner Cable was a great company to work for, I especially loved the benefits they were awesome. I did not like working for charter communications ""Spectrum"" they expect too much and took away most of the perks and incentives. There are some very good supervisors and others that are horrible. A typical day is you taking calls back to back and assisting customers to the best of your ability  As long as you do that you will be ok. I can't say they are supportive at all if you become ill. You must absolutely meet your mark otherwise you are on a written, Other than that people are good and the place is a mostly good atmosphere."
good,"good work, no benefits , people are nice, management is ok, no room for advancement. overtime is good. must have own tools to work. no training, work all weekends"
good,it was stressful to try to meet all appointments  on time to do install and since I was getting paid commission not hourly it was worse can remember ever getting out on time from doing installs
good,I don't have anything to say about this company. The job I performed was advanced tech support. There was nothing super special about it and was treated as such.
good,Time Warner was a good company to eork for up until April of 2013 when they began the process of breakinh the union that had been eith them for over 30 years. This was done in an effort to sell the company.
good,"Meeting and missed meetings, too many meetings to manage most days.  This was the story of the day, You telling seasoned managers deadlines and they do not care or listen."
good,"The original job description for my job was looking for IT professionals.  Now it is run by non technical agents.  Metrics make no sense and the walls are very high and thick.  Benefits are great, hard to beat."
good,"It was a good place to work until it was merged by Spectrum who did not need our department of community affairs any longer. So, therefore, we were summarily let go."
good,Not a fun place to work.Your job was always under review daily.Basically job was about numbers.Management were always under scrutiny so in return so were the techs.The hardest part of the job was pleasing subscribers in the home.The most enjoyable times were leaving a subscribers home.
good,Time Warner was big into Micromanaging and tying your commission up in unrealistic goals. Very frustrating having worked for the prior company and had been very financially successful
good,"This is a very interesting company to work for to say the least. They do have awesome benefits but the scheduling I think causes an high turnover rate as well as the location and convenience of travel for those utilizing public transportation. management is very friendly but professional, Coworkers very helpful in assisting new hires."
good,Charter Communications is concerned only with profit and saturating the market in Upstate NY. Time Warner Legacy was a much more people orientated company.The marketing strategies are strong and well thought out.
good,"This was my first experience in doing a live broadcast. The roles included graphics, shooting a camera, setting up marketing material, setting up and tearing down production."
good,not much opportunity to advance at time warner cable they need better training and a firm management group need to be selected. as far as the monet and benefits go the packages are great.
good,It wasn't much to say about it. It was a job that you came in and did. I worked outbound sales so you knew the goal and you either achieved it or you didn't. I did feel they were unnecessary rules like dress codes. It was not a cust facing job. Felt company worried about the wrong things. They did have alot of incentives. It was ok for what it was.
good,"I worked as a technician in New York, NY for 4 years.  In the beginning of my career I could say that it was a great company to work for with great upward mobility in the future, and great benefits.  I worked in a union position.  The reason for the great pay and benefits was because of a union contract between the workers and the company.  I honestly believe that if this contract was not in place those benefits would cease to exist.  About halfway through my career with the company, the company started to fire all of the management that we worked with for what appeared to be no reason.  Next, they hired new management that was put in place for what seemed to be one reason.  To get rid of the union.  From this point on working for the company was miserable.  The management would try to write you up or get you suspended or fired for any little thing they could.  It got so bad that I would be in a miserable mood the moment I would punch in for work.  That is when I knew it was time to leave the company.  This was one of the best decisions in my life.  I have never looked back and I regret no part of this decision at all.  If you are reading this, please think long and hard before you work for a company like this."
good,"With the new management team, everything is rocky and very tedious. What used to be a Come to work and d-o your job is now filled with micro managers and metrics that has to be exceeded or else. They cut the pension and changed the health care plan to a lower more expensive one. However its not all horrible yet, there are still some good managers that you can rely on and they done breathe down your neck very 10 seconds for and update."
good,"a typical day of work was very stressful, I learned nothing, management was only focused on selling not how employees felt, culture was very diverse, the hardest part of the job was getting support from management"
good,"As with many companies, favoritism was rampant.  Company had brought in efficiency consultants and had no clue as to true customer service.  CEO was clueless on running a communication business."
good,Working at time Warner cable was a very good experience for me . I meet new people and learn every aspect of how the cable system works. I was able to move from a installer technician to now a lead fiber technician. Working at TWC for all these years I was able to make a better futur for me and my family
good,"With most of the company going through a transition from TWC to Charter, it has been one of change for employees and customers. "
good,"company does not care about you, they carter to baby sitting the techs and do not care about your opinion. they will let you go if you offend someone."
good,I enjoyed working for the biggest media company in the world it was enjoyable to be with my coworkers as we were able to work well with each other and work was fulfilling.
good,Not much to explain for this company. Regular 9-5. They had good benefits. The sales department was dissolved from the Colorado springs location. So it no longer exists.
good,a great place to work if you are good at sales. employees get free services and that is probably the best part. the job itself can be stressful at times. If you happen to get a good manager they will be there for you.sometimes the goals are unrealistic with the tools provided.
good,"this was typically a high paced in bound call center.  most people were calling with a complaint.  typically there was a problem with their service, a complaint about their bill or they every once in a while they were looking to move or add services.  Our job was to handle the initial concern.  If that was a service issue we attempted to fix it from our chair.  We toggled through our various systems sending out signals to reset the equipment.  If this didn't work a service call needed to be set up however we were encouraged to avoid this at all costs!  On every call we needed to transition to sales and pitch an upgrade of service to the customer allowing us to make a sale.  Our calls were graded and if the pitch was not made and/or not successful this put our job in jeopardy."
good,Good while I was there. Great people and a growing company back when I was there. Good leadership and mentors. Very diverse workforce. I miss the environment
good,when i got into work i would go get my signed truck then go get my stuff that i needed to complete jobs that were assigned to me.. what i like about the job i got to meet every nice people
good,"Time Warner provides an alright experience. when starting out there was not too much help from the manual given. there were a lot of customers who would coem with thesame complaints, showing the very common problems wtih the service."
good,Met some nice people and learned a great deal in accounts receivable department.  was there over 2 years and i loved the benefits and the hours.  will never be able to find another job that had the benefits that time warner had.
good,"It was a decent place to work, customer service inbound can be difficult. While it didn't last for me they were very understanding with medical issues."
good,Warner was fine.It paid the bills barely. but it had a good 401k which I heavily invested in which allowed the time to take a chance on myself. For that I will be forever grateful.
good,"You go home when the work is done. Not every house is the same, so some house take longer to complete then others. So you might miss your next appointment. That is when management get upset  and they rarely find you help. Some of the house you go in are bio hazards. This is not a friendly environment. The stress of trying to get done in time to make it home is impossible. If you cut corners you might  get done in time but then you have a repeat service call and you lose your pay raise. If you want to see what people are really like on a day to day bases , this is the job for you."
good,Supervisors not as helpful as I would like but overall a good place to work. Incentive is a plus. Lots of friendly people there willing to help in any manner possible.
good,I would only recommend this job for people who really like to hustle and lie a little bit just to make a dollar. The people are pretty cool but the company ethics are what I question.
good,The company has been bought by another firm and the management has had a complete turnover.  I don't see how any review by me would be worthwhile.  I liked working there but left when i was offered a better paying job.
good,"I learned a lot worked with a lot of great people learned about hot cuts sales teams, test and turn ups the culture was great the hardest part of the job was the shortness if the contract. the team work was great"
good,"I worked there in the early 2000's and at that time it was a fun place to be with a highly creative environment with fun perks.  Being an entertainment company, it was always busy and full of great surprises."
good,"Your typical call center - explaining billing issues, troubleshooting basic cable/internet issues, taking new orders, selling various products. Supervisors ok when you have no questions"
good,Good work place took contacts and did the job at hand in the best way that I could in a safe well maintained pace.     We did the construction part of putting fiber optic under ground or above ground on the poles as well as doing hard coax lines.       I worked in a crew and told others the job at hand and what all needed to be done in a professional manner as well as a safe one .
good,I was able to take classes to improve my pay.  I really thought that with the travel distances needed to be taken into consideration and not giving techs enough time to do their jobs propertly
good,They actively and consistently support all efforts to simplify and enhance the customer experience. The role will provide good customer support and maintaining professional and positive relationships with customers.
good,"You go in and take 40 calls a day and sell cable, internet, and phone. If a customer calls in and only wants one service you gotta upsell them to get everything."
good,"Pay is lower then most serverice worker jobs, workers are told to own the job that your on but management just wants to hurry to get thoughs numbers.."
good,"If you're child-less, then this job is for you. If you have children, re-think applying as work-life balance isn't one of Charter's strong points. Look for work in someone's office but NOT this one!"
good,Arbitrarily changing metrics month to month is something else. Terrible management. Sort of unfair because the supervisors are under intense pressure to produce. In my short career there I have seen supervisors come and go almost as much as the employees. Typical revolving door call center.
good,"There is constant change for the better. Management encourages and challenges you on a daily basis. There are people who have been there for many, many years and take their jobs extremely personally."
good,Interesting environment working with incredibly bright individuals. Very hierarchical in nature. Large staff supporting a medium sized employee environment.
good,"A lot of client and colleague interaction.  Very flexible with work hours and filled with great benefits and company-related perks.  Management is very flexible with work-life balance and always seeking to help teach/grow your career.  The hardest part of the job would be the networking.  Very key in the field, and also hard to gain the trust of the different areas.  Most enjoyable part is the people."
good,"Working commercail logs could get boring, a lot of data entry. Management wasn't very supportive. Some of the co-workers were helpful. Hardest part of the job was working the late nights which could have been avoided. Enoyable part of the job, viewing the TV commercials before they went live."
good,Great benefits and perks like free preview to movies. There are great assistance programs for tuition and child daycare.
good,It can be a very good position it just depends upon your what your expectations are for yourself.  There is some room for growth if you're willing to stick to it
good,I love/hated working here. My teammates and supervisors were all easy to work for and with. The stressfulness of the job was unhealthy. It was not a culture fit for me.
good,"A typical day is resolving customer issues cable, internet or phone. I learned how to have great customer service skills.The work place culture is diverse."
good,Over 20+ years working for the company. When Spectrum took over the company took a turn for the worst. They are trying to get it back on track but it won’t be easy especially after the strike with Union
good,"Enjoyed working there while I was with the company. It was a good company but jobs were being sent out of state. A typical day at work would be working with property managers, owners to bring the company money. The hardest part of the job was."
good,"The benefits are decent, not exceptional.  The pay is pretty good, but the commissions make the income what it is.  The atmosphere was kind of cliquey, and turn over can be pretty high.  Cable is not free anymore, though you do get a discount on services.  Direct Sales gets out of the office door to door, but the Account Executive positions were cut back significantly."
good,"TWC no longers exists, so this review is somewhat pointless.  I preferred to culture of TWC to the culture at Spectrum, particularly the decisions of upper management.  Much the middle management was the same, so the day-to-day experience did not change, but the long-term planning was worse."
good,"This is a call center job answering billing questions for Spectrum Cable, formerly Time Warner Cable. The job evolved over time and the focus has narrowed so that it is now a ""center of excellence"" focusing solely on billing matters."
good,"Good company, able to advance to another position. Gather work knowledge. Friendly environment to work at. Work at unsupervised condition. Raises and reviews annually."
good,Overall great work life balance.  A good manager is a key factor to success to mentor and grow your career.  Highly tiered so internal advancement based on both networking and job performance
good,"Always had work busy all day .On cal 24/7 for a week at a time, no home life at all.pay was Great and great benifites. i worked in Florida though where it was extreemly hot all the time."
good,Great company but minimal growth due to low turnover.  Great culture with nice perks and overall management structure.  LA office located on Warner Bros lot
good,"I loved my job but was laid off due to the company buy out.  It is a fast pas place to work with room for advancement.  Many different positions, the managment is great."
good,I left because my school was not advancing because work would not even budge 30 minutes on my schedule for classes. Then management wrote me up for missing work when my mom was given a terminal illness diagnosis and I rushed to go see her. I had missed 2 days of work in 27 months and they put me on final notice for attendance.
good,"Easy job, good management. policies change constantly. Charter has made it too policy strict. lost my job due to very bad illness. had doctors notes for every missed day. Was told to wait 6months to reapply and now am told that I was terminated so i cant be rehired. Regardless the reasoning and the proof."
good,"Very political as executives protect their own turf at the expense of the overall company.  At the time I was there, AOL was in charge and the acquisition deal with a big mistake.  AOL didn't know how to run a larger, established company."
good,The office vibe was always positive. I enjoyed helping my customers and the environment that I worked. Many job opportunities were available and the benefits were great!
good,"Time Warner was great at offering incentives for it's employees, however, was really more sales oriented and I was a customer service representative. If you didn't meet the qualifications of sales than you were immediately fired. I always met my requirements but a lot of employees didn't that were there for many years and unfortunately got let go after twenty years of employment."
good,"Not much more I can say about that. If you have worked at one, you know what the culture is like and how the job is. You take calls, have metrics to meet, and get yelled at because people don't understand why the internet doesn't work when they have no electricity in the house."
good,Very much time spent working and putting out great equipment with a great group of people. More like family. Led by John Ryck who understood each and every employees strength. Company lost sight of workers
good,"Time Warner Cable was soul-sucking. When you're hired, you go through about 6 weeks of training and you go on the phone soon after that. They train you relatively well until you get an issue that keeps you on the phone for 4+ hours and no one is willing to help you. "
good,"It really just depends on who your management is if you will have a great work life and experience, but Turner overall provides great benefits."
good,"I don’t care to write a review. The company is ok to work for and I have nothing to say. If you’d like to know if it’s a good company to work for, go get a job with them"
good,"I found the interactions with the customers (inside of their homes) to be interesting, but not for everyone. Drug use and squalor, to high end homes, one must be a people person to enjoy this job. "
good,This company change supervisors  many of times since I been their and I did not have a hard time adjusting. I have learned a few things dealing with people.
good,"Overall, it was a great learning curve for me in marketing. I never anicipated a position in marketing and especially not with medical benefits. At the time, the company had a supplemental employee program in place which allowed selected contract workers to obtain the same benefits as a staff member. It was indeed a good place to be at the time. Unfortunately, it was a difficult place/deparment(s) to get nto as a fulltime staff member. People never left!"
good,"Comcast bought Time Warner, I should have stayed. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the politics of a merger. Coworkers become anxious and afraid of change towards an already high paced, high-stress work environment."
good,"I think it's a great company. I honestly believe twc was great for so many years. But I also believe I started work for the company at a time, when twc was going thru very difficult time. Customers were not happy."
good,company atmosphere has changed from when Time Warner initialled owned it to how it is now with Charter in control.  very toxic and hostile work environment.
good,"Before turning to Spectrum, TWC was a GREAT place to work for. It was fun, productive and had great benefits. Everyday it felt like coming home to my second home. The hardest part was when the company switched and I got pregnant."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Time Warner Cable, however, once the merger with Charter completed, everything changed.  It was obvious that Charter had much different views, and does not seem to be nearly as focused on their employees.  They are more closed minded and feel that the way they do business is the only way.  They are really behind the ball when it comes to telecommuting, and being flexible regarding WFH, that was a huge bonus working at Time Warner Cable."
good,"The ratings I provided were for Time Warner, which was a far better-run company than Charter (Spectrum). Everything about Charter screams shareholder profit, not efficiency, customer care, logic, employee support, or effectiveness."
good,"-Advancement opportunities based on who you know and who you've previously worked under."
good,Its a okay place to work with good job advancement if you are willing to put in the work required for it. They will hold your hand for a bit before sending you to the wolves
good,Great place to work with great employees. Awesome way to not be stuck in the same environment every day as u are able to travel from site to site to make the necessary appointments.
good,Overall I enjoyed my time with the Time Warner family. The tough part about working at Time Warner was going through the re-organization process and seeing the impact it had on it's employees.
good,"This was a good company to work for, gave the opportunity for internal advancement and many great perks for a job well done. It was always challenging and there was a new way to earn perks each month as well as a very competitive commission schedule."
good,I was a Contract Consultant at TW. I cannot provide any data in regards to how Employees are compensated or treated. Please note that Contractors are not involved in Company Dealings
good,Typical day is cold calling in your territory.  Weekly and monthly team meetings followed by one on ones with your manager.  The method has changed since the merger from what I'm told.
good,Great People! Not sure about long term future of the company...
good,"I enjoy working the hours. It had great benefits. I worked with"
good,"My job was eliminated, otherwise i would have loved to stayed with TW Inc. for many more years."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time with this company and I miss the people I worked with the more than anything. I would be willing to return for the right situation and salary.
good,"Overall good time working there. You work 40 hours a week.  You learn how to operate there program and computer systems,Generating new customers that purchase merchandise products routers, internet"
good,This job when you first start you get sucked into everyone's sobs story. However the more you work the more you become immune to everything.. So someone 80 with no family an no income besides from the state and all she does is watch tv and her bill goes from $65 to $135 you have no sympathy for that person.
good,"Install, maintain, and repair cable systems, most often involved with television and internet services"
good,"- Flexible hours"
good,My position was different than the others in the building but I enjoy what I do for the company.  My teammates are helpful and wonderful and we communicate well with each other.
good,"Stressful,overwhelming, and  bullied not respected when explaining that the company’s equipment is faulty and out dated.  they are quick to blame you for customers dissatisfaction instead of fixing there mainframe equipment."
good,This is a great company to work for in terms of sales. You can make a lot if you put in the work. The down side is long hours and not always he best support from upper management. Not much teamwork involved do to the competitive nature of the job need to meet sales goals. But if you are a great sales person this is the perfect job to challenge you.
good,A great place to begin a career and get introduced to the corporate work experience. Great work locations in NYC and top benefits. Fantastic work life balance.
good,Good company but management culture is changing.  Needs training programs that develop individuals.  Standardized training manuals and processes needs to be developed. Needs linear career paths.
good,"I worked in the CNN division, at first it was a fun, challenging place to work. As the years and CEO's passed the work environment declined and moral was at an all time low. The benefits and pay were excellent."
good,"Big Multinational Media Company"
good,"The company being so large made the environment feel distant at times, but the smaller teams within the company were very close and responsive to employee concerns.  Advancement was very clear and self-managed.  An employee could advance at their chosen pace.  This process was a main benefit of working for the company. The work was rewarding, but could be overwhelming at times, and because of this, scheduling could get difficult and getting off work on time was sometimes hard to manage."
good,"Lovely team and good, friendly culture. You feel valued and like you're making a difference and contribution, but at the same time it's hard to progress and you can risk being siloed in your role."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at TWC, but opportunities dried up at the end as we were on the verge of being acquired. I did appreciate my time there, and wish the company well in the future."
good,I loved working at Time Warner Cable/Charter Communications! I enjoyed working with the my fellow co-workers. However my direct manager was new to the role and very inexperienced. 
good,"No major complaints, onsite café isn't bad. Constantly on call as management member. Lots of politics but staff is made up of some really great people. That's what I miss the most about the place."
good,Helping customers with their service asking any questions they have about their services. Able to resolve the issue a customer had and explaining what caused the issue.Making the customer Satisfied overall through the visit
good,It's a hard and stressful job but pay and benefits are good. You will have to do sales regardless of your position. All calls are to be handled with notes on the account in under 6 minutes.
good,"My experience in Twc, was good cause I learned the necessary traits to have a productive day. The workplace was clean, professional, my coworkers were team players which made it fun to work with and excite our daily task."
good,"After being used to a fast paced environment where challenges were met constantly, I found myself in a department that was very uninviting.  The hours dragged due to lack of work and the social atmosphere was draining and void.  I don't speak of the company as a whole but the department I was in was not suited for me and what I have been accustomed to."
good,"12+ year tenure ended with TWC/Charter merger (as I was unable to relocate)."
good,My time at twc was good until the last year I started as a retention specialist then moved up to team captain and as team captain I lead team meetings and also preformed one on one coaching. The reason I'm no longer there is the merger and the way things started being handled
good,"Adelphia was a wonderful place to work for. The owners made you feel like family and recongnized you for your had work and dedication. Time Warner itself came in and I was aware that due to their huge presence in New York State and their operations being in close proximity of Buffalo, that it would lead to the most job loss. They moved several different departments to other states. Possibly more than 50% of the jobs have been relocated to other states as well as Syracuse and some to Rochester. When they were previously one of the top employers here in Buffalo. I understand that there were duplications in departments that caused these closures, but Buffalo was the Head quarters and now I can see additional job loss to other employees due to departmental closures."
good,"I learn a lot working at Time Warner, but it was not the fit for me at the time. I was just getting out the military and was also having my third child. While I was there they was very supportive with everything and provide me with time off to be with my family. The few months that I was there was a good experience overall."
good,"Attendance is everything. Know your job, use your judgment properly, work indepently without calling on a supervisor. Know when to schedule a technician. Know your packages and I think you will be ok."
good,Great company with good benefits and room for advancement. To bad it closed because it ended up lowering it's staff by almost half. Also closing its office's.
good,"TBS was a great place to work for many years. Although workplace changes affected a lot of tenured employee's, the people and perks provided made it exciting. "
good,"I wrote several productivity applications for the engineers and technicians including asset management and repair tracking."
good,"alot of hard work but rewarding, and can advance really quick.i would get anywhere form 8 to 10 jobs a day an only an hour to complete but if u can work steady should be no problem."
good,good job good pay i enjoyed it for a while then i went to canada and when i came back two onths later i got a different manager and thngs were not as mch fun.
good,We're there to fix cable. as long as you stay polite and be empathetic than your good. If you are someone who need a hand more than once a week you might not like it beause everyone else is just as busy.
good,"great place to work, lacking in customer service. Stringent dress code. Pay was adequate and benefits were great. No job security, always worried about company selling and eliminating jobs."
good,great place to work with advancement opportunities and employee benefits along with health and retirement benefits.diversified culture and fun environment.
good,"A typical day at work is grinding it out from the time my feet step off the elevator to the moment I shut my computer down at the end of the day. Every day is full and most days are spent putting out fires. I am thankful for the job as it affords me the opportunity to travel, speak, work, train, and brainstorm with many different individuals; those seen as internal and external customers."
good,Time Warner is a great company as an employee you can gain valuable experience. The company offers an impressive benefits package. Overall it is a great company.
good,"Productive and a learning environment. Very Process oriented and Business Users driven Projects."
good,Working for TWC was stressful bu the management was kind. i had to leave because I was moving to a location that didn't have Time Warner. this company offered great benefits while I was there and i enjoyed the atmosphere.
good,"This opportunity is for those who loves sales, can manage your time appropriately then you can make a pretty decent salary with this company.  The benefits are good as well."
good,It's very hard to review Time Warner as a whole due to the two very different work atmospheres and management styles.  While working in East Syracuse it was a team effort working to provide the best customer service possible whereas in Latham it was cut throat.
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in and see what research was needed for key players that played in the videos sent to us by other time warner cable partners in Western, NY. Also to locate and communicate with any guess speakers to fill spots in the pre-recorded show. What I learned working here is how edited sports videos. While coming up with written script material to go with the videos play by play movements. I also learned how to setup equipment in the studio for live shows such as moving the cameras to pan to the right position. The management for this facility was awesome very caring and concerned for his employees. The people I worked with were very informative if I had any questions or concerns about any problem I could not figure out. The hardest part of my job was to start and end the pre-recorded show without any mistakes and more retakes to edited any mistakes. The most enjoyable part of my job was the laid back atmosphere and how everyone gets along with some great humor."
good,Good stable job and great benefits. Great co-workers and working environment.
good,"I started. At CNN  and moved on to entertainment. I noticed that when coworkers turned 55 thr were generally laid off so that Time warner could hire a person who was you ger, good with technology and CST much less. It seemed to be business practice. Now it has been acquired by AT&T  who is incompetent!"
good,This was one of my best jobs that I ever had.   Unfortunately I had to relocate so I had to resign my position.   I miss this job tremendously.   If given the opportunity I would definitely go back.
good,"Time Warner may not be for everybody.  Must be willing to venture into attics and crawl space, and climbing utility poles."
good,Management did not work with employees to understand what was needed for the job. Upper management did not want to accept responsibility for bad customer experience.
good,"Time Warner Cable was a very interesting place to work. Understanding how Internet, cable and phone services are provided really was an eye opener. Assisting customers and getting their services working as it should was always a good feeling."
good,"I'd start my day with a half hour standing team meeting with my off-shore team, my on-site team, and my remote team. We review outstanding tickets, update major projects, mention any important issues and address fires that need to be put out.. Then I'd meet with clients next hour to find out about their concerns, upcoming projects, upcoming tickets that need special attention and their general feeling about our partnership. After that I'd spend an hour updating Projects and documentation. Lunch with a Client. Then Global Management meeting with other Directors and managers in Warner Bros, Turner Networks, TW Corp and HBO. This is followed by a few hours of unstructured afternoon time which might be used to plan,  design solutions and respond to the days emails. End of day we typically meet about the upcoming evening work and review our plans to ensure we are ready for flawless execution and we are ready to mitigate or  back out should the unexpected occur ."
good,"if you like technology this is the place for you. you will learn alot here like about phones, cable boxes, and internet service and how to troubleshoot all equipment"
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at Time Warner Cable. This was a fast paced job. We were always busy, leaving little down time during the day. At this job it was still early in my career and I was able to learn what was expected in an office  environment."
good,The workplace culture was great.  The balance of team effort along with balancing fun gave you motivation for being there. Some projects were team focused while most were not.
good,"Fast-Paced with constant calls coming in.   It does have a few issues with support to new employees but can be completed given proper training.   "
good,"Good company to work for. They have very high standards, so they keep you on your toes. Different work environment and conditions at every job you go to. If you don't like change, you don't want to work here."
good,"Last 3 years I worked in security installations and service, the company sold and became spectrum when I changed to a new company  as spectrum would no longer install security systems"
good,"The teamwork was the most enjoyable part of working for TWC.  We had a great management structure and as a supervisor being a part of that structure enabled me to keep my team informed.  As daily work fluctuated, cross-training was implemented to ensure coverage of all tasks and I learned to evaluate each individual for their strength and weakness."
good,"To be fair, I worked at this company during it's former incarnation as Time Warner Cable. The duties were compounded, and not fairly compensated. "
good,I enjoyed working for them. Great place to work. I had good training. I felt appreciated. It was a great experience. I did outside sales. I did very well.
good,"Great place to work for benefits are good. Daily change within the company since buyout of Charter. This makes it hard to work at times, but other than that a good place to work."
good,"The day went smooth and fast!! You are so caught up in helping others you forget the time!!! I love helping people because it helps ,e feel wonderful."
good,Sky is the limit with working for this company.  Within a year I had received 2 job promotions. As long as you are willing to make yourself a better employee they are willing to recognize that.
good,"Productive fast pace environment with room for growth, great people - family based environment, good benefits and nice amenities - a lounge and play room to relaxe."
good,"This was a helpful step in my career that actually better prepared"
good,"A typical day was being on the computer and answering emails and phone calls and entering orders,  non micro managed, fun place to work at, hardest part was adjusting to the new system."
good,TWC had great benefits and a wonderful culture and employees.  The employees really make the company what it is.  Lovely campus in Charlotte and a solid product.
good,"A fun place to work with a number of perks and good morale.  Company offered summer hours, Christmas week off and had a pool table and ping pong table."
good,"Very enjoyable work environment.  Although my position was eliminated due to budget shortfalls/cuts, the severance process and compensation was very well handled by management and fair.  I would highly recommend Time Warner Inc. as an employer."
good,It is an excellent company to work for but because of that no one leaves and it is difficult to move up.  There are a lot talented individuals but there are also old-timers with very conservative ways to operate the business.
good,Good company for any person to work. It provided growth and advancement.  Flexibility. I have acquired more experience and knowledge in my career.
good,My typical day at work would be assisting managers in a very broad IT department.
good,Employees and employers got along very well we did things as a company and Coworker's and Employee's got long fine and we all worked hard together to provide services thru out Maui at least with Oceanic they allowed us to work togethere to make sure we all go home on time and safely
good,"Train and assist customers with the creation, design, configuration, validation, installation and marketing, sale application engineering and development activities"
good,I enjoyed working with TWC I went from an Agent to a Interim Supervisor. My hours were the most difficult I worked from 4:00 pm until 4:00 am. I asked my supervisor if I can start earlier and he humiliated me in front of my peers and agents that I was supervising. I really enjoyed my job! My team was always the winners on the afternoon and night shift for sales and QA! My supervisor accused my Agents of not preforming their jobs correctly because he stated there’s no way we could be weekly Winners ! For me he was insulting my integrity and sadly I knew it was time for me to move on.
good,"I started working at TWC full time in the fall of 2014.  I went through 8 weeks of training before even going out to the call center floor.  We would listen to other people on the phone in training but it wasn't till the last week that we started taking calls.  Call center work is rough.  The calls can be daunting to say the least.  I do not recommend this type of work for anyone that can't control their temper because you would lose it fast.  I would say 75% of my calls were kind people that wanted to talk to me longer than I was supposed to be on the line, but the other 25% were rude, used foul language, threatened things against the company etc.  Those were calls that typically went up to a supervisor, but every once in a while you'd have to wait on a supervisor to take the call.  We got an hour for lunch each day and in 2015 my health started to decline.  I won't go into details, but lets just say I had to have 4 major surgeries from 2016 to 2018.  Due to this I was let go, but it was after all of my ADA benefits had expired.  They got rid of my department only a couple months later after I had to go out for surgery once Charter took over.  In fact the whole call center is now a billing call center and all tech support were left with a choice to go do billing or take three months pay.  I never got the chance to do either since I was out, and they did offer me the chance to go back, but I've heard of what's happened there since and it's the last place I'd want to go back to.  Years and years of tech support to be a billing agent?  Nope.  I'll find some place where I can put"
good,"worked with a fun bunch of folks. laid back work environment. management was so-so. nothing was hard about my job."
good,"Time Warner Cable was a great employer.  They hired a great management team that knew how to motivate their employees.  The work and compensation were well above the normal for most employers in NC, and I am certain across the US.  This was one of the only remaining employers that offered a pension to their employees, nationwide, and IVF to its employees in NC."
good,I have worked for the company for over 14 years. I started in the call center as an agent and have been promoted several time over the past 14 years to my current position of NYC Quality Assurance Coordinator.
good,"My typical day consisted of  communicating with my staff regarding media request from clients, monitoring and troubleshooting hardware and software issues, applications failures and providing customer service globally to our internal and external customers.  My day also consisted of ensuring and monitoring the  successful ingestion of all commercial media for the News Networks globally.  I learned over the years to have patience and understanding with things that I could not control.  I also learned to trust and understand my co-workers differences. The hardest part of the job for me was not being able to have the work/life balance.  I worked in a 24/7 environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the final results of my hard work with happy clients, happy employees, successful projects ending on time and meeting budget requirements and receiving rewarding feedback from Senior Management (VP's/Directors)"
good,t was a great place to work I was given full responsibility of the projects and Vendor management. the manager i had was very open to ideas and in the weekly meeting only needed to know that the work was getting done.
good,"There was room for growth. I started out as a temp, helping out the manager. Was hired on as a full time employee. Working in collections, running daily and weekly reports on past due accounts for all customers, was the job I learned from my manager. All agents were extremely helpful in my daily process."
good,"If you do your job well, you do well. Every day was challenging and most days felt productive and sometimes even rewarding. The customers who need to utilize the customer support services are usually complete idiots and it's a miracle some have made it this far but there are real opportunities to help people navigate a large problem with a large company in a larger industry."
good,The company definitely promoted a culture in its marketing department that we were all part of leadership.  Ideas flowed regardless of tittles and accountability and data driven results were encouraged.
good,Time Warner was one the best companies I had the pleaser of working for. Unfortunately they sold it to Charter/ Spectrum who didn't share the same values as Time Warner did. Time Warners investment in their employees and infrastructure makes it a great company to work for. They have full benefits as well as a 401k and stock options. Their management is very good as well. I was with them for 13 years and was promoted to Crew Chief/ field supervisor . Again if it were not for them selling the company I would have still been employed with Time Warner till this day.
good,"A typical day at work was tiring, due to the grueling physical of labor of walking around and placing advertisements, but it taught me a lot about how to stay focused on a single task at hand and the importance of sticking to a schedule. The management was amazing, important to note is that my mom helped me get the job, but regardless, I had no issues with my superiors and I always enjoyed the culture they had there. The hardest part of the job was walking in the heat as I worked a Texas Summer, but the most enjoyable part of the job was in the early morning where I was most productive due to the cool weather, lack of automotive/human congestion and the relaxing nature of completing task after task."
good,The only thing I didn't like was going all billing and dealing with mostly angry customers. When we were billing and tech support it was great but billing only with spectrums new rules you could never make anyone happy
good,"Time Warner was a cable company,they believe in making quota & sales. They offered discount service & very good insurance. They were active in bigger communities, but not so much in the small community that I'm from"
good,Good Management. Great benefits. Pretty much decent employees to work around or work with. Plenty of opportunity for advancement. The pay is decent but I don't like the face that a person just graduating from high school getting a job there will be making the same starting pay as I will despite that I have around 20 years of customer service experience.
good,Great location to work and not a bad company to work. For. I. Wish they had more room for growth for security officers. If that issue can be fixed it would be an ideal place to work.
good,Very Easy job laid back Cool environment I Really set my own hrs and if I Did my job in a timely fashion or quick I was able to leave early and still be able to make a lot of cash management was horrible if I Could improvise or figure a problem out myself was little hard to get in contact with anyone had problems with Keosh Machine but other then that pay was Excellent and It was the best part time job I ever had in my life iam just glad I Already has sales skills.
good,My experience brought me alone way. This job will help you with your communication skills ‘ typing skills if you having any problems in those fields. Good job
good,It was my first big job it also helped me with being more responsible I was very excited when I was told I had got the job it was challenging at first but I got use to it
good,"I worked in the Food service for Time Warner for Restaurant Associates.  I was responsible for the Cafeteria and catering in both towers.  My dealings with management of Time Warner itself, the loading dock procedures, and building security overall was very professional and congenial.  I enjoyed my time there till I was forced out due to downsizing of the kitchen staff."
good,"I have had over six years of experience in Automation Test script Development. I have had experience in  both manual and automated testing of web based applications as well as client server applications. In my QA carrier I have worked on different Operating Systems such as windows XP, Windows, Unix and few others. I have done test developed in C++, Java and Visual Basic.  A Few testing tools I believe I have extensive experience that would be QC/ALM(11.00)  and QTP(9.52,10.00,11.00)/UFT(11.50). And I have done a lot of different tests using these Testing Tools, some of them are Smoke Testing, Functional Testing, Black Box Testing, Integration Testing, Regression Testing ,UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Testing and so many others. And other than that I have also done a lot of back-end testing using SQL Query. So few of the databases that I  have worked on  are  Oracle, Sql Server and Microsoft Access."
good,"An outstanding culture that offers exposure, experience and opportunities in the vast landscape of media, publishing, film and television. Stay here and you'll go far."
good,Sourced new media candidates; Strong networking environment; Conducive to forging new relationships; Impressive facility
good,I enjoyed working for Time Warner. My co-workers and management were always very helpful
good,A solid company true to the principles of a liberal organization. Fun work environment.
good,Turner offers great benefits and perks to its employees. It is a wonderful company to work for.
good,"People rely on cable and internet too much. If the service is down and it took longer to fix, they’d just lay into us and say horrible things. Apologizing didbt matter either. I’m very happy with my new career."
good,Good place to work I spent many years doing it and enjoyed it very much. If you work hard you can make a lot of money. My job required a lot of travel
good,"We offered business solutions at Time Warner and helped increase productivity, profitability, and efficiency for all size companies.  It was a descent base with uncapped commission."
good,"My focus at Time Warner was in the Commercial print arena.  We were constantly reviewing our strategic sourcing strategies.  We work across all media platforms from Cable Networks like CNN to Home Improvement magazines like “This Old House”."
good,"Excellent place to work at, friendly environment opportunity for development and growth and would highly recommend entry level candidates to apply."
good,I would edit photos and upload them to the server. I alerted my manager to any issues with the photo gallery. I would also help my coworkers with any of their issues.
good,This position stretched my capacity.  Gave me the opportunity to utilize my project manager skills and utilize my decision making ability for projects
good,Jobs were challenging as well as learning experiences. Employees were friendly and helpful with day to day training and tasks. Manager Was understanding. He took time to clarify his wishes on the jobs I performe.
good,"My number one priority is having a great team, who are able to communicate well. And I got that from the team. So looking forward to working with them again."
good,Time Warner Media was a good place to work with many benefits. I enjoyed the opportunity to work with many talented people and do my share to contribute to our department's advancement.
good,"Always growing, always challenged, the company worked hard to meet the needs of the customers and shareholders.  The workplace was open, friendly and over the years the silo'd nature of the departments began to adapt to the new reality. One where team work and ownership of the goals became the responsibility of all the groups involved in their delivery.  Much effort was made to update the culture, inclusion and diversity were real goals … not just words. The people made the organization. The customers drove the innovation."
good,They were great to employees. It was a very good job and I greatly enjoyed it. It was always challenging me to the max and I loved that about working there
good,"Report to work at 0730 and receive the word on the up coming weekly events from supervisor then load up the vans with necessary equipmnent and supplies needed, leave by 0800, stop if possible and meet with a few of my fellow Techs and discuss the strategy for the day and then hit the ground running to our various jobs that we had scheduled. Jobs were Installation of TV boxes/Modems for various rooms in the residences, also troubleshooting issues/ replace damaged or loose fittings, splitters, cables, or drops, also how to use remote  controls, channel settings, associated devices such as DVDs, VCRs, TV antenna set ups etc. Learned a lot about working as a team, assisting other Techs who might be behind on jobs, need assistance at jobs for various reasons. Learned the Importance of management, how it can raise or lower moral. Workplace was friendly and enjoyable with a small gym and outdoor lunch events. Hardest part of the job was sometimes doing disconnections (not necessary with digital services) because the connection points (Telephone Poles, Pedistals) were not always accessable ie., back yards with dogs, bees/wasps nests, nonco-operative customers etc. Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving a satisfied customer with job well done. Also leaving a job after 14 years and still keeping in touch with some good people that I've worked with."
good,had to be able to multi task sometimes more than 2 or 3 things always with a positive attitude typical day most enjoyable is the closeiness of the employees
good,Company provided all tools necessary to succeed. Well traveled company with ample opportunity to succeed within you field or opportunities to grow outside of your initial field.
good,I had great pay. Coworkers were great until charter took over. Management was very very poor and extremely cold and unprofessional. It became a job of horror
good,"Learn about the television environment, how they budget and create comercial and stunts. Helped different departments to move forward with their projects. "
good,I loved working at Time Warner and the Cartoon Network. Fun environment

good,Wish the budge wasn't a factor or I'd still have my job.  But I still believe this is a great company to work for. The staff is really nice and it's a clean environment.  Very secure too.
good,Productive and fun place to work.Learn more while you grow in the company.Need more involvement from management to their hard working employees.Customer service among top priorities.
good,"Good culture, although industry changes make it subject to layoffs on a regular basis.  Good group of people, tries to make a positive difference in the day to day of people work/life balance.  good opportunity for advancement in certain areas of company (slower than before).  Industry leader."

good,The company has provided their employees with tremendous amount of opportunity to grow within the company.  The culture and management was really appreciated.  Totally recommend.
good,"Management was approachable, friendly and gave direction without micro managing. However merger culture has changed a bit and still trying to find a new norm"

good,Time Warner was an exceptional company to work for.  The only reason I left the company was to pursue an opportunity at running my own business.  I would recommend Time Warner Cable to any young person trying to get a head start on life.  Exceptional company to work for and now has me wishing I had never left.
good,Not sure why I am writing a review on somewhere I never worked.  This was a customer of mine.  Not an actual place of employment.  I am just trying to get enough words in to move on.
good,"Great company to work for.  Has been recently acquired.  Changes are pending.  Big restructuring, merger, and new opportunities."
good,"There was no typical day at this company,  what I can say is that there was always great camaraderie, lots of fun and just really good times working there.  Management was personable, open and fair.  There wasn't much to learn there, it was for the most part your standard administrative job.  The hardest part of this job was waiting and hoping to become a permanent employee and it never happening.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the different environments I experience by being a floater and getting to meet some of my favorite music artists."
good,"Great place to work even with a fast paced call environment, management is always willing to help improve and help give the tools and knowledge to move up in the company"
