rating,review
bad,"Do NOT work here. Terrible company, clique HR team that hires their own family and friends. Unless you know someone, or are related to a current employee..."
bad,You are discriminated against if your above 30 years of age for decent positions..you can have an unreal set of skills but if your over 30 you won't be considered .offer jobs if your in the clocks
bad,Don't work here. They treat you like dirt and don't care about their employees. The pay is good but not for the amount of labor and the harmful chemicals you work in.
bad,agent de production travail a la chaine travail posté en  3 / 8
bad,"Although i enjoyed my job at Enersys, it is not for everyone. Thre is no room for advancement or growth. nice job for a college stupid."
bad,Locally this company is a revolving door. Management is horrible and changed as often as socks. Bonuses seem to be terminated right before the goal is met. Safety is a huge issue at this plant due to lack of proper training and tired people working machines they are not trained on. Huge disconnect within this company on so many levels because communication is just non existent. This company has literally ruined a good reputation within the local community
bad,"Management does not care about their employees. Problems get turned in and they are ignored, but when an employee reacts to an ongoing situation they fire them. If they would have handled it in the beginning employees wouldn't have reacted in the way they did."
bad,"the place is like a rotten caramel apple ... it looks great on the out side ... but then after that first bite .... its just gross... i did have some good times with some of the employees and bonded the same way dogs bond when they are stuck together  ... and that is exactly what it is .. the same people you stand with will stab you in the back soon as they get a chance ... or when they want to try to be leader of the pack"
bad,typical day at enersys was hectic not organized the place was ran by a dictator if u wanted to keep Ur job u really needed to kiss but. they look for reason to fire ppl for no reason. but if u mess up once even if its small u better look out they will get u.
bad,"So much weld smoke in there that you can't hardly see to work,management just makes rules as they go along. Don't give you a handbook,they lock it up in glass."
bad,"Terrible place. No notice of overtime, no ventilation, people steal out of vehicles, employee got stabbed in the neck with a knife in a fight, production manager got choked by a employee. They make rate impossible to achieve.Favoritism is very noticable.They need a Union because there management walks all over employees. We call corporate on them on a daily basis."
bad,lots of travel no time at home the people were slow had to do a lot of the work and watch over them all day.
bad,"Worked at the one in Lorain, Ohio. Coworker talked about some working conditions I joked about it and that they should get a union. I was fired and out of a job 2 weeks later."
bad,"Worked at santa fe springs location for almost 3 years, got along with everyone, was always on time, never said no to task that they would assign to me and management never promoted me... never got noticed for my effort.... worked weekends and also somedays graveyard.. never got a raise or promoted for field tech position... I asked they said not yet... I had more experience than people that they were hiring with ZERO experience and I WAS teaching them?? Made no sense to me that I was teaching/showing other how to work on batteries and chargers when they were making alot more money than me..... if  it makes no money it makes no sense..... so I quit....  the END"
bad,"The work is fast paced and I really enjoyed the work. However the management was horrible. HR was a joke, Pay was great. The hardest part of the job was the Drama."
bad,"It only matters who you are family to in this company. The safety program is a joke. The personnel in charge of safety watches someone get shocked to the point their arms are burnt and didn't report it. A fork lift driver runs over a person and nothing happens to them, and if you self report you get in trouble.They don't back up their employees to their customers. The customer is always right even when they are wrong.The management will tell you they have your back, they let you take blame for everything."
bad,My training here consisted of riding with the person I was hired to replace for two weeks and watched him do his new job.  Was then told by manager not to call this employee who held the position with questions.  Mistakes were not looked at as learning experiences they were strikes against you.  Worked from 4 am until 10 pm - stressed to the max about making a mistake.  Was fired two weeks before Christmas with no warning or explanation and I was ranked 15th out of 90 in the sales force with over 3.2 million in sales.  I was able to accomplish this sales record in a short 5 months with the company.  I do not necessarily believe the entire company is bad but my manager was the worst I have had in my career.
bad,"Segregated work culture between offices and shop floor, extremely poor morale throughout production. "
bad,"My managers were nice but the HR department was awful, they are rarely helpful and don't do true investigations into incidents. They see you as nothing but a number. The pay was good and had decent benefits but the work environment itself was dirty."
bad,"This used to be such a great place, unfortunately it has fallen into poor management. Human Resources is no resource. If you have to take off for an emergency appendectomy then you better make sure your doctor mails in the FMLA within 10 days or you will be fired. No compassion, not family oriented and definitely not employee centered."
bad,"Management is never available, mean co-workers, negative attitudes, lot's of favoritism, lack of training, never complimented for a good job but ALWAYS called out when doing wrong, all in all a very unhappy work environment."
bad,"Travel 80% of the year."
bad,"Hard to work for, no room for advancement, unequal pay for the same job."
bad,"Upper management on the reserve power side incompetent!"
bad,"I learned to be my own boss, and using my time wisely on the job. Having a routine is always a good thing. Everyone employed by this company were very nice people. The best part about this job, was having the opportunity to work for myself and make my own hours."
bad,"The company has changed considerably over the last five years.  Many valuable people have either been fired or left due to upper management, bringing in new people to run the company.  These people have now brought in their new people and the business has suffered as a consequence.  The business was very profitable and has since started to hemorrhage money due to poor decisions by the C-Suite.  People who actually have a clue are either not listened to or ignored.  The CEO has been buying other companies as way to increase stock prices but all built as a house of cards.  Too many new  people in high level decisions that are feeding the pipeline with ideas that have not been thought out.  Manufacturing, Sales, Quality, and Engineering are all working in silos.  CEO basically lies every shareholder call, CTO has good vision but ZERO execution.  New product promised years ago are still not even close to being ready for production.  CEO has eliminated almost the entire workforce that started the company.  Does not have finger on the pulse of the company.  Only the new lower level people are happy at the company, but they do not know the serious trouble the company is really in."
bad,"Entreprise où il ne fait plus bon vivre. Petit personnel démotivé. Peu de vrais managers en général souvent des petits tyrans locaux. Promotions et récompenses ciblées sur un lot d'élus uniquement. Il ne faudrait pas grand chose pour améliorer mais aucune volonté. Seul le copinage paye. Royaume idéal des consultants de tout poil aux idées lumineuses qui ne marchent jamais (on fait, on casse et on recommence autre chose), et des ex de Faurécia. Le travail est toutefois intéressant et oui il y a bien pire. Ambiance délétère, vous rasez les murs de peur de faire une erreur qui mènera de toute façon à la porte...dans le meilleur des cas. Entreprise qui ne sait plus motiver ses troupes autrement que par le bâton. Evitez si vous pouvez...sinon ce n'est pas le bagne non plus, mais évitez les problèmes, ne vous mettez pas en avant, soyez une ombre. Faut bien vivre...Vous qui entrez ici abandonnez tout espoir. J'aime mon entreprise, pas sûr de la réciproque."
bad,"Keine Kompetente Bürofachleute."
bad,"Stressful and challenging at the internal level. Poor communication within the company. Management is weak. Internal support is lacking with support. Logistics are not solid. Computer and software support is outdated and mot supported while traveling. Products are great, yet inventory and availability can be an issue. Product lines for new technology are late to market and on time."
bad,they had no idea how to run a company. the only thing good about it was the supervisor i worked for. having to worry about your blood lead level was awful
bad,Enersys is in a dangerous business and does not keep BET on all it processes. The main goal is not safety is make production.
bad,co-workers extermaly nosie .
bad,"Lots of hot air coming from management, add to that very average pay and very frequent unrealistic work loads, and you can see why there is a high turn over. It's really just used by most employees with any standards as a 'filler job' in between better pay and conditions elsewhere. The buck stops at accountants and large shareholders in the US who couldn't care less about you."
bad,"Company has no training in place.  Innovative products but need to become more competitive with other lines.  Also build stronger relations with OEMS. This could be a great company but they need to review their managers who are part of a club, and seem to be stay in place regardless of their ineptitude."
bad,"A typical day was breaking down or building mine batteries."
bad,"Alpha Power was purchased by Enersys and there were immediate negative impacts. A number of positions were eliminated and their responsibilities distributed to other employees who already had more to do than they could reasonably accomplish in a standard shift. I was one of those employees. When I was told I would be required to work a twelve hour shift, as a salaried employee, I tried to negotiate with my manager to no avail. As a result, I resigned from the company."
bad,"Poor management. Nepotism at its finest."
bad,"5o+ hours a week, don't see kids except on weekends when they are in school, and miss day of work-get a point-for any reason to include going to doctor. 14 points your fired."
bad,"Most jobs are not bad, the people you work with and the management are horrible.  I am talking a whole new level of horrible.  Horrible people, horrible management but a good job with great pay and decent benefits. It would be up to you on how much you can take and what your willing to deal with if seeking a job here."
bad,"The nature of work did was critical for business, I enjoyed the work I did as the Enersys Benefitting much by automated docoument exchange."
bad,The radio is something that can take you by surprise in the word of people on the air and the job was a little easy.
good,Poor job security. Very poor communication. No leadership from management . Did not promote within the company.
good,the pay is excellent. can be a long day but overall it's a good place to work. I've learned to work with a wide variety of people.
good,"The product is good, warranty is good, management is closed off and can be completely disrespectful. Your ether in or out with them, senior management is too involved in day to day. Hire felons and treat every employee like one. Lots of turnover"
good,".une journée de 8 h , pas beaucoups de possibilité d'avancement sauf depart . bonne entende entre les employers de bureau et entrepot.le poid de certaine machandise . l'embiance général"
good,"You work different hours day and night, your required to travel 80 percent of the time and you do not get much over time. Even when you stay with in your daily expense your manager still complains about it"
good,Good company to work for but lacks good leadership. pay is not inline with work schedule and the expectation to work 7 days a week at a moments notice.
good,"It was fun while it lasted, but they wanted to make more money so they sent the work we did over to china. now everyone is out of work and no jobs for us"
good,"A Typical day would consist of either doing 3 to 6 things at once or nothing at all but sweep the shop all day. Ive learned to use a torch,crane, and operate a forklift.The hardest part of the day is when the shop gets swamped with 6 orders and only 2 workers to get the jobs done.The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing the satisfaction that you got the job done which helps powers the mining industry."
good,"work hard a joy to work with. they find a lot to talk about while working. management; good people , not a good benefit package for 401k , retirement might be ok."
good,I worked for Enersys in the Warrensburg location. This is not a bad job all in all and as far as factory work this is probably the easiest work you will find in the area for the money. Management shows a lot of favoritism on all of the shifts. This is a very unstable job and if you want to be laid off around the holidays they are known for that. All in all not a horrible place to work but not good for a steady reliable income.
good,Work in fast paced production facility.
good,"Dans l’ensemble j'ai étais très bien accueillie, la sécurité font comme sa les arranges mises a par se désagrément j'ai étais plutôt satisfait ."
good,"Typically a day at enersys was interesting, always a new task and always something to do. All assignments had to be timed correctly. Management was very flexible with time off if needed."
good,"Enersys was a great company to work for when I first started ."
good,Enesys is a forward thinking company always trying to improve quality or their product and for theost part life for their employees. Although a lot of theanagement their is straight up BAD not all but most. Management is constantly making changes to work areas for no reason without any imput from the people that actually know what they are doing and most of the time I was their it felt like they were just trying toake your life harder for no reason. Most of the workers on the floor are nice friendly people and fun to work with. I met a lot of good people there. All in all if they could make some management changes this company could thrive.
good,I was hired as an Engineering Lab Technician II and never seen the Engineering part of it. I was to be actively performing testing which became very minimal and sporadic. Now very little testing more maintaining the test lab.
good,"The company closed its plant in Cleveland, OH. However, the supervisor was very unskillful, liked better some people than others, did not do a quality job, took advantages on hard workers and kept some workers around on easy jobs. There was no probability to advance on a higher position, unless became one of the supervisor's favorites. The job overall was not that bad, only the supervisor made it worst."
good,"I hold myself and my employees to a very high level of accountability.  EnerSys does little to hold employees accountable for their job performance, making collaboration and cross functional participation difficult. As a result, functions are very isolated."
good,Je trouve qu'il n'y a pas assez de personnel pour des postes clefs de l'entreprise se qui malheureusement crée des problèmes multiples au quotidien et c'est se qui m’incite à chercher un nouvel emploi.
good,"My job requires me to work as a team day in day out as we have team targets to hit and also personal targets to hit and if theres one indivdual who is not pulling there weight then we all suffer and will not hit the target required. I work with Lead so there are strict P.P.E rules to follow which makes the job more difficult but they are necessary. Ive learned alot about different machinery since ive worked at enersys for example changing parts on different machines to understanding how they work and to learning how to operate them which at first looked difficult, Ive also learned to operate a forklift in my time at enersys. There are some good management and some bad! there are professional people and there are people who dont take the role serious and have been given the job as there a friend of someone in a higher role and its the same situation with supervisors. There are jobs which require you to work on your own which i am fine with but most jobs are a team effort, i believe i have a very good team and are happy with all my colleagues as we work well together and we all have known each other for a long time. The hardest part of the job is most probably working with unprofesional people and people who are lazy! Most enjoyable part of working for enersys is working with friends and working in a role which i quite enjoy doing as there are some roles which are not as enjoyable, i like the shift pattern im on and the hours are decent too."
good,"Assembly line work. Working with machinery, changing over parts, adjusting machines to spec, routine maintenance to machinery, quality control sheets. Must be able stand 8+ hours per shift. Must be able to push, pull, lift, 30+pounds. Consistent fast-paced work. Most of the time very hot working conditions. The benefits and pay rate are excellent."
good,"Awesome place of employment! I enjoyed the small, local branch although the company is international. Learning about various fork lift batteries and chargers (how to quote the sale & service of them) was quite interesting and informative."
good,"Learned a lot here. mostly from senior team members in the past and just figuring out things on my own. Formal training on anything new is non existent. "
good,"work was hard and stressful, some times it was good work some times not, Many late nights. A lot of heavy lifting, this is a job for a single young man that is very physically fit and smart.."
good,"its a very good place to work, excellent benefits and time off. better than average pay. the management how ever is not so good. you can earn very good money in all the Richmond ky facilities if you want to work."
good,"My boss was terrible. He was rarely happy and when he asked me to do something, I would do it but then he would change his mind and blame me for not doing it the way he wanted. Other departments seemed pretty cool though."
good,"Good place to work excellent pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you must be willing to operate according to sop, as well as ISO standards. They for the most part are fair with employs. Your yearly raise is pretty much asured every year in the mottnh of April. You have a yearly appraisal that they do take very serious. Attendance is very strict."
good,"Make sure all equipment was up and running"
good,Unhealthy enviroment but money was ok. Opportunities to add a training position to my skills to show others how to operate the machinery. Breaks were pointless as had to walk a fair way to canteen.
good,"Great work, and different challenges. Learned a lot about battiers and wiring. Training was very detailed, helped very much when it came to charging big and small battiers"
good,Good opportunity for growth in the industry of energy storage systems driven from top line management to be leaders in the industry
good,"The day would start by with the supervisor telling us which line we would be on and also what our targets are for the day, we would then check our machine to see if it is correctly set up before running it through the shift, ensuring we was on target or in front of target and encouraging other team mates that they would hit there targets, the hardest part about the job is when the machine goes down and playing catch up on target to make sure they are all met, making new friends and learning new things each day, at the end of the shift you have to make sure machines are clear for the next shift and ready for the next shift to come on and run a product."
good,"using a rotary grinder to shape welds to quality approved standards, maneuvering 50lbs-600lbs fork lift batter boxes on a conveyor, fixing imperfections in paint/welds on boxes with grinder and welder,"
good,No job security. I felt I gave a lot to this company and was given no real reason of why I was let go.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Enersys and was sorry that my job was eliminated. Most of the time, there was not enough work to keep me busy just as an Administrative Assistant, so I started helping out in other areas."
good,Fast paced environment.  Able to use my customer service skills in retaining customers.  Got government help to aid training costs on my own.  I loved the training aspect and that was what I was hired for.  The customer service manager position was very challenging with a work force that was not easily manageable.  The culture as difficult and set in their ways.  Difficult to change their procedures to do things more efficiently and with better results.
good,"When you are hired, after your 90 days you receive a cellphone, laptop computer, and company vehicle . Each day you drive to the worksite , complete your work, and return home or to your hotel, according to the location of the job site. Your time begins a half an hour after you leave your home or hotel, and ends a half an hour before you return."
good,"Installation of heavy batteries and I was away from home a lot  but the pay was ok.   "
good,"My primary role as an engineer is to support production. I could be a functioning alcoholic and do that job, so my ""free time"" is completely un-monitored such that I can pursue my own projects (AWESOME) and I do almost anything I want, with a reasonable budget, but...it comes at a price. I have zero technical support and no mentor and as a first year grad, that's not good. My manager's technical ability is far less than my own and we frequently do not report actual results to the corporate office because of the subsequent fallout that can occur from ""doing too good of a job with [insert program here],"" which could (would?) result in the reduction of manpower, which our operation desperately needs. "
good,"I was responsible for payroll, accounts payable, the general ledger, maintain the integrity of SOX reporting, all standard cost reporting, and monthly closing. A typical workday after close would be closing analysis to plant and corporate management. Payroll was on a bi-weekly schedule and maintaining the G/L and standard costs were a daily challenge."
good,"I enjoy everyone at this company that I work with, however, as a FHSU student that just graduated with a Bachelor's degree, there is no opportunity for advancement in this company."
good,I learned how to make batteries and assemble them. I enjoyed the people I worked with. And the hardest part of the job was testing the batteries because if they were bad you would have to open up the battery and find out what was wrong with the battery.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when your able get your work done and make your boss look good!
good,Ik heb een hele fijne tijd gehad bij EnerSys! Alleen hield het op vanwege m'n zwangerschap.
good,"My time at Enersys allowed me to advance and I loved my job. Enersys has been forced to make some cut backs, I unfortunatly fell in the cut. I believe Enersys to be a great company to work for. My only set back was with a few of the older staff managmanet who I felt did not want to nove the company forward.  I wish my peers at Enersys only the best and hope that they can once again bring up the sales."
good,"Its a good job, IF you are mechanically inclined and thrive in stressful environments this job is for you."
good,Be nice if they hired other then through a temp agency because the pay wasnt worth the task I completed and working for thw temp agency was taking most of the pay which is why they should hire good people like me that was able to do the job and keep hard at work and duties that were assigned to me
good,"I truly enjoyed working for EnerSys, Inc. However, the regional Sales Manager was seemingly not very people oriented and in fact came across as quite racist, unfortunately."
good,"A dar de alta a personal y bajas "
good,"Enersys was an alright place to work for. Basically each day I came in for work I got my start up test and machine ready for production. I was able to learn how to operate many of the machines there as well as how to fix various problems that would occur at times. My supervisor was a good boss. Easy to get along with and was pretty helpful. The work environment wasn't bad, i'm pretty easy going and get along with everyone so I never had any problems with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was probably making my co-workers smile when I could."
good,The staff was very friendly and really took care of their interns. They were always willing to help and made work enjoyable. Everyone felt like a family there.
good,"entreprise correct selon les postes d'affectation...rémunération dans la norme, ambiance générale satisfaisante."
good,Good co-workers making work go by fast.   Work environment is fast paced and stressful.  Management is a 3 out of 5.  A lot of micro management.  Annual raises are very poor.
good,"Nice and beautiful environment to work, greater mobility and long term perspective possible."
good,"EnerSys is a great place to work. Management is very encouraging and the staff is outgoing and helpful. Although I was only with the company temporarily, everyone was always so kind and very smart."
good,Enersys gives anyone an opportunity to work. I've worked there for eight years and enjoy it. I'm grateful they gave me an opportunity to work there.
good,Enjoyed the fast paced environment. Enersys has friendly co-workers and management. Good balance for all tasks needed to preform job tasks.
good,"At the menomonee falls enersys service center we fixed batteries for forklifts by taking voltages of all the cells, charge the battery and acid adjusting before we would test them on a load bank. The shop was small and there was only a few employes so everyone new each other pretty good. I like that for the time i was there i learned something new every day."
good,I liked the job. I learned how to set up over 100 batteries to get charge with one charger. Everyone was friendly and willing to help. The only downfall for me was that I was working by a temp agency with no benefits at all.
good,"In additional to personal responsibilities, spent a great amount of time learning in a shadowing capacity."
good,"Go in, do your job and everything's fine. managers have their favorites and tend to lack actually management skills with the rare manager or 2. Great benefits and pay. you accumulate lead in your blood system which requires you to have blood tested for the levels, amount of times per year depends on the level."
good,"Enersys was a wonderful place to work, and it had wonderful people to work with. On a typical day it was very easy to stay busy and on task. Some days were good and some days were bad, but in the end all the benefits made it all worth it."
good,"In a typical day you can work on a new model in CAD, help manufacturing engineer a second sourced part to fit properly and ensure the quality of the charger will be maintained."
good,Okay place to work. good healthcare. Nice people that arent management.
good,"pull orders get ready for shipping, rec. in new stock and repair work, learned how to work on batteries, co-worker we work as a team, keeping management happy"
good,"Good pay rate but horrible attendance points system for lates and sick days. Get 12 points total and termination. "
good,Overall I like working for the company. The people you work with are team focused.   Everyone wants to get the job done in a timely efficient manner. And SAFETY is always first.
good,I loved the people I worked with and it is and exciting industry.  Could stand to improve in training and corporate structure.  Severe management problems at the executive level.
good,A good place to work and people to work with.  I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge as it relates to different processes and product assembly.  I was exposed to automation that will benefit me in future jobs.
good,"Working at director / board level presenting the company, division and product portfolio. "
good,IT is a good company. production balance is not good .I think product manager and line feeding and balanves is not good.some times every body should work over time and some times is not to do. that is not good
good,"EnerSys is your typical factory setting. There are a number of positions available based on the amount of work one is willing to do, with continuous advancement so long as a position is available. However, salary is based purely on a pay-grade and is independent on ones history or employment history (I'm being paid the same as individuals who have worked there over thirty years). In my opinion, it's a great opportunity if viewed as a temporary solution."
good,"most days were quite enjoyable with various issues arising day to day."
good,"12 hrs 4on 2 off rolling a cnc lead strip mill and filling furnace"
good,"Every day was different in that we built different styles of batteries, even though the process was the same. I leardned how to drive alot of styles of forklifts and use torches. My co-workers was real nice although the management was nice in ways, but they always looked for ways to fire you instead of making the job better. The hardest part of my job was all of the heavy lifting and the best part of the job was the pay and the benefits."
good,It was a fun place where most people got along. I still miss it to this day. I was hired in after being out of work for two years and it got me back on my feet again.
good,The only thing about the job was travel. Great people to work with. My Boss took real good care of everyone. All and all it was a great job. The job was a great experienc
good,"In a typical day I will visit between 1-4 locations and work on their batteries and chargers. Sometimes doing preventive maintenance, and also doing troubleshooting and repairs."
good,"EnerSys was a great place to work, money was good, job was easy. But it seems as if every 3 or 4 years they go in a dry spell and have to lay people off, starting December 1st 2012 anyone that was not hired before Aug. 2010 got the boot, no matter how much you knew, or how hard you worked."
good,"Travail très prenant et très stressant, mais une équipe formidable, un supérieur plus que présent et des collègues dévoués au partage et à la formation. Produit spécifique à travailler, d'où le manque d'autonomie mais superbe expérience globalement."
good,I really enjoyed working there training the hourly employees how to become a very productive employee. I was a big part of management and that was a great feeling for me. The plant relocated and me and my family decided not to go with them.
good,Like all places it has it good points and bad points. All in all it’s not a bad place to work. Good points are: We get paid breaks plus we are on a shift where we get a week off every 4th week! And plenty of Overtime too. Bad points: Is the PPE you got to wear but after a few weeks you will get use to it. Also we have  blood test every 3 months to check our lead in blood count. And finally the canteen is absolutely rubbish.
good,The people I worked with were great.  However the executive level made some very poor decisions along the way and has cost many people their jobs.  I started on the factory floor and worked my way up into a salary position.  I loved the job that I did until all the changes that occurred almost daily making it difficult to perform my job adequately.
good,This is a great place to work sad to leave! It is not easy work you have to work hard. You have your blood drawn monthly depending what department due to heavy lead exposure.
good,It is a good job with great pay only thing i couldn't handle was being around the lead which did not react well with my body. You also had to take showers at the end of your shift and couldn't leave on lunch due to being contaminated.
good,"It was a productive place to work. Most coworkers were like family."
good,If i could i would go back to work there if i could i loved it loved my job an the pay was good if my wife hadn't got sick i would still be working there
good,"A typical work day would be arriving by 6:30 a.m. put on protective gear locate shipping and receiving sheets to determine what needs to be prioritize. I learned that it's very important to keep protective gear on so that lead levels won't go pass the job requirements. Management is very diverse are willing to sit and speak on issues that employees are encountering, work place culture is a mix of different nationalities, everyone gets alone well. I haven't found any hard parts to the job because I can confirm to just about any type of situation. The most enjoyable  part is being able to communicate with one another."
good,"EnerSys was a small group of people and family oriented. Good company culture and good leader, strict but that made all of us try harder and get the job done right."
good,"J'ai pu passer 6 semaines de stage au service méthode de la maintenance, j'ai eu l'occasion de travailler dans une ambiance très agréable ou j'ai pu mettre en pratique ce que j'avais appris lors de mes cours. Belle expérience..."
good,Pretty good pay rate and good co workers. temperatures get high and the work is pretty tough at first. once you get used to it its actually a good job.
good,Opportunity for job growth.  Hard workers rewarded.  Job flexibility available for those who earn it.  Work with people who have been in the industry for 25+ years; learn from their experience and become a part of a work-family
good,"Enersys was a great place to work, and made very good money through their incintive program.  The more our team did, the more money we made.  The lead was the only bad thing, had to have lead test monthly."
good,"Good company to work for. Management was good but training was lacking. Very good work force to deal with. A typical day at work included answering phones, inputting information, following up on things."
good,"Getting better. Plant manager is approachable and listens. New maintenance manager has had large impact on safety and machine uptime. "
good,i enjoyed working as a team member especially when relied on to take charge in certain tasks and resolving problems that occured.i also enjoyed working shifts and making friends .
good,a typical day at work was running the end of the production line which was a fast paced and enjoyable experience for myself .
good,"Its a good place to work, I left to go to school to become a lineman. If you like working inside that its a good place to work."
good,très bonne ambiance au sien de l'entreprise  je recommande
good,"I would review requirements for new equipment or replacement of obsolete equipment.  Create design and fabrication drawings.  Udate the bill of material and issue ECO's for new parts or changes.  I learned more about different materials and their reactions to acid and dionized water.  Management has just changed and I am not sure of the direction that will take place.  My co-workers are talented and competent and very easy to work with.  There is a lot of sharing of design iterations to come up with better solutions. The hardest part of the job when I got here was getting all the work done as a plant expansion was underway and there was much to get done.  Currently, the work load is much lighter and I am finding myself missing the urgency that was in my career here earlier.  I enjoy the fact that the plant I work at for Enersys is the company's largest and most profitable.  We also make a premium lead acid battery that is well know in the many industries that use them."
good,"Work from 7:00am to 3:30 pm daily with overtime when needed. Handled all aspects of inventory, day to day shipping and receiving and running the shop. Learned how to deal with customers on a daily basis. Management is very hands off until needed which sometimes could get a little difficult. My co-workers in the shop are great hard working guys who would help anytime needed. The hardest part of my job would be the smell from the batteries when charging. I am going to miss my co-workers the most. They made the days easier everyday."
good,Great company to work for. Great coworkers. Overall great experience. Excellent pay. Great Benefits. Great if you love to travel.
good,"I had to install and maintain backup batteries for various applications for hospitals, data centers, telecom and many more."

good,A good company with good benefits. Company Van health vision dental 401K and profit sharing!!! There is quite a bit of freedom here. As long as you do your job and not be a lazy person you can have a job for life. There are some slow times and you just have to drum up some of your own business.

good,I worked at enersys for over 12 years and made a lot of lifelong friends. I worked my way up from temp. to manager. the only con to working in this environment is the health hazards. the lead and acid are really hazardous to your health so you have to be extremely safe. the company goes to great lengths to ensure that your health and safety are #1.
good,El ambiente es perfecto para trabajar tanto como el aprendizaje
good,"When I did work their, it was great. All good people who were of blue collar status so to speak and were family. It indeed was a shame to see that company close it's doors."
good,"I loved working at EnerSys, i had only stopped working for this company due to a company wide Layoff, during the layoff the points system ad been changed and that is what had caused me to not be eligible for a call back, but other than that it is a really good place to work if you can get on, i will be getting ahold of them in the near future to see if i can continue my employment with them!"

good,"Working for Enesys was very rewarding and challenging, no two days were alike. The company provided a work vehicle and company laptop and cell phone.  A typical day,  there were no typical days.  Work days consisted of getting with the scheduler and completing paperwork, computer reports on the prior day completed work.  Management was very good and listened to the needs of the employees.  Co-workers were the best part of the job.  Due to the high skill level and variety of work everyone helped each other on day to day schedules and work loads when possible.  The most enjoyable part of the job was coming across different types of work, ATT, Verizon, Sprint. Time Warner, Military bases and Law Enforcement communications."
good,"My official job title was Assistant to the Service Coordinator at Enersys Inc. Some of my responsibilities included, creating templates for account payable clients, answering service requests, which is a request by the customer for us to perform our services to their battery or charger.  Another responsibility would be creating spreadsheets to list inventory products, rental inventory, loaner and demos batteries or chargers. My main responsibility was by using the program Baan in order to report the warranty on each sale and service work orders. This was very time-consuming because each order had many steps that you had to make sure it was entered correctly.  I had to make sure that a technician was going out to repair the product.  I needed to look carefully that if any warranty was left on the merchandise we turned those orders back to the factory so they get reimbursed with time and material.  "
good,Enjoyed my past ten years and have gained valuable knowledge!
good,"I enjoyed the accounting department and my coworkers. Month end"
