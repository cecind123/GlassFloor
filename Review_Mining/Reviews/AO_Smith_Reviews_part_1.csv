rating,review
bad,Worst Company on Earth! JC Tn. Management is clueless to what is going on and Supervision is middle school children. If I could tell you anything it would be to avoid this place like the plague!
bad,"Terrible management, rude an ignorant HR, the medical office is a joke. All in all they lie about caring for their employees safety and well being. Its a joke out there."
bad,Ok the ppl are cool to work with. However it's sad that a big company like that has to use a temp service to hire. Also its also sad they make temps work 5 months with only being able to miss 3 days. In my opinion if mgmt cant figure out if an employee is worth hiring in 90 days then they need a new job just saying. This company isn't the only one that does this. Lazy mgmt if you ask me.i admit I went over on my points allowed by one due to sickness and car trouble.things sometimes you cant control and was canned. They do this to temps when they have many full time ppl with greater attendance problems but oh well that's the way it goes.
bad,Never work here. Never work here.its a horrible place they don’t care about you or your family. It’s disgusting there. And the will throw anyone under the bus to get ahead.
bad,"What isn't broken? It all is. Lots of issues, company lacks empathy and is as cut throat as it gets. Worked my tail off for 3 years, to get fired without proof evidence and an issue that had been reported to direct management multiple times. Never did I have a warning or write up in all my time with the company, and was completely blindsided by it."
bad,"Payables, data entry, payroll . . . . . catering to incoming visitors for meetings, covering for receptionist, assisting in any area I could"
bad,"I was employed at A.O. Smith for 26 1/2 years, it started out as a fun place to work, but their focus changed to where you were told that you could be replaced at a moments notice, even if you were a senior employee like I was, I would not recommend working there at all unless you can deal with that kind of Environment."
bad,While there I saw some on my team with unlimited sick and other days off. Often their work had to be done by others ( me a lot). The training manager had no clue on how to run this 7  Person team. And relied heavily on intimidation and browbeating the workers a.super lenient on others
bad,Management clueless.100k a yr for group leaders to be stupid at their job. Employee get 9.50-14.00 an hour. I actually hated getting up and going to work. Rules for employees differ from the gods of management.
bad,Managers are unfair pick and choose their click only.  I've been there 10yrs with a degree and can't get promoted but so!some got a group leader position within 3days they are lazy
bad,"Poor managed, poor coordinated, hostile enviroment, very stressful workplace..It may be a very good ""company"" to work for but definetly not a good place( EL Paso DC) to work at....!!! And this is not said by only one employee. 60% of employees are not happy at this place...Must be reviewed in all aspects...urgent need of Supervisor and Lead change..!! Employees come and go frequently and cannot keep a good group of employees due to this..."
bad,"They have a bad turnover rate, they lay people off all the time, and reward hard work with even harder work and people that brown nose get easy jobs and are left alone."
bad,"They pay well and have decent benefits but other than that not a company you want to work for unless you already know someone there. You will deal with favortism, lack of management, and costant hounding to reach unrealistic goals. Their attendance policy is a joke and ridiculously unfair."
bad,"Depends on who you work with and what department you are in. Forklift drivers are constantly on the go. Next to no help so if you get behind, good luck. Dealing with people constantly walking out in front of you while driving. Some people who shouldn't even be on equipment. The only enjoyable part of my day is quitting time."
bad,"I was recently fired and although I was only a temporary, I didn't expect it. In fact I was confident I was doing well. I was told the reasoning was due to poor performance and that I just wasn't cutting it. It came as a shock considering how hard I worked there, how quickly I picked up every task they threw at me, but must importantly because no one told me that I was doing bad or gave me a chance to correct it. Even in only the month I worked there, I saw quite a few people not make the cut. I hope this isn't always the case for temps that work there and that I just had a bad experience but I thought I'd share what happened to me so that people that do plan on working there in the future does so with caution."
bad,"Not organized."
bad,Ao smith is the same as working on a plantation 98 machine operators black  all bosses lead men and 99.9 office people white  no black bosses extreme racism
bad,Cancel your contract for no reason. Management let's the  favorite people do whatever with our any repercussions. Temps work harder than full time personal and temps are not appropriated.
bad,"Avoid this place like the plague! The pay is okay, and the job can be a little stressful but the work environment is terrible! They have cliques like it is a high school instead of a job with adults. The management is terrible, and consists of back biters and people who pretend to care about your concerns, but will talk bad about you within their little circles. There are also people who aren't even in management that will try to boss you around and tell you what to do when it's clear they know nothing and get away with it just because they're friends with the supervisor. The pay again is okay, but not worth being made to feel as if your nothing. RUN FAR AWAY!!!"
bad,"This is a easy job, but it goes beyond work function. When you have leadership who act like the children you help raise it pretty much makes you not want to work here. "
bad,Very productive place to work at Ive learn alot while working there. I love the shift that i was place on and the salary. i thank them for giving me a chance
bad,"Great culture, Take amazing care of their employees, very stable and well established company."
bad,"its and alright place to work very hot in the summer but they compensate by bring you water extra time on breaks and things that will help cool you down good about giving rewards for goals reached, some management in departments is good some bad"
bad,"Growth of knowledge gain was limited. I want to gain more knowledge about power energy, and power instruments its working was not there."
bad,"This used to be a really good place to work before ao smith bought us. They don't care about the people, it's all about the money. They treat people like rubbish now, expecting more work for less money. "
bad,"Normally assigned to operate a machine press, but frequently reassigned to work other machines on other lines and shifts on a moment's notice without prior training."
bad,"high in potential but looses it when it comes to the mentality of ""just get it done"". all about friends instead of bettering the business. the supervisors are either biased towards people they like or not present. people breaking rules get free passes, others that do their job and show on time get pushed back. ""take care of each other"" is a huge issue. full time employees will bend backwards to bring people into the company that dont deserve or earn it all because they like them."
bad,Good place to work with the employees.  But have too many bad managers and poor safety practices. Need better opportunities for their employees for advancement.
bad,"The job was a little boring because it was a different day doing exactly the same thing as the day before, exactly the same thing from the week before. very tense work environment, odd work hours"
bad,"I looked at this company in terms of employment and it left much to be desired. It is a union shop and being a union shop the low pay was surprising. It was evident that working outside of this company I could earn a higher wage without paying union dues."
bad,"Not anywhere that you woudnt want to make a career out of ,not enough hours, you do not have breaks,and I work 6 days a week ,8 hours a day and only was getting paid 150 a week"
bad,"A very hot place to work. fast pace work learned to use air tools,paint parts to. management was ok co workers was great."
bad,Working at A.O Smith requires hard work and sacrifice. The hours are long and there's always mandatory  overtime. When your not working it's hard get anything  done because  you are plain wore down.
bad,the company doesn't really care about you. I lost the job because I had to choose from getting married to my wife or loose my job..no man should have to choose
bad,"This used to be a wonderful place to work, but current management is destroying the environment and morale of employees."
bad,There is not much room for home/personal life working there. They own you! You are expected to be a machine that never breaks down. But if you want to earn good money and don't mind spending most of your life there its a good place to wrk. They could use some improvement in the HR and mngmt depts. favoritism is obvious
bad,I did not have a pleasant review to write about AO Smith Water Products Company at this time considering my employment history with them and how I was treated.
bad,It's great if your not a temp if hired it's amazing other and that it's not bad just hard to balance work and personal life job is sometimes stressful
bad,it's not the best place to work just depends on what kind of work you want to do and what you are willing to do. the management needs more work they don't work well with you
bad,It was a good Job. But they didn't work with your life schedule. Maybe if I wasn't working through a temp service then I could of continued to work there.
bad,Very good people to work with. Have a favoritism thing going some can some can’t. Supervisor sucked . No support or training is not good and then if u mess up they will right u up.
good,They paid me decent for what I did there for work. But the company has lost its values and culture and I'm sorry but I got to tired of carrying that on my back like that for more then I did.
good,"Was fun for a while, then they moved production down south."
good,"I would have to say the company itself is an awsome company to work for, great benefits, and for the most part great people.  However there are a select few that make working their not worth the benefits.  Communication is only one direction, I never once had communication from my superiors without going to them."
good,"No hours for the drivers here and when there is work,its physically loading and unloading water heaters. The pay? $21.18 an  hour as per the union contract. That is the top rate and they pay it upon hire simply because no one wants to work for the starting contract wage of $16 and change per hour. You won't be getting a raise. Period."
good,"The culture and moral in the engineering lab was greatly affected by the poor management team. No one trusted anyone, there was no room for advancement. Project management was handled poorly as well as time management. Overall a very stressful and hostile environment."
good,"Minimal support from executive management to provide sufficient and knowledgeable resources that were required to achieve project goals and objectives.  Not known for 'walking the talk"".  Employee morale was generally low due to job security concerns.  The most difficult part of the job was assuring team members that they would not lose their employment if a process improvement eliminated a portion of their current position.  The most enjoyable part of the job was successfully completing the project."
good,"Easy work, co workers are weird and you can get fired for unforeseen medical/ personal time inside of the first year if you miss more than a three shifts"
good,"Too much turnover in upper management, no understanding of the work your department does. Did not allocate the time needed for training very reactionary instead of being proactive. You got the feeling that directors chose managers that they were ""friends"" with, did not hold them accountable in making decisions and keeping deadlines."
good,"Ao smith parts dep moving to franklin,tn. Hiring was put on hold. Other than that decent job,great people. Easy job,no room for advancement though. Hate it was moving!"
good,Management won't get the recourses to achieve daily goals. My department has been short staffed for over a year. We have to loan people to other departments.
good,The employees are not treated equally. The rules are changed depending on the situation. Some of the employees work very hard while others do close to nothing.
good,for someone who enjoys working in a goal oriented environment AOSmith is a wonderful employer.  I worked in QC checking to ensure the quality of the water heaters which were produced that day on the assembly line.  Hardest part of the job was shutting down production to correct imperfections with a series of new product because management rarely takes such things with grace.
good,If you like to work and have no family this will be ideal place for you.The hours are horrendous you will hardly have time to do anything ecspecially on second shift.
good,It is an ok place to work. The job is dirty and it is very fast paced. The factory life is a lot of gossip. People are always in your business and try to get problems started.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work depending on your job and what your expectations were. It has put food on the table for lots of families and does provide decent benefits for you and your dependents. I personally just got bored working there. But it is a factory and that type of work just isn't for everybody.
good,Not the best place nor the worst place to work hours fluctuate and if a supervisor says something happened then that is how it is no matter if you can prove them wrong with witnesses
good,"The company feels like family and everyone is always there to help you out. They encourage cross training and to apply to other internal departments. Part of the company is paid salary while the other is paid hourly through a union. I have worked at the company for 7 months now and really enjoy it. You are paid every Friday, they have a pension plan, benefits and a reimbursement program for night school."
good,"Fair benefits, and pay. They do quite a bit of extra curricular activities for the employees, and give away shirts, food, etc quite often.  That said, to be an hourly employee is to be at the mercy of their overtime. Do not believe their hype about a work life balance because if you punch their clock, you will be punching it often."
good,The pay and benifits along with the shifts are the only thing good about it. No room to move up and managment skills are lacking.
good,It was a great source if income at that time in my life several years ago before they sold out and moved to Mexico pay was alright I guess for that time period with plenty of overtime pay and double time pay which I think more places at this time should offer dbl time pay as well  but times change as so do the company in present time
good,"It is a good place to learn but it is hard to get promoted. "
good,Overall it a good place to work its better if your young hours are long it's a rotating schedule and always mandatory overtime and it's unbelievably hot  in there
good,Never intended to retire or anything from here. Don't think they treat employees that great. Management doesn't interact with floor shop workers. A tense vibe.
good,"AO Smith is an OK place to work, the pay is really good. The management is very rude. they always played favoritism. The pay isn't worth the stress of management"
good,"a typical work day"
good,A typical day at work consists of dealing with a boss that is unpredictable at best while managing to produce quality material. The working conditions are safe and clean. My supervisor is disrespectful and rude. The plant manager is nonexistent and provides no support to the facility.
good,"AO Smith is a good place to work if you value an environment where your co-workers are supportive and fun to work with. However, there is little room for upward mobility and a clear distinction between management and staff. Definite lack of communication and not good pathways for airing employee concerns. Pay is fair to poor."
good,"You were paid good but management was not the best."
good,Was not greatest place to work.  My desk was a table in a hallway that contributed to the stress of my joints and helped to hasted my arthritis.  Management does not understand the nature of IT and how work flows.
good,"There's a lot of Ready-Fire-Aim at AO Smith.  Projects are underestimated and we received new requirements well after internal testing had begun.  AO Smith also allows for tribal-knowledge-hording, with one of the worst offenders being someone I had to deal with constantly.  Even though my architecture recommendations were followed, things got dicey getting other developers to stay on the design and not revert to an anything goes development pattern."
good,"Residential support Supervisors and 1 team lead not very helpful.  They talk down to you.  Could be a great place to work, if leadership showed more compassion and more helpful.  Great 5 week training course.  1 downfall of training is, you get no formal training on the computer.  When you get put on the floor for calls, you're thrown in  with little help.  1 team lead is great at showing support and praising for a good job done."
good,"Good company as i am concerned great ethics employee supportive"
good,a typical day at work would be to come in and check th parts in the punch press to make sure the press was running right and then start up the press.  Some days it was easy to make production and other days it was not to due the fact the presses were really old and broke down alot.
good,My work day would start at 5:00 am and end at 2:30 pm. My job was to sand blast top and bottom heads and also pipes for the water heaters the company makes. i enjoyed the job because it was physical and steady the heads would be about 30 pounds and they would come on a 40 piece rack and the pipe would come 100 in each  ben. I would do about 6 bens a day and about 7 racks a day which was probably the hardest part of the job. I worked around a lot of good people very hardworking. i learned how to stay determined  and be on time everyday.
good,it was interesting place to work. i learned how a hot water works and what it took for it to run. stock numbers and what it took for it to ship out.
good,Lots of overtime to work on hot or cold days. Pay is very good. People are very friendly.
good,Frustrating place to work if you want to try to change anything or make a difference
good,"- working on the AS400 program for pulling orders for dock workers, completing and locating inventory, completing all reprots to submit to management, vice president and president of plant and company"
good,"Zero work/life balance. Management is hit or miss depending on who you end up working under. Good pay and benefits. Coworkers are for the most part good hardworking people. If you have a family its a good place to earn a living, but you will never see your family. They work mandatory overtime almost every week and weekend. I was getting one day off a month for the last 5 or 6 months I worked there. If you're single or just like to work all the time its a good place to make money. Biggest con for me is no time off for family."
good,"I need less hours... Days driving into Toronto to stressful, need more time out side the city or not in Toronto at all. This is a good company but to many hours. My boss is great."
good,"•	Successful Launch Viper SRT-10 with ZB platform for a 185% volume increase in 7/03."
good,Good job but with no room for advancement. Repetitive work and hard labour depending on your position. Very old equipment to work with and can be very dirty. But nice people and was in town so very convenient.
good,A good company with 5 day working . manufacturer of water heater and water purifier.  No one company in  water heating products . so many scope to improve for management .
good,"A. O. Smith’s tagline is “Innovation Has A Name” but that only applies to water heaters. With respect to systems, processes, and programs, they are a typical slow-paced manufacturing company. If you want to be leading edge in your career, this is probably not where you want to be."
good,"This job was simple for the most part seeing as I boxed water heaters. However, management was not the best and job security was the worst. Truly I did not learn much here. The hardest part was work in the facility with no A/C, it was always extremely hot."
good,I enjoyed working there. over time was always offered. however I was laid off for a while along with many others. a typical day at work was clock in get started. team leaders came around to check with everyone which I think is a good idea. my co-workers were very friendly but again it was a place where everyone had to work to get things accomplished.
good,"Programming CNC machinery, "
good,"I can't describe a typical day as I had many different jobs and had the opportunity to advance into them which was fantastic.  It was here I first learned how well I could work on my own and produce in volume!  The workplace culture left a little to be desired though as people behaved in a manner that was more like high-school, something I'd rather forget. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers in the second-to-last position I held before our jobs were taken to China.  I worked with some good people!"
good,Good pay and benefits. Very family friendly. Lots of overtime. Large company with several other plant in other countries. Modern facility with more innovations on the way. Having to deal with the manufacturing to fill customer orders can be hard to do some times.
good,Very healthy professional work culture. Learned lots of thing here.
good,"Good place for the pay but like other places it has it good and bad days,I believe in everyone treated fairly . There is a lot of things that go on and incorrectly say we go by the policy book."
good,This is a job that calls for you to be strong mentally and physically. They tend not to pay properly and when confronted will not fix the issue. They don't care if you have physical issues with heat etc... Only thing that matters is how many heaters go out the door.
good,"Pay was good, However, nepotism makes it a difficult place to advance and makes a very easy job difficult. Keeping clear of typical office drama will help you last longer."
good,Good job...decent management...great workforce... unfortunate set of circumstances lead to plant closing after more than 100 years.
good,"running the lines"
good,"Stressful at time but the pay was very good but it seems a lot of the time you're higher ups won't do anything for you, Mostly Laziness.Most of the time the people you work with are goingto be easy to get along with."
good,Learning how to weld and the inspection of welding and procedures was a good experience of how a production line or system worked.
good,it was a good job upuntill they moved to mexico i washed motors in varnish and then baked them then i drilled them then tested them then packed them and then took them to shipping
good,Good company to work for. They offer a great deal of training and opportunity to advance. They are very strict about the use of company time and have many policies in place.
good,"I loved working at AO Smith and wish I had never left.  However, I left because I wanted to try to advance into management.  The management I worked for was great."
good,I was able to run my own tests and be responsible for the work that i was doing. There were many opportunities for learning and growing. Full Time staff was always will to aid with questions.
good,"Work day : Usually have multiple projects going on at the same time."
good,liked my job. meet some great people there. the company was a good place to work. the company put back into the community. there could be times you would have to work a lot of hours per week.
good,"Day to day a good company to work for its just the supervisor and some of the people i deal with I do not want to continue to work for."
good,"Very fast paced environment with friendly people.  Work volume was high, and employees did many jobs besides there own."
good,busy place keep you on your toes at all the time. one of the leaders in fiberglass manufacturing
good,it is an assembly line.  you work hard but get good pay and great benefits.
good,This was a perfect place to receive engineering experience while still in school.  They challenged the interns to solve real world problems that couldn't be learned in the class room.
good,We did the installation of the new frame lines. Management treated everyone as a valued employee.
good,I liked working their. It was a good place to work with good pay and hours. The people that worked their was friendly and always wanted to help others that needed help
good,"I worked for the Powder Coating Department of A. O. Smith. The job requires excellent time management skills and a Forklift Certification. The training given by the full-time employees there are awful. However, the job itself is pretty straight forward. I was able to be shown one time what I had to do and was running my station and others by the end of the shift. You maintain a smelter pushing 2300 degrees so the job is hazardous and the material is glass so the factory is quite dusty. The job isn't for everyone and anyone at the plant will tell you that."
good,Great benefits. Friendly environment. Co-workers always willing to help. Good working conditions. Upgraded technology to keep up skill levels. Wages are low. Paid time off is not generous.
good,"For the most part, AO Smith is a good company to work for. The benefits are great for the employees,  including 401k retirement plan.  With the exception of only a couple of office workers, it's a great company. It's a great environment and the employees get along."
good,"A Typical Day At Work "
good,Typical day of work at this location was heavy lifting from one line to another. Repetitive work easy to do as long as the line wasn't baked up. Didn't really get to converse with other employees due to working on the line as one person only. Management was very easy to get along with as long as you were doing you job.
good,I enjoyed most about this job is the ability to have security of the company. Wages were competitive and very reliable. The location was ideal to where I stayed in the beginning. I moved to Clarksville while working here.
good,AO Smith was a good place to work. Making production attainment with a lack of employees to staff the various jobs. The relationships that was built with the employees.
good,"A O Smith company is Productive & fun Workplace in my life, also enjoy my life. We have always remind this pride in my life. My sinear  are very great person, These are always support me every time."
good,"Worked there for thirty four years starting when it was State Ind, when working in Service engineer ,manager in order to keep from getting in trouble made up lies to have me terminated, was also told I would receive severance package which I never received which was also planned ahead."
good,a typical day consisted of some fabricating but mostly welding from where first shift had done all the fabricating or putting plates on coworkers were nice
good,Each day was met with individual challenges that were met with a group effort. The product of effective teamwork was exemplified on a daily basis. Each team member was reliable and consistent in their willingness to help anyone with any problem.
good,"I learned how to be responsible and take matters in my own hands. People there were friendly, There was always other jobs you could transfer to. The pay was good."
good,"1.It is a good place for learners  "
good,"Teamwork. Teamwork is essential. Co-workers were fun, friendly and extremely helpful. Hardest part of the job was when the production line had numerous problems. It made for a long, slow day. Enjoyable part was when you found out at the end of the day that even though there were issues the line still ended up making quota."
good,i operated a vertical boring lathe and built and did final test on electric motors.
good,"Worked a lot of overtime. At the time I was employed there was a need for management change. "
good,"People very friendly and the company does care about you! "
good,A.O is not a place to work if you are not used to a fast paced environment. You work on assembly lines and there is no time to play around when the lines are turned on. It’s not a place to be if you are not used to hard work. It can be dirty depending on what job you have.
good,"The day to day operations are great if you fit in with their clicks.  If you just want to work, play in the drama then you will fit in perfectly; If you want to make a difference be prepared to give the best years of your life."
good,I started off working on the line and learned several different positions . I seen people advance but my time there was cut short after I enrolled in college. A nice place to work but the drive was long from clarksville.
good,"AO Smith is good place to work and learn with free hand from the supervisor it will help us for  development in decision making.  "
good,"I highly enjoyed working at A.O. Smith. The typical day was fast paced and pretty peaceful. The other employees and I were like family and we looked out for each other. "
good,"> A typical day is laid back and we do our work as we have it "
good,"Working as a temporary employee for AO Smith, my job was to last only six to eight weeks. I was surprised that it lasted nine months instead. From a temp employee's point of view, it was a fun friendly, and generous employer."
good,AO Smith is an outstanding company to work for. There are plenty of opportunities with the right education and background.
good,"Worked their for three years and only got 10 weekends off. Work/life balance not good."
good,"Go to work in the am, and go home before dark.  Most weekends off great benefits.  The company creates water heaters.  You have to be able to lift, and work with others very well."
good,"Validate Production and inception reports."
good,It was a great place to work...Great people...made good money...just didn't work out for me
good,"passing out loads to the dock workers to get trailer loaded for drivers waiting in trucks or picking up from yard"
good,"I use to work at ao smith in mcbee,sc I really enjoy working there some ups&downs but overall great place to work"
good,"Typically worked 9 hours a day and 5 days a week. Managed Lean Managers at 16 plants. Also managed Material Managers at 11 plants. Our team was always saving the Company money. We worked hard, but had fun in the process. Told my team that if they weren't having fun, then they were doing something wrong."
good,I thought I was going to retire from here. But they moved their business to the USA. I actually enjoyed going to work every day. They trained me on ABB robots which I enjoyed alot
good,"My time at A.O. Smith was spent full of hard work but great people, my coworkers really made the job something to look forward to, it was a good environment to work in."
good,I was with A.O Smith for 11 years. I liked my job most days. I left for the chance at bettering myself. It's a hard job but a good job. Hard work pays off there.
good,"fun, fast paced, sometimes stressfull job. learned to multi task, learned to work on different jobs. people fun to work with. worked close with supervisor. do and turn in paper work to supervisior every hour."
good,"Freindly atmosphere with plenty of opportunity for advancement. Started out as a assembler went on to get some machine and welding experience and finished with getting my G2, and for the last ten years have enjoyed working in the feild and helping to develope new products"
good,"A dedicated and experience Warehouse Specialist, with over 6 years of experience and a proven track record when it comes to running a warehouse. I have knowledge of daily operations and the flow of inventory control, shipping & receiving, and safety management. Maintains positive relationships with customers, coworkers, and superiors. Also, capable of working well with others or alone to complete task. Aiming to leverage my skills to successfully fill the Warehouse role at your company."
good,AO Smith is a great company to work for. I would highly recommend working for the company. I enjoyed the work and my  senior coworkers were always helpful.
good,"Decent place to work,competitive pay. the hours are steady and the work is consistent. Management could be a little more hands on."
good,Great  Co  the commute was long. Love working with one another. We were more like Family . As a planner received all kind of respect from the carriers.
good,it is a very clean and safe workplace. there are a wide variety of people working here and it is very diverse. people are very helful and you learn a lot of different things and jobs
good,"The day would start at 5am and finish when the daily duties were done. Learned scheduling to supply customer needs. There are a lot of great, hard working people."
good,Assisting customers with emergency repairs and assisting project managers with sourcing new equipment and installers.
good,I sold motors here. Good place to work. Fair management. Pay is below marker level.
good,Good work environment that has proficient management. Have to able to work a good pace to keep up with factory production. Co-workers supervisors work hard to get product right the first time.
good,it was a nice place to work friendly people and they helped you the best way they could
good,"This is one of the most generous, people focused companies I have ever worked for. They truly care about their employees and go the extra mile to keep them happy."
good,"If you're not afraid of hard work and will show up on time, so smith could be right for you. The pay, benefits and people are all great. And they will let you bid out for another position after 6 months if you decide you don't like where they put you. Moving up can only go so far if you don't have a degree though, so that's something to keep in mind if you're wanting a supervisor position eventually."
good,"I was mostly able to keep to myself and as long as I got my work done, I was okay. Training was a bit odd, as I had five people trying to show me how to do one thing five different ways.... and they were all wrong."
good,Alot of playing on the lines lead on line one nights create end plays alot. I think his last name is williams you have the safety lady nora taking pictures while line is running safty issue. The coordinator andrea is playing with the workers her phone is always out and its not being work related down in tank end the assembly manger was in jail for spouse abuse. I think his name is joe. Employees are scared of joe
good,you will be moving constantly but all in all it is a good work place to be in they pay good now an they have excellent benefits once you get hired on an you get paid every week
good,"Wonderful place to work, I enjoyed this job so much, I stayed for about 10 years reporting directly to my supervisor. My machine shop skills and training really paid off. The Company went thru a downsizing and I lost my job after 10 years."
good,"I never thought I would be working for a water heater company but it really has been such a great opportunity for me. I have been challenge by learning the industry and the products. "
good,"AO Smith brought me on as a temp, and within 3 months I was full time with benefits. Its the type of company where little things like showing up on time everyday, relying heavily on hard work and low on excuses is rewarded. Constant job openings are posted with more then enough opportunities to move up. There was zero tolerance for anyone who was anything less then dedicated and punctual. Goals had to be met on a regular basis and sometimes that required staying late and putting forth extra effort, and you were most certainly rewarded for it. Water Heaters , Tanks , and Gauges had to be properly calibrated, tested , labeled and shipped properly with a slim margin for error."
good,"Loved to have stayed with company, took custody of nephew and had no babysitter until 3 A.M."
good,"-Supervisores muy bien capacitados y muy atentos."
good,"It's not a desk job.  You may be sitting or standing in one place for a time, installing a particular component on each unit or you may be pulling jackets and parts off the paint line.  you may be moving heavy tanks onto skids or hanging them on the conveyor line.  Whatever job you start on, there will be physical demands as with most industrial labor jobs, but the wages and benefits are worth it.  The heat and noise can seem a bit much at first, but if you like factory work with good pay, this may be the job for you."
good,"This is a very good company to work for.  They really care about the customer in a multitude of  ways.  They have a large focus on training and continued education to always offer customers the best, and most accurate information.  Team work and relationships are fostered, not just within each department, but throughout the company as whole.  A friendly atmosphere is promoted and maintained.  Up to date equipment and technology is available to help keep the company and the information provided cutting edge.  Management listens to employee concerns more than expected in a corporation of this size.  The benefits package revels any in the industry.  The different schedules available make it easy for any family/person to work with.  You actually don’t mind waking up and going to ‘work’."
good,"Over all good, i learned many things in this company with lot of supports from internal team."
good,"▪	Provided assistance in positioning parts and subassemblies bu using templates or reading measurements."
good,"I worked for A. O. Smith for 17 years and loved it.  I would have retired from  AO if I could have. Maintaining strong fiscal responsibility and strong balance sheet meant making the tough decision to close my facility so I could not stay, unfortunately, but I had a wonderful experience while I was there.  Recommended highly."
good,"Overall great job. Biggest issue is the heat in the summer! If you can survive that, it's definitely worth it. Get a little dirty depending on where u work. You can bid on a job every 6 months once rolled over. Great starting pay. And car pooling for surrounding cities!"
good,Enjoyed the ability of job advancement within company. Pay rate was average and the enviroment was okay.
good,Kept track of incoming parts.
good,i worked through insight global  so i was not a full time employee so i did not receive any benefits and did not have vacation time. I believe this is a great place to work if you have a opportunity
good,Assisted administration office duties to two department managers. I learned about certain software. Worked as a team. The hardest part of my job being shared between two managers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the advancements.
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar , pero ahy un tope de puestos para personas capacitadas ."

good,This was a great place to work and most likely if they was still there I would have been there. The best part I liked about the job was learning to use all the various tooling and guages
good,"Buena escuela, con buenos planes de desarrollo, buen ambiente"
good,"Currently Regal Beloit."
good,AO Smith is a company that anyone in the industry would enjoy working for. There is a great deal placed on always improving your sales skills with them.
good,I worked at this company for 22 years and we worked well together. I thoroughly enjoyed it and retired from that company.
good,I would come in set up machine and start running the machine if I ran out of sheet meta before the tow motor driver I would either have to find a tow motor get it my self or wait on him the messed with my number if machine would go down if maintenance wasn't available I would see what was wrong and if it was a easy fix I would fix it or I would have to wait and tell them what part you need
good,"A typical day at work starts at 6:00 am and ends at 2:45 pm. My forklift operator's job is to move product from one location to another location safely and securely. This is done through the manipulation of the forklift controls and toggles. This includes the loading or unloading of a trailer,or other storage unit. It is my responsibility to perform routine inspections on the forklift to ensure its safety and to ensure it is capable of performing the job required. My personal qualities are basic reading and writing skills. The hardest part of the job is making space for items where there is none and the most enjoyable part of the job is getting everything accomplished."
good,"Job is easy, pay decent. It is a sewing circle so watch your back.Production manager is the worst!!! She will belittle you, talk down to you and I've seen her make some girls cry.I worked there 6 years and if it wasn't for HER I'd still be there."
good,"Really enjoy working here, but the cutback the regular employees get while temporary employees are still working doesn't help.  It would make more sense to get rid of temporary employees to allow the full time regular employees to make their hours."
good,Great team less the Plant Manager (no longer there) who drove off all of the staff at the two locations he controlled. Plenty of new equipment and support from upper management. I loved working for AO.

good,Un poco sucias las áreas de trabajo pero su ambiente de trabajo es muy relajado
good,"I took tanks out of the furnace, and supplied them to the bottom press for further production. The management was awesome, and the pay was good. the worst part about the job was the physicality."
good,"Management is good"
good,One of the best companies I worked for.  The company provided an excellent work environment and the means to grow with the company.  I had a great boss who took great interest in my career.
good,"I didn't get to work here long, because they thought I had more leadership in me than line work but had no opening for that.  I loved working on the line with my coworkers.  Most enjoyable part is when we finally rolled off 500 frames in one day (which was the first time ever) and management came out and shook our hands. Hardest part was saying goodbye."
good,"I been able to work in every department at AO Smith, which has provided me to grow with the company. Ive learned how to work the various machine in the department to cut the medal to make water heaters that are well known in a typical home or business.    Coworkers are like family.  Hardest part is coming in 2nd shift and ready to work but machines may be down from 1st shift but I will come in to help get the machine fixed so we can produce more product to satisfy our customers."
good,Left due to economy. Enjoyed my work and the people. Got good experience. Hated to leave.
good,i was laid off due to a plent closure.i liked my jobs and the people i worked with.many of the people i worked with have moved on to somewhere else or another state

good,"Working for aosmith through Teleperforamance is a wonderful experience. A job that has great response to its employee's needs and a wonderful environment. At 9hr it was the first company to really take a shot and hire me, and they were not disappointed. Currently employed for a year I am already responding to emails/fax, esculation call backs, and doing my part to help new agents on the phone. I am also one of the few to be trained to handle special calls that require specific training to take. I have a healthy relationship with my supervisors and fellow agents in this fast paced call center."
good,Wonderful company everyone is nice management is good fair work area on moving up yearly raise good vacation hours overtime is nice easy environment to work in
good,A.o smith is a great company to work for. I will recommend anyone who likes to work to work here. They take care of their employees. I have was at A.o smith 2 years and was permoted to a different building to help out with a more rewarding task. The benefits are awesome as well.
good,The company is a good stable company and they provide a lot for their employees.   But because of low turn-over its hard to move around within the company.  That’s good on the one-hand but can lead to burn-out on the other.
good,Hard working conditions but worth it. It's a factory with no central heat  or air but that's the game. Plenty of opportunity for advancement and great schedule.
good,"A.O Smith Water Heaters was a great experience and amazing staff, well communication within departments, teamwork effort resulting in great friendships and support. Production line required speed and self challenge but in the end gave great motivation an confidence, wage was amazing during and after probation period, top out pay at $19.00 hour within your first year. Learning water heater step building was amazing and discounts for all employees. Manager took the time to get to know every new employee and gave out birthday lunch time to discuss any ideas or opinions, communication meetings before every shift. A.O Smith gives everyone a chance to exercise their skills in different stations also while learning different jobs to swap for emergency replacement making employees feel involved. Great experience, highly recommended."
good,"Entraba a las 7 am era un lugar tranquilo el edificio no era muy grande era un trabajo agradable muy rutinario en aquel entonces 1996 creo, ya no me acuerdo el sueldo era bueno entre como suplente temporal,no pude seguir trabajando despues porque mi hijo de 5 tenia problemas de salud."

good,"The 1000+ co-workers are wonderful, there is an awesome environment and culture here. The work is very rewarding and you will always learn something new.  I know first hand that if you apply yourself you can grow in this company quite rapidly."
good,"I worked through Aerotek, was contracted on to handle their inbound calls for technical support. AO Smith deals with water products, mainly water heaters, but 1% of the products they support are water pumps. The end users and technicians are generally nice, but a water heater's a kind of appliance that is, in most circumstances, forgotten until it breaks. And when it breaks, and they call in, they're late for something or had just taken a cold shower, or just had a part of their house flooded. It takes a level of patience to deal with people who've just had their day turned around. On the other hand, providing excellent service turns their day around too. Oftentimes the news may not be satisfactory (product is out of warranty, there's no fix until it's up in code, labor may not be included, etc.), being knowledge and helpful goes a long way."
good,"I enjoyed working at AO Smith, and recommend this job to anyone."
good,"I started at A O Smith when I was 18 years old in the shipping department. I started at the lowest job and when they moved I was the traffic, shipping and warehouse manager.

good,A typical day was to stand on a assembly and wait for the motors to come to youu so they could be inspected or repaied .That some people don't like team work.The managers know that it was a hard job and they tried to make it fun .We were mixed from people all over the world and I loved it ...Hardiest part was standing for 10 hours sometimes..The best part was when we had study meetings
good,"I had an amazing time working at A.O. and learned a lot about how an assembly line actually works, along with learning the ins and outs of water heaters, big and small. If I could go back, I would in a heartbeat."
good,"I have been working in mixed service centers for the last 5 years and I have a very good expenditure in terms of Ro and Geyser."

good,I really loved working for A O. Smith it was just a temp position so I didn't work there for too long. You have to be quick it's very fast paced. You had plenty of breaks there and everyone I worked with was nice. The pay is definitely worth it. But you definitely work for your pay.

good,i liked the company it self but the employees themselves were not the best people to work around a lot of pros and cons to the job that i don't want to get into
good,Ao Smith is a family oriented based factory. There all about meeting there numbers for the day. It gets pretty hot inside but they have everything you need to make sure you stay coo throughout the day. Starting at 14$ id recommend this job to anyone

good,"Fresh out of college I needed a job and it turned out to be a great opportunity. Management is engaging and great, extremely supported and goal driven."
good,"A typical work day for me is being at the line at six o'clock sharp ready to work. Since I've been at A.O Smith I've learned to be a better worker, to be in a fast paced environment,and being a good communicator with fellow co-workers. In our facility I'd like to say that our management definitely cares for their people, whatever we may need, whether it be about work or personal, they're there to help.The hardest part about my job is the heat that comes from the parts we make, we do alot of welding and some parts go through an oven type machine, the most enjoyable part would have to be the people i work with, they make the time go by very fast, and it makes work fun and easier."
good,"I really enjoyed working at A.O. Smith.  I learn alot.  Although the position was temporary, it was a pleasure working with the organization."

good,I love the way all employees here worked together. The supervisor was a great person to deal with and the work itself was fun.
good,"I was in charge of building data acquisition carts. Typically, I would arrive to work at 6:30 a.m and would begin work on panels to be put into the carts. I stuffed and soldered the circuit boards and learned basic trouble shooting skills needed when problems arose such as finding where problems started and alterations needed to fix them. The management and co-workers were all very professional and respectful toward me and each other. The most difficult part of the job was the heavy lifting of the carts but with the teamwork of the employees there was always someone willing to help. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to build something from start to finish and know that I was part of a team.This was truly the best company I have ever had the pleasure of working for."
good,"AO Smith purchased Magnetek motors and then built the brand, got greedy and moved the company to Mexico to save money. The quality of motors coming out of Mexico was not as anticipated and it was forced to close. (best of my knowledge). It does still have a few AO Smith's in the U.S. but not many."
