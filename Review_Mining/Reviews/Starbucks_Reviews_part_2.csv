rating,review
good,"the staff is good everyone helps each other and you get to meet wonderful guests, you should take the time to get to know them while you make their coffee"
good,Fun work environment. Learned a lot about different coffees. Was treated with respect and I was trained very well.  I would recommend Starbucks as a great work place.
good,"Starbucks was a decent job that came along when the timing was convenient.  I had been working at another job that was unwilling to work with my college schedule, and needed something a little more accommodating. The relatively accommodating schedule, combined with benefits for full time employees (20+ hours a week) and close proximity to my home at the time made the job a no-brainer. It was not a job I ever saw myself at long term, but it got me through a handful of tough years while the job market was at a lull. It also afforded me the time I required to focus on my studies and artwork."
good,"I started in 2008 and the company has changed a lot. It's difficult to pay bills on the salary that I made there, but I love working for the company itself so it's bittersweet."
good,"This is a very fast place to work, great people, with great benefits. My manager is very supportive. Starbucks has very clear standards but it depends on how they are interpreted by the manager it can be complicated if you go to other stores."
good,"A place where you can grow in the company, just need to have some confidence in yourself. Coffee knowledge, every step you grow in the company they will provide training. Fun work place where you can chit chat with customers, the hardest part is that you need to ensure the consistency of the store cleanliness and quality of product and to ensure that their is no expired product being carried in the store. To much audit in a year and very strict where yo can get a warning letter if you fail to meet the compliance. Great team to work with."
good,A good place to work and engage with the community you are serving. Possibilities for advancements are usually available if you exhibit desired traits.
good,Work was always super fast paced. Everything had to be spotless all the time and you had to be good at memorizing how to make all the drinks. You are very team oriented. I learned better customer service. I loved that I worked at a Starbucks close to home so it helped me become closer to my community. Management was great. My manager was the nicest most hard working boss I had ever had. I was a supervisor and I did know a lot of the things going on in the store. There were times where there was some issues with all the supervisors. People were not in the same page and would have a lot of conflicts. Hardest part of the job is having to run a whole floor without having enough employees. Having a line out of the door with a 3 man floor was brutal. Most enjoyable were the coworkers and also the customers that make the experience so much better.
good,"This is more of a restaurant style barista job. Making coffee was fun, but the rest was stressful and unnecessary. The benefits were amazing though. I left because it was too stressful!"
good,"it was a fun place to work although at the specific place I worked at inside of a Safeway, my manager wasn't the best and always put herself before everyone else and was pretty rude about it but it seems like it is pretty fun at other places."
good,Starbucks offers you a good learning curve. You are not thrown into the fire without being given resources to help you be prepared. The support you receive from seasoned employees makes it easy to get acclimated to the fast paced work flow.
good,"This particular store grew a culture of family and it was a joy working with my co-workers. The customers were interesting , as we were in a rough part of town. Our team strived to bring the best customer service, and we were rewarded consistently from our district manager"
good,The work is fun. You meet a bunch of great people. Some customers become friends or future employers. Coworkers become friends. If you like doing easy tasks while having fun this is the job for you.
good,"Retail and sales goals are given priority, customer experience is valued much higher than the experience of the employees (partners). Good benefits. In charge of day to day operations, as well as placing baristas in roles and managing breaks and workflow. Customers can be extremely demanding and often times rude. Store manager was great, but higher up district and regional managers seem very disconnected from what an actual day is like at the store level."
good,"Takes about 6 months to get decent at the job, maybe longer if your not closing. Being closing shift you learn quicker since you do every position with only 1 or 2 other people."
good,This was my first place of employment and I stayed there nearly 5 years. There's room to grow and the overall culture is pretty positive. I would highly recommend this job to any younger person trying to get their foot in the door.
good,Starbucks is a great company and has great benefits for all employee! The work is easy and most of the customers are fantastic! It's a great place to meet new people.
good,"Most of our days were very busy, i learned how to make lattes and flat whites with perfect foam. It's actually quite interesting once you get the hang of it"
good,Fast pace job with great health benefits and lots of perks. Very customer oriented and community based job. Starbucks also has a great college program.
good,"This job has been a fantastic place to grow and learn, as I finish my bachelor degree the company has allowed me to enjoy my life as a full time student, uncle, brother, and son. It would be nice to earn enough to live but the benefits are certainly above board."
good,Workplace culture is immature and full of unnecessary politics. A typical day is very routine. Management enforces rules to everyone equally. The  hardest part of the job is workplace drama. The most enjoyable is getting to know customers and employees in your department.
good,The job itself is fun; the coworkers you will have will most likely be wonderful. But the way that management and corporate pleases every difficult customer is ridiculous.
good,"I loved my job at Starbucks. It was a great place to work while in school. Unfortunately, my manager moved to another store and we were without a manager for 3 months. One of the shift leads did a great job at keeping us together as a team. When our replacement manager arrived, the work became unpleasant and no longer fun. Her constant discouraging remarks lead me to leave the company. A few other co-workers left as well. I hope that place gets better because overall starbucks is a good company to work for."
good,The manager was rarely ever there. Training was awful. They didnt teach you anything about making drinks or learning the cashier etc. Customers were rude but that is to be expected at Starbucks.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you have a lot of energy and optimism. You need to be able to multitask and deal with difficult customers regularly.
good,The staff was friendly. An in depth insight was gained into the daily lives of Baristas. Faced paced environment. Hardest part was fulfilling customer orders during rush hours.
good,"Every day consists of plenty of interacting with customers and making sure that they leave happy. Besides the heavy attention towards the customers, baristas tend to make sure the store is spotless."
good,"Starbucks overall was a great and fun company to work for. But it's the individual store that matters! Some of the managers and partners are rude and disrespectful, some stores are dirtier than others. I loved my first store before I transferred! If you're a college student or even a mom that needs a part time job, they definitely work with you."
good,"Overall the job is very fun and I love the people I work with; but the district manager and higher up management doesn't treat the employees very well. They will come in and not really care about how we feel, they just find ways to criticize our work instead of compliment anything."
good,"Of the time of this review i would like to let you know that working for this company was fun but not rewarding at all. All i have to say is this. Coming from someone who always goes to Starbucks to get coffee and working to serve, i think its safe to say that people need to chill out and stop thinking that they are entitled to every little thing and if the drink wasn't made correctly then we are sorry. We will make you a new one. Simple as that. No need to jump on us over it."
good,It's a fun place to work and the scheduling is very flexible. Lots of call outs on a regular basis. But everyone is supportive and bands together. Positions are very station oriented and only deployed flexing is allowed. Allows all employees to take ownership of their responsibility.
good,Compensation is awful. it's a great place for young people who need a first job. Anyone with real responsibilities can not make a living working at Starbucks.
good,"My colleagues were great, so the people are lovely though the company doesn't care about the 'little guy' and takes a long time to listen to the 'partners'- Baristas and supervisors etc. And make changes."
good,"A typical day of work is demand, demand, demand. No time for rest, everything must get done. Nothing was stocked, store was barely cleaned. Morning and night shift did not work well together, but morning shift's crew was very close."
good,made alot of lovely friends gained alot of experience overall quite happy. the skilles ive gained will help me alot in the future and im grateful to stabucks for that.
good,"Starbucks was an awesome place to work at, people wise. The previous manager was a big downfall on the company though, the other employees were amazing and always a blast to be around."
good,"I had an amazing boss, great coworkers and learned a lot about customer service. Unfortunately Starbucks is the lowest paying job around now, even McDonalds pays more for less responsibility. I stayed as long as I did because it was fun and I really liked my boss and coworkers."
good,"fast paced, pleaser to support costumer service "
good,"This job is a great job to work at if you are starting off (first time workers) but if you like money and you feel you work hard for the money and the hours and money aren't adding up, then I would consider going somewhere else."
good,Buen ambiente laboral ya que esta constituido por muchos jóvenes donde puedes intercambiar experiencias y tener el apoyo para realizar los trabajos que se tienen que llevar acabo durante el día
good,"Many think that all of the guidelines to make drinks would be too confusing, however Starbucks has the art of making gourmet and traditional cultural coffee down to a tee, with formulaic instructions that are easily memorable. While many critics would say Starbucks is the ""McDonald's of coffee"", or of lower quality, it would only be because Starbucks is one of the biggest corporations in the world, as the only things that they have done is making a fast and easy way for the average person to taste many different forms of tea and coffee beverages. They are the biggest and best in coffee for a good reason."
good,The job itself is not very hard. The biggest problem is the manager. shes very selfish. She will give you a hard time about the schedule and about having to call off when you're sick even if its the only time you've called off that year. Starbucks is a great company but pick your store wisely.
good,"place was awesome employees management benefits but the pay was the only thing that got in the way , high paced work environment to but the feel of the place was spot on customers were cool for the most part"
good,"The benefits and culture are what makes Starbucks a great place to work.  It is a great place to develop customer service and retail skills as well as cashiering, basic food and drink prep, and exposure to cleanliness and OSHA.  It is flexible for students and those desiring part time work.  You will not make enough to survive and need a second job."
good,"I received opportunity for advancement to Shift Supervisor, and felt the environment conducive to learning proficiency in the required skills. The team environment was generally agreeable, with functional communication with managers. "
good,"You get to see people before they've had their coffee so some customers are hard to handle. Aside from that, time goes by quickly and it's a fun, fast-paced workplace."
good,Having been at Starbucks for almost 4 years has given me a good idea of customer service and what to expect to deal with especially with people and goals in the company.  Having been a barista and shift supervisor has two similar goals but different responsibilities and they can make or break you.
good,"It is a lot to work for Starbucks. The company and it's ideals and culture are phenomenal, but it is still in the food service, and all that entails. Applicants are not always looking for a career, just for a ""fun job"" that can make it a difficult place to manage."
good,"In this job I was able to learn the values of customer service, and work to promote good service. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with a team, and constantly meet new people."
good,Very flexible scheduling. Work culture depends on the management that is currently hired. At times things can get out of hand due to managers relying on others to do their job.
good,"works well with school schedule, great management, great benefits however the compensation isn't too great, great team environment, lots of opportunity for growth."
good,"we were one team one family till most of the main officers left and the whole atmosphere change not for the best for most of the employees."
good,"Diariamente se cumplia los labores del sector asignado, junto a otros compañeros o aveces solo. Aprendes a ser estratégico con el tiempo, a ser agil y practicas la empatía en todo momento del turno al estar en contacto con personas que buscan detenerse a tomar un café, y muchas veces a reflexionar o leer. "
good,"Often make drinks for hours at a time with no break. Management is excellent though, but work itself is frustrating. Very fast paced at times and it is often difficult to work as a team."
good,"Not my dream job. However, it allowed me schedule flexibility for over ten years while I worked on my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. I was able to transfer from a store in St. Louis to Dallas when I found a Graduate school, all while granting me health benefits. Not an easy job, lots of hard work and repetitive motion, as well as the usual strain of interacting with a sometimes cranky uncaffeinated public. I never asked to move up, so I could focus on my education, but advancement was offered as an option."
good,"Solid entry-level position. Free music streaming service, tuition reimbursement programs, several investment options. The trade-off is in the business volume; it will gradually erode all but the most stalwart customer service professionals."
good,"Busy morning shift would involve getting up at 4am to be at work at 5am. "
good,"Applying great customer service within the community. Building relationships with different people, finding a common interest within all of customers. Professionally achieving customer satisfaction.""the customer is always right"". Employee handles the duties of job tasking between health inspections, customer care, and time limits. This workplace can be calm and conversational all at once! Schedules to be correct within time frames of the service, does need to repeat task because of error."
good,Starbucks has great benefits and is probably the best thing it has going for it in terms of taking care of the employees that work there. Seemed to value the quantity of drinks sold over quality.
good,"A place to learn how to create espresso beverage while making connections with partners and the community. Flexible hours for students in need of a part time job. Benefits include dental, medical etc. opportunity to grow and learn about coffee culture if interested."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for with wonderful benefits and a great work environment. The management I've dealt with has changed too much for me to feel stable in the environment. A typical day at work is fast paced and full of energy, I enjoy the customer connections that I get to make and the fun that I have with my amazing coworkers. The culture of Starbucks is pretty good but I don't feel like it is always present in my current location. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the lack of communication throughout my store. The most enjoyable part is the great experiences I get to have with my coworkers and the regular clientel."
good,It doesn't matter how many benefits the job comes with if you can't work enough hours to pay your bills. This is a common problem for partners working at Starbucks and not an isolated incident. Short shifts too many people on the schedule and not enough hours.
good,"Honestly, I love working here. I enjoy making espresso drinks and connecting with customers. There are great benefits as well, such as free schooling through Arizona State and varying health care plans. Unfortunately, there is a work shortage right now and the store has gone through five managers since I was hired in January of 2016 and I am hoping for more stability."
good,"Overall Starbucks has been a great company to work for. The benefits are great and there are a lot of on the job perks. You receive free beverages as well as a free food item everyday you work, as well as a free pound of coffee every week!"
good,"Great place to work part time no matter where you are. The Starbucks name is well-known, and as busy as the stores can tend to get, there is no shortage of support from the team. Everyone has a job, and things go much smoother when every cog in the machine is turning."
good,"great benefits..."
good,"There is never a dull moment working at Starbucks. The company is well known so they attract different types of customers as well as different types of workers. Everyone was diverse. The managers were encouraging and helpful, always willing to listen to you when you had a problem and making sure things were alright with you in your personal life and work life. I learned a lot of interpersonal skills, customer service skills, how to work quick on my feet, think outside the box, express my creativity, and maintain some great relationships with customers and coworkers. The hardest part about the job would have had to have been the hours being varied at different stores so there wasn't as much work some weeks as there was others."
good,Starbucks is a really good place to work due to management working with partners on when they are available to work. It's all a memorization game and multitasking so it is nice to know what your walking in to each day but I enjoy challenges and learning new things!
good,The job was alright and minimal pay. Coworkers were friendly but we're not trained properly. The environment was very clean but at times we would run out of ingredients.
good,A quite busy environment in a retail business. For the ones who just punch in and out it would be a good job .For the ones who look for a development company they are not so good. They just promise a lot of things until they need you and then take it back.Taking advantage o every single person who wants to develop by pressuring them and putting too many responsibilities on your shoulders without training
good,"wish there was less rotation of staff, which could be achieved with more respect and better salary.  the advantages, like insurance, markouts and free drinks were good perks."
good,It was a great job from my experience. my only issue is with the higher ups who are very uncultured in the actual work force due to external hires. My first manager was great but after her replacement was a very rude and bitter person.
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me how to multitask better than I ever thought I could. A typical day at work is very stressful, with having to handle so many different positions just to get through the morning rush. The management could have been better when it comes to general behavior, but the store was otherwise run very well in my eyes. My co-workers and I have grown close and a lot of us usually talk together outside of work. The hardest part of the job would probably be the intensity of some rushes and handling more issues such as machines not working very frequently. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet and know customers and develop connections with them."
good,"A day at Starbucks is always busy, with regulars wanting their coffee as fast as possible and lots of students coming in to do homework with a drink. I learned very quickly how to memorize orders, remember customer names, read what a customer wants from me, whether that's me asking them how their day was or getting them their coffee and payment as quickly as possible. I had to memorize every drink recipe and understand easily how to sub ingredients or change it to the customers needs. My manager was efficient and organized and customers loved her, and she was always fair with her employees. The hardest part of the job is not getting easily stressed under pressure and making sure every customer receives the best service we can give them. Connecting with customers who remember  you and want to know more about you was definitely the best part of the job."
good,"At Starbucks I was able to acquire new skills, very challenging and fun work environment, very productive workplace, this company offered me a lot of benefits including medical and retirement plans, I also enjoyed paticipating in charity events, coffee tastings, etc, my overall experience with this company was great."
good,"Starbucks is a great place for continuous learning and growth. It is definitely not a place for a quitter. Everyday is a new chapter with new things to learn and embrace. From just a barista, I have undergone all positions in Operations before I led Learning and Development team. I was fortunate to be part of the Starbucks success story."
good,"Fun atmosphere, but pay is compensated by a lot of benefits. My coworkers were a great part of the job, but the management made me resign."
good,Typical day: constantly on your feet and busy at all times especially in the mornings. Most enjoyable part of job: the environment and the people I worked with.
good,"Its a good place to work, they provide many benefits, but your experience varies depending who your manager is and what location you work at."
good,"During training period, there were multiple occasions of drama with other employees that I did not want a part of.  As well as poor management and the treatment to other employees was not acceptable."
good,"A typical day as a partner at Starbucks includes setting up all products for display according to store schematics and store use for the entire business day. Partners (employees) are provided half an hour before business hours begin to get necessary tasks completed to take care of the ""early bird"" customers.The job requires partners to stay on their feet for their entire shift. Inventory counts and labor usage are factored in between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shifts. Communication must be thorough between supervisors and management to ensure proper handling of cash deposits, till auditing, sales opportunities, delegation of tasks, daily and weekly inventory management, and partner and customer complaints. "
good,Starbucks provided great compensation benefits but was too fast paced for my liking right now. Suited for the physically healthy and fast paced workers.
good,"My day would start out very early! I'd get there at 5am and brew coffee, count the safe and set up the tills make some tea also try to sneak in my order that I had to do. Once we opened I'd be greeting the guests that came in and order their hand crafted beverages. Our morning rush came between 7am and 9am. Once everything settled down and got cleaned and back up to speed I then went and would go do my deposit for the prior days money drops from the safe. After that its time to run everyones breaks, so i would go back out on the floor and cover someones section they were working in so they could go realx on their break. Next I would start my pull of pasteries for the next day, we offered our guests everything from muffins to sausage egg and cheese sandwiches. By the time I was done pulling the pasteries my shift is uaully almost over, enough time for me to give the next supervisor coming in an update on the day what our sales were and a heads up on how our morning was. "
good,"I started as a barista, and it took me only 5 months to move up to a shift supervisor.  I am mainly a closer. If you want to move up to different positions, Starbucks would be the place. You could be a barista trainer or a coffee master. Being a shift supervisor doesn't mean you have to be a coffee master, which I love. I learned to better multi-task while working. You need to be able to multi-task here or you'll never be able to get your tasks done. I also love how I am able to work 28 hours and still be a supervisor. At my previous job, I had to do 40 hours which was way too much to handle. With all that said, working with my actual manager is pretty stressful. Workloads and workloads of cleaning are added everyday to my closing shifts which makes it ultimately harder to get off on time and also a struggle for my baristas. There is definitely a good amount of favoritism in my store. I don't see myself as friends with fellow coworkers. I'm there to get my job done and that's it!"
good,"Work can be pretty stressful and fast-paced. Without a stable team, you can tend to rely on yourself a lot to get work finished."
good,overall a fun environment. not a bad job for college students who have multiple room mates and can afford such a low pay. management treats employees poorly.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job had to have been the customers and interacting with them. A typical work day entailed making drinks, conversing with customers and processing payments. The hardest part of my job was running out of coffee."
good,it was an aright place to work . i meet new people both bad and good but most of the time it will be good. yes and that pretty much all the is so if your not really a peoples person then it wont be for you.
good,"I have worked at four different stores, but the thing they all have in common is that the work is difficult but rewarding. You get to interact with all types of people and that is my favorite thing about my job. A typical day at work is making beverages for people, making people smile as much as I can, and supporting a positive work space. I have learned so much. Such as how to meet a customer's needs by reading their visual cues, interacting with people and staying positive, and also how to become the leader I am today. I am a great leader not only because I have the drive to do the best that I can, but also because I have had a hard working management team to work with. Questions are always answered quickly and kindly, and everyone is willing to help one another, almost like family.My co-workers love to help one another and solve any problem as best as they can. It makes it easier to work when everyone is in harmony. The most difficult part of the job is working in the steady paced environment and ensuring that every customer leaves the store happy. But the most enjoyable part is meeting new people every day and creating something special just for them that will brighten their day, if only for a little. I love to make people laugh and smile. They are a great company to work for."
good,"consist of searching schools data base for in use books, checking books in and out. helping students fax and make copies, answering phones and restocking"
good,"Job is fun and customers are great. Management is not that great, and the pay is slightly over minimum wage."
good,IF one is lucky to find a functional store then it'd be great. find the right combo and you're set. it was fun overall i learned a lot though.
good,"This job was good for when I was going through college. I am older now and my views do not allign with that of the CEO's. I have had wonderful managers and DM's in the past. Friendly culture, you make life long friends while you are there. Customers obviously can be hard to handle sometimes."
good,Starbucks is a company that if you like dealing with people complain about making their coffee not to their liking then this job is for you in my eyes its just not worth it people are usually nasty and management is always rude to their employees
good,"buen trabajo en equipo , buena ética laboral, buen ambiente y atmósfera laboral ,respeto por parte de los jefes inmediatos."
good,"After eight years of consecutive employment with Starbucks, I will have to say that your experience is entirely dependent on who is your immediate manager/district manager/regional director. I have have great times but there were periods during which the support was just not there. Given the increasingly stringent demands placed on management (research recent periodicals re: Starbucks), extra support should have been implemented, especially in such a dense urban environment such as New York City. Compensation structure is not commensurate with experience, ESPECIALLY if you rise through internal promotions."
good,"I had fun working at Starbucks. I mostly did the early morning shifts where we had the huge rush in the drivethru. This was the best part of my day becasue it was always a challenge and we were always trying to beat our drivethru record (which our team did!). What I did not like was walking a mile to Starbucks at 4:30am in Alaska becasue the manager didn't have enough consideration to schedule people with cars that early. I guess it built character, but it was still very scary and VERY cold. Also, my manager did not consider that I was taking 15 units at my University, and not only scheduled me full time despite my multiple requests for part time, but also ended up working me overtime constantly."
good,"Learning how to make coffee, the history of coffee, and entertaining customers by making their drink right is a blast. Its a very easy job. it's just coffee!"
good,"It was a fast paced job, sometimes stressful, but enjoyable most times. Constant moving, there was always something to do, constant preparation, and making sure the restaurant was clean."
good,Management makes or breaks the Starbucks work experience. A good manager and you will love your job at Starbucks like I did. A bad one made me quit.
good,Many of the staff were more than happy to help in any situation necessary during my probation. However it was felt a lack of communication and uniformed methodology created a somewhat intense and stressful workplace.
good,"Many great lessons to be learned at Starbucks, both good and bad! Great first job and student position. Promotion often given to those who ask most, not the most deserving. Often times poor store management in my experience. Great benefits package, pays for college through ASU. Provides partners with quality healthcare at affordable rates. Counseling services and other employee programs provided. Discounts to major retailers, free Spotify account!"
good,"its slow moving but a great place to work, not for the ones looking for advancement.  Evaluation base of personal taste rather than merits.  filled with politics."
good,"I would wake up at 3am get to work for 4;15am, set up the pastry case, brew coffee, take out the patio, unload boxes, do a garbage run, help customers and so on. The benefits were incredible but when I went to transfer the Management wouldn't let me. So I quit"
good,"Nice place to work with a hard working management. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing good customer service to people and learning about different peoples walks of life. The only difficulty is getting there and back each day, this can prove to be quite expensive."
good,"great workplace to improve based on people skills, development and self confident to communicate with others. understanding, caring, fairness and respect."
good,"A typical day at work involves mostly cleaning and performing other tasks necessary to promote a clean and organized workplace while simultaneously servicing customers. Customers are given top priority above any other tasks at hand, however baristas work together to juggle customer and store demands efficiently. Baristas are led by shift managers present during the morning, midday, and evening hours that ensure the workplace environment runs smoothly and ensures partners are given breaks on time and helped as needed to meet customer demands. The hardest part of the job is the high level of stress you experience at times in the store. The company's emphasis on speed and accuracy of service often times makes you feel rushed. Customers can sometimes become agitated or rude regarding their service, however it is the company's policy to do everything we can to problem solve and ensure repeat customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is becoming friends with your customers and seeing the ""regulars"" come in and their face lighting up as you remember their name and what they are coming in for."
good,"This role is extremely customer focused and is all about interaction with the customers to ensure they have the best experience possible. It is an environment where team work is essential to the day to day running of the store. I have met some of the best personalities in this job which makes the extremely fast paced and sometimes stressful environment a lot easier to deal with. This role has taught me a lot about about myself and the personal skills I posses ans need to improve on. I have developed my confidence, precision and ability to take leadership, but also to train and encourage others. The hardest part of the job is the increasingly high demands of the customers but furthermore the company, however it is mostly a very enjoyable environment to work in and a great opportunity to meet and interact with new people."
good,"-Typically the day at work starts with getting your register tendered with cash and logged into it. Once thats done then you will be able to take customer order's. This includes alot of multi-tasking. Taking order's for customer then preparing drinks or meals and completeting transaction for cash. "
good,"The work life balance of some teams are great, with onsite gym and day care.  The hardest part of working at Starbucks is your current management can block you from accepting an internal offer."
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,"Let me start by saying that Starbucks has a great corporate culture. They require all baristas to know exactly how their products taste, terminology, have comfortable uniforms, and know that these people that are working for them are more than just faces in a crowd. With that said, employees receive VERY low compensation for their work (8.25 an hour while living in Orange County!) and there are definitely hoops to jump through trying to earn your medical benefits, such as having to work for 20 hours a week minimum but not scheduling each employee for that amount of time. Also, some managers are great, but some of them only show up once a week, and don't like to get their hands dirty by actually assisting with the business. That doesn't constitute all of their managers, just some that I've observed."
good,"I would start by counting the safe making sure it was at the right amount. Then make drinks, do dishes, manage time to clean the lobby."
good,"was fun to work with lots of different people, however the company has a bad ethos for those who work there and are often let down by the company themselves."
good,I learn to make coffea . The hardes part of the job was the long hours  that you have to work .Salary was small so I choose to work in  hotels  beacause there I can learne a lot of things
good,"Ich habe als Barista bei ""Starbucks"" in London gearbeitet. Diese Erfahrung war sehr wichtig für mich, ich habe mit Leute aus allen Teilen der Welt gearbeitet und ihre Kultur kennen gelernt. Wir haben sehr gut im Team gearbeitet und uns gegenseitig geholfen. Jeden Tag mussten sehr viele Kunden bedient werden, da diese Filiale im Zentrum der Stadt war. Dadurch habe ich gelernt schnell und fleißig zu arbeiten. An diesem Job war sehr schwierig, die Arbeit gut in kurzer Zeit zu organisieren, der Vorteil war, mit vielen Menschen zu arbeiten."
good,"You learn a lot about coffee, but its a lot of work and you aren't guaranteed many hours as a new hire. the co-workes are mostly great people and most customers are very cool."
good,"Use of great customer service and communication skills, interpersonal relationships and team player abilities. Share experiences and make sure that everyone is enjoying their visit in the store."
good,Great benefits.  Little room to move up. Broken promises of promotions. The hours are long and draining. Tips are usually good. Customers are rude.
good,Great learning experience.  Benfits were excellent.  Was a good seven year journey.  The employees I worked with were hardworking and loyal.  I thank Starbucks for the chance to work for this company.
good,"Starbucks has a talent for attracting and hiring talented people, and likes to move people up in the company from within. The margins for profitability, goals, and expectations are very high for performance and cleanliness. This is a stressful place to work, but can be fun."
good,"Today, the costumers are cools and my co-workers too! A good vibe in the market and the floor is clean and the customers are happy and the manager too because if the customers are happy, they spend money and if they spend money, my store manager and my manager are happy too because sales are good."
good,"I loved Starbucks.  I loved what it represented to it's customers and to it's baristas.  I loved how they made a cup of coffee mean more, but I did not like my store.  I tried to transfer, but there was a delay.  The management did not seem to care when there was more than several employees not working, receiving complaints, and harassing other employees.  I talked to the manager of the store, as well as the district manager, but nothing was done for a long time.  My biggest requirement is to be happy and I was extremely unhappy at that job, so that's when I found a better job elsewhere.  The benefits were amazing.  I had good pay, good hours, and amazing insurance, but sometimes those things just aren't enough."
good,"I love that it is a fast pace, very active, and quick environment. All these categories are similar to the kind of work place I am  used to working in on a daily basis. Management is great at least in my particular store and my hours are always flexible. Overall the benefits and the company is good to work for especially now that I can show my tattoos."
good,"The district I worked at took work too seriously, however fabulous benefits that helped me put myself through school."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks I would make coffee and coffee related drinks for customers in a timely manner. At this job I learned the difference between many coffee beans and how to make various drinks. I also learned how to restock bar. Management was okay, they hardly were there. My co-workers were good people who were very dedicated to helping me learn. Hardest part of the job is moving fast in a close spaced making hot drinks. Most enjoyable part of my job was the benefits and pay."
good,"Worked as a contractor, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a stable and serious work place."
good,I worked different events which at times I was lucky to see famous people
good,"If you work a full 8 hour work day here things become very monotonous and the jobs grows tired quickly. A 6 hour work day there, on the other hand is great."
good,it's all right but don't plan to make this a career if your starting from the bottom
good,"Starbucks is a great opportunity for a younger generation looking to advance quickly and pursue a career in a stable work environment. Each day consists of making each customer leave with a smile on their face and a great drink in there hand. At Starbucks we value our customers and want to create the best experience each and every time they visit one of our stores. Cleanliness is our second highest objective and is held to the highest standard. Each day that we open the store all tills will be counted, inventory will be tracked and all of our product is fully stocked so that the customer can order and leave as fast as possible. Each day we try to discover new ways to make our customers happy and feel as if they weren’t just a customer but are a part of the Starbucks family. The hardest part of the job would have to be the hours and amount of work that is required upon the shift supervisors to create the success desirable to be a fortune 500 company. With this being said it has provided the knowledge of excellent customer service and the integrity to constantly grow and focus my aspirations on my work and growth as an employee for any career I pursue."
good,benefits are available if you work 20 or more hours a week.  Good work/life balance.
good,"This is a great job to have as a young adult as it is flexible around other activities such as school and/or other jobs but I would not recommend it as a career unless you plan on moving up the cooperate ladder (District Manager, Regional Manager, etc.). The job requires early mornings and sometimes even late nights. For the most part the job is enjoyable and fast paced. The job is sometimes difficult as there is ""drama"" amongst the employees because so many of them are young but I guess that is at every job. Working for this company I have grown to resent coming to work some days because we are required to do extra tasks that are out of the description of the job title. I've also been through some very good and some VERY bad management. I feel that the management team is what makes the job so amazing so when you are at a store with poor management there is more turn over, therefore more new employees to train, leading to more mistakes and longer waits. My advice, look up the store before you apply!"
good,"I happened to get hired at a store that did not have stable manager for more than a year at a time. For the most part it is a good company, and i would recommend it"
good,"There is no divider between your work and your private life.  District Managers will contact you at 4 am.  As a store manager, you are expected to respond at all hours of the day.  There is never a ""day off""."
good,"At Starbucks, you want to get customers their drinks as quickly as possible, while engaging them in conversations that will hopefully bring them back. "
good,i am tired  of working at food  and beverages division so i want to o change my job. overall i enjoyed starbucks.
good,It is a cool place to work. Fun and trendy vibe. Always nice meeting new people.
good,"Starbucks in all is a great company to work for, but not what I want to do for the rest of my life."
good,"There were many benefits that came along with the job to make it worth it, but overall I didn't really fit in. I guess I was just uninterested in their personal lives but they expected me to be. I am more of an introvert, and they were all basically outgoing, loud, and wanted to get drunk all the time. Although, I was learning how to appreciate things out of my own realm. I forced myself to enjoy their company as much as I could. The customers were usually very good people, and I really enjoyed having a free latte whenever I wanted one."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of confirming appointments with patients, before heading out to visit patients. I learned my way around the surrounding cities."
good,"My day started at 5:30 AM by preparing the kiosk for the day's customers by making the brewed coffee, ice teas, and various mixtures used in the more complicated drinks. Extensive cleaning was required with any food preparation, both daily and weekly: Cleaning of the milk steaming pitchers, various pumps, refrigerators ,tables, chairs counter tops, sinks and drains. as well as cleaning and maintaining the Espresso machine and the coffee brewer."
good,"A great job that taught me many things, needed much more room for advancement."
good,"Overall good company to work for if you have the right management and co-workers. The job security is not great, but free drinks, and coffee each week."
good,"Job was okay, Coworkers were great"
good,My experience at Starbucks challenging. It was one of physically hardest jobs. It was demanding on you body and mind. I enjoyed the co-workers and regulars customers.
good,"Help Starbucks create and start manufacturing machines. This is something they have never done before and proud I helped build and create a new coffee brewer."
good,"I work very hard at a busy downtown location."
good,"You have to follow their rules, and there is no flexibility in appearance, however they are extremely flexible with your hours.  Sometimes to the point that it is annoying."
good,"A typical morning included a very busy morning rush which carried on  into mid morning, and again around lunch time. When you aren't helping customers, you are cleaning every thing head to toe. My co-workers were fantastic until all of the ""seasoned"" ones left for better job opportunities. The hardest part of the job is the stress put on you to work every position when someone else isn't doing their job, and pleasing customers who refuse to be happy. The best part of the job is customers who enjoy seeing your face every day and become a part of your life, and that's the most enjoyable part as well."
good,"A typical day at work includes, making drinks, cleaning, taking care of customers, and dealing with any issues people may have.  The management is usually pretty good, but one main concern is the fact that if an employee does have a complaint, and talks to the manager, the manager will go to the person the complaint was about and tell this person who said something about them.  This makes for an uncomfortable work environment sometimes.  There are many rumors and gossip that spread around this place because the co-workers cannot seem to mind their own business.  Also people like to complain and therefore make working there not as fun when all people do is complain.  The hardest part of this job is dealing with unhappy customers, but no matter what happens, I have to be nice and keep the customers happy."
good,"	Managed two/three employees during assigned shift; oversaw activities related to serving customers."
good,Starbucks is fair trade coffee which is refreshing to work for such a large company with ethical values. Day is fast-paced go go go good thing you get all the free coffee you need.
good,"Great Transition Job. Some days are long and stressful because of the volume, but it's never too hard to work. "
good,"Overall I feel pretty sustained since I started working at starbucks. My boss is opened and flexible and listens to her employees. The majority of my coworkers are good company. Im always busy and there's always something to be done which I like, so Im not twiddling my thumbs waiting for the next customer. For the most part the patrons a friendly and we get to know them on first name basis. Hardest part of the job is the learning curve when you first start out and the most enjoyable part making good conversation with customers and co-workers"
good,High volume atmosphere. Learned cultures of diffrent coffee beans.Caring and helpful management.Out going and dependable co-workers.High demand for orders.Pesonal interaction with customers.
good,"A typical day of work consists of many grumpy faces complaining about overpriced coffee, then coming back 2 - 5 times a day. Every once in awhile, a pleasant ""regular"" comes around, and lifts up your mood. However, depending on the location, these can be few and far between."
good,"I was working at Starbucks at the same time I was working for Lowes. I worked in a Target where Starbucks what directly inside. I loved working here, because the constant work flow. I enjoyed times where it was extremely busy. There was not a challange that I turned away. I was acknowledged for my hard work, and trained to be a trainer for new employees. I was also given manager tasks, and duties. I enjoyed what I did, until I began to have issues regarding the tasks that I was being asked to do. Management was being irresponsible about having my certification as a trainer signed off. I was constantly being promised a management position that was never given to me. I therefore left, and devoted my time working for Lowes. "
good,"Very fun work place,benefits are very good but low salary since the work and life balance is very hard to control."
good,"- Fast passed and on-the-go"
good,"Kept very busy, learned routine in a week, shifts were flexible (could always get more shifts), most difficult part of my job was being outside in mid-winter to clean the patio, some managers were excellent, fair and upfront"
good,"preparation, cashier, sales, served hot/cold beverages, great customer service skills"
good,"I enjoyed working for a company who was so flexible with their hours, it was amazing to me. I was a college student going to school fulltime and i needed a job that could work with my schedule. wow! i worked my way up to management and I appreciated everything they offered with on going training and knowledge. I moved up very quickly and enjoyed everyone i worked with. Yes, again it's like highschool. But they do take the job seriously. I did."
good,Starbuck's Coffee Company requires an individual prepared for energy and personality in the early hours. A manager must foresee the morning rush and prepare his/her floor for success.
good,"A typical day involves managing the needs of customers while working in a time-efficient manner. You have to make drinks, clean and adhere to corporate standards for customer service. My management experience was decent, but because there are a plethora of Starbucks locations in Colorado, you can always transfer to a new store if you are not enjoying your current experience. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistent schedule where you are expected to work an array for different shifts. My co-workers are mostly young people who are employed by Starbucks while they pursue higher education or are hoping to move up the management chain. The most enjoyable part of this job are the nice customers and the nice benefits package (affordable health insurance!)."
good,"great fast paced work place that kept you on your toes. learned alot about coffee, the management was great, co workers were a bit drama filled but that happens. hardest part was keeping the co workers from cracking under pressure, most enjoyable was the customers"
good,"Overall Starbucks is a great go to job for independents who need health insurance. It is what it is, a coffee shop job. The real down side, other than the low hourly rate and horrible pay raises, is that the Barista is the Guinea Pig for every marketing idea corporate can come up with. Shaking the Drinks for example; which added extra time and steps to a simple process which only served to delay the customer. All of the shift supervisors, assistant mangers and many managers are new to the retail industry and they are learning on you the labor's back, they are changed out every six months. If you can make it more than two years at this job you will leave with a set of customer service skills second to none and a coat of armor for any boss anywhere."
good,"Starbucks is a great company if you like working in retail. Every day was different, filled with different challenges, different customers, and different coworkers. Your teammates are generally very good at their job, because the more efficiently you work, the easier a given shift runs. Nevertheless, there will always be a few times when nothing seems to go right, customer volume is overwhelming, someone can't come to work, and supplies run out. Therefore, you must be able to keep a cool head at all times. The one time you lose your temper, management will hear about it!"
good,Good place to work and they will train because they want you to be knowledgeable about what your selling.
good,"Starbucks is a well known company and known for being all over the place, found on every street corner in nearly every part of the world. A Typical day involved talking to various people every single day with the expectation of making their drink perfectly and exactly as they want it. Cash handling, the up selling of products, creating an welcoming ""second home"" atmosphere along with keeping the cafe clean. I was able to practice my interpersonal skills while working at Starbucks due to having to constantly be talking to someone, either a new customer or a regular."
good,Meeting interesting people on a day to day basis. If you are comfortable in fast pace environments this job is the right job for you
good,the sales side of my work was great. i liked my co workers and the fact that you can grow with the company
good,I personally love where I work but it all depends on the manager. I worked with two Starbucks and the second one was the best and I’m still here bc of this manager. Also my coworkers are amazing. I do this we should get paid more but the flexibility is amazing. Like GREAT.
good,"Es una empresa con buenas prestaciones y cultura laboral, pero en muchos casos/tiendas hay gerentes con falta de objetividad ycoaching, también muestran comportamientos de favoritismo."
good,"It's fun if you're working with coworkers you get along with. "
good,Everyone makes a huge sense of belonging among coworkers. Management is strict. Sometimes your work is under appreciated. They reduce labor hours also at the time put more work on your shoulder that leads to stressful working conditions during rush hours. Great benefits.
good,"Though it can get very stressful at times, Starbucks is a very valuable job to me. It's taught me a lot of skills both in interacting with customers and memorization of recipes and techniques for making drinks and food items. A typical day fork me would be coming in half an hour early, making a drink for myself then throwing my apron on to work. My management team could be better to be honest, but they're overall a very good team that is well voiced."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for about 3 months and although it was a fun job, I wasn't treated fairly, and did not have a good experience at the Starbucks I worked at! I did not get paid until I had to speak to the manager, I had to learn everything by myself without any help, and I sometimes just felt uncomfortable!"
good,"Each store is different and no one store, or their management should be reflective of the company. Ultimately, they are fun to work for, but it depends what you're after, or what you want to get out of it."
good,I like this job because of the flexible hours. I am happy here. I do wish I had more hours afternoons and evenings because I need more money. The staff is nice and the area is very clean and respectful.
good,"Flexible hours, great people to work with, fast paced and fun. Management was helpful and understanding with personal obligations and willing to help you if you needed anything."
good,Starbucks is what you make it. They have great benefits and upper management is reasonable. It's not common but not unheard of to get a difficult store manager but it's easy to get along with almost any hire.
good,"Working at starbucks requires you to become familiar with the many faces that show up everyday and ask for ""the usual"". "
good,"My coworkers made my day all the time."
good,Working at Starbucks provides a lot of job advancement. I was fast tracked to promotion within 6 months of working there. The job does require a lot of out of pay grade responsibilities.
good,As long as you stay long enough for the stock and college help to pay off it is an easy job. Just try your best to keep the masses happy. At times things do run out and it’s not always easy to replenish in time.
good,"Overall it was a different experience for me. Coming from someone who didn't like coffee. I learned how to make and brew all types of drinks, I even tried some of my own and enjoyed it!"
good,"Upper management is terrible. They don't care about you or your development. Be weary when choosing location, as of course experience will vary. Great place to build your patience and speed, however."
good,"For those wanting to establish a foundation in working in customer or food service, Starbucks is a good place to start. It offers you experience that you can use in everyday life or at another job and the pay was good, given that Hawaii's minimum wage is 10.10. In addition, it also had good benefits such as a 401K, dental and medical, Spotify premium and discounts. The partners that you work with are really understanding and fun to hang out with. They are probably the most enjoyable part; being able to bond and connect with them. The difficult part of the job was having to stand for 8 hours, but being on the move kept you busy so you didn't worry much. Management was alright, but what really mattered was what you learned working aside your partners, communicating, help each other out, and caring for the customers."
good,"Pay isn’t great. But you get weekly tips."
good,"The company has an amazing culture and takes cares of the partners in all aspects. There is great training given to partners and managers to ensure they are successful in their role. However, as a manager (as others may agree as well) there is no work-life balance. There is constant need to be on your phone that takes time away from things outside of work. Overall a great company but there are restrictions in some things that we do as managers."
good,"While I really enjoyed the people I worked with, I feel very strongly that only a few of us were putting in the work and carrying everyone else. I was a barista and only about 5 out of the 20 people working there were held to the standard of being perfect with every drink made. Most people were hired to run the drive thru window or to work as a cashier. So once the managers saw you could make drinks in an efficient manner, it was like a sweatshop. Everyone just stands around while you and one other person make drive thru, cafe and mobile orders in an efficient manner. I feel as though this company neglects strengthening other people's skills and forces perfection upon those who acquire a sense of what it means to be a barista in the first place."
good,"The benefits are unreal for a part time job. It’s also very taxing. Especially, when people struggle to work together. It’s fast-paced and emotionally draining. When you have a minute, the connections you do make are great and make it somewhat worth it. Plus, hand crafting drinks is pretty fun when it’s busy. It just takes teamwork."
good,"I was a Barista. I took orders, established relationships with customers, and overall tried to make the customers happy. I learned how to deal with different personality types, working collaboratively and how to think on your feet. The hardest part is dealing with difficult customers. My favorite part was learning more about coffee, Starbucks culture, and what makes Starbucks special (I am a big Starbucks fan myself)."
good,You can choose to cover other partners at other stores and each environment seems completely different. The people you're working with can make or break the job.
good,"Frankly, the health insurance is really great, a lot of people who worked with me only worked the minimum hours to get the health insurance benefits and spent the rest of the time at a higher paying gig. But honestly, as someone on Medicaid, their insurance wasn't enough for me to make up for working at minimum wage in a state with a high cost of living and a low minimum wage, but I'm also someone who tends to has very low medical expenses. I've met other coworkers who had dependents, pre-existing medical conditions, or who were transgender who most certainly felt like it was a great option for them. "
good,"They want you to be a cashier, a beverage maker, a janitor, and a dish washer. If you expect me to clean toilets and make drinks I expect more money. Still a fun place to work"
good,"I had many tasks to do in my typical day, and was at a very busy location. The pay was not worth staying at the job. I did not like the way both of my managers treated me."
good,"At  typical day working at Starbucks would  be keeping the work space clean and the coffee fresh so guest. Also checking with your team to make sure  you have every thing you need to start your day. Working at Starbucks I've learned that the customer is ALWAYS right, i have also learned how to be patient and commented. Everyone who walks into starbucks treat them like family remember names and  faces. Remembering your customers will make them feel at home and they will always come back because you've made a connection with them!"
good,A typical day consisted of brewing coffee and help customers order their drinks and food. I learned how to do Pont Of Sales at my location. I was hired by my manager and she was very sweet but she went to go manager another store and we got another manager that wasn't as nice as here and was very bias as to what information was given to her. So I was unfortunately relieved of my job as her and the supervisors were not professional any all I hopefully will be reapplying the company at a different location as to not make the mistake of working at that store.
good,Management could use some improvement but you’ll meet some of your bffs here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It can be challenging at times and stressful but it is fun learning all the drinks and such!!
good,It mainly Depends on the store you work at and partners you work with as well as your own attitude. Sometimes stores won’t be as organized as others but most times they appreciate others organizational skills.
good,I stayed with the company for nearly 7 years and didn’t feel as nearly as appreciated as I should. Pay goes up and down as you move from state to state. Shift supervisors are very underpaid for what they do.
good,Starbucks was a great place to work but it was just a temporary job for me. But it could be a forever job for you. I loved working at Starbucks but I ended up getting a job opportunity I couldn’t turn down
good,"Comencé a trabajar en septiembre del 2012, el ambiente es excelente para los jóvenes que buscan su primera experiencia laboral, con buenos beneficios (además de la bebida gratis por el día de trabajo). Sin embargo, el trabajo no es poco, trabajé en la sucursal de Pedro de Valdivia y asistía mucho público. Tienes muchas tareas, además de solo ser barista y atender en caja, y el sueldo es muy bajo, en ese año las 20 hrs las pagaban en 130.000."
good,"The management at Starbucks was awful, since it was also under the control of Aramark. The hours were flexible and the peer employees were fun to work with, but other than that, it was pretty rough."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work part-time when I needed health benefits. The Starbucks wage is not one that you are able to live off of though, even as a fulltime employee. Would recommend for a part-time short-time solution for health benefits."
good,Expected to go above in beyond maintaining strong customer service and quality of drinks/food. Customer connections are the main focus while making drinks comes secondary.
good,"My time at Starbucks has been truly stressful and trying. It seemed like everyday there was a new problem that occurred within the store, which isn’t so much of a bad thing but it was the lack of support that I was receiving. I’m perfectly fine working independently and pretty good at it; however there is a limit."
good,"Starbucks can truly be a great company to work for! Although i personally feel like there's not much room for advancement it can be a great part time job or a great job to have if you're going to school or need extra money. Full time is 30-35 hrs unless you are a store manager and if you are working cafe instead of drive through the hours are less.  Drive through is definitely fast paced. Good training, easy work. Work quickly and clean up just as fast and you'll do great! Work perks are nice. Pay depends on the area you work in but from what i remember it's like $1 more than minimum to start with no experience."
good,It’s the leads that make the job hard for you and non understanding managers. You can’t collect tips in the airport. But you do get a payed for meal to a limit. And discounts on a lot of things in the airport and also for renting a car from there. You do get to meet new people every day and stay busy until it’s time to go home.
good,The employees and management will make or break the store.  I was lucky enough to have a great manager. It is a very team oriented job and the partners you have dictate your experience there.
good,"Crazy customers is by far the ""hardest"" part of the job. I love my coworkers at my store. A real family to be honest, but I don't think most stores are like that. Really I enjoy coming to work for my coworkers"
good,"It is a good company and I would suggest that anyone apply. They offer free schooling, insurance for part time employees, free food pre shift, free coffee each week, and free spotify."
good,"This job has incredibly high demands for the pay provided. While the benefits are excellent, the stress and demands placed on you are sometimes extreme."
good,Upper management is rough but the people you work with will be great friends and the environment is enjoyable. It's stressful depending on when and where you work but rewarding
good,Working at Starbucks could be fun or miserable. The constant sales promotions and new products could make work hard. The people who work at Starbucks are usually pretty cool though.
good,"As far as entry level jobs it's not too bad, but the pay is low in comparison to standard of living in Middletown, Delaware. Overall, the experience isn't bad."
good,Starbucks offers great benefits to their employees. Health insurance is even available to part time workers. They also have a partnership with Arizona State University offering tuition reimbursement toward a bachelors degree.
good,My coworkers were awesome. My job was fun. The management was not. There was a huge lack of communication on one side and it was hard to figure things out and took way too much patience.
good,"It's the fast food/retail store that will most likely take the best care of their employees and have the widest range if benefits that I know of, but, at the end of the day, it's still a fast food/retail job."
good,"I have had wonderful managers who took care of their employees and made sure we had and good work/school/life balance and I have had a manager who physically put his hands on me and a district manager who did nothing about it. "
good,it was often short staffed when i went into work but i enjoyed lots of my other coworkers. I got a 30% discount and was able to have free drinks when i was on the clock.
good,"I have worked here for 5 years and I have never once had any major issues with management. But, as I moved from different locations, I could see poor management skills. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers. The hardest day is BOGO drinks."
good,If you’re looking for a part time job Starbucks is for you. The benefits is honestly the only good think about working for them. Also love my regular customers.
good,"I learned some of my most valuable life and communication skills from this job, it has taught me plenty with that and ever after leaving the company i still carry those virtues to this day."
good,Typical day consisted of team work in a fast passed environment. each employee had a fair share of work to do while at the same time building a culture of employees and customer satisfaction.
good,The company used to aim to satisfy and make both customers and partners feel included. It now remains about the money and fails to investigate where problems within the company begin.
good,"Bei Starbucks hatte ich eine gute Zeit, als ich noch jünger war."
good,"Great work environment since most of people are students, young"
good,"If you are shy and new in a country, working at Starbucks might give you the kick start you need to move further. Working here taught me a lot about customer service, patience, quality and coffee, and most importantly about me and what I  actually want from life."
good,"a typical day at work can be very hectic and busy , but the people you work with can make it all the better. Customers are not always the nicest but if you are not the type to let a few rude people ruin your day you'll be great. Making drinks and putting a smile on peoples face are the best part of the job"
good,"Preformed daily cleaning tasks, assist customers, suggestive selling, customer service, prepare products for the next shift, provide a happy environment for customers"
good,"I've found that some people, depending on the store, 'drink the cool-aid,' i.e. they romanticize a corporate culture that doesn't care about them. This is of course a store-by-store basis, some Starbucks have been fine, in others I've worked with Supervisors who are so rule-oriented, even when the rule itself is arbitrary and pointless (e.g. no taking expired food home, we HAD to throw it out). On the upside, as long as you live in an area with more than one Starbucks, transferring is pretty painless."
good,Work life balance is horrible. People call out all the time and stressful. Schedule is always changing because of call outs working from home way to much as manager.
good,"Like most places depending on your store volume it can be challenging. Slower stores are a breeze, busier store are difficult because you need to be on the floor helping as opposed to doing operations. They give little as far as labor, so you count as a barista. DM was temporary and expectation were too high. Lost 4 store managers in the 6 months she stood in."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast-paced environment and challenges its employees to think critically and quickly to achieve the best results possible. The flow of business can be sporadic, but Starbucks gives their employees excellent tools on how to navigate operations on a daily basis."
good,"Starbucks has great benefits. They call their employees ""Partners"". The work life balance is amazing. The only issue I encountered was favoritism. Policies applied to certain people and not others."
good,Low pay and flexible hours make for a great job for high schoolers and college students. Its fast paced to build stamina and time management. Fairly easy as long as you are prompt and efficient.
good,Very nice atmosphere had such a good time with all the crew even the management they were all very kind and trained me as best as they could.
good,Working at Starbucks has its ups and downs. It depends on the kind and amount if customers you get. It depends a lot on the work climate and who works there. Starbucks in general in a very good Company.
good,"Even though the company has good benefits like free lunches and full benefit packages for part time labor, the messy company outlook with constantly changing policies and lack of communication with the partners makes working for the company hardly worth it."
good,"My review of Starbucks, Was a good look into the service industry which i think that everyone should go through. Learned good communication skills as well as team building skills."
good,Fast paced environment. Food industry background huge plus! Customers often ask for drinks to remade and Starbucks give employees the initiative to do it.
good,"Make it worth while. It’s a calm job, although you have to be quick on your feet. I caught on pretty fast due to my job history. Poor management, and poor organization."
good,I love my co-workers as well as my boss but the amount of work we do is not worth the pay. It's a good temporary job and nice to get connections but other than that I wouldn't stay long term if I knew I had a promise future of management position.
good,Pay is awful but you do get benefits starting at 20 hours per week (part-time). The only real reason to work there is the culture and team environment (if you're lucky enough to have a good team and manager).
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work while you're trying to get on your feet in a new area. It provides a lot of flexibility to its workers as far as scheduling is concerned. Management seems cohesive and goal-oriented, so it's easy to know what your team needs to improve upon to push your store to a higher standard of excellence. They place their customers' happiness at the forefront of everything they do, which can sometimes be taken advantage of by more difficult patrons."
good,"This was a chapter in my life and I am glad to say its over, the managment at alton and rancho was terrible, I had a work related injury I delt with by myself , but overall it was enjoyable when I got to connect with the customers."
good,"Starbucks was a physically demanding job that required your mental and physical best. At times it was draining and exhausting but the people always made your job easier and doable. The ability to receive benefits from the company was always my reason for working there. The pay was often lower than what I felt the work deserved, but the benefits were essential."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks for the last 10+ years and I love my coworkers.  Although it can be stressful at times most of your customers make the job worth it.  My biggest struggle is getting at least 30 hours a week.  Depending on management and demand your hours will vary.
good,It's been great working for Starbucks. It taught me that you can work under pressure and still having fun with staff. The working tasks were very organised and because of that motivating and fulfilling.
good,I think the company's reputation allows for the customer base to just be completely insufferable and it's not a job that a lot of people can honestly handle (the need for benefits aside) and the high level of turn around hurt because of how extensive the training needs to be the keep the store running optimally.
good,My manager didn't manage well but the work environment is was pretty comfy and I got to know my co workers pretry well. Closing sucks if you have to solo close
good,Was very fast paced which made the day go faster. Customers were all different but wonderful. I enjoyed creating the perfect latte or cappuccino. Morning shifts allow you to continue your day to day things.
good,"This company does not pay you nearly enough for how much they ask of you. Customer service is the same in every company, pitiful and lack support/respect. If your life is coffee, if you need flexible scheduling, if you like part time hours, if you are a super people person then this is the job for you. If your heart isn’t in any of the above mentioned, this job is *not* for you. This job was solely convenient for me. It was not stimulating nor satisfying. I spent 5+ years here and I would not go back. If the company at least paid better and it treated it’s employees better, it would be deserving of a high rating. Unfortunately, it does not."
good,"Great place to work while I was in college. Very early hours, mostly 6 hour shifts. All the free coffee you could dream of!! Still miss getting a discount."
good,Fast-paced working environment with great customers. There are many customers that you are able to connect with from various backgrounds. That is the most enjoyable and refreshing part of the job.
good,"Starbucks has the ability to appear outwardly appealing to a young audience looking for work after high school. However, it is not worth it with low pay (lower than state minimum) by use of an excuse of tips being included as apart of your pay. My location was constantly busy, but had the 2nd lowest tip rate in the entire city. Therefore we were always paid under minimum wage. They were also sued by another barista in the state as they were found out to be neglecting state law on over time. Their benefits are only usable by those who work a certain number of hours, which any manager seems very keen to make sure any one employee does not hit without themselves being very pushy."
good,Great for growth and advancement . Great benefits  stock medical employee perks flexible hour s .build relationships with partners and customers experience
good,I've been with the company for a while and all I can say are the benefits and regulars are what keep you around. You're paid to do everything possible in the store other than handle money.
good,"There is a time frame that you are expected to know very little, but after that you need to be able to multitask well and without much supervision. It can be physically exhausting and mentally dulling. Your coworkers are what will make or break your time there."
good,Starbucks is a great company and i will strongly encourage any teen to work there and take full advantage of the benefits. Especially for college and savings.
good,Its a good company on the outside and generally on the inside. The work balance has taken a toll. Low labor hours are given each day but they want sky high customer counts and 45 seconds or less at the window times when most of our sandwiches even take a minute in the oven.
good,"Easy to learn the basics and easy to do the work if you apply yourself. Most stores suffer from understaffing, which makes it difficult to do the tasks asked of you in the time required. Many corners often get cut as a result."
good,"Starbucks used to be seen as a progressive company when it came to benefits and taking care of employees.  And I won't lie, they're pretty dang good. They take care of us. But the amount of work and stress required for a wage that's barely livable and hours that are barely full time, it is not worth it.  I love the people I work with, sometimes I get upset with management and how things are handled but it varies from store to store."
good,"I worked morning shifts (as early as 3:30 AM) which starts off with making coffee, counting sandwiches, stocking up, and dating every item possible. Management was alright. This job shows you how well people work as a team, what happens when someone's missing and how to handle it, and how to work well under pressure."
good,The management was unfair and very biased. Favoritism played a very big role with scheduling and time off. Co-workers also played favoritism and there was no team work.
good,Starbucks does tend to treat their employees quite well. Breaks are allowed and business on the floor tends to be organized. The benefits you receive by being a partner are not bad as well.
good,"If you can keep a smile on your face while a grown man is yelling at you for making his blended beverage too blended, you will enjoy working at Starbucks."
good,"Mornings are crazy and can get hectic especially if your shift manager is a stressful person. Partners are generally decent human beings + easy to get along with. You get free drinks before, after + during any shift so if you're of the little to no sleep culture like most of us are, working for a coffee shop might be your best choice. Starbucks has done an OK job in terms of how they treat their employees by instituting progressive policies such as paid time off, offering healthcare, dental, vision and life insurance and a 401k amongst other benefits (beanstock?). The salary needs to be more though. I cannot stress enough the importance of being paid a living wage in todays economic climate and especially if you live in a big city. Working at a cafe store is much more different (relaxed, chill, less demand) than a drive-thru starbucks (fast-paced, speed oriented, very demanding)."
good,"I think that management should be carefully looked at, and that would improve work attitudes. Have more district meetings in the greater Seattle areas and it might help get people you need in to manage well."
good,So the location I worked at was amazing we had almost always amazing customers and the job has some amazing benefits. The pay was alright not the greatest considering how much work you actually put into the job.
good,Was a good place to work. It had flexible hours and was a fun environment. A good place to get customer service experience and get to know the customers.
good,"Being a part of the Starbucks family is a wonderful experience. Learning the product and brand is made easy by a great team of people who are supportive, easy going, and fun to work with"
good,"Prós:Ótimas pessoas para se trabalhar"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks, however some of my shift leaders and co-workers would get so stressed during the shift that they would take it out on other workers."
good,I've been at Starbucks 4 years now and it's a solid job. Stores are varied in work environment. I've been in stores with high amounts of drama and then stores that have been a great work environment. Company gives great benefits but the pay is too low for the amount of work that goes into the job. My pay after 4 years is $9 and hr when it should be more like $11-12. I've considered being a Shift but considering it's only $2 more an hour but 100 times more responsibility I'll pass.
good,"Starbucks offers a great work culture, there is much to be learned throughout the day from drink preparation to customer connection. Much can be learned from simply working at Starbucks, including soft skills when speaking to people and having to handle difficult situations. In a way most of the day is repetitive, same customers at the same hour, however, it's different customers that make you ask ""how can I perform y job better?""  There is not much to stress about in this job, as it can seem overwhelming at times, your routine at Starbucks becomes second nature."
good,"Starbucks provides the opportunity to grow as much as you want with them. If you take their tools seriously, you may advance fairly rapidly. Benefits are great."
good,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at the location I was employed. It may be a different environment at other stores, as well as may be a different experience for someone else."
good,"This is a great place to work if you're a people person. I was only there for 3 months because I was offered a better job opportunity, but this is a good job for someone with an erratic schedule. Hours and shifts are very flexible."
good,Fun and can give you a lot of skills and experience with customer service. And they take great care of there employees. Makes it hard to ever quit. But its very Stressful at the same time.
good,"Starbucks has a great work culture and benefits, unfortunately they are not the best at giving you the staff you need to accomplish all that they want you to do and all that you would like to do."
good,Overall the benefits are great however the work life home life balance is uneven and its hard to juggle the two. The work environment was fun most of the time but theres a lot of drama and stress. It's a great place to work but it's not for everyone.
good,I loved working at Starbucks. They offer good hourly pay plus tips and a ton of Benefits. They are good with working around your schedule and value family time.
good,"was promised so many advancements , never got it people outside would get pronmoted and do favoirtism which sucks good benefits but barley any hours there"
good,I loved working at Starbucks.  I had 2 great managers.  The people there were awesome.  Starbucks has a great work culture and excellent training program.  unfortunately I was only getting paid $8.30/hr in 2016.  the tips average out to a dollar an hour (you have to split it amongst your coworkers).  I couldn't afford groceries and I could barely make my rent (and that's with even splitting the cost of rent for my studio with my roommate).  I left for that very reason. I was financially sinking further and further into debt just to afford food and a roof over my head as I was charging everything on my credit card.  something in me clicked when I realized I was working so hard in a busy starbucks busting out those drinks like a machine during peak hours and I couldn't even get by.  It was infuriating.
good,It was cool nice warming but I was a person who didn't drink coffee but loved the smell of it. Pay was ok around the time I was working there because I was young and had no responsibilities. But now it's me and 2 beautiful children I have too be able to take care of.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks because the people were friendly and my first manager was awesome. It was a fast paced environment and being able to multitask is essential to working here.
good,"starbucks was a good place for me.it was fun,all partners were friendly there.but that is not kind of a job which im really interested in.i was a newcomer to this country and it was a good place to start.connecting with new people,making some money ,and lots of new things that i was involved with. my manager was awesome.after i got more experienced in my job there was almost nothing to be worried about and i had everything under control.i believe i enjoyed every single moment of my job even when an annoying thing would happen."
good,"When I first began working at Starbucks, the culture was all about the customer experience and making sure that we created positive moments. We were always encouraged to have coffee tastings, and our customers loved our store. However, it began changing into a sales-based job, where we were expected to move quicker, sell more, and pressure our customers into buying food. We lost our customer focus and the customers noticed and began moving on to other coffee shops."
good,"Starbucks is a great job to have. Always a fast pace day, dealing with customer non stop. I've learned how to make drinks and how to have a connections with with day people."
good,"I enjoyed working here for a couple years but after a while, the job changed and became stressful due to changes made to the particular location I worked at. After some stressful events and lack of advancement, I decided to quit. I enjoyed working there initially though, building relationships with my coworkers and customers was a plus and I enjoyed getting creative with the drinks developing some of my own recipes and concoctions that became a hit among my co-workers as well!"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty awesome when you are greeted by smiling faces and your regular customers. I wouldn't trade those memories for anything in the world . I learned a lot about how every person is more than a transaction but they have their own individual lives and problems that make them who they are and getting to know them is a tremendous opportunity. The only problem I have though is that the customer interaction part is lost to the Store Managers because they are more focused on turning a profit and not being on the floor to help when work is busy.  Playing favorites is also a very big issue in the company that I have seen a lot of management guilty of and that is also a con to working here. The work is fine, the culture is great, but the Store Managers make it place you dread to come to sometimes."
good,I am responsible professional and autonomy. Punctual i know how to lead a team. I like challenges to motivate my team to achieve goals. I want to give the best service to customers.
good,It was fun working there. Lots of room for growth. Always stayed busy. Worked with my daughters schedule. Met a lot of great people. Learned a lot of new things.
good,It was ok but there was a lot of hidden drama and favoritism going on. I felt like I was being treated unfairly and not cared for. It could just be the location I was at but I would rather work with a local coffee shop than a corporate one.
good,"It's an alright job if you just need something quick, there's not many chances to grow in the company. I was desperate for work so I ended up taking the job."
good,"Good place to work if you want a part time job, and better then minimum wage. The customers can start to make the job tolling. You do get free coffee when you are there however."
good,manager was not the best especially if you knew more about the coffee that they served then they did and you were going to be a black apron and the manager was only a green apron
good,"This job teaches fantastic skills to improve work ethic, and allows many opportunities for growth, both personal and within the company. It's not easy, but its well worth the work put in."
good,great job for high school or college students. depending on management they usually work around your schedule. sometimes they do overwork you though and the people there can be very cliquey\
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 8 years. I was promoted to Shift Supervisor after only 6 months. They offered me many opportunities to advance, but I knew that I didn't want to make it a career so I did not move forward with them. Starbucks has an amazing sense of teamwork. I worked in 4 different locations, with countless partners, 6 store managers, and enjoyed all of them - even the harder baristas to work with and the tougher managers. I had a chance to meet some amazing people, and some of my old customers are even friends on mine on Facebook. I quite loved the job. That being said the pay is too low for how much work is required. There is a wild amount of work expected of you. I am a very hard working individual, and will always get done what needs to be done - usually with a smile on my face. I don't complain. But I watched several people physically have mental breakdowns in front of me, including some of those 6 store managers. The company has the best benefits any job has ever offered me, some of the people I worked with are still my best friends, I gained a really amazing knowledge on coffee that I am genuinely grateful for. But I would never excel with the company because they expect you to do 7 peoples work with only 3 on staff, and for wildly low pay. Those do not sit right with me."
good,"I learned that working at Starbucks is a high paced job, and the breaks were at not given at times to meet the demand of customers. There were very little opportunities for advancement but the people you work really make a difference."
good,"Worked here for 3 years.  Great insurance, great customers and great partners.  Pay was really low. They require a lot for so little.  All in all I did love my time here though"
good,"Every store is different. My first store was a fantastically managed, well-staffed location with fun, interesting, but still professional coworkers. I worked briefly in the city, and pretty much found the opposite of that in the store in which I landed. When I went back to my first store, it was more or less the same, though not managed as well anymore (new manager, the old one got a promotion), and so the store's middle-leadership was... varied. The one I then transferred to in Long Island was workable, though understaffed. The final one was a drive-thru-only location, and something about the management and coworkers made the almost-torturously slow pace even worse, and I eventually quit. Learning the drinks isn't difficult, it's just repetition. If you're shy, this is the job to break you out of your shell. Customers... well, it's retail and foodservice, it's always going to be difficult due to people, but with the right disposition, anyone with a hint of patience will do well here."
good,"The company as a whole has very good values and cultures, but there is a disconnect between those making the ""rules"" and those who have to work according to the rules. Many times they are not realistic and end up causing many of the baristas to end up having bad shifts because of it."
good,"People I work with are amazing, so are the customers."
good,"Was part of the Teavana management team that was laid off due to the store closing all locations in North America..  The transition was not done to basic recruitment standards.  Recruiters not calling back for weeks.  Severance delayed because they ""did not realize I didn't transfer to Starbucks"".  Not being considered for positions highly qualified for.  That said, the company is awesome and should not be judged on this recruitment fiasco."
good,"2 great starbucks locations inside the rio. management could be better, work can be stressful but we pull through. you learn something new everyday working with SOME FOLKS there."
good,"The job was great, work was great as well, there was stability and a daily routine. I definitely loved the set schedule however the management and professionalism was horrible. Favoritism played too much of a part and the women, all snobby for no reason towards new and old workers."
good,I worked part-time and the managers gave me almost no hours on the actual bar. It was fast all the time and when a drink was late and I try to apologize to the customer about the wait my MOD often ridiculed me about it. My other co-workers were nice and willing to help. Honestly it just wasn't the job for me. If you enjoy a fast pace environment and multitasking it's the place for you.
good,Had a hard time because manager quit but before that it was very enjoyable. Great hours and great people. Learned a lot of skills that i didn't have before.
good,"tips per week was from 10 to 20 dollars "
good,"Starbucks is a great company. They offer great benefits such as free tuition, 401k, stock options, paid vacation, and advancement opportunities. Management can be great, but it can also be very bad."
good,job is fine once you learn your way around it. pay is very low even after 5 years. management varies store to store. you are on your feet all day. free food and drinks which is cool.
good,"They will teach you proper training skills both with hands on training and computer training. The management can either be great or not depending on the manager you work for. The workplace itself can be a bit fast pace and stressful, but if you have trained well on bar and can multi-task drinks you should be good other then that someone would jump in on bar with you if you struggle. Hardest part of the job is just being able to ""perfect"" bar to be able to create drinks perfectly steaming milk perfectly making perfect consistency of Frappuccinos while also multi-tasking working on two drinks at once or even three. Enjoyable part is your co workers and customers seem to lighten up the work day or the stresses of it."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, it provides free schooling and pretty great benefits."
good,I loved working at Starbucks it was a fun work environment! I was able to keep up with school and still work. The work was easy and making drinks was vary fun!
good,"The most enjoyable part working a seaworld was, seeing all the people smile to see Shamu. For them to have a story to tell when they go back to their countries."
good,"buen ambiente laboral, buena remuneración, trabajo entretenido"
good,from the minute you start until the minute you get off its non stop. go go go. there is no real time to stop and think because the demand is high within a fast paced job such as this one.
good,"The shop operates like a Starbucks, with fewer benefits for employees because Sodexo essentially pays to use the logo and coffee. Being in one of several assigned positions meant very repetitive tasks in a strictly codified procedure that somehow becomes chaotic in rushes. Food is pre-prepared (and expensive) and it's hard to put very much personality into the service. One supervisor was highly critical, the other laissez-faire. I enjoyed training and working with the student employees on evening shifts. Benefits were relatively decent."
good,"as a job when it was good it was great, but during difficult times it was very stressful and draining, Im hoping in the future there are more benefits for baristas"
good,Se aprende mucho tanto sobre la empresa como a nível de atención al cliente y trabajo en equipo.
good,"The benefits and support provided is great at Starbucks if you seek it. "
good,most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with many different people on a daily basis but also seeing a lot of the same customers everyday and getting to know them more through daily interactions. it is a pretty fast paced job and can be a bit stressful at times but its a good/fun time nonetheless.
good,"A typical day at work starts with setting up the store for operations like the bar and pastry case and checking that the cafe area is clean. "
good,I started working in starbucks at safeway when I got hired and loved it. I worked there a year and was promoted to supervisor of the department which was stressful but I had a great crew so it was fun too at times. The only thing about it that causes stress is you have to follow Safeways guidelines as well as Starbucks but sometimes they don't see eye to eye and you are stuck in the middle. As a clerk it is a fun job to do and if you do it try to get the morning shifts they are the busiest and your time flys by.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, but I just wasn't getting paid enough for all the work I was doing. my manager was great and always tried to make everyone happy."
good,This was a fast-paced multi-tasking position.  Dealing with difficult people was the hardest part of the job. Getting to know different kinds of people was amazing!
good,I really enjoy working at this Starbucks I love customer service and enjoy interacting with the customers! But my management is very unprofessional and they go off of who they like the best not who works the hardest!
good,"Great place when you are a student or a summer job room to progress help a lot of charities which staff can take part in "
good,"It's retail, so it's rough. Coworkers make or break the job and, generally, Starbucks recruits well. I'll never regret it because of the people I met."
good,great environment to work in. just needs a corporate team that actually cares about the employees. company focuses to much on the happiness of the customer before the partners.
good,"I love the company, but it is so stressful day in and day out. The high turn over rate makes it hard to keep good people around that are capable of doing the job. The amount of benefits you get and extras the company gives you are pretty decent."
good,"Starbucks is a great environment to work in, it is always busy so you have to be able to do multiple jobs at any given time although the atmosphere is incredible."
good,Starbucks argentina te permite una buena disponibilidad horaria. Un armonioso clima laboral y una buena preparación para lo que es el trabajo a realizar
good,"The job itself is the best job there could be in the food and. Everage industry. Although the management needs improvement, the workers gets along well, if you can work a fast pace environment dealing with customers that are in a rush this is a job for you !"
good,"Great to work for as manager, however they could do a lot better for hourly partners, they are expected to do a lot of work for min pay, and not enough is done to allow managers to staff and retain great employees."
good,"At starbucks, they treat you as a leader and train you thoroughly- the hours match up to whatever you need and the people you work with are generally very motivated!"
good,"I fell in love with the company but it has been a hard couple of years. They put a lot on the store managers without giving them the necessary tools, people and products to do their job."
good,"fun environment, great engagement with customers but very fast pace. Management isn't great as everything is all over the place at times, for example shortage of supplies"
good,We as Baristas are showing passion for coffees and customer services besides just brewing coffees. We also have a high standard requirement of keeping the store clean. We as baristas have to adapt to the busy and fast pace working environment while keeping up on a cheerful personality. Cashier handlers will be more in promoting the company's product where the cashiers will have a high knowledge of the product understanding. For example : the different kinds of coffee beans.
good,"Manager is amazing, coworkers and supervisor not so much. I dealt with  a lot of racism when the manager wasn't around, and hazing. So much so I took months off."
good,"I loved working at starbucks and would've stayed had it paid a little more. It is definitely a fast paced environment, and takes a little while to get adjusted. But they are super friendly no matter what establishment you go to, and you'll always make friends."
good,"This is by far the most challenging job I have ever had, but it is also very fun.  It is constantly busy which makes the time go by fast, but by the end of the day you are drained of all your energy.  At my location management is great! They really take the time to find a schedule that best fits you. Overall experience is great!"
good,"Great company to work for. With great benefits, But expect lower wages. As a store manager day to day challenges that makes the job exciting. But can be Demanding with your work life balance."
good,Realmente el ambiente de trabajo es excelente por las mismas personas que trabajan ahí pero la paga es pésima.
good,Good workplace and company culture. I've worked at 5 different locations in 5 different cities and have concluded that the district manager and store manager set the mood of the entire workplace. There is also a lot of pressure to finish so many tasks that I have found myself having to cut my breaks during my shift.
good,The company in general helps create new business and job openings for people but they do not value their employees. It is hard to have a personal life outside of work due to inconsistency with the schedule.
good,"I loved my coworkers, the customers were always nice, it fun at times but always extremely busy. My manager worked with my schedule until I started school so I had to quit."
good,"In the summer always the store is always full so we had to work hard as a team."
good,"It can feel like family at the store you work, you get to meet new faces everyday, make new friends, and develop as long as you dedicate to do so."
good,"Starbucks in general is a good company with good benefits ad pays a reasonable wage (usually starting out above minimum wage) with special perks like weekly tips, free coffee, healthcare for part time employees, etc. However, it is not a relaxed coffee shop feel as some expect. A lot is expected and demanded of workers and one is often falling behind and unable to keep up with the rigorous demands of the customer flow and daily duties. If you are a quick learner, love a fast paced environment, and don't mind dealing with a variety of customer service issues and physical cleaning, it can be a fun job! But don't expect to be getting payed to stand around and chat, because that is a rarity, especially with drive through, stores."
good,It's an easy place to work and management is flexible with schedules. There's room for growth and customer relationships are valuable.
good,The job is VERY fast paced and you always go home feeling exhausted. The pay is better than other big fast food companies but you have to work as hard as 2 or sometimes 3 people. The people you work with always are close because everyday you leave feeling like you survived a war together. That and Starbucks does a great job creating a strong culture around coffee. The management in several locations always leaves something to be desired.
good,"fun environment with good people and regular customers that I got to know and become friends with. I love making coffee drinks, so this job is really fun for me."
good,The management sucks. It's not everybody though. Just one in particular. The coworkers are amazing people. The pay was amazing for me at the time.
good,"Ambiente de trabalho despojado, profissional e agradável. Dinamismo nas áreas de trabalho, excelente relação com colegas e gerência."
good,"My work day varied based on the position I held for each shift.  Each day, updated recipes, menu changes and system updates would be learned."
good,"The work at Starbucks was my introduction to the work place. Overall, it was a job that required you to be able to multitask and handle your portion of the work in order to have a smooth running team to handle any difficulties. Any one person who was not doing their portion would of drastically affected customer ratings and productivity within the sore."
good,"bueno aprendí a relacionarme mas con las personas, tuve una buena acogida, me apoyaron bastante en el mes de mi entrenamiento."
good,"At my old store unfortunately the management was horrible, but my old employees had been some of the greatest people i met. Everyone has a great personality they are energetic and make the job fun. Best part of the day is when you can say ""we did it"" when we get a rush during happy hour. Wost part if when you walk in and its so packed you cant clock on fast enough to help out. But it showed me great customer service, communication with customers, great work ethic ect."
good,"Typical work day at Starbucks is long day where you might start sounding like robot at the end of the night. I have learned with my time at Starbucks; a lot of coffee knowledge that I didn't know there was, also learned how to multitask a little better with all the beepers and timers going off. Management always means well, and there is always opportunity to move up and beyond in the company if you are striving for it. My coworkers were the best they could be, smiling, always making things right for the costumers, and helping out after hours to make sure projects around the store were done. The hardest part of the job was making sure that every costumer had their drinks and food items in timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment it self that Starbucks has created in their stores: Welcoming, kind, caring, and togetherness."
good,This was a decent company to work for. Scheduling was terrible and it was impossible to get a shift covered if you fell ill or needed to take off work.
good,Mostly got tired of dealing with the customers . Some can be very demanding with little idea that employees are people too. Co workers for the most part were okay.
good,An excellent team environment to work in.  Great interpersonal skills are an asset because you can build a lot of meaningful friendships within this company.
good,"Difficult having a work life balance, but only at the management level. Work goes by very quickly and while I enjoy(ed) my job and position there it makes it very difficult having a family to take care of. If partners made more money I would easily stay with the company at a lower level, but the pay isn't enough to support a family. This job is great for a young, coffee loving person who wants to gain experience and knowledge to develop in their career. I have nothing but the upmost respect for Starbucks but it unfortunately does not work with my personal life anymore or I would stay."
good,"Being a shift supervisor, my typical day would consist of continuous cash handling, task delegating, and problem solving in order to get tasks competed within an allotted amount of time with my team. Within this position I have gained problem solving skills and have learned to plan ahead of my schedule so that I set myself up for a great work day. I also gained the confidence to have fierce conversations with my peers. I worked alongside 3 other supervisors and my store manager. My store manager is very personable and friendly and really depends on her supervisor team to complete store goals and tasks. My co workers are great; each with their own ideas to bring to the table and very independent workers, but even better as a team. But the hardest part of my job would be my pay rate and the conditions that we are under as a company. For $12.20 an hour, I am expected to meet the expectations of a person earning salary, and I am finding it harder to support myself, even while working overtime most days. Also, our company as a whole is really tight on labor so customer service is looked over because we have become more task oriented rather than guest oriented. But through it all, I have a great time at my job at the end of the day. I love leading my team to daily successes and becoming a stronger worker everyday and learning how to coordinate my way through managing a business on my own."
good,"i worked for Starbucks for almost two years, and grew a lot in terms of customer service. it is a good job if you are looking for something to give you experience. I quickly made my way up to a Supervisor position. the only thing that turned me off about this job was the company itself. Starbucks ( as much as they preach partnership and such) is not good to their employees. they make changes without notifying us and make us deal with the back lash. They make horrendous rules that are  not necessary for the survival of the company yet make their employees do them just for the sake of credibility"
good,"I'd clock in and be assigned either on register, bar (making the drinks), or customer support (maintain store clean and restock all areas needed). I learned how to be productive and social while maintaining a good pace. Here I was able to work on my people skills. The hardest part of the job was being used as the main barista for all job tasks because there was lazy hires who wouldn't cooperate and do their job. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to connect with my regulars and being able to make them leave completely satisfied with their beverage."
good,"the hardest part about this job is the fact that management is not concerned with individual development; moreover, there are employees that are fully capable of their job and employees that are not."
good,Peak is super fast paced. General Manager sits in the back all day. Co-workers were always friendly and fun. Not a bad place to work if you like fast paced.
good,"-I love helping customers who are polite and patient"
good,"open store, maintain cleanliness and give customer satisfaction. Make drinks and prepare food items, help make lasting impressions on customers.  Co-workers varied, some older some younger, different types of people,  got along well. Hardest part would be aggressive customers. enjoyed fellow partners and regular customers."
good,You will meet some amazing people a long the way. You have to love people and want to work hard. Great company to work for when you are younger.
good,Working with main company and franchise is completely different. Zero hour contract and minimum wages and no share bonus ....
good,"Une journée chez Starbucks est rythmée par les différents rushes (périodes de forte affluence)"
good,"Work is usually pretty busy, but for the most part my co-workers make the work day bearable. The store is in the process of switching management so it has been stressful as everything is changing. The hardest part of the job is being understaffed in the evenings. The most enjoyable part is all of the friends that I have made there."
good,"If you want to spend long hours on your feet making drinks for rude customers with a min wage salary go work at Starbucks. Only thing that kept me there for a year was my manager, she was great. The job it self isn't worth the money and the stress."
good,Fun place to work with supportive management. I love the people I work with but I need to get back into my field. I went to school for Psychology and I love what I used to do.
good,"A typical morning shift includes preparing the food case for the day and setting up all the coffee machines and putting away freight starting at 4am. After morning prep, there are rushes of customers who need to be taken care of and in between the rushes we clean and stock all the supplies we need for the next rush."
good,"If you are a coffee lifer or trying to get thru school to get to your real passion I life then this is the place for you.  It's not the easiest place to work and can be stressfull at times but the family environment trumps all of the bad stuff.  7 years of my life was spent there and though I only found one store where I didn't quite fit, it's a great company as a whole where the higher ups actually listen to you and you matter as a person."
good,Great place to work but the move up process is not great. Not enough training time or one on one training to make sure things happen
good,I like the job a lot but the pay isn't great. day to day is busy and requires a lot of customer service. i love the pace and customer interactions. the company values its employees and their are opportunities to grow.
good,typical day at work can be very chaotic but fun with all the communication between your team. I learned to be patient with people who come to Starbucks and have no knowledge of the types of things Starbucks can do. Management is different for every store i think. Hardest part of the job is being able to keep calm while its chaotic. Most enjoyable part of the job is going above and beyond for a customer and seeing their face light up in gratitude.
good,"to work for Starbucks is fun and its a chance to learn new things, developing new skills and the best part is meeting new friends. It is possible to grow in this company with a hard work and positive attitude. Starbucks is choosing their partners very carefully, we all have to be with a positive look and willing to learn. the amazing part is that i meet a lot of new people, and from customers they have become important part of my life, i know what their kids do, where r they going for holidays and where their are working etc"
good,"I have a great manager at startbucks, she listens to her employees, and helps them when she can. She came in after our team was already established, she didnt try and change everything all at once, she asked for opinions and ideas. She does what she can to help us and that makes a huge difference."
good,Starbucks is a fun fast paced job. You meet a lot of new people. It is fun for the most part but also stressful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers sometimes it can be really difficult.
good,I have been enjoying my time with this company. It has been beneficial to my time and personal growth. I recommend it to students ages 16-20
good,The environment is amazing and the team work phenomenal. However it is an exhausting job that requires you to be on your feet for the entirety of your shift. The average customer is nice and caring however there are several customers that could put you off.
good,"I work inside of one of the largest Starbucks in the country, one of the only 24 hour locations in the Southern United States, so there's plenty of pressure to perform. As of right now, I have a great general manager, he is trying very hard to regulate store flow to the lives of the employees to better benefit us and the store. He is a pleasure to work with, as are most of the shift leaders and assistant managers he has hired as well. The hardest part of this job would honestly just have to be the snobby, self-entitled customers (but they're everywhere so you simply go about your day once they finally leave), otherwise drink making and prep is fairly simple. Multitasking is a fun thing to do, keeps you busy and keeps your mind going."
good,"on a typical day I opened the store and was the first person most of our customers would talk to. I greeted all of them as if I was excited to see them. "
good,I enjoy serving my customers and working with my team. I don't appreciate management and the way they treat their employees. This is why i'm currently seeking employment
good,"Going to work was great, but adjusting to the speed of your already working peers was pressure inducing. Welcome to the world of coffee, yes you will learn everything about coffee, It's trivial but another piece of knowledge. Bosses will always be bosses, still they are very understanding. The environment will show contrast to your working peers. Hardest part of this job is adjusting to speed level, memorization is necessary. But hey you have a great day talking to over zealous customers and making aromatic art!"
good,"I don't know if it's just my store, but my co-workers are just amazing people to work with. They are the sole reason I am still working there at the moment."
good,"Working at starbucks can often be a stressful job, however a close working relationship with staff can make the experience worthwhile"
good,Great and fun place to work when management is involved in a positive way if not horrible but overall it was good.
good,"As a shift  manager the position requires someone to oversee the employees on their shift. To manage, delegate and ensure operational tasks are performed by the baristas. The shift manager is also required to manage aspects of profits and losses, inventory, scheduling, promotions and labor and to perform any additional tasks delegated by the upper management."
good,"I worked for a very high volume Starbucks profiting about $5,500 on average a day. The hardest part of the job was managing several different jobs at one time i.e being on register and bar at the same time. However I felt as though I got along with my supervisors and fellow partners very well and we did our best to work together."
good,"-everyday was cool and enjoy, i learned alot about this job"
good,"Typical day would be to dress to impress"
good,Great benifits with the company. Some days can be stressful and really busy. Always have fun with the employees though.
good,"I learned a lot and it was a fun place to work. I worked at the busiest Starbucks in Memphis, so we were busy from open to close.I enjoyed learning and mastering all of the beverages."
good,"Starbucks if one of, if not the best at customer service. i work in a drive thru i see many people and am able to connect with some many people from one location. i learned you have to take initiative no matter where you are in the store. my manager is the best! she knows what is happening with everyone in every position, so if she is at the back of the store she will always be asking what is going on, always checking in. the hardest part of my job is getting up early and having very little down time. once we are there we are going. my co workers range from kids in high school to people that are retired and want to keep busy. Some of the hardest working people i know work at Starbucks. the most enjoyable is that customer one on one connection, been if it really busy you can still connect and have a great conversation with someone."
good,A typical day was very busy and consistent movement. My coworkers made the job bearable.
good,"My overall experience with Starbucks is great. I had the opportunity to work with so many talented people from employees to guest all the way to our techs. Our days would start around 4am and my 7am we are so busy all the way until 11am then we would enter our lunch rush around 1230p. As a company 70% of our business happens before 11am in the morning. The benefits package that Sbux presents to its Partners (employees) is amazing. 401K, Health, Life, Stock Options, Discounts and the list of benefits goes on. Our days would be filled with many tasks that were customer focused, BOH focus and then I would be responsible for the management / administrative aspect of the business. Processing Payroll, creating schedules, review, interviews, hiring, training, coaching, corrective actions, inventory, ordering, promotions, demotions and separation and all other duties that come with running a retail establishment. My upper management was always very inspiring, understanding and supportive. The only negative thing about the SM position is that there is NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. Working beyond 55 hrs a week was pretty normal. Myself and other managers would work 55-60 hours a week. Overall my experience with Sbux was great, they are a great company to be a part of."
good,"Since I was promoted to the manager position last year, there has been a sharp increase in sales—particularly over the last two quarters. Our conversion rate hasn’t dipped below 70 percent, and we’ve met segment goals in each department 80 percent of the time, which is the highest percentage in our region."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. Of course being at work at 4am sucked but getting off early was a plus. Free beverages on your breaks and discounts on food too! I did hate how corporate it was. You would always see so many stuck up managers come in, inspecting everything you do. Also getting those bogus test every month where they graded you was lame as well."
good,"Working at Starbucks was definitely an experience. I'm appreciative that I got to learn how to make and what was in all of those beverages. It was fascinating how many orders you could make so fast with the system they have. Every day was pretty much the same, depending on business. I made the same drinks the same way for the same regular customers. All of my co-workers were great, because they were around my age and really fun. Management was organized but did not seem to be very productive. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I could paint my nails, do my hair, and not have to wear a hat like my previous job. It was a very relaxed environment. The hardest part of the job was the strange scheduling with different shifts every week differing between days, time of shift and amount of hours. It was nearly impossible to make plans."
good,its a pretty decent job to work at. the partners are the greatest people to work with.
good,"Although the job was fun while I was a full-time student allowing flexibility of working weekends only, booking several days off to study and what not, it definitely takes a toll on the body, lifting heavy things, putting away orders, and is by no means a way to pay bills as a primary source of income."
good,"Though I worked here for a short while, it was a fun environment with fun co-workers."
good,Starbucks is a very uplifting company to work for it is very diverse and as a barista I have learned to to be customer oriented manageral skills
good,engaging with random people who tend to treat you like family even when you just making they favorite drink all it would take is 3 minutes to make a person day
good,On feet 8 hours straight. repetitive motions. Positive atmosphere created by partners. Management needs to be more educated and work harder at promoting from within. Hardest part of job is dealing with picky customers. The most enjoyable part is making connections with your customers by letting them enjoy free and creative samples.
good,"management is good, coworkers are nice, training in the beginning is a bit overwhelming, free drinks during shifts, decent benefits, employee discount..."
good,This is a great job for anyone who is wanted to work with people and be on their feet all day. Free drinks while you're working. Amazing benefits!!!! (money sucks)
good,"I've worked for Starbucks for 2 years. While this was a great company when I started I've seen it decline from a very employee-centric to a bottom-line oriented organization. Employees are becoming numbers and everything is run from the company's headquarters in Seattle, WA...even when they don't understand what goes on in remote locations. My belief in this company has waned over time and I would not work for it again."""
good,"It was a nice and quiet place , great team , I developed my communication skills and I gained a lot of experience , I develop my ability to work under pressure."
good,"I have a love/hate relationship with starbucks. On the one hand they treat me well enough and I enjoy my staff. On the other, i think the company itself cuts corners and puts a larger workload on it's employees than they let on. There is a lot of specialized cleaning and what is essentially acting as a security guard, due to their universal open door policy. In general it's a good work environment, but even as a supervisor i'm not positive if i feel that the compensation reflects the workload."
good,"flexible hours but bad management no hours given its more of a part time job and easy promotion they promote everybody literally , free food good thing"
good,"Working as a barista at Starbucks can be stressful at times, but is also very rewarding. The managers and district managers are hit or miss but usually your team is pretty alright."
good,"This job is an excellent way to make ends meet for all college students, or persons trying to support their family. My experience was Starbucks was that you will never have much downtime, which makes the shifts go by fast, and my team members made the job fun!"
good,Most of the time I didn't mind working there as long you have team that willing to wok together as a team! Which I believe is key to a easier day at  Starbucks on the hill. Had a manager who was there every weekday from 5 in the morning to 4-5 night. He would always make sure we were well stocked and hope on if we needed help on the floor. he would do his best to keep team happy and make sure everything runs smoothly!
good,"I learned a lot about counting a safe and tills, handling money, taking temperatures for products, and how to manage a team of great baristas. I enjoyed making connections with customers and building bonds with coworkers. The hours were long and the weekend and morning rushes can be brutal, but overall when I look back on my time at Starbucks it is a job that I miss."
good,"I love working for starbucks, great benefits, able to advance if wanted. flexible work hours. coworkers are great to work with. An area that needs to improve is hiring store managers."
good,The baristas ran the place which often lead to favoritism and not a structured work environment but also felt like a family and that was nice. But watch out customers are nice but you do anything wrong there whole day is screwed up.
good,I feel like the amount of work that is asked of an employee is unreal compared to the amount of work that is expected. I have worked plenty of jobs that paid me fairly for the amount of work that is being produced. Starbucks is ridiculous when it comes to paying employees. People at this place literally make less than $10 an hour.
good,stressful environment but also had good benefits and flexible work schedule. Supervisors can be micromanage and same goes with management. Partners are supportive.
good,"Being employed by Starbucks did not go how I imagined at all. I knew it was a busy place with a fast paced, competitive environment. Due to my experience as a customer, it was my initial impression that the working environment would be as positive and friendly but it was the opposite. My training was not thorough and management was impatient, rude and unprofessional."
good,"Great environment, great experience, terrible management! The customers show great love and support that it makes you very enthusiastic about coming into work!"
good,"Overworked , not paid enough- tips are nice though and coworkers are amazing work can be fun and stressful most customers are awesome and you always meet new people and try new fun drinks I really love my job at Starbucks but I am disappointed every time I see my paycheck."
good,"Mostly good people. Fast paced environment, requires lots of energy to keep up. Don't recommend for people who cant handle big crowds. Expect to work with young people with underdeveloped work ethic. Definitely could get paid more for the amount of labor, but it's a job that requires no degree."
good,It’s was great there the pay was nice alway had overtime Get a nice discount nice good stocks And could have as much time off as you need and works with your
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced enviornment. Team forward, and there is a lot to learn. The benefits are very nice though, they take good care of staff. Management was okay, but they always hire younf high school kids so theres always some kind of drama and staff cycle through very quickly."
good,"The benefits are outstanding. I recieved my bachelors degree for free with them and started a 401k working part time and had stocks (about 600 dollars) each year to cash out. And they paid for my maternity leave. Buuuut, the work is stressful everyday. It will challenge you everyday. And the pay is WAY too low. The management will always work with you for your schedule or any issues your having. But, the staff is usually very young and thus immature and can be plain mean for lack of a better word. It's a physically demanding job, my body hurt after every shift. So, like everything else in life it has its pros and cons."
good,The company was great to work with until after the drive through were added and they took the whole idea of the third place out the door. Now it's a revolving door of employees being hired.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks involves supervising and assisting team members in delivering a wonderful Starbucks experience to our customers. Here, I have had the opportunity to strengthen my time management and team work kills. The management team is supportive and inspiring and helps to create a comforting and adaptable workplace environment. The most difficult aspect of this job is learning how to effectively manage your time in order to complete your tasks. The most enjoyable part of Starbucks has been learning how to adapt and react in a fast paste environment while providing our customers with a unique coffee house experience."
good,"Store was chronically understaffed so you would work more than one position at a time. One position already requires lots of multitasking so having to take on two of three in an extremely busy store is unrealistic and very stressful.  Not all, but most of my co-workers were overly stressed and often meanspirited/catty. The environment was the most stressful one I've ever been in, made worse by the unreasonable standards Starbucks carries while shorting staff.  Management was good. Customer's were rude and abusive and were supported by the company in their bad behaviors. Overall one of the most stressful, draining, and mentally difficult jobs I've ever had for only 9.50 an hour."
good,"Cool "
good,"It was mostly a pleasant job during the slow periods, however I found that the corporation focused too much on the happiness of the customers than their employees. Customers would often take advantage of the ""make the moment right"" policy and would verbally abuse staff to get free food. It created a culture of entitlement unfortunately, and caused a lot of employees unnecessary stress. However, I did like what they stood for in regard to their fair trade policies, efforts to improve the environment, and their stance on inclusiveness. It was admirable that they would try to constantly improve their corporate responsibility. "
good,"Fun, but can be very stressful at times. Customers can be rude, but all the employees were wonderful! If given the chance and needed to I would go back and work for this company again."
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for 5 years now and I for the most part enjoy it. Just some days are hectic and the morning crew will forever blame the night crew. There are a lot of benefits, alot if free stuff you get when your working, and chances to move up. Alot of mulittasking and craziness but over all it's real and it's fun but it's not really fun ☺️"
good,"An average day requires anywhere from 4-8 hours on your feet.  It is very fast paced, and requires a great deal of patience.  You are dealing with people before their coffee, so they can be very rude and sometimes impossible to deal with.  If you do not enjoy the people you work with, it can be very difficult to handle."
good,Really good culture put in place. Family oriented. Pay structure and job advancement leaves something to be desired but what lacked there was made up for in benefits and schedule flexibility.
good,Fast pace environment and a tough place to start working at first but once you get to know all the roles and recipes it gets better. Store mangers being promoted aren't great workers. Hours are flexible and paid schooling is a big plus. Benefits are the only thing that kept me staying here for 6 years. Customers are not as awful as everyone seems to make them.
good,Fun place to work in an great environment.  Great place to call a 3rd home.  Can get frustrating with the typical entitled Midland person.  Other than that it is a great place to work.
good,"I loved Starbucks. It really opened me up as a person and made me feel more confident in my abilities. I also learned soft skills, like communication, sales, and learning how to recommend products to customers."
good,I loved working for Starbucks but could not understand how the pay was so low.  I transferred from one state to another and actually took a pay cut of more than $2/hr which is insane.  If the pay was even slightly higher I think the retention rate would climb significantly.  My store had great employees and most days were enjoyable.  You must be pretty fit to work there because lots of hustling is involved and downtime is a time for cleaning without much standing around.  The shifts go by quickly and you get free coffee and great benefits.  Just know that the pay is about minimum wage.
good,"When I moved locations, I met a lot of interesting regulars. Fast pace environment. I enjoyed most of my coworkers. The tips were good and very helpful for gas."
good,"There are so many different people that come into the store on a daily basis. Some will make your day, many will just be an interaction, and very few can also break your day and mental stability. "
good,"Alshaya Starbucks is very good place to work, job safety is high. As per me Alshaya company and owner is super honest, they will pay you incentive even market is down and if you achieve your total target."
good,It's a great place to work as a student. Perfect part-time hours to match your variable class schedule and it really depends on the manager you get. Managers can make or break the experience for workers and subordinates.
good,"Muy buena experiencia, se preocupa por supersonal."
good,"I like working at Starbucks in the beginning but from my experience I felt the management was very poor and some workers worked hard than others. "
good,"Fast paced enviroment that requires excellent social and multitasking skills. On your feet all day with limited breaks. Good benefits that include free college online, good medical and dental. Free coffee every week."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks, but the hourly rate, even after cost of living adjustments, is not enough. The cost of living adjustments also caused some of the longer-standing employees to become disgruntled, because the cost of living adjustments only affected the minimum starting salaries. "
good,The store I worked at had a young manager that made our store a hostile environment. I loved the job of making coffee and the customers but the coworkers I had made it a miserable experience
good,"I worked for Starbucks for almost two years. I worked at a Starbucks in Newbury Park, CA and had an amazing experience, but unfortunately I had to transfer stores because I started attending UCSB. I was able to transfer to the Starbucks in Goleta, CA."
good,"Long hours"
good,Starbucks has good benefits but salary wise is a little odd. Working with my manager was great but there are some opportunities to focus on. Overall it was good.
good,I absolutely loved what i did but just some of the coworkers just were not on the same page and once i am disrespected by others i do not feel welcomed. My manger was/is a great one.
good,Fun place to work but gets old fast. Got the job for benefits but as soon as I got them my manager cut my hours for no reason and said it was because of my availability but it never changed and I had plenty of time available.
good,"At Starbucks there is a huge emphasis on customer experience but it comes at the expense of the front-line employees. Baristas are expected to give sterling service even when customers are extremely rude, often times infront of management. We are encouraged to literally give the customer whatever they want, so they leave happy. An alarming percentage of customers have realized this and take full advantage of the store and its policies. Starbucks does however do a fantastic job hiring, and I've bonded with many of my co-workers."
good,"flexible hours ad nice coworkers, really pay attention to your availability and follow it. sometimes can be a stressful work environment. Coworkers are friendly and its easy to talk with management."
good,"Great work environment and awesome coworkers! Benefit package is awesome. Hours very flexible especially if you're going to school. Pay is something to be desired. Tips are nice, but don't make up for pay scale."
good,"It honestly just doesn't pay enough. I learned how to make lots of drinks and how to interact with customers, but with how low the wage is and how little hours I get, I may have to leave. Being a barista just isn't as sustainable as shift supervisor or management."
good,Standing in one place without support is so bad on your back you have to have some type of mat. I was in pain everyday. The management was great. This is all I have to say on this subject.
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work and allows a really good work life balance. It is very fast paced and the customer is always right so it can sometimes be stressful, especially during peak times when customers are in a rush."
good,Starbucks is a greater first job. Especially for students who need a flexible schedule. The workplace culture tends to be pretty fun and relaxed. Depending on what store you're at the management can be great. The most enjoyable part of the job was making lots of friends with coworkers.
good,"Every job has good and bad moments but Starbucks works with you to get to where you need to be. I've been with the company for a little over a year and the benefits are the reason I stay. The hardest part about the job is being able to work with a sense of urgency and being able to make the moment right for every customer. If you have that type of personality then Go for the spot They look for out going individuals that can spread positivity and people that are ""color blind"" meaning seeing the person for who they are and not just the overall appearance."
good,fun. stressful. will test your patience. great customers and people. the most enjoyable part of the job is actually being a barista and seeing a customer love the drink you've made.
good,bien pour etudiant ou personne seul environnement pas mal mais dur pour une vie de famille
good,"For a place with a drive through it's not bad. The benefits are great, and my experience with management was mostly positive. It's still a food service place with a drive-through though, and once you have the hang of everything it will become mind-numbing. That's not necessarily a knock. You could do way worse in terms of mind numbing jobs. Overall decent work environment."
good,Overall Good Environment .Some Co workers are Not cool and other Co workers are cool with you . Rude Customers come up to you with ridiculous Concerns . Especially when it’s busy . Do a lot of stuff on your own on the floor . Poor management from One Manager and I won’t ever work there Again.
good,"The store I had been previously employed at always had a rush. Leaving me with no choice but to adapt quickly, located in Rio Rancho and next to Walmart. You can assume it would always be busy."
good,This job will keep you on your feet 100 percent of the time. Always having something to do . Sometime low staffed but besides all that its an excellent place to work.
good,"Starbucks is a great company that offers tons of benefits. You get free drinks while working, a free food item per day, 30% off when not working, tuition reimbursement through ASU, full heath, vision and dental care as well as many more. However, they have a tendency to not listen to the partners who work there and handle the problems with some of their employees."
good,"The past 9 years has been truly amazing at Starbucks. I have meet so many"
good,"Great place to work, however pay is too low for the work that is expected and for the area. Really liked my manager and that they worked with you as far as a schedule."
good,"This is a great job for students, or to suppliment income. I only worked here during the holidays to make ends meet. Besides the $80 in tips I made on Christmas, this was a crazy place to work."
good,"All of people you work with here and super nice and friendly, just when it comes to certain things you have to be on it. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay organized with everything that you're doing so that you don't get confused with a drink order."
good,"Very fast paced job, but lots of training provided."
good,They don't pay very well but the benefits are good as long as you use them. How much you like your store really varies depending on which location you work and your manager. Managers can be really great or really terrible.
good,"I enjoyed working for starbucks, my location was changed three times and one of them being the district manager opended a express store and wanted a fast pace employee there."
good,"This is just MY opinion. I have talked to many people who love it. I just struggled greatly at Starbucks. Theres like hundreds of combinations of drinks you have to memorize. After 3 months i was still confused about most of the things about this job. There are shots of espresso, pumps of syrup, size, type of drink, type of flavoring x 200 because you had to memorize probably 200 drinks when it came down to it. I don't know how anyone enjoys the job. doesn't have anything to do with management. Just the job duties and responsibilities itself is like almost unrealistic to memorize."
good,"it was my first job, at 18 years old. had a lot of catching up to do with the fast pace of learning drinks recipes, how to operate the cash register, SOP of company. but it was a great experience"
good,Working for a company that is ubiquitous in our society has its perks such as engaging in networking opportunities. The drawback is you are always under staffed and under-appreciated. Extra expectations are put on management for sales but at times it is difficult to predict depending on location and circumstances. The team aspect can be tricky because everyone is accustomed to the autocratic leadership perspective as well. So the community of ideas if you are a barista is not highly regarded.
good,"work typically was easy but you had those days where it would be so fast paced that you wouldnt have a chance to breathe. i learned how to multi task especially being a supervisor you had to be all over the place at the same time. management was alright cuold have been better. hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy everyone, make sure their drinks and food was set out on time, especially if we were understaffed. the most  enjoyable part of this job was building relationships with your customers, those that came by everyday and you would have their drink ready before they even made it to the register. it felt great them paying and you handing them their drink and them being in disbelief that you remembered their order out of so many other customers."
good,It was hard to quit working for Starbucks because I came to love the staff and guests so much. The downside is that the pay is pretty bad (especially when you consider the pace you often have to work at) and raises are very small.
good,"A usual day at work was totally dependent on the shift. Morning shifts were pretty busy, and a lot of tasks had to be completed before opening. Weekend shifts were relatively hectic, especially if we were down a barista. Evening shifts and football Sundays were relatively slow, which gave plenty of time for cleaning tasks."
good,"I happened to have a good manager at my store, but I have had plenty of experience with some not-so-good managers in the region. "
good,"If you are a person who likes to constantly be on the move and learning new things then this job is for you. It is a fast paced, high energy place to work. Management has always been friendly and helpful. SS's can be an array of different things to people. I would give my experience overall a 7 out of 10."
good,A typical day at work was a lot of fun and challenging at the same time. One had to wear many hats in  a store manager position. It was a very competitive environment.
good,"advancement is hard to come by. leadership can be less forgiving. tenured partners are favored. Store level is amazing, working with your subordinates are great. the benefit packages cannot be beat."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks and I found it to be a secure and supportive working environment.  However, nearly everyone in my district including over half of the managers quit because of the district manager.  Even though all other employees had many people that checked and reviewed their job performance, there was no one to check her job performance and realize that there was an issue."
good,"A typical day at work included greeting countless customers through the front lobby or drive-through window and taking food or drink orders, completing drink orders in a timely manner, getting food, taking payment, cleaning, restocking. I learned how to make a wide variety of drinks, how crucial communication is between employees, how to properly handle food, how to brew coffee, and remaining calm in a stressful situations. The management was fair, but I feel that the store could have used more employees for the work hours. Workplace culture was exciting because I learned a lot about my co-workers from working busy mornings and nights with them. The hardest part of the job was not having enough employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting and talking to the customers."
good,"I had enjoyed working for starbucks. I had learned a lot of new skills."
good,"Be ready to move and learn to multi task, talking and making drinks is required and if you're applying to a drive-thru or busy location be ready to be constantly moving."
good,des bon avantages et assurances. belle équipe et beaux clients réguliers
good,"A very inner competitive environment, cut throat. Sales are everything, from barista pushing coffee sales to management pushing baristas to sell the max at all times"
good,Learned a lot about customer service and working as a team. Regular hours and great people to work with. Offers benefits but do nit get paid enough to accpet them.
good,"Management is great, you can set your schedule but pay is horrible especially here in Orlando. If you are a clean person then I suggest to stay away from bar."
good,"Working as a barista is a fun learning experience. Being able to connect with people from something like a cup of coffee is a rewarding way to be apart of that side of someone's life. It can definitely be stressful with all the customers, standards, and expectations. However, making a person's day in the little things with a smile, small conversation, and making them coffee out weighs the stress that comes."
good,"A barista position is great for those in school or just working part-time. Health insurance, employer-matched 401k and stock options available to every employee, part or full-time. For those looking to advance into management, there is room and encouragement for advancement. As with any service job, customer service can be a draining experience, but, overall this is a great atmosphere to work under."
good,"Easy job when you remember the drinks very very easy, you have to remember a lot of stuff sock life ' you have to date the pastries and food you dumb out sauces every day"
good,"I loved my job, I loved how fast paced it was and how there was always something to do. I loved learning all about the company and how to make all the drinks. Unfortunately management wasnt all that great."
good,"Overall, I loved working at Starbucks. I learned a lot about time management, beverage quality, and friendships while at Starbucks. Although, Starbucks did not take good care of their stores; in my year at this particular store, we went through 4 managers, at the district managers request, and the last manager was so uncaring and cold that 15 baristas quit and took their skills elsewhere."
good,It can be an amazing or terrible place to work based on the store manager.  Typical retail environment and customers can be more demanding depending on location
good,"really nice staff,learned how to make certain coffee and what puastries go good with flavors, communication was always a plus, learned how to do the fridges and make whipping cream"
good,"Starbucks is a fast pace job but worth the work. You get to meet great new people, learn about drinks and listen to great music. You also get tobenjoy the look of happy customers who keep coming back so you could make their day again."
good,Great experience great training.  I find more suited for those that are single and have no time restrictions.  There is room for advancement and they encourage personal and professional growth.  I obtained great transferable skills.
good,"As my first job Starbucks gave me everything I needed to direct myself in the working world. A barista's work is very high stress go go go kind of work, at least in the three locations I worked at and customers aren't too hospitable before they have had their morning coffee, but it wasn't a bad place to work, just challenging as any good learning experience should be in my opinion."
good,"Management varies from store to store, but the people who work at Starbucks are make it an enjoyable experience. An average day consists of a morning and afternoon costumer rush, as well as slower periods before, after, and in between. You are constantly busy, cleaning and keeping the store neat if not working the till or making drinks. Starbucks teaches you good time management, team building, and costumer service skills. It is hard to keep up with orders during the rushes, but most patrons understand that orders tend to get backed up."
good,Management not very friendly. They offer loads of over time so the money was very good you start at minimum wage. Benefits are very good for a job like this one
good,"Just don't upset the guests. You will meet great people working here but others aren't so great, some will step on your toes purposely to get their way. Always smile and never argue!"
good,"This was probably my most professional setting, working with a company. They expected dress code, attitude and script appropriation, and consistent awareness of your image to the customers. Being pregnant, I feel I did a very good job, as well as the level in activity I maintained. Wonderful benefits available. However, the location was brand new, and the managerial staff was inconsistent and not strong with communication, leading to lots of tension. It was sort of like high school again."
good,"Really great, early morning hours. Lots of opportunity to excel, but no room for advancement past store manager level. Not much support in store, key holders do not have clearance for a lot of essential operations. Store manager is frequently a barista on sales floor"
good,"Its the best place for youngsters to develop themselves with the best training to baristas, supervisors and managers. "
good,This job was fun for a while. It was just hard to progress up the proverbial ladder. A lot of competition with shift/management positions. (regardless of tenure).
good,"It was a great experience especially with the location I was able to interact with all types of customers, infact i even remembered the names of the regular customers & enjoy making their favorite drinks!"
good,"A typical day at work would include managing money throughout the store and making sure all of my co-workers where well taken care of when it came to giving out breaks.  Giving great customer service and making everyday sales for store product was also a big responsibility and very important.  We all got along great as co-workers and helped each other out in every way possible.  The hardest part of the job would be keeping the store balanced when it came to an early morning rush, which would be a typical morning for us all.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a diverse group of people, from co-workers to customers."
good,"The good things about this company outweigh the bad, the pay is low for how hard we get our butts kicked, especially since the company as a whole has been cutting labor.  That makes our job a two person job, and doesn't feel like we're maintaining the store like it should be.  It just can't happen anymore with 3 people while there should be 5.  It's disappointing, but overall, Starbucks is great and the weekly markout for free at home coffee is awesome,free drinks and a food item while on the clock, I pay $160 a month for insurance for 4 people!  Also the free college tuition is something to look into..."
good,I find that a lot of favoritism was throughout the store. It never seemed possible to get ahead no matter the effort. I would not recommend it to anyone who values balance between life and work.
good,"May have had some bad luck with management at the store level, but corporate  knows what they are doing and under a different management team it would be a great job to have. I know other partners who love the job and have no issues at all."
good,"Working at Starbucks is much more difficult that it may seem. You have to be a very fast learner, and be able to multi task at am extremely fast pace. While at the same time you need to be personable, kind, understanding, and very very patient. I learned that I am very good at making the customer feel at home and like they are being taken care of."
good,Great place to provide customer service and to learn how to work at a fast paste and to meet new people every day and you would also no how to make drinks.
good,"Starbucks was a very detail oriented, fast paced job.  The customer service provided here was unbelievably great. They also had a strong focus on continuing education."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for 8.5 years.  As a barista the job is amazing.  Every day you take pride and ownership of what you do and it makes you feel like you are making a difference.  The fast paced environment is not for many but if you like a constant challenge then Starbucks is for you.  A huge focus of Starbucks is development and they invest a lot in their partners to help partners achieve that goal.  As a manager the expectations are very unrealistic as they want you to have a work/life balance but spend all of your time at the store.  The hardest part of working for Starbucks was having a balance.  Things are constantly changing and it has taken a toll on the company as far as training and making sure we have the right people in the company.  Starbucks keeps layering on more and more for their partners to achieve but the metrics don't reflect a realistic way to get the job done.  Each day provided a new challenge and gave me something to improve on.  As a self motivator I excelled in this aspect of the job because you have to be your own leader 99.9% of the time.  Overall Starbucks is a fantastic place to work.  You have a consistent, healthy work environment where you can create friendship that will last a lifetime."
good,"A typical day begins with connecting with our customers and their communities, fostering a deep sense of purpose while building a meeting place in their communities. Focusing on our partners on surpassing our business goals through coaching, support and leveraging our business support tools. "
good,"Being a barista at Starbucks is fun. I truly enjoyed serving coffee to customers, meeting new people and multitasking in a fast-paced environment."
good,Great way to engage and meet people from all over. Great benefits but the pay could be better. There needs to more opportunities to move up the ladder.
good,The atmosphere in the store was usually good. the benefits were amazing fro a part time position. I left due to some changes at the corporate level regarding sales.
good,Great people and a great work environment. For the most part the customers are kind and polite. I would rate 5 out of 5 before my last manager.
good,"happiest job I've had, love the people around me, good job for part time student.  don't seek for long term.  short term job"
good,"Come into work. Grab a cup of coffee. Clock in, get a till, shift lead gives you one of four spots to maintain till another rotation (Customer support, Register, Bar, Drive Through Order 1 or 2). "
good,"A typical day at work is fun. The customers are awesome. I learned how to work well under pressure. The management at the moment is awesome. We currently don't have a manager but we are getting one. The co-workers are great, obviously every job does have some conflict with them but not for me. The hardest part would be the long hours and that we are short staffed mostly. The most enjoyable part would be the connection you have with the customers. I love ot!!"
good,It is an everyday challenge to come to work every morning but I love it. I learn something new everyday. I like getting to know people and sharing experiences with them.
good,"I loved working for this company, it provided great benefits, good pay, and incentives like weekly mark-outs and discounts. The only thing i had a problem with were the people that management seems to hire. The store I worked at was a brand new store, and my SM had no previous Starbucks experience. I feel as if she was so caught up with trying to fit in to the culture that she was misguided in hiring baristas. The people she hired were very snobby and always seemed to have something to say about you when you left the room. They ran to my SM for every tiny mistake I made. Everyone was too busy standing around talking, and the partners never cleaned a thing, even while i was on my hands and knees cleaning the drains that were ignored for days and days. And this wasn't all at my store, but at others in my district. I worked at 3 stores in my district besides my own, and i found that everyone seems to have this snobby attitude. Other than that, i loved my customers, i loved my job, really great place. I was ultimately fired for something i still don't completely understand. In short, my SM sat me down, and told me that 'Starbucks has decided we should separate.' And I'm sitting there wondering where all of this came from. Her only explanation was that I 'wasn't a good fit'. All together, I was not very happy with the way any situation was handled in my store."
good,"great for highly extroverted people, but not so much for introverts."
good,Would work either six or eight hour shift and quickly learned how to make every type of drink. The management was fantastic the coworkers could have been better but I dealt with them perfectly fine. Hardest part of the job was just smelling Coffee all day other than that it was easy. As for most enjoyable I'd say learning the history of the chain and also the drinks.
good,"we are busy most of the time and i learned to enhance my capability to handle transactions efficiently and still maintain the highest level of customer service. "
good,"best place to start your career in anything"
good,"Starbucks is a terrific company to begin any career in beverage service.  The barista training guidelines are fantastic and comprehensive, and the company sets you up for success.  Starbucks offers a full benefits package to even part-time employees: health, dental, vision and 401k/stock options.  Starbucks took care of me even after I decided to move on from the company.  As long as you leave the company on good terms, you are always welcome to return."
good,I had a great experience working there and i would do it again
good,"Great health benefits for part and full time employees, respectful of age, gender, religious affiliation, work-life balance. Good job for young students on their way to a career in a different field, as well as a great company for advancement to upper management. 401k, stock options, CUP fund,"
good,Management was good but there were times they wouldn't work with you but very good benefits.
good,"Starbucks forces you to work hard and take some amount of responsibility. It is an easily accessible job to anyone in the market and has some nice perks if you want to make it more than just a temporary position. That said, it is food service and despite what some might argue, it is fast food. You will be expected to deal with customers who are not always friendly and to clean the store up and down. Sometimes it is stressful, and sometimes it is great. It comes with the territory."
good,"It's great to work for a coffee shop. You work in a fun environment, free drinks, 30% discount on all items, customer interaction and majority of time, a great staff. Starbucks is very flexible when it comes to schedule. The only poor part of working at Starbucks is starting off below minimum wage."
good,My typical day at Starbucks would consist of serving customers in a friendly manner and creating inspired moments. I have learned how to handle difficult customers and how to multi-task to the best of my ability. My co-workers are all great people who are constantly giving me positive feed back or encouraging me. The hardest part of my job would be trying to maintain proper customer service through out the whole shift even during a busy rush. The most enjoyable part of the job would be making drinks in busy rushes. The managment at Starbucks is highly professional and inspiring.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that came in. I worked hard to put a smile or make someone's day. Attitude goes a long way with people. The best attitude is the one who wins over customers and keeps them coming back for more or knows to come to you when there is a problem or not.
good,i am excited to see what indeed can do for me. i am lucky to work for starbucks
good,"It's great to go to work and feel like you have plenty of support from your co-workers. I felt like I did and, although sometimes dealing with challenging customers was difficult, you also get to have the very sweet regulars."
good,The management over at Starbucks is a little corrupt at least from working for the company for almost 2 years I would say just be carful around them and just try to be yourself.
good,"Great position if going to school, or if looking for part-time. Depending which Starbucks, many can be based off of politics, rather than working hard."
good,"Going to work was awesome with the coworkers I had, they all made work much easier with both their personality and hard work. The crucial part of work was the constant rushes and consistent complaining customers, but as Starbucks we had to do the absolute most to satisfy our customer needs. But for anyone that works there I believe that they can agree that the employees try their best to help each other when it gets really busy. The management is very well constructed and they will be very flexible with both hours and scheduling. A great first job because it builds character and it also helps develop  work ethic physically, verbally, and mentally."
good,I learned how to connect with different types of people. Managers push you to move up in the company. Starbucks has a lot of positive benefits to offer employees.
good,"typical day at work requires you to move at a fast pace, and be on your feet for extended periods of time. you are required to interact with and socialixe with every customer that comes through the doors."
good,"I tried my best to speak to my manager about giving me full time hours which is between 29-35."
good,"starbucks was the most stressful job i’ve ever had. people are always rude to you. i had multiple drinks thrown at me, people screaming, it’s just very stressful. management was great though."
good,"Just like customers love Starbucks even though it’s over priced, baristas love Starbucks even though they are underpaid. Starting out you don’t make much money but you are expected to perform at a high level. There is great opportunity for advancement! If you make it to ASM or SM you make great money with bonuses! And the job is fun! It is customer service and very fast paced!"
good,"Starbucks is very big on personalizing connections with customers. We get a lot of regulars and tend to build a relationship with them as time goes by, so it's nice making friends and meeting new people through a cup of coffee. The job itself gets easier and simple the more you practice. I got everyhing down in a span of 3 months of working hard. It's a lot of information to know and a lot measurements to memorize, but like any job once you get the hang of things, it will become muscle memory to you. Starbucks is usually surrounded with young workers so it tends to get fun time to time. I look forward to going to work every single day because I love the people i work with and the customers I connect with."
good,"with starbucks, you get what you put in. if you want a part time job that you arent that involved in, you can have that. If you want to move up and really engrain yourself in the culture, youll probably have a better time. Just dont take anything too personal and realize that at the end of the day its just coffee"
good,This was a good job but it was very stressful at times especially when you have those customers that’s never  satisfy with what you do no matter how bad you bust you brain brain for them. The manager was never on the floor to help or to even check out his employees.
good,"A company that requires a great deal of multi-tasking skills for long amounts of time due to popularity of the business. Company has great benefits for the employees, but their strict and numerous amount of rules are off-putting and unnecessary which doesn't allow employee creativity and personality."
good,"The people working here are great. Everyone gets along, very little drama. It is definitely fast-paced and can be stressful. There is opportunity for growth if you have the availability for it."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I have also been a barista elsewhere. This job had great benefits, but wasn't a good fit for me personally. It is a great job for someone entering the world of coffee!"
good,"Made amazing lifelong friends while working here.Learned more about customer service, managing staff, and how to properly handle unfortunate situations.The hardest part of the job was unfortunately dealing with customers who could not be satisfied. But, the best part was seeing the regulars everyday and knowing their orders. Seeing them happy made us happy."
good,"Some issues with Management in Alberta, lack of communication and respect in some stores. Overall great company to work for. Most of the shift is spent standing which is harder for some people."
good,"Very stressful, dealing with rude customers all the time, but very rewarding, there are many benefits, but I’d say that is the only good thing about working here."
good,This working environment is great for someone who is fast paced and understands palatizing orders and labeling them. Easy going fun workers. Also have free drinks you can make yourself just like the real Starbucks stores.
good,I enjoyed working there but no benefits with safeway starbucks. Hours seem long with being the only staff working at a time I recommend working at an actual starbucks not a kiosk.
good,"I would not like to work as a full-time member of staff however that was due to my circumstances at the time of employment, I think the company is very fast paced and exciting from a higher up perspective."
good,"They care about the employees, and while pay is horrible benefits are pretty killer in the stock option and ASU program they have. I will say that while I liked my managers in the time I worked there (less than a year) there were three changes to management, and it left our store very stressed and incomplete"
good,"Starbucks is a great first time job, or a job to have while going to college. However once you get older or need to start making a livable wage it becomes a less desirable job."
good,"There was lack of proper leadership skills of the management and staff, which often leads to miscommunication. That, and not being able to sit down often enough was horrible."
good,great place andd eviorment to work at great co workers and great benifits would recommend for part time and full time options great jb great people and great custoers
good,"I was my store managers right hand from when I started in May of 2016 till about July 2016 when I told her I was making plans to move out of the city to go to college but that she had till September'16 because I was enrolling pretty late. She was upset about it but didn't keep me from going, I agreed that I'd work for her during my breaks in school. (Christmas, Spring Break, Summer-Etc) and she was content with that."
good,"Starbucks Coffee Co. is a lovely organization to work for in that it compensates its partners well above industry standard.  That being said, the future of the company is precarious in that customer taste is straying toward that of Third Wave coffee houses.  SBUX will see increasing exits from its customer base as more specialized, lower price-point options arise.  Starbucks made a hasty grab at Nestle's distribution channels in an effort to remain relevant in grocery stores and the like, but that will not be enough to retain market share as more Third Wave coffee purveyors come up to bat."
good,Great place to work. There is favoritism. Free Coffee at all shift. Free Spotify. Sometimes customers are demanding. The corporation allows their customers to get away with a lot.
good,"Mi valoración sobre esta empresa es buena por regla general. Salvo el tema del salario que era entre 1000-1100 libras mensuales, que para una ciudad tan cara como Londres no es suficiente."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a great job and includes numerous benefits. Personally, this position was a stepping stone to gain more experience and advance my professional career."
good,"All I’m going to say is that I enjoyed working there."
good,If you're looking for a challenging work environment Starbucks has got you covered. I really enjoyed the work itself however coworkers tend to be somewhat entitled and have high expectations of your output which can become frustrating over time. I had issues with multiple coworkers consistently expecting me to do their job for them and then would throw a fit when I wouldn't. Not to say everyone was bad there just a few of the younger workers.
good,"It's a good company to start with if this is your first job. Get to know new friend, learning communication with customers, and skills of brewing coffee."
good,A typical business day at work would be going into a rush where everything was hectic then getting placed somewhere and dealing with issues due to lack of training. It was stressful but it was still a good job because the staff was great the training MATERIAL was great.
good,"I really liked working at Starbucks. It was a really fun and high paced environment."
good,"Es un muy buen trabajo, sólo que muchos de los que son genrente no tienen cultura laboral y sueles ser groseros con los empleados"
good,"Extremely fun when surrounded by great coworkers. More stressful and more responsibility than you'd expect! Overall, worth the experience and would definitely recommend!"
good,"Work is great and has many learning opportunities, with a magazine available each month on some of the upcoming changes. However, there is no rule consistency on where things are stored, cleaned, or even made which lead to infighting of the proper method to maintain functionality."
good,"the corporate HQ created an environment where the customer was put above the employee. If someone complained, we were to just throw free drinks at them"
good,"Had to leave when I had been there for 4 years, was managing and still didn't make 10$. Company caps pay at 15$ Would recommend for teenagers, or those trying to attend free college."
good,"A typical day was fast pace and not enough staff to complete cleaning chores, which seemed that the management was pretty lenient about completing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"I knew Starbucks was going to be a big opportunity for me to learn and experience working with coworkers and customers. Since it was my first job, I was really excited to collaborate/communicate with others while satisfying with their orders and hoping they would come back for more!"
good,I worked at Starbucks through college so it was a good job as far as hour flexibility. Everyone that worked there was going to school so they are really understanding with scheduling.
good,"This job is fun at times, really demanding at times, sometimes complicated; however, the pay is pretty good.  My manager is very good and sweet!  Everyone that works there is really nice and pretty easy to get along with!"
good,"it's a good place to work. It is a good work environment, it is very chill and relaxed. The team was one of the best teams I have ever worked with, but there are things that need to be addressed. overall, it is a good place to work."
good,"Its nott a terrible place to work, some days can be long but its a job. its just my personal opinion. the partners can become family, along with customers. its room for advancment, and benefits to help partners"
good,"This job will really test your customer service skills. Great training program. A lot to handle at first and can be overwhelming, but benefits are excellent and well worth it."
good,"I was a dedicated, hard- working employee. Always very helpful and shared my knowledge being an employee for a consistent 18+ years. I enjoyed the opportunity of serving customers building loyal clientele through friendly interactions and consistent appreciation. I maintained high standards of customer service during high-volume, fast-paced operations. I really enjoyed the leadership aspect when I was promoted to shift supervisor. Also I enjoyed the additional responsibilities"
good,"Typical days at Starbucks were all about staying in the routine and making sure that whatever was ordered by customers was ready to go. Making drinks, ringing people up, and getting to know customers. I learned how to deal with irritant customers and how to work fast and dilligently. The workplace culture was usually laid back but still very fast-paced. The hardest part about the job was when the drink and food orders piled up past 10 orders. The most enjoyable part about the job was when there was a new coffee or food item to be sampled. Also, learning about coffee was very enjoyable."
good,"The customer were always nice and the workers were always nice as well. Great work space and pay. Always moving, always on your feet. Learn really fast and taste great things."
good,"I've heard it can be a toss up based on management, but I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the management at my location. "
good,"Busy. "
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you want to grow and feel confident as the mission of Starbucks resonates with me personally, I felt at home and always apart of the team. I like how we can all train one another and generally any Starbucks you work at has friendly staff and happy customers."
good,una organización con estructuras muy bien tasadas en cuento al clima laboral.
good,"Depending on the hours you work and the location of the store that you work at, you will experience rushes where you will be push to your limit to work at fast as possible while maintaining the connection you have with customers.  You will learn communication skills and barista skills, and when there are times when it's slow and you might have the chance to practice your latte art to win competitions like the Starbucks barista competition.  From personal experience, i have the most trouble working with difficult partners (Starbucks' way of calling co-workers), those who simply would not like to put in the effort.  My most enjoyable moments are when I am able to create this bond with customers that would talk to me about personal life whether I'm working or not, where customers will be more than just customers to you and you become friends, and this isn't just people are my age, many customers with varying age."
good,"-	Enhancing communication and marketing skill."
good,while working for this company not only did I learn how to make incredible drinks I learned how to make phenomenal connections and friendships with customers from all over the place.
good,I've learnt to deal with a large amount of customers and work under pressure whiles achieving sale targets. This is all done with customer satisfaction in mind. I've also been training as a supervisor to run the store whiles the manager is away.
good,"Ran out of white mocha syrup, manager ran out to a different location and borrowed more. And managed to be set for a couple days until the next shipment came in."
good,"Always a fun shift, with lots of work to do. fast paced so you have to be able to get in the groove of things, but with the right shift supervisor and the right co-workers anything is fun. I worked the opening shift so from 3am-11:30am at the latest. we always got homeless people there, but if they're not bothering anyone it's all good, and the morning crew and customers were the best."
good,Fun and dynamic work place with supportive management.Brilliant people with a keen eye for business.Incredibly dynamic colleagues.Extremely well developing company
good,"Working as a barista at Starbucks can be great. What really makes your experience is the type of team you get to work with, and how well your team works together. Your coworkers are your greatest asset when things get busy and things will be busy at Starbucks. There is never a dull moment and you will work hard."
good,"Most of the customers are rude, but I've made some of the best friendships with my co-workers. Starbucks can be a fun, amazing experience completely depending on the managers."
good,"Rien de particulier de exprimer mis a part lors de mon recrutement nous etions en sous effectifs."
good,"always moving around. manager was emotionally and physically abusive, my coworkers and shift supervisors were awesome, i loved joking around"
good,"A typical day is either a 4 hour shift, or 7.5. Business is usually very slow, which gets us a lot of cleaning done."
good,"Everyday is different working at the airport and can be overwhelming but once the team come up witha plan on how to help the customers as quickly as possible, everything goes smooth. I learned that once you take control of every situation you'll be more sucessful on reaching your daily goals."
good,"At Starbucks I was promoted to my first leadership role. I've leaned the importance of multitasking and being aware of my surroundings at all times. Overall, Starbucks is an excellent company to work for, especially given their great benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be customer connection. Its a very character building quality to be able to interact and brighten peoples day, which my co workers and I do on a daily basis. unfortunately, I live in New York where the price of living is very high, so the salary hourly wage that i was given with my promotion just isn't enough to live."
good,I love the partners I worked with. They all were so caring. Most days it was like working with my family and the days I couldn't see my family they were there.
good,the work was very easy but I can say there was a few things to correct in the way the team operated with each other. after a month we kept switching managers so it became more difficult to communicate any difficulties to any higher ups not knowing who was still the location manager. I had to handle many task on my own in the very begging. once things started to settle down it was alright I guess
good,I love the people that work with and they are a pretty fair company. I work as many days as possible there. One problem I do have is that they will not allow you to work overtime because they don’t want to pay for overtime. They also schedule everyone very short shifts so that they do not have to give you the longer breaks.
good,"I loved my managers at Starbucks, she was always so considerate and worked harder than any of her workers, including myself. The work was fairly easy after being trained thoroughly."
good,You are not allowed to work more than 40 hours unless approved. You are constantly moving and on your feet. For shifts less than 6 hours you get one 10 minute break. Over 6 hours you get a ten and 30 min break. 7 or more hours means 2 ten minute breaks and one 30.
good,It was a great place to work in. Many benefits towards you and your family. It’s a diverse company and everyone loves to laugh and get to know new people.
good,"empresa muito boa, padrões e procedimentos bem definidos ."
good,"Pretty chill environment, and an easy way to meet great friends. At times it can be pretty hectic, but is overall an easy job and works well around school scheduling."
good,Hardest part is the rate of promotional materials you have to learn and unlearn constantly. I love that they are always for the growth of the employees. Nice workplace if you're just looking for experience. Hiring process is VERY long. Takes a month.
good,It was ok it works with your schedule for example if you had school like I did so it was really flexible. The pay sucks and mostly for the amount of work your putting in it was not worth it at all.
good,"I have been a partner for a year and a half now. I love this job, but the pay alone isn't worth it. I can barely afford anything with this job. The benefits are amazing though, I have an awesome store manager and my team is amazing, which is why I hate that I am trying to leave. A typical day at work is either coming into a crystal clean store with happy partners, or a insane asylum with grumpy customers and stressed out partners. The people higher up could care less about the mental and physical health of their partners, and labor? Don't even get me started. No overtime, and no going over even if you're store needs it."
good,"good job, very fast paced, "
good,"It was very fast paced work. Besides having to know about 50 different combinations of drinks to get, there are orders coming from the counter and the drive through window.  At times you would be making 4 drinks at the same time or having to ring someone up at the register while making drinks.  I think the staffing could have been better.  Although, the girl's that I worked with (I was the only man working there at the time) were such amazing people and very hard workers.  So for other than the fact of the job not paying enough and the furious pace of everyday coffee making, I did enjoy meeting my co-workers and becoming friends. In conclusion, I would recommend people to work at Starbucks, but Starbucks needs to pay their workers more."
good,"It gets stressful around specific hours, sometimes the customers are rude but overall its fun when you are working with the right people. You do a lot of coffee tasting and learn the backgrounds about coffee as well."
good,"This was my very first job, and it opened doors to other advancements. Not the best managers, and not as clean as you would hope. In general you get great discounts, and coffee all you can drink. The pay is sadly minimum wage for hard work and a lot of stress."
good,"Starbucks is the place to work if you're looking to put a smile on a customer's face, challenge yourself on the fly in an extremely fast-paced environment, enjoy numerous benefits and discounts, as well as provide yourself with stability and security. The only downfall is the pay--less than minimum wage. While it is true that you do receive weekly tips based on hours worked, Starbucks is a beginner job only, unless you are looking to work your way up the company ladder, which Starbucks is more than generous in helping you do just that. They also offer an incredible amount of benefits that are there if you are bright enough to take advantage of them. I greatly enjoyed my time at Starbucks and the coffee discounts I received!"
good,"if you are not comfortable in quick paced environment, Starbucks is not the job for you. you get to form  bond with the guests which is cool. I can honestly say my manager is the best."
good,The only reason I left is because the District Manager stated she would never advance me into management because I am a mother. So I had to move on to make more of an income for my family.
good,"Un día típico en Starbucks es estar constantemente preocupado de tu entorno, de tu presentación personal, tus acciones, vocabulario y la limpieza del local. Pero es una carga que se puede sobrellevar (como cualquier trabajo), solo si tu lo quieres así. "
good,this job in particular was very interesting in part because the people I met were all different in a way and we needed to work together or else nothing would have gotten done.
good,I really enjoyed working at Starbucks because the environment was very open and friendly. I loved that it was a fast pace company because I'm used to moving fast and being able to keep up with my fellow team players.
good,"This place is great to start work at. I had this job for 2 years and it had taught me a lot in those years. I learned how to work under pressure, how to maintain a positive attitude, and the beginning pay isn't to shabby for a first time job."
good,"Loved it at first, then new management came along. Still a great job with many benefits such as free beverages and pounds of coffee. It's great to see our regulars come in everyday. Type of place with lots of turnover and out of a staff of around 20 only 3 have been there since I started a year ago. Working nights is extremely easy and laid back but the mornings are complete opposite. It becomes extremely repetitive, maybe it's seeing the same customers everyday or making the same drinks a 100 times a day but overall it's not a bad job."
good,"starbucks has been good to me over the years and the work atmosphere is great,i aslo lovre the health benefits there in addition to the team work thats displayed with hr and the employees when problems may occur between employees.although this job is fun and benefits are great, i must say that the pay raises are lacking."
good,"Trabalhar na Starbucks é muito inspirador. Não tem como não adorar a cultura a missão da empresa."
good,"I work the morning shift so as part of my responsibility I help set up the store. The store opens at 4:30 am which challenges my bubbly personality from showing but I am a pro by now. Whether I am greeting customers at the register or handing them there favorite custom made beverage with my special ingredient ""love"" I make sure they leave with a smile on their face.  Management for the most part is there to offer support and just guide us through the day and handle any situation that might be overwhelming for us or the customer. I absolutely love my co-workers, they are fun and make my shift so enjoyable and of course they love me just as much. "
good,"* A typical day at work would initially begin with deploying employees to positions. There are numerous tasks that need to be complete throughout my shift. However, our main responsibility is customer service."
good,"the hardest part of the job was dealing with irrational management.  The work place culture is diversity, learning about different religions. i enjoyed the positive energy from co workers."
good,I really enjoyed working for the Starbucks. I met some really great friends in my coworkers and gained more experience in the field of customer service.
good,"Starbucks as a company is good for employees, but they’re not making enough strides to make things sustainable. We are contributing to plastic waste and it’s not okay. At the end of the day it’s a Corporation and they only care about money. Barista life is reletavily easy, don’t get too hung up on management, you’re never gonna think they’re doing their best. Just go in, do your job, be nice to ppl and go home."
good,"It was very laid back in terms of attendance and Starbucks works really hard to be convenient in your everyday life, rather than getting in the way. Many days would generally go smoothly. Customers were the most stressful part of the job, the tasks you have are basic. Cleaning tasks, keeping the store clean and ready for everyday business, making drinks and/or food in a fashionable amount of time. The expectations weren't ridiculously difficult, a super easy job to manage. There is a learning curve period because there is a lot to learn about your work envirnomemt but you eventually get it. In the easiest terms to describe the job, it was just a huge check list you would have to go through in the day. Try to get as much as you can done in one day and go home."
good,It is a very fast paced by the book environment. It’s great for making customer connections. Working here you feel like you’re an actual team and honestly you meet the coolest people.
good,I learned a lot about dealing with customers' wishes and got into the habit of working under pressure while doing my job fast and efficient. I am really grateful for the new experiences.
good,"I chose to work at Starbucks because I love coffee and their school benefits are unbeatable. It’s too bad I’m a single woman struggling to pay my rent, car insurance and gas! Starbucks managers do NOT give enough hours no matter where you work it seems, the hourly pay is nowhere near enough for the work we put in, and I just simply cannot survive off of their wages. Even with room to grow as a shift supervisor or general store manager, their wages are not enough for the incredible work our higher ups do. Starbucks is simply a job for teens still living at home or young adults living at home and going to school."
good,"Awesome benefits. Can't say enough about that. Full benefits at only 16hrs/week and up. The pay is pretty low, however. It can be stressful until you get the hang of it..then it can be pretty fun if you enjoy your co-workers and don't mind dealing with some customers who take a cup of coffee wayyy too seriously. Still hired me even though I had some stuff on my background and I didn't let them down. You can tell they really care about their employees and promote from within. Also I had a 3 month leave of absence for a medical issue and they were totally cool about that and gave me no hassle and everything went off seamlessly. I appreciated that.Transferred stores with no problem also. "
good,"Want to walk on the floor it's lights camera action!"
good,manager did not like me for some reason and overtime i had a question she would give me attitude and when friends went in and i said hi i was told i wasn't allowed to talk to customers
good,"There is a lot more to this job than just making coffee. Its fast-paced and intense. Some of the crankiest people to deal with are ones who are running late and haven't had their coffee yet! On the other hand, my managers and coworkers are some of the best people in the world. The culture and community of this company are what make it enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks is a great company and takes care of you. They offer benefits and stocks to all employees, therefore allowing you to stay in the business if you would like to"
good,"It was a nice place to work. I appreciated mornings that were slow and where working with the customer and my partners was really personable. You build a lot of character there. There are cons, but it overall was very nice."
good,Not always a great place to work. NO room for advancement. If you are not in the in crowd hard to move ahead. Poor managers that are spread to thin. Some managing 14 store or better.
good,I wish I would  have gotten a better experience there. You could tell when people didn't like other people they didn't really keep it too professional  and they didn't really let the new people learn
good,"Starbucks is not an ideal place of employment for you if you are not a fast learner or cannot deal with high stress situations. It is incredibly fast paced, which isn't to say that that kind of excitement is always a negative thing. Most customer interactions are positive, and post learning curve, it is not a bad environment or a bad place to work. Very organized, sociable and helpful coworkers and managers, and the routine of it all kinda balanced out the high volume and stress in learning the plethora of drink recipes."
good,"Starting at 4:00 am, learned how to prepare different types of hot and cold drinks.  Management was supportive in the training and the needs of the team.  Co-workers could sometimes be over bearing but you had to keep the smile and greet your customers. The hardest part was getting up at 2:30 am to be at work by 4:00 a.m."
good,This is more challenging then it seems but fun at the same time if your into trying new things and competitive. The hours are flexible and they can work around the employees schedule.
good,A typical day at Starbucks would be I clock on and jump completely into ensuring our customers are being taken care of from every aspect. Making sure they are enjoying their experience as well as ensuring my staff is happy and well standing. Team work is key in Starbucks and what Ive learned from being a supervisor there is building a strong team is beneficial towards success.
good,"this job is ok for short term but is not great for a long time or a career orientate growth. hardest part of the job would definitely  be dealing with rude customers on a daily basis, overall would not recommend this job"
good,"A empresa e otimo,mais devido o horario de trabalho nao estava dando pra mim."
good,"Starbucks in itself is a wonderful company to work for.  But like any service job, one must get past the customer aspect.  Herein lies the problem with Starbucks.  Customers were rude and overbearing, and Starbucks employees are trained to ask very specific questions.  Management would often breath down our necks if we skipped these steps while observing a customer's body language.  I know when to not ask further questions.  Overall, it was a great company to work for, if one can get past having to be on the clock at 4 AM"
good,The good part is the pay and the people and trying new things out . The bad part is the people who works there they attitude sucks .the managers are nice and they will compromise with u
good,"It's busy on daily basis. But working at Starbucks, you will learn how to deal with customer and of course, give the best customer service ever. It's always fun working at Starbucks especially when you finally become family with your co-workers or as we always call them, partner."
good,I Love the customers asking me can I show them where things was at.and can I help them with something.also keeping the store clean and neat.
good,My manger was so stressed cause they had just made her manger and she was short staffed and had to train 10 people in a two months span. So she tended to take it out on her staff.
good,"Loved working at Starbucks because of the customers, However my coworkers an I didn’t get along very well. Their was a lot of miscommunication. Overall it was a okay job"
good,Management was very bad but I learnt a lot by having to deal with different kinds of people though-out the entire day. The hardest part of the job is doing everything on your own.
good,the work I do at starbucks is a busy schedule. im on my feet most of the time. I serve and mak drinks and use the register. I am fully trained at this job.
good,"I enjoy Starbucks as a customer, not as an employee.  I always felt alone and my manager always scheduled me on the days I was unavailable because of school."
good,If you enjoy not having support from a company and getting treated terrible by customers this job is for you! You are cleaning 24/7 and will be belittled by management
good,"I enjoyed my 8 years at Starbucks, the pay for the work expected is not nearly enough.  The wrong manager can completely destroy morale.  They don't reward hard work as much as they reward smooth talk.  Very little opportunity for advancement"
good,"well i work at the Starbucks in Kroger and i am the only boy employee working at Starbucks, there is more than enough drama. no one wants to own up to anything and its poorly managed. Being the only boy i step up a lot to make sure the store is running well (and do not get it twisted i am not trying to say its a sexist thing its just these girls are lazy). so i have learned a lot about stepping up to the plate and taking responsibility because at the end of the day i am here to work and get payed and make sure the customers want to come back!"
good,A typical day at work was busy I learned about different coffees and different drinks that starbucks offered. Management was fun they helped out a lot when it came to making different drinks. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to taste the different drinks that was been made
good,Working in coffee was nice. I really enjoy it once I'm in the zone again. But working on Wright State University's campus and for Starbucks is a bad idea.
good,I have loved being  a partner since my first shift last year. Recently our management has changed hands twice. I don't feel supported at my job. I feel singled out for my beliefs in terms of environmental impact and social responsibility. recently i was completely mortified by our store manager because i have sensory processing issues (math specific learning disability) and was made to feel like an inadequate/incompetent employee.
good,"It was a good job, worked at Starbucks in a university.  It was fast pace with no tips. $8.50 no raises or advancement.  Same thing everyday.  Quit due to poor management"
good,"dudes. if you know you struggle with mental illness, and you're not medicated for it, or you dont have a way of coping yet, don't work here. The customers are entitled problematic white people who will cuss you out over a 5 dollar cup of coffee. the pay isn't worth the trauma."
good,"It became stressful at times, it is a quick pace job. You must be a fast learner and be able to deal with unhappy customers. You must be able to work well with others."
good,Did not treat employees properly. Forced people to work when they were throwing up. Did not give employees their tips if they quit. Adding people to the schedule without any notice.
good,"great job benefits, however there is little support and a lot of tasks to complete all at once. the job is not worth the pay."
good,"While Starbucks has had great reviews in the past, it is slowly becoming more and more 'corporate' with them being more worried about us getting you your latte in 37 seconds rather than making a connection with the customer and providing the utmost customer service, they aren't so worried about what you care as how long it takes us to get your rear end out of the door. Upper management does nothing to listen to our complaints and in fact, they placate us to a ridiculous degree and I've gone from once loving my job to absolutely hating it."
good,My experience changed dramatically with each Store Manager.  The managers with common sense that showed a caring of the Partners were great.  The ones without this skill had no idea how to manage or even talk to people.
good,"I think it depends on  what store you work at; each store is ran different and theres a different work environment."
good,"I was out in between switching majors and needed a job so I took this one. My first manager was an absolute control freak. I had a bunch of good coworkers. The discounts are pretty good and you get to take home a bag of coffee every week. I had to often work the closing shift which sucked because its a lot of cleaning which includes all the equipment, floors and bathrooms. Compensation is nowhere near what they make you do. They gave us free spotify premium which was nice. A great in the meantime or summer job but definitely not for the long term."
good,Starbucks offers many benefits which is how they draw you in however you are very underpaid for the work you do in my opinion. however if you are a high school student looking for part time you may enjoy this job
good,"When I began I loved Starbucks, however it was very corporate and there was not much direction as it seemed the manager was under trained. I enjoyed my fellow partners."
good,Learn how to make thousands of different drinks but must be able to be an active problem solver with self-motivation  and ability to multi-task efficiently
good,"The environment was fast paced, but was great working with partners and customers. Management could have been better and more respectful to her partners."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for as an hourly partner.  There is very little support for Store Managers.  Hourly partners can determine how successful you can be, or not be.  A good district manager makes the difference. A district manager that listens and understands you as a store manager will help make you successful.  The benefits offered at Starbucks cannot be matched.  You have to decide if poor upper management is worth the benefits."
good,"Good flexible shifts to fit around students, perks incude 50% off food and free markout of coffee to take home each week, including free drinks whilst on shift."
good,"Working at a corporate Starbucks long-term would probably be in your best interest. I have worked in a smaller location inside of a grocery store. Though, we have higher wages the workspace is much smaller and we have fewer resources and benefits. You are always on your feet and doing something, you very seldom will be bored. It can be tiring and in a smaller location it can be difficult to manage it all yourself. I worked by myself most of the time and I found it to be extremely stressful with very little reward for hard work. It wasn't very competitive and had little incentive for others to work hard because we couldn't accept tips. You have to weigh your costs and benefits and see if it's right for you. It could be perfect or horrible, it all depends on the person."
good,"It's a fast paced environment. The focus is split between making coffee rapidly and building up the hipster community."
good,"At first it was great! The hours were plenty.  Then, the Manager kept hiring other people and the work hours went from 9 hrs per day to 4-3 hours per day.  There was no compensation or benefits offered at the Starbucks located in the Safeway Store.  The co-workers were helpful and we all got along great.  The area of work was very cramped as it was a very small area with 4-5 people trying to work."
good,"Unlike most Starbucks this doesn't fall under a category of a great work environment as you work there over the years. This one was inside of a Target, the Target supervisors treat their employees unfair. They mistreated me and had false accusations. I decided not to work there anymore because of the way I was treated."
good,"One of those job where i got to learn a lot. It wasn't just recipes of frappe or coffee, i got to learn about so many things like costumer dealing and how to engage costumer into conversation while working on their order. The most enjoyable part of this job was trying new drinks so you could tell costumers how it tastes like. The most hardest job was to get muffins from the cooler. Plus, some of the people were racist over there."
good,"Can be full on but enjoyable working environment. Was trained in customer service and was barista trained. Was taught how to train other employees friendly working environment, nice staff. Half price food and free coffee while working."
good,This job tough me the roots to satisfying customers and really understanding customer service skills. This job wasn't that bad the management team was awesome they treated you with respect and nothing less. I just didn't like the hours that they were giving me it just wasn't enough for me.
good,I dealt with customers at each shift. Worked with the register and also made a lot of different drinks. Stocked the shelves and did inventory as well.
good,"There are several stellar benefits offered , but the pay and hours aren't there.  Unless you become manager or shift leader, you can't be given more than 25 hours per week. Its only meant to be a side job."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work! I’ve been gifted many friends through working here and all the baristas are super nice  I love how you can connect with the customers as well!
good,"I had good days and bad days, they would always put me on drive through but wouldn’t let me excel in anything else nor did i have any help when it was extremely busy. It was also always under-staffed and the management wasn’t all that great."
good,"Starbucks was good work. It’s very easily taught and is fun to do. My issue was with management and how workers are treated. I try to always keep things peaceable and do my work. Not only were workers not inclined to do their jobs, but they were very quick to assume the worst in people. If you are sick you aren’t able to go home. ( not just a little sick, but throwing up) I was not allowed to leave. Overall the work was good and work was easy to complete. The way was low and the management is untrelinle and irresponsible"
good,"Starbucks is only a part time job , not a full time job. It is also difficult to move up as almost everyone is on the same level experience plus there is only a few employees."
good,I have to start cleaning the bar area from the moment I am on the floor because there are many customers that come in the first two hours of my shift. I’ve learned how to flex between bar and register when I am the only one on the floor. Everyone of the employees gets along with each other they are always there to help.
good,Company has some things to work but if you like fast environment with weird customers ordering strange drinks this place is for you always ask the questions before doing
good,"I was recruited by the manager at my usual location. The team seemed to enjoy it and I wanted to start the job hunt soon after my company announced its closure. I had a good experience through the interview process and the first few weeks of training before going to my assigned location things changed quickly. The assistant manager would talk to me as if I were a child and would clap.after.each.word.  I asked her to not do that as it was inappropriate and she said she would. I gave the store manager a heads up as thi was rude and not in keeping with Starbucks values and if she did it to me then she was most likely doing it to others. A few weeks late the district manager, store manager and assistant were in the cafe and hey were taking a meeting while it was busy. I was running the floor getting customers helped, cleaning the cafes, getting the product pulled for the next day and doing the order for th next delivery. And the assistant manager comes to me and stands in the door way between the cafe and the back room and says to me go.sweep.the.cafe.now. And clapped after each word. I said that it would get it done as soon as we had the staff available and the customers had speed down a bit. She returned to the meeting in the cafe. 10 mins later she came back and stopped me between tasks and told me to go.sweep.the.cafe.now.  This was in front of another team member. She returned to the table, I took off my apron and grabbed my purse and went to the cafe and interrupted the meeting. I said that you.cant.talk.to.people.like.they.ate.2.years.old.  And clapped after each word just"
good,"This is a fast pace job and it requires you to pay attention to detail. You will learn great customer services skill, all while helping customers. Everyone make an effort to help one another."
good,"As a first job, I learned a lot about customer service, to handle cash, and to work in a fast-paced environment. I learned how to interact with strangers and I met lots of new people and created good connections."
good,"if you have a great neck when it comes to dealing with rude and initialed people, this is the place to work"
good,The best part of the day is working with your team while ensuring the customers are the priority. It's always a great feeling to know the customers appreciate you and you make a difference in their day.
good,"My coworkers were depressed and hated their jobs, which made staying positive much harder. My manager was horrible, constantly late, made fun of employees, and caused all of us to feel like we were constantly about to be fired no matter how hard we worked. I loved my customers, who were usually respectful; and no one was ever unhappy to see us. The job was fast-paced and fun, but the inability to sit down was exhausting and hard on me, physically. I left because I couldn't tolerate management. She was later fired."
good,"Starbucks is a decent place to work should you have a manager who takes everyone's needs into consideration. If you have a manager who doesn't care, it isn't worth it."
good,Day time hours is fast pace and it is crucial you are able to move quickly and multitask. Not every barista is able to do this which makes the function of the store difficult at times. With a great team and great leadership it can be challenging but fun! It all depends on the team effort. The company needs to provide more coverage on the floor during peak. This would help a lot with the baristas that have a more difficult time moving quickly.
good,"Manager has a culture of favourism...some get treated better than others, aren’t required as much as other employees. The manager also requires weird shift hour and sometimes even asks if you can work double shifts."
good,"It is hard. Customers expect you to be a robot. I have been screamed at, called stupid, had things thrown at me, all over a drink. If you're sick, the weathers bad, have an emergency, you're kind of out of luck for coverage. Making drinks is fun, and the work is entertaining. Some times the customers are amazing, but just know that most customers talk to you like your are the scum of the earth."
good,I worked at a highway rest stop and management was terrible. It was hot and really stressful. I know it’s not Starbucks fault but it was super discouraging feeling like you did all the hard work of a Starbucks employee for no compensation.
good,"I love working for Starbucks but I rather work their as a side hustle than my main job as the hours are not guaranteed and unstable. The ability to have full time benefits at 20 hours a week, tips, stock, free drink and a meal etc are all reasons why I absolutely love being a Partner!"
good,I work the night shift so the work is never ending. I also learned a lot about coffee and pastries. Starbucks is a okay company but management could do better in hiring and training partners. The hardest part about the job is customers of a trying nature. The most enjoyable part of the job is my fellow partners.
good,It's great if you love to drink coffee. But personally my management sucked and my manager would do things like embarrass employees and call them out if they forgot to do something or even if they did something the manager did not like. Which is not professional at all.
good,"I worked there to get by and the hours where not guaranteed. You would be lucky to get the same hours every week. District manager was not knowledgeable of the store operations, but more so focused on the numbers. No sense of help from higher divisions."
good,"In the colder months it was pretty dead. But once spring break hit till all the way to September, it was non stop work. There is always something to do so you're not bored."
good,"Don't listen to the hype about sustainability, promotion of diversity, or any other buzzwords. This company is all about making money, and pushing an over-sugared product on the masses. Their culture of toxic feminism leaves no room for straight, white men."
good,"Was a decent place to work. I learned a lot more than people probably realized. The reason I left was my manager was had favoritism and it showed very well. He had no problem letting people know who he did and did not care about. He would tell you what you wanted to hear to try and keep you around, And when people left and caught on to what he was doing they left. He took that very personal and put the employees non rehirable because of it even though people completed their two weeks."
good,"Liked the job, but they were not very flexible with school and sports. My Starbucks also cut back a lot on hours, and is not very good at communicating."
good,Work at the licensed store does not give you the real experience Starbucks offers. The standards as well as the benefits are lacking. The environment is faster paced and sometimes stressful if upper management does not stay on job.
good,"Starbucks was not a bad company to work for. It is an average minimum wage job perfect for those in school most likely. Unless you are in a management position, you will hardly make enough money to sustain yourself. As well as that, the management team is hardly stable. The benefits were good if you could get them properly activated. Management at the location I worked at was good until I needed time off, then they were ridiculous to work for."
good,"I had a great experience at this job , it was very satisfying for the time being. At this job i learned how to multi task very well. The most enjoyable part about this job is you get to meet new people everyday"
good,"Great benefits at part time but does take about 5 months to qualify. Scheduling is great for students or those who need flexibility. Worked at 3 locations with a promotion and have experienced poor managers, but some are great."
good,Wasn't the best workplace. Very stressful and not a supportive company. I wouldn't support this company. Sorry I was just being honest.The higher management wasn't run to standards.
good,"really nice people to work with"
good,"If you like working in fast foods than starbucks is great and has great benefits for their employees. You gain a lot of customer service experience, and become good at multi tasking."
good,Starbucks is a great place to network and meet people outside of the cafe that will help you grow as an individual and career wise. Easier to move up within the store but not in corporate level.
good,"This job is not easy. Starbucks customers are not an easy bunch, and for every iced caramel macchiato, there is just as much dirty work involved. Your partners make it worth it, and the occasional regular who you're excited to see. Baristas are definitely underpaid, we work our booties off. And people do not tip their baristas."
good,"Learned how to deal with any situation i'm put in, which taught me to be fast in the busy workplace. I'm grateful for the easygoing environment the management is with my school schedule."
good,"They expect you to put work before your child/family"
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for, its a fast paced job that makes you have to be able to handle a busy environment. Its a good job for a young adult wanting a part time job. "
good,"Fun place to work. Fast paced Barista position, with nigh volume clientele. Management was good, before the rehire. No so much anymore. Recommended for short term."
good,Fun people good coffee great time wonderful experience lots of doctors and people to serve great coffee to. Ok work place good environment
good,Great work place for baristas. Free meals and drinks per shift. Fast paced so you don't ever get bored. Lots of great customers.
good,"A typical day would be filled with customer service, I learned how to communicate with many different people and my manager was supportive and flexible with everyone's schedules. Quite a few of my co-workers could be difficult during certain situations. The hardest part of the job was climbing to clean shelves but the most enjoyable part was the customer service over all and getting to meet  and connect with new people everyday."
good,"Great Company and the benefits are amazing- But as a mom now I cant work later shifts or early morning shifts like they need. Hard to balance mom duties and work - and the management is very poor here in the central valley. "
good,"Over turn rate is high"
good,starbuck needs to take more time out and talk to there customers the drinks are good but the service can do better over all thriving business.
good,"Starbucks tries to promote a coffee-house culture, and gives it's employees (even part-time) needed healthcare and other benefits, like other service industry companies, it often  places customers first even when it is detrimental to it's employees and sometimes even to itself.  There is often a very high manager turn-over, and there is less and less promoting from within then there used to be, even when there are employees who have been working and waiting there for years for such a chance. When a manager has been working for the company for less than a year, and his/her employees have worked for the company for several years, this can cause problems that range from minor to major. (Particularly since Starbucks managers are expected to work on the floor making drinks, and they sometimes have very little experience with producing drinks correctly or in a timely manner.)"
good,"Came in assigned a cash drawer, taking orders and knocking out as many drinks as possible.  Learning to work as a team and making sure your customers are 100% happy."
good,"I love the people I work with. However, the chain of command there is annoying and the guests can be really mean. I enjoy what I do, but the lack of people scheduled make it very stressful sometimes."
good,"working at safeway was okay, coworkers were very nice and easy to work with. had a lot of cutomer service expectations. clock ins and out, right on percise time of starting work and ending work. had to keep work area well maintence, clean, and stocked for cutomer prestations and working abilities/tasks."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience, I was able to use skills that I learned in college and build good customer loyalty. I learned to rely on my fellow co-workers and to multitask. I did not always agree with policies but I followed procedures. Working as a barista I learned basic survival skills in the work place which has developed better work ethics."
good,A regular day it was always busy and very fast paced environment.I learned how to deal with very rude customers because we had a lot come through because the was in the airport. The management was not so good. My coworkers were a joy to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting drinks made fast enough.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and networking with people.
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced, I learned a lot about customer service and how to assist customers with their needs. Management had its ups and downs, I had about three in my almost two and a half years there so far. My co-works have been pretty awesome, most pull their weight and are considerate of each other. The hardest part of my job are the customers that you just can't please, you try the best you can to make their experice a good one but maybe they are just having a bad and no matter what you do its not going to change that, but on the other hand when you are able to cheer someone up and put that smile on their face thats the best part!!! I love coming into work and seeing my regular customers and seeing their happy faces and knowing they are happy to see me, always puts a smile on my face!"
good,always something new everyday
good,"It's a great place to work. Your superior makes all the difference. If he is a bad apple, best of luck."
good,"Requires patience and fast thinking, must accommodate to customers for any needs they have, teamwork is essential as well as knowledge of the work place and awareness of surroundings"
good,"I truly did enjoy my job the first year or so. While it is quick paced and there's a lot to learn in a short amount of time, it was still fairly satisfying. The only reason I left was due to poor management. Great benefits though."
good,"Managment doesnt really listen to you and you are another easily replaced worked, but it's the coworkers that really make the job what it is. Any fast food/ drink job will not be the best but it would help if they could treat you with more respect and follow your scheduling needs"
good,"I love the manager here and how he really cares about his employees. The environment depends on who is working that day. The job itself is enjoyable, very fast-paced."
good,Starbucks is a good company however the Starbucks i was employed by was a target Starbucks and they were just okay as a company. The people i worked with were great but the target team was never very focused on starbucks at any time.
good,"EL ambiente entre compañeros era muy grato, lo único malo era la poca paga."
good,"Poor management and scheduling "
good,Can be a bit stressful at times. Hours are given when requested. Management is a hit or miss and tend not to care about your personal life. There is room for moving up but the pay is not worth it.
good,"Great for those who like a fast paced environment and are quick on their feet. Don't recommend this job to people who easily get stressed, or have difficulties dealing with customers."
good,Te company should focus more on the staff instead of sales and quality. If your workers are unhappy then the product or sell won’t be at its fullest potential
good,"When I was trained, I was put mainly on the cash register. But this meant I only got slower at making drinks, and therefor more useless. Due to this, I'm working less than I should be, and am barely working. The atmosphere is comfortable, but I have never felt more useless and awkward around my partners. I need to work enough hours to pay rent, and enough time to learn how to make the drinks."
good,"Must want the job. If not it’s going to be difficult to remember all the recipes and tips, always smile and double check the customer likes their beverage before they leave."
good,"Starbucks was a fun, up beat place to work, it was a very competitive place to work but well worth it for a new teen. I would recommend this job to most teenagers right out if High school."
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me a lot with it being only my second barista/cashier job. It taught me how to be more fast-paced in times of need and to get everything done in a timely manner. Starbucks also taught me how to help a customer in need, such as making their orders, helping them decide what they would like as a new customer etc. The Starbucks that I worked in was in a Food Pyramid so we had a variety of different customers to help and even some who weren't a customer of Starbucks I would help them to find what they needed around the grocery store as well."
good,I loved this job and I would do it today if I could. I left there only because they don’t pay enough. The one thing that always bothered me though is they are bad about making you close one night and open the next morning. So you will be there until 10 or so at night then you get home get maybe four hours of sleep then have to be up at 4 am to open at 5.
good,"Standard food service job. My coworkers were super fun and work was pretty fast paced and social, and most customers were wonderful. However, the shifts were always understaffed and staff turnover was over 100% per year."
good,"It is a really lovely job, I love making drinks, and I love making people happy when they come to me to tell me that their drinks taste SO good, or when they request that I make their drinks. It makes you feel special. It is not a lot of work, is just a lot of people all the time and it can be really exhausting."
good,Licensed store not the same as corporate. Consistently told we are less than corporate and missed many of the benefits that other corporate employees were given.
good,Hy-Vee is a pretty good company as is Starbucks. However the two have an uncomfortable marriage in business. Starbucks is like any restaurant very demanding an unpredictable at times. Don't mistake how difficult it is to learn this job. Baristas are underrated!
good,"Fun temporary job, but stressful and they purposely understaff each shift to save money. How good the management is will dramatically impact your job satisfaction. Be prepared to be stressed, tired, and caffeinated."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for but I would stay out of Enfield if you want to work there. The management at both locations are super unprofessional. They have had the biggest turn over rate in the district for a reason.
good,"Good customer service experience, funy time, active job position, perfect for a full time and part time job for students."
good,"The job is very fast-paced and very clean however at the Starbucks that I worked at my manager was more emotive rather than professional she would base a lot of her decisions  on how she felt on the particular worker rather than what was better for the company other than that I absolutely loved the job, the pay was great the breaks were fine and the scheduling was very flexible."
good,"The store I worked for was a 24 hour store. It seemed like we never really closed and after changing management, (from worse to bad) it just dragged you down. The managers seemed to play on favorites as far as movement through positions. "
good,"Amazing place to work at if you're still a student. My co-workers were great, but the management needs some improvement. They need to connect and understand the employees"
good,"Cleaned machinery, greeted and got to know customers, made their drinks and memorized sizing."
good,"You gain several useful skills at Starbucks, this job is very demanding and only pays a dollar above minimum wage. Multitasking is expected. Minimum age to work is 16."
good,really was not the greatest as much as of management helping out if anything was going on an really  stressfulied. I really didn't like how i work there after a while you will feel like your not welcome or that you can be really thrown under buss or written up
good,"Store Manager is a 24/7 position. Depending on the store, customers can have ridiculously unrealistic expectations, which are fostered by a ""customer service"" hotline that gives out $10, $15, or $25 gift cards just because the customer called--they assume the customer tells the truth. Supportive district manager, but horribly profit driven culture. Hardest part of the job is maintaining staffing with part-time partners at hourly wages less than many competitors. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with my team."
good,the store I worked at was a great place to work but very stressful. management was bad. my partners were great people. the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to see my favourite partners. the hardest part of the job is working on a 3 man play during peak or during happy hours.
good,"Starbucks was amazing at first but once you get comfortable it goes downhill. My manager digs at me, targets me, and sometimes belittles me. I loved my coworkers and it’s a great company to work for, but the stress and anxiety is not worth it all."
good,"And then I got the worst manager I’ve ever met. Vindictive, hateful, and liked to play favorites with her drinking buddy subordinates. Oh, and don’t you dare get sick or you’re on the “list”. I loved my customers, but in the end the job you do doesn’t matter. The butt you kiss does."
good,depends on what store you work at. some stores are awful and others great. depends on staff. opening shift is much more fun but a bit harder on your body. personally i love my morning regulars.
good,"The company does many wonderful things for their employees, however the location I worked at was rather terrible. Co-workers were reprimanded in front of guests and other employees. Hours were scarce if the manager didn’t like you."
good,"If a manager does not like you they will make your life miserable"
good,"The shift leaders and manager all do not coordinate with each other, very understaffed and stressful. Fast paced but the people you work with are great (besides the unorganized leaders)"
good,"Working with the other members was the highlight of the job, getting to know how to make coffee and other drinks up to standards was rather easy. Though was rather stressful when at our busiest"
good,"The best part about working for Starbucks is the interaction and meeting new people. It is a fun environment, everyone loves coffee. The company gives nice benefits as well"
good,Not the greatest environment . Doesn't offer job advancement to loyal and dedicated employees. They offer very limited hours for part-time employees. .
good,"There is a certain evil within starbucks, and that is that they allow customers to yell and scream at you and all you get to do is smile and take it. If you’re stuck with a bad or lazy manager, from my experience 4/5 managers are lazy/bad, you don’t get to move forward. Hardly ever. The pay is all right, but not worth the constant beratement from customers and shift supervisors. There were many days I left in tears because I felt so stuck in such a hostile place."
good,"Upper managment gave promotions to work buddies instead of those who worked hard. The health insurance benefits are stellar, though and that kept me there for 5 years."
good,People sometimes care to help new or fellow partners but when things don't go right they are quick to blame each other. No matter how hard you work it does not get recognized it usually ends up like a competition.
good,"Malgré les horaires difficile, bon travail d'équipe, bons responsables."
good,It’s a good job for experience! Not for everyone! Highly enjoyable if you can handle it! I personally loved this job! Loved the interactions with the customers and the partners! Was truely an experience unlike anything else! Would work at a different location in a heart beat!
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, they have good benefits, loved getting to know the customers, but I have experienced a lot of poor management skills."
good,Good experience but very demanding. Lack of business ethics within the management of stores and districts. I developed many skills with this company but it seems to be more and more focused on pure profit with a lack of business ethics.
good,"Senior management is very poor and does not align with mission and values.  No possibility for advancement based on work performance, rather it is based on poor senior leadership's personal opinion"
good,"It's always the people you work with that are great, as well as the customers for the most part. There can be false promises with promotions within the current staff, as well as new management not playing by the books nor know what they're doing. Thus, the mission of Starbucks gets lost and people leave the job."
good,I feel like my manager didn't give me enough time to learn how to make the dozens of drinks it was very hard to learn how to use the machine and the coffee brewer and everything in one week but other than that I love learning the new drinks I love learning the new machine and I love the experience
good,"Management was not the greatest at this location. People were always quitting, and new people being hired. Not a friendly environment. I strongly support the company as a whole, though."
good,"At Starbucks, we are trained with the belief that we are special individuals, with special skills. Really, the company believes we are factory workers"
good,You get to make a great customer and partner connection each day and this job has helped me improve on dealing with high volumes of people in a short time but unfortunately without the support of your store manager it brings down your and the whole stores attitudes down
good,I was able to graduate with a Bachelors degree paid for by my employer and will forever be grateful to Starbucks. They also taught offered health benefits which is wonderful.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for but it is very fast paced which you do have to get used to also not all management is the best try to work with it to your best abilitiy
good,"I used to be a store manager at starbucks, overall I really enjoyed what I did- loved my job responsibilities and my employees, however my direct supervisor was unreasonable and sexist. "
good,clock in serve customers. stressful place. I enjoy the free coffee each week. the pressure to meet sales with a bad manager is not great. I do like the partners.
good,"A typical day at work? Coworkers blaming each other, catty drama."
good,The management position is very high demanding. It feels like you are in charge of a group of young folks that don't really care to much about their job. Can be very frustrating most of the time.
good,When working at a fast-paced job you can only have a small moment to breath nothing else. It was fun in the beginning but towards the end of my time working it all went down hill.
good,"I worked as a barista and cashier at this prestigious company. Customer service role, hospitality. I was quick and efficient when serving , blended, hot and iced drinks."
good,When I worked there I really did enjoy it but I was a temp that they called in for a week during the busy seasons. I was paid quite a bit for what I did. I did tend to work 10-12 hours a day but it was only for a week and then they would call me again in 3 months usually to see if I could work again.
good,Evolution is the best Juice out there--It really is.  Great taste and the highest quality.  Work environment was tense and demanding.  There was frequent disconnect between managers and senior managers
good,I enjoyed learning drinks and products customers would enjoy.I learned about different types of coffees and where they originated from. The manager I had was nice and and took his time training properly.
good,I got into a car accident about a year ago and I have to help my with pay all the water bills and rent to support her and my dather with the food and exc.
good,"On a typical day you would go in and be assigned certain jobs with how the manager would be running the store. you could be the barista/food gatherer or the runner of certain responsibilities. very fast paced, but fun and get to make connections with many different people."
good,The pay is not high enough but it is a great place to work if you are looking for some type of job experience. Working at starbucks has a lot of perks and great for creating relationships with customers along the way. A typical day at work can go from not so busy to not getting breaks at the scheduled times because of the amount of customers. The hardest part of the job is they do not financially take care of their partners enough.
good,"It's busy all the time. The customers make it a very difficult enviroment. Depending on store you join management is very wishy washy. The thing I learned from Starbucks is the customer service skills, being able to communicate a lot better with people, handling money, and being able to learn and adapt in a very fast paced enviroment and multitask. The workplace culture can be great sometimes. I'm a closer and I live working with the crew I have."
good,"It's a good place to work but management aren't always up to standards."
good,A typical day is a rush that last about 5 hours i learned to make many drinks and the management is OK. Great co-workers but over all really stressful because I feel like I didn't have my life anymore.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, and you definitely have the potential of staying at this job for awhile. Most people that work at Starbucks have been there for a couple years, including myself. You will learn how to multi-task and prioritize certain tasks on a daily basis, and depending on how busy your store is you will be working under pressure"
good,"Probably my favorite job. It was great interacting with co workers and customers. Seeing the progress the store has made due to all the hard work my team has done. Seeing sales reports and hearing feedback made me feel great. Operating the store and feeling in control was a reassuring feeling. Upper management was usually very nice and understanding, But sometimes asked for too much and did nothing to help. Worst part about this job was probably compensation and appreciation."
good,"My first job here, i've got a lot of advices about everything, they are friendly and kind, and it's a really good place to work."
good,"its a very fun work , having a regular customer and you knew what they want, I learned new things everyday and had fun with co-barista."
good,"loved working here"
good,Typical work day would be to setup cameras and equipment. Operate camera and equipment for each church service. Put away and tare down camera equipment when done.
good,"I was responsible for training new employees, interacting with a variety of diverse populations, and resolving customer complaints. I enjoyed working with such a diverse group of individuals."
good,"Upper manager micromanagement at its finest.  No work/life balance."
good,"Every day has new challenges and opportunities to ensure the customer is felt heard, a resolution is met, and policies are upheld. Many times this also means collaborating with other shift supervisors as well as setting expectations about what is needed to be done. I've learned that managing people requires a special skill set that is either challenging or fulfilling, depending on who your manager is and the kind of support you receive from your peers. Without the proper support system from upper management and the skill set to accomplish one's roll in management, it is difficult to sustain the goals set before oneself. However, when those items are in place, leading people to accomplish set goals is rewarding. Nothing can compare to supporting a team to realize their own goals and actualizing their own success."
good,College Education means little to Starbucks. Hire from within! Already had excellent management skills. Enjoyed learning how to make all coffees. No hard part of the job.
good,"Working at Starbucks inside of a rest stop consisted of extremely busy non-stop lines from open to close, the store is open twenty four hours, and I learned just about anything you can think of. From making and memorizing drinks and their recipes, disposal of waste, how to multitask with the best of them, taking orders swiftly and accurately, product preparation, and being a convincing saleswoman. I also learned how to adapt quickly and keep working even with, difficult, shall I say management and a team of very high strung coworkers. The most difficult part of the  job was being the only person who wasn't easily stressed out on a team of very high strung people, my favorite part was definitely the customers. Of course there are some not so nice people, but majority of customers were very kind people from all over the world with interesting orders and stories to tell."
good,Lots of opportunity for advancement and for specific certifications. Flexible schedule is great for people who are in school or have a second job.
good,Typical day would start from 6am to 2pm and varies on shifts. It is very likely to finish late at night and start early in morning. There is definitely a lot to learn but t is a very good experience especially when dealing with customers and their complaints.
good,"I previously worked for Starbucks in 2008-2009. I was promoted to shift supervisor after only being their 2 months. That was a great accomplishment. In 2012 I was laid -off from my job as a Data Entry Clerk and decided to returned to Starbucks. I wasn't their long due to what I would call a hostile work setting. It's a great company , but my second experience wasn't  to great."
good,"•	Supervised a staff of 12 people, which included scheduling, assigning stations, assigning cleaning duties, opened and closed the store, balanced the registers and prepared bank deposits"
good,Its a decent company with poor execution. Very stressful and poor hours and stability.
good,"It's a very good place to work. But, I'm looking for a better opportunity"
good,"Me alludaron mucho al comienzo,aprendi a tratar y a acomodar al cliente y me gusto mucho mis compañeros y la experiencia con esa empresa."
good,"I made coffee, helped customers, Sampled and stocked coffee."
good,"A typical day will involve you being busy all the time. You have to make mocha and make three types of Frappuccino mixes for the people who come in after you so you don’t run out. The closing is much harder than the opening shift. The openers make the teas for the ice tea beverages, the put out the pastries, the newspapers. A few other things, but I only opened once. The closers have to clean up everything, it takes soooo long. Everyone has to do 10 minute sweeps, which is a cleaning of the condiment bar and whatever needs cleaning every ten minutes-that doesn’t happen, but expect to be asked at least twice a day. You should also do those before you go on break, go home etc. It’s a lot, but you'll get the hang of it after a month. Of course you’ll still be learning."
good,Work was great people were great costumers the best seeing regular every day but Safeway didn’t support the manager and management was under trained :(
good,Bien pour un temps mais l'entreprise ment sur les possibles évolutions de carrière.
good,"The benefits were the best part of the job...but as a store manager, the work life balance sucked. Unless you were on vacation or have someone as a proxy for your store, you are expected to come in on your time off and stay longer/come in earlier if someone calls out. Original DM was great but new DM not so much. Turnover within the Store Manager position sky rocketed once the new DM came in and they're still having issues with keeping people in the district."
good,So much potential with this company! Great for when in school or need part time work! Very easy to move up the corporate ladder if that's a personal goal. Benefits are really good.
good,"flexible job with very inconsistent hours. Underpaid employees for amount of work required, not all days but most. at the location i work at very strong lack of work ethic, people call out all the time with little to no consideration. Manager is awesome but maybe a bit too relaxed?"
good,"Prima werkgever, zeer gezellige en betrouwbare collega's. Alleen het ""hoofdkantoor"" is vreselijk. Je moet aan strenge eisen voldoen (typisch Amerikaans bedrijf) als je aan het werk bent en het management ondersteunt je niet genoeg daarin."
good,"I worked for minimum wage at 11$ per hour and also was dealing with a head injury at the time  they were as accommodating as was possible "
good,"Fantastic training programs."
good,More improvements should be made with management and making the employees happy but overall good for student life. Flexible hours help with any busy life adjustments that you need to make.
good,"Starbucks, Like any job, had its good and bad days. The best part of the job is meeting new and friendly faces. The hard part was something I had to learn the hard way. You can not make everyone happy. There will be people who are just going to be angry at you. But at the end of it all, just be kind and have courage."
good,"I have worked at many different Starbucks stores. It all comes down to who you work with. Great managers make this job SO rewarding and fun, but bad management brings out the worst in everyone."
good,"my experience, in particular, was bad for multiple reasons, however with the right store, district manager, store manager and team it could have gone very differently for me"
good,"Poor work/life balance, pay doesn't reflect the amount of work involved. "
good,This job is good experience for first time job experience. Connection with customers is nice. Sometimes overwhelming because it gets really busy but good experience.
good,I loved starbucks but the management at my location was HORRIBLE. So I quit. Simple as that she couldnt for her life get ordering our stock down and it just made everything heck along with bishy coworkers that run their mouths and think they are your boss. Just make sure you find a good location
good,"The management was terrible. they fired me because I had a lab. I asked everyone to take my shift but unfortunately they couldn't, seems really unfair"
good,Managers are paid very low salaries for the work they are required to do.  It is not a typical retail environment and should not be compared to a retail manager's position and pay.
good,"le travail est correct, l'ambiance est très familial. Mais il ne faut pas avoir peur de faire du ménage. "
good,"I was on the cash register most of my time working their and barley got to make any drinks, I wasn't really trained for a while, I left because they were not being flexible with my hours."
good,"there’s a difference between liking Starbucks and working at Starbucks, consider that when applying. It’s a fast paced environment, especially in the mornings. Fun environment when you have great partners working with."
good,"When I first started working at Starbucks this was back when it was still trying to find its feet essentially. This is when the college assistance first was launched and everything. The main crew I worked with weren't very good, the GM had her favorites and those favorites were allowed to do whatever they wanted. As long as they were sober and collected when health inspectors and the DM came in, everything was fine. I was not a favorite and struggled with a lot, and after a major incident where I was not allowed to take personal time, I had to quit. I worked 40+ hours a week, and worked every holiday on top of a second job. I loved the job itself, just not the particular store."
good,I loved my time at Starbucks until the last 2 years when the changes started. There seemed to be more things for the staff to do off floor with out enough support to run the floor and have other operations taken care of like clean safe ready.
good,The customers get away with verbal abuse and assault and nothing is done about it but blaming the barista and saying it's their fault no matter what. Benefits are nice but the stress is NOT worth it
good,"Starbucks was great at first, but over the past few years they have been rapidly expanding the menu causing more stress on shifts and baristas. Cutting labor hours and not offering enough to survive on, It’s sad to say I wish to leave this company behind."
good,"Started with many hours, then everyones hours dwindled.  We were always told by managers that we would get more. Our manager never takes our suggestions on how to improve our kiosk and our sales."
good,"I worked at a college campus Starbucks that paid a stipend to Starbucks to use the name and supplies, so I didn't actually work for Starbucks, but it showed up like this anyway. Overall it was good, making drinks was fun."
good,"Starbucks offers flexible hours, decent pay, as well as decent benefits. The employees at any given location really set the atmosphere, so each employee's experience is different. The work itself is very enjoyable, despite the sometimes (more often than other restaurants/businesses) rude and entitled, arrogant customer base."
good,job was great until you become a supervisor any everything wrong the management did would be blamed on you. stay a barista and youll be happy. the benefits were good.
good,"It was a fun, and stressful job. There was no 'typical day at work' , it was hectic but great at the same time , if you like fast paced that is.I learned a lot about order sequencing ."
good,"My personal experience here was that of only being used as a temporary christmas member of staff. "
good,this job was a fun and easy way to make money during my college experience. Making and serving drinks was a lot of fun. I enjoyed putting smiles on my customers faces.
good,A typical day at Starbucks is usually busy with a decent amount of customers. Making the drinks and interacting with the customers is fun and makes the time pass.
good,Great place to work if the management was better. Starbucks is a great company who's lack of managerial choices can definitely use professional improvement.
good,"a good fast paced environment. helpful staff but the one at wonderland does not have air conditioning gets hard to work in the heat. overall, good experience."
good,"Management was over their heads and unwilling to work with baristas."
good,"... If you you dont catch on immediately, you will run into problems. Depending mangment your experience may vary. Some locations are run much better and smoother then others. Upper management only cares about numbers."
good,Starbucks was a great place to work but it was difficult to manage between work and school. The company was under the school which meant no benefits for students working there.
good,"Great work and environment. Great way to really engage with customers and get to know one and other, unfortunately for me, management was terrible. Would definitely recommend to a friend but just not at the same location."
good,I learned how to adapt to the customers want. You also learn to work as a team. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the different drinks we offered. The most enjoyable part were the customers. The Starbucks in the airport brought people from all over the world.
good,"Need to get along with everyone for a smooth shift. You get to meet a lot of amazing people, some not so great. It has very flexible hours. This job has a lot of benefits. It has wonderful insurance and can help you pay for school."
good,the company does not take good care of thier employees but with that said the working aspect of it was great. starbucks is a great company to work for i just wish it wasnt within canadas wonderland beacuse that is not the best company to work for
good,"It was not the worst experience, although, bad management can most definitely ruin the experience for you as it did for me in a couple of occasions."
good,"Cashier, make smoothie, coffee, hot chocolate, , clean tables, clean bathroom, so whatever is needed ,stock, I loved working there it was only temporary for me, cuz the hourly pay want good enough for me"
good,You learn how to deal with tricky situations and how to manage your time effectively. its a good starter job and can have many benefits if you are looking to prolong your career there.
good,"I worked inside a Kroger Starbucks, we hired on a new manager that talked poorly about me behind my back and purposely scheduled me the complete opposite of what I would request. I loved my co workers and I had a lot o amazing regulars, unfortunately you deal with a couple poorly behaved customers"
good,if you have high anxiety it is not the job for you at all i was hardly trained and didn't have anyone to help me i would've loved to stay working here but i didn't get any training
good,co workers are very nice and surprisingly regular customers are also amazing but the management at the two stores i worked were very rude and had no care for the employees.
good,"The benefits of free coffee throughout your shift was great, along with the weekly market of whole bean coffee, but it differs from each store how it is ran, like most other businesses. Not many available hours and no loyalty to higher ranked employees."
good,"I have been with the company for 4 years, and I loved it for the first two. The changes they seem to be making as a company just shows that they aren't the ""employee respecting"" company they use to claim to be. Their policies put their employees in very bad predicaments fairly often, The managers they are continuing to hire are people who don't know the first thing about running a store (or even the laws they can and can not cross.), and the stores and coworkers in other districts that I connect with seem to be having a very stressful time as well. They make it so difficult anymore for you to move up, but keep shift leads that don't hold up their end of their job."
good,"fast paced, great  coworkers but poor staff and management. Worked at the utm starbucks on campus and it provided a flexible schedule in terms of hours"
good,"very fast paced, on toes all day running around and serving and making orders. Was a little exhausting and the pay wasn't great at all for the kind of work ."
good,no room for advancement in the time i was there even tho others were passing me by through outside hirings. Had to train alot of my supervisors on there ways up.
good,Not bad.  Hours could be more consistent. Tips are good.  Relaxed environment. Fast paced work.   Decent clientele.  Slow through the afternoon.  Ok pay.
good,mala experiencia con jefe de local por escapar con sueldos
good,"Pay wasn't great. Long hours. Management wasn't the best.I worked long hours and never felt like i got any recognition for it. They also made us always throw away left over food at the end of every night, i thought it was odd. Why not donate it or leave it out for a lower price at the end of the night."
good,"Starbucks experience is almost identical.. poor management at times. Okay benefits, only if you are FT.. hours are somewhat flexible.. great work relationships, excellent locations"
good,It's a good starter job. it's good to get your fort in work experience. It's fast paced and you deal with a lot of customer service as well as cash transactions.
good,"It really depends on the store you choose. My management and district manager were terrible. If you find yourself at a Starbucks, make sure your higher ups are people you can actually depend on. Otherwise transfer to a store where people are happy to be there. Besides management and some crazy customers it was a pleasure to work there."
good,"my situation at starbucks was a weird one. i dont want to go into it so i wont talk about it. thank you for understanding. anyway, everything is all good, now."
good,"This is a good company to work for, great benefits, fast paced environment.  However might not be the right job for someone who is not good with multitasking, time management, and stressful situations."
good,Work day typically goes by pretty fast since you’re constantly moving. It’s a great place to learn about world class customer service and how to multitask.
good,"Be on your toes when dealing with upper management. They will leave you out to dry when you call on them for anything, but come down on you for literally anything they can make an excuse for"
good,"I love working for Starbucks, the company. It is incredibly difficult to report anything about unfair treatment/lack of support from anyone higher than Store Manager."
good,I only worked there for a few weeks before I ended up quitting. I was never completely trained and no one was eager to teach me. I started the excited to learn and ended up having to teach myself how to do most drinks. My first few days of working I spent cleaning because no one wanted to train me.  The most enjoyable part of the job was not working there anymore.
good,"The position at Starbucks gave me many skills. There is a lot of multitasking and a strong customer focus. It is often a fun and lively place to work. However, management expects supervisors to have full responsibility of the store, even when the resources to succeed are not available."
good,Buen trabajo pero con salarios no acordes al trabajo realizado.
good,"Praca uczy cierpliwości, działania pod presją czasu."
good,jjjj supervisore with starbucks worked with company for just over 2 years. Did not have much hands on with upper management or development for company growth.
good,"working there you really have to learn to multitask and its difficult but once you master it, the job becomes so much easier. It took me about a little over a year to master working there without getting overly stressed. The best part of it is the connections I came across with customers the coworkers. It is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I've seen people work at Starbucks for ten years before being considered for management. It's very fun as a part time job, not as a career. There is no progression."
good,"Find a good manager who upholds the company values and customer service. Cafe stores are slower paced, drive-thru will speed up your day. You can work with your manager on creating a schedule that works for you. Shifts can be short, long, early morning, mid-day, closing, etc. "
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for. So many benefits and perks, but still not worth having to work and be criticized for doing your job. It’s just coffee. I gave everything for that company, so much time invested. There are people who have terrible customer service skills and are flat out rude to customers and nothing is done about it. It’s just an unfair company to work for."
good,Sometimes you would have weeks with almost a full 40 hours and sometimes you would have weeks with 9 hours. Not very reliable if you're looking to support yourself.
good,Starbucks is great if you’re full time. Starbucks is also great if you love coffee. It all depends on what type of environment you like. If you like to be stressed out and running around all day with hardly any breaks than you would love Starbucks.
good,amazing company to work for as long as you have a good team in your store. the hours are pretty flexible and its a very fun place to work again if you have the right team.
good,"I worked the opening shift so I was there at 5am it was long shift but, a great job. I made all the Starbucks drinks and worked with some great people."
good,"I came from working at the Starbucks located in a Target. The Target Starbucks was riddled with bugs, the training was 90% wrong so making the transition to a standalone was more difficult then I had thought and basically had to be retrained even though I assumed I knew how to properly do everything."
good,"My management was generally okay, but a little rude at times. They were not the least bit understanding about school conflicting with my job. I quit because they gave me way more hours than I was available to work. I got paid $11 an hour to be a Barista though, and I generally really liked my work environment."
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks but occasionally it becomes to stressful to enjoy. In moments where the position requires you to move at a quick pace, everything sort of falls apart. The customer become less friendly and the co-workers get worked up making it a hard experience to enjoy. Overall it is a great place to go on the average day to get yourself a coffee or whatever your appetite desires. It's a place where people go to get there work done and the one thing that I will always like about the job isn't getting to meet the kind customers."
good,The benefits are great if you are looking to stay comfortable but with the hourly wage you will have to work full time. It has been my experience that Starbucks employees are overworked and underpaid.
good,"I didn't quit Starbucks - I quit extremely incompetent management that made working there absolute he**. If you get into a good store and a good district, you will love this job!"
good,"The people you work with are usually great, however, at both locations I worked at, there was drama. Regular customers are usually rude and don't tip, and tips are so minimal. You get denied a raise because you ""make tips."" Lots is expected from you, especially early in the morning and when it's busy.If you can't keep up, this isn't the job for you."
good,Starbucks isn't a bad company to work for has its pros and cons. I just wish there wasn't so much standing on my feet for long periods of time which makes me not like the job being that we get only a 10 minute break with no other break in between to sit.
good,"i would always go to work happy and ready to work but there was no pleasing store manager, i learned how starbucks store is to be ran correctly due to working in other stores around the area."
good,Working in Tampa International Airport at Starbucks was an experience that I wouldn't trade. the work was stressful because we would help between 500 and 800 guests in a shift. Working at Starbucks was a learning experience that demanded communication and team work not to mention a firm grasp of the products provided. teamwork and workplace friendships were encouraged.
good,"Fun place to work, lots of new people from different back rounds. When i worked there they required uniforms, no color on your nails, no visible piercings on your face, no colored hair. Now im told you can wear what you want. Not very much advancement at the one i worked at but a good and fun work place for the time I was there."
good,"Generally, good people to work with, but it can be demanding physical / emotional work for little pay or change to move up.  Benefits are good, and it's very portable."
good,"Got to try and learn how to make all kinds of drinks.  Management was challenging.  Loved co workers.  Long days on your feet, wear comfortable shoes.  This was just a temporary job so don't really have much to say about this place.  It was in Target so that was awesome.  Could go shopping afterwards."
good,"You get tips but you also split it with seven other people. So, if you’re lucky you’d get maybe 12-15 bucks on a good day. Most days you’re usually getting around 8 bucks."
good,I don't like how they boast about their good culture within the company but the employees don't even uphold the vision and culture of the company. You won't be able to do much in your life after work because you pretty much consume your time at work and won't even give you an opportunity to have career growth( Based on my experience)
good,Pay is not worth the work that must be completed in a shift. Benefits are amazing. Great co-workers to work with. Customers are overwhelming at times.
good,"I wish I worked with a team. The Starbucks I worked with at Safeway was really relaxing during the weekdays, but on the weekends it was complete chaos. Most weekends I was left by myself operating an entire Starbucks Kiosk. It was definitely a great experience except when I had to go to the bathroom, then the job became crazy. Customer after customer, smile after smile I was chained to the beverage making area inside a Safeway which holds some of the worst customers I mind you. Again, the experience was great, but man those customers need their coffee! haha.."
good,"The job can be stressful, the coworkers make it enjoyable. I would not work here for long though, it can be trying. Its simply a retail job, stay for a bit but get out when you can."
good,"Within six months I worked under 2 district managers, 3 store managers, and 9 shifts all at one location.  There was no standard day, duties, or responsibilities, everything changed based on who was in charge at the time, which consistently impeded further training, improvement, or advancement.  Company policies would have allowed it to be a good work environment if things had ever calmed down and not been in chaos all the time.  It's supposed to be coffee, not a series of emergencies everyday."
good,"Great company, be ready to work a lot of hours. Benefits were amazing, the brake-room was amazing. Coffee all the time. Hardest part of the job is the amount of management they have on the floor. Too many chiefs to the amount of Indians."
good,"It was fast paced, the people were friendly. The management was difficult to work with. When i asked for more hours i was denied because i did not have any financial hardships. i.e. i didnt have any kids, they gave parents more hours. discrimination."
good,I loved all the people who worked there and the environment in itself. We had to close due to location so that’s why I don’t work there anymore. I would love to work there again
good,The Starbucks location I worked at was the absolute worst. The manger lets the shift managers steal food all the time and didn't like me from the start. Everyone there was pretty bias and they would cancel my shifts within a few hours of it starting or sending me home after a hour of work. Half of what they did was against policy and when I called human resources they did nothing about it and still have yet to call me about why I was fired.
good,It was fun in the beginning but they started to hire people outside of the company and moving up in the company is harder than it needs to be. managers are not entrenched in the culture and just given a quick run through and sent on their way. company feels impersonal and unrelatable  mostly becoming click bait material. They lean heavy on people in management.
good,"The store I work at has a difficult manager who's actions are not in the best interest of her partners and often times results in the suffering of the store. That is applicable to my store however, there are others that run much better. it is a good place to work though it is challenging to climb the ladder. I love working with customers that wish to explore coffee as that is a passion of mine. it is great place to work if you want to personally, actively learn about the art of coffee. it is what you make it most of the time. I have learned a lot of good skills, working with various people with different work ethics and how to put my heart into what I do to work as a team."
good,"Customer interaction is very enjoyable, The pressure to meet financial goals in order to achieve bonus is high. We are told to treat our store as entreprenuer, but tends to be micro managed."
good,"Cooperate store have more benefits, The Management at the shop i worked at was the worst. they do not hold up company standards. The only upside in working at the Starbucks were the hours and the customers were really nice and that it was located at the pentagon."
good,The learning curve is a couple months but if you can stick it out the job is great. It becomes natural and it is a great place to work. They could pay their employees better though.
good,"Fun work environment"
good,"Overall, I loved working at Starbucks and making all of the drinks, working with customers, and interacting with coworkers, but the management not only refused to work with my schedule, but seemed to intentionally schedule me during times when I'd have class or were otherwise unavailable. If the management was a little more caring and compassionate toward their employees, it would be a great place to work."
good,"Company will ask you to bend over backwards without proper compensation. As a supervisor you will always be told that you are leading a team to better the connection between customers, when in reality most people could care less. Starbucks is a hub for homeless distraction and impatient customers. Employees do not get paid enough to deal with customers yelling and throwing things. We"
good,"Starbucks can be a great place to work, if the leadership over you is strong.  However, the system is not great at promoting strong leaders, and bad leadership is common. "
good,"Bright Horizons is a great job if you're looking to work with young children. It's ideal for college students, working moms, and families who also have young children."
good,"Lots of reasons to work for Starbucks! Free coffee, meeting great people, wonderful coworkers, and plenty of fun while working. However, working extremely early hours, poor management and low overall pay makes the job not worth a career option. Very difficult to be promoted. Great security and fun culture, despite working very hard. Although I personally enjoy being very busy and having plenty of work to do, it eventually becomes just busy-work and not very fulfilling. The hardest part of the job can be waking up before 4 AM for opening shifts, or dealing with agitated customers who need their coffee. The best part of the job were all the smiles I caused, making great friends of both my coworkers and the people I served."
good,"The typical day of work is learning the new things there and read all the book given. Second , I learning lots of thing example making a water and remember the name of water .."
good,Making and taking orders cleaning all kinds of stuff Barista pretty much has all around job very hard for advancement into management. Good job For someone who needs work
good,Nice place for first job. Develop good communication skills. Everyone is always welcome. Do not require previous experience. Flexible working timetable.
good,A typical day started at 6am and went till 4:30. Other coworkers are lovely however the shift leads happen to  be not so friendly and the way some issues were handled could have been better. However beside the lack of proper pay the company did give perks but didn't think of others needs in overtime hand outs. I did suggest the job to a friend and she enjoys the job but admits that it's still a male dominate environment and women are looked down upon.
good,Enjoyed learning how to be a barista!  Enjoyed working with my work crew as well as satisfying customers.  The training was a lot of fun as well.  Made many drinks and got to try them as well!
good,"A typical day at work includes two paid ten minute breaks and one unpaid meal break. These breaks are to be given at the discretion of the shift lead. At the beginning of a shift, you are assigned a role to play and are to remain there until directed to move or until a need arises for you to assist a co worker."
good,"I worked at starbucks for about 2 years, the benefits of the company are amazing! The work its self and the people that tend to work for this company are why it isn't fun anymore."
good,Its a ok place to work but its a little difficult to grow if you dont know anyone. The benefits is what i dont like because its very confusong and you dont get that much help.
good,"managers change from time to time but you just hope for the best. true colors will show in about 2 weeks. the last manager i had was not very pleasant towards the military. i had school tuesday and thursday night so she would schedule me for tuesday morning, about 0300 to 1100 and then schedule me for the closing shift on wednesday, about 1600 to 2200, only for me to work the morning shift on thursday. thankfully she has left the starbucks i work at."
good,"Store manager was the absolute worst. Love the job, love the people, but the management was terrible. That includes other store managers in the area, as well as the district manager. Couldnt say enough bad things about all of them."
good,"I loved the scenery here and meeting professors whom would encourage me daily to go back to college and follow my career goals. I've invested so much time, sweat, and hard work into the job and I feel like I haven't gotten anything in return barley a vacation!"
good,"This is a great company for students to work and go to school, although it takes time and decipline to advance in your position. The hours vary. You can see your self getting  up to 40 hours one week and 12 hrs the next week. In my personal experience working at starbucks the hours are not consistent."
good,"A typical day at work looks like a clock-in, hand washing, and then delegation to a particular role, repeated until clock-out. I learned that Starbucks is a great corporation to work for, as much as a bottom-of-the-ladder position at a corporation can be great. Management had shifted hands early on, so much of my training was self-perpetuated. Workplace culture is one of demanded proficiency and efficiency without any compensation or significant recognition. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a positive attitude when the expectations would change or increase drastically; the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be learning to make the beverages and help people customize their drinks appropriately."
good,The company is great to work for. The employees are nice. I moved up in the company from Barista to Shift supervisor in just a few months of working for the company.
good,A typical day at work was doing customer service 1st Shift. Which consisted on rotating coffee and cleaning all stations every 30 minutes. 2 Shift was working on cash register and rotating back to bar to make drinks. The hardest part was working with Co-workers. The reason why was because of the work environment for me. My personality dint fit in with the majority of the co-workers.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks as my first job and would recommend the job to anyone thinking about becoming a barista. It was simple work, most customers were very nice and I found the time went by really quick with this job, as there isn't much downtime depending on location."
good,"Typical day at work involves cleaning counter tops and machines, making espresso based hot and cold drinks, coffee, tea, iced cold drinks and blended beverages. The coworkers and working environment are awesome and the work itself is fun too. The hardest part of the job is closing since it takes a while but the more practice you get doing it the faster it goes. By far the most enjoyable part is making connections with the customers and learning their stories and names."
good,"at first I loved star bucks.but I started to see how things work when I came to my gm and told her that I was having problems with her shift supervisor and how she was treating and talking to me,, after presenting the facts and expressing how I felt, she immediately took the side of her 5yrs associate and anything I had to say didn't matter and she even stated that.... this starbucks was ran by nothing but women and it was alot of ""cattiness"" in the store.. ide never work there agin."
good,favoritism and politics.  hard work for very little pay.  However they are very flexible if you want to go to school or have a family.  Advancement is almost impossible from within unless you are a favorite
good,I absolutely loved the people I worked with and the benefits package Starbucks provides but management from the Store level up is inconsistent and generally hired from the outside providing a level of incompetence that could be considered absurd
good,"The management was a little shaky but i really enjoyed the time i spent at this store, some of the people here just didn't seem to enjoy my presence at times and i felt out of place occasinally."
good,"Starting here you fell very loved and open to everyone, if you work well in fast paced environments this is perfect for you. It as fun at the start but later started to hurt by the comp nays cut in hours and making less staff."
good,"unfortunitly at my location the manager is horrible, she picks favouites, scheduels you out side of availiblity and makes it your problem to get it fixed and doesnt care about her workers"
good,"Low pay,and Shifting hours. great job for young high school kids who don't have bills. Good benefits but that's it. some good some bad managers"
good,"It's very nice working at Starbucks, you'll get to meet and work with different kinds of people. You'll learn and grow a lot, it is highly recommended job specially for first timers. It may be challenging at some times with the fast phase environment but when you get the hang of it you'll actually enjoy it."
good,"I enjoyed working with the crew that I was with. The environment was nice. Sometimes you would have very rude customers but I manage to put a smile their face.  When we came under new management, we were always short staff, so I really didn't approve of that. But overall it was a descent company to work for."
good,Starbucks has great benefits and can work well if juggling school or a second job. Hours are typically not available to work full-time year round.
good,"> This job allowed me to staying connected with customers as I am in Marketing field."
good,Hop on floor ask the shift supervisor what's going on the shift. Ask shift where he would like you to be at. Make drinks and take customers orders. Management was awful. Very clicky with other employees and if you weren't friends with them they would try anything to get you in trouble. Hardest part of the job is making sure everything is set from morning crew. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet you and exciting people.
good,"If you are working as a contract worker they do not consider you a part of their team, they do not use your skills to the best of their abilities."
good,"I love the work, I love the fast pace environment (You have 30 seconds to make a drink and I thrive on that) and adore the people I worked with. I loved 90% of the people that walked through the door and learned something from the 10% that I didn't like. I really enjoy everything about the job as a whole and its a good company to work for. But the management has some big problems (micro managing, I do very well managing my time and what needs to be done)."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for because the environment is fun and the company allows its workers to learn in-depth about coffee. Starbucks is a safe, fun, and great workplace environment for workers. The hardest part of the job is learning what new food items the company will receive. The easy part of the job is making hand-crafted beverages."
good,"A day at Starbucks is never how you plan it. There are always complications that arise that you must problem solve on the spot to keep everything flowing smoothly. Working in stressful situation like this has always been something I have handled well and because of that, and my calm demeanor, my coworkers and customers don't feel the chaos. "
good,"Starbucks, overall, is a great company to be employed by.  They offer amazing benefits, along with product incentives and stock.  The only drawback is the management for each store varies, some stores have inspiring and motivated general managers, where others have been in the same position for 10+ years and their attitude leaves a lot to be desired and have become quite lazy.  The work is somewhat enjoyable, but what really makes the job fun is the customer interactions on a daily basis."
good,Motivation to kick off the day followed by intense repetitive motion to move boxes and scan in ID data that controls product moving in from vendors and out to retail locations across the East Coast.
good,Work was interesting. Working at the starbucks in the airport was really fast paced and you meet a lot of different people. I learned to be patient and deal with a lot of diffferent people. My coworkers were all hard working and fun to work with.
good,"This starbucks is a pleasure to work at, the hours are reasonable and the environment is spectacular. The management could use a little bit of an overhaul because most of the time while working we'd always be out of stock on at least one item, and that item would vary per week where sometimes it's simple pastries, and other times it's the essentials such as coffee beans or milk. The mostenjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with such a wide spread customer base because you meet people from around the globe working at an airport.  The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with people calling out, or trying to leave your shift on time in general, along with dealing with apologizing to customers daily for being low on stock."
good,"opened and closed the store"
good,Good company if you re looking for a part time gig. they do not promote good managers.
good,"I found that my time in Starbucks was spent doing a lot of work that someone else above me was meant to be doing. "
good,"Effectively helped all customers with purchases, (hot and cold foods, hot or cold drinks, and retail items."
good,great place to meet new people and make lasting connections
good,Did not like management. Not good motivation and support. Understaffed
good,"Overall I was very satisfied working for the company. They focus on creating a fast friendly environment where customers and quality come first. "
good,I loved the job and the baristas but the managers were horrible and verbal abuse was given daily.
good,"The management was commendable, very efficient. However, they did not stick to availability. It was productive and a very enjoyable work place."
good,"Some supervisors do what they want, treat customers bad, and are lazy. The manager can be a push over. People who don't show up without calling don't even get yelled at."
good,"clean, cashier, prepare drinks, getting familiar with customers to ensure driink is right, meeting & greeting customer as soon as they enter establishment"
good,Just like any other job... you don't work for a company but for people.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and exciting. I have learned to multi-task, and get things done not only fast but properly. I have also learned good organization skills in order to keep things running smoothly. However, I often feel the people in management are not always on the same page and that can make things confusing. My co-workers come from all diffrent backgrounds and are fun people to work with. They definetly make work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is delivering great customer service when we are short staffed. It can be difficult to have conversations with customers when there are other things that need to be done to keep things running smoothly such as making back-up product. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and interacting with so many diffrent people. During my time at Starbucks I have met some really interesting customers whom I have had some great conversations with. That is the part of my job I love the most."
good,Management didn't care so much about employee only customers. The place just seemed it was too runned down. Too many favoritism within some employees and management.
good,"A typical day includes working to create the best moments and best products for guest. This includes taking orders, making food and beverages, keeping the store clean."
good,"With a management role you will be expected to work over 40 a week. Since you are salary, there is no over time.  As an hourly partner, it is a great place to work for a part time job."
good,I liked everyone I worked with and we became like a family. My coworkers made working even more enjoyable. Working with people I liked and that liked me made working together as a team even better.
good,"The hardest part of the job was learning to work under lots of pressure, especially with how busy this specific store was. Staying calm under pressure and taking care of everyday tasks is essential."
good,Working at Starbucks is rewarding because they help you learn to work on a team and fulfill leadership roles. My favorite thing about Starbucks is working in the upbeat environment.
good,The Starbucks that I work on is on campus so it is such a nice environment to work in where you could see your classmates and such. I get to work with people that I have had classes with or even that have the same major as me so it is always mice to bond over that.
good,"Work as a barista in starbucks will help and challenge your communicate skill with strangers.Also,from starbucks you will learn how to multitasking task."
good,"I learned how to make all drinks within the first few days, and was not properly trained, so most of the training process fell to me, as an employee, outside of work hours. It was extremely demanding and I was often working double the hours that I had agreed to and it was not up for negotiation."
good,"Working as a barista at Starbucks is very fun if you go into the job with an open mind & a desire to learn as you go. Being a barista is an on-your-feet job; you're always doing something, whether helping a customer or restocking product."
good,"I thought I’d enjoy it but the location I worked at in Ontario was poorly ran with the GM picking favourites, was up for a promotion and so was another employee, Starbucks rules to my knowledge at the time was staff members especially management and the other person was promoted and “secretly” dating the assistant manager"
good,"If you can handle constant changes, then this is the job for you. Everyone was helpful and molded me in to the potential I possessed of bring a supervisor. I don’t regret my time here. I’m still in touch with regular customers that I met when working here. I’m also in touch with previous coworkers as well. We are all and always will be one big happy siren family."
good,I worked at a location on a university campus so this was not a corporate store. The management was bias and the schedule was never right. The training was sub par so we were not able to provide customers with correct orders. Overall an easy job.
good,"Great in the beginning but as time goes on the culture has changed as has the job and although i love it, i strive for more. I was happy the first two years but now it is not about the partners, it’s about the customer never being wrong and making money."
good,Detail orienting workplace striving for highest numbers. Exclusive management style in regard to management/supervisors. A typical work day revolved around fulfilling customer's order according to dietary needs and preferences as quickly and accurately as possible. Maintaining cleanliness and stocked shelves.
good,It's a great place to work with decent pay! It's also a great environment for students and the best place for a coffee lover to work! I   enjoy meeting new people and there is always something new to learn everyday!
good,Working here provides the opportunity to learn all kinds of things about coffee you wouldn't expect. Building connections with your team and with the daily customers is what makes the job most satisfying. The work can be demanding and really stresses multitasking and being able to anticipate store needs. Pay and benefits are not as fabulous as portrayed but the discounted coffee almost makes it worth it.
good,I definitely enjoyed working there once i started. However as time went on the management fell apart which the environment to completely change. I found out after a while that they cared for the advancement of the store and stopped taking care of their employees. on top of that the customers began to get to aggressive making our work day much more complex than it needed to be.
good,met some great people along the way and had many learning opportunities along the way that i think helped shape me into the person I am today. Great place to gain experience
good,Deal with undecided customers that have little to no knowledge of Starbucks beverages. Coworkers are fun and friendly. Some are lazy and have bad work ethics. Fast paced environment. No time for breaks all am hours! Constantly making drinks and using cash register all day. Direct contact with customers. This job requires a lot of physical activity so if you like to sit around then it’s not the place for you.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 3 years under poor and often changing management,  back when certain policies were also far more strict. The pay and benefits are nice as are the free coffee and food however in a store where the management was cliquey and there was so chance of advancement unless you were favorited by the boss it wasn't a good work environment."
good,"I loved this job, and the only reason I left was because of compensation.  That said, the management was a joke. The managers all think they run the world. There was no room for ideas or improvement. There also is difficulty advancing. I enjoyed it overall, but I would not return"
good,"Business offers great incentives like free premium spotify, tuition waiver to ASU, and other discount perks. Great options offered in stock, medical benefits, and insurance policies. "
good,Starbucks offers many benefits and is a great place to start out in. Offers amazing healthcare without having to put in full-time hours and also convienient biweekly pay.
good,"I had a good experience working at Starbucks. I learned a lot about customer service and acquired skills in preparing drinks and food. I learned to multitask, although at times it did become very stressful if we were understaffed or out of important supplies. Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere but I resigned because i wanted something less hectic and higher paying."
good,The customers were my favorite part of the day. The regulars would come and drop by and talk to us. It was refreshing and listening to their problems would help me feel better about making them feel better. It was a win-win situation.
good,"The job itself is fun if you like making drinks for people, it’s the lack of management skills that made it lack luster. I was constantly closing by myself especially on weekends and the managers didn’t seem to care."
good,"Since I have experience in Customer Service I just had to learn and keep learning about food, and the hot/cold beverages. Work Culture is face more to the customer instead to the partner(employee). My view is first to take care of the employee because when there is a happy employee, customer are going to be happier and excited with the brand."
good,"Verry good company, depends on the management for the rest. The overall environment was not plaisant but again it is not because of Starbuck's. Could be a great job."
good,"I worked for a Starbucks on a college campus for two years while I was in high school. The hours were ideal as the schedule changed every week based on availability, but we receive no compensation other than a 35% discount, not even tips. Other starbucks get free drinks while on shift, food vouchers, and tips on top of a discount. This was infuriation and to top it off we received no increase in pay even after two years."
good,"This job is great if you’re in college and need all the fundamentals such as insurance, 401K, spending cash, a paycheck etc. I made great friendships when I worked there. Only problem I had was with higher management. One person spread across a district and several stores end up getting neglected."
good,"i helped make drinks and wash dishes and take out trash"
good,Great job for college kids and people with a lot of responsibilities in their personal life. Patience is a virtual at alll times as a Starbucks employee.
good,"Was a fun place to work, shifts went by quickly. I worked for the metral station location in Nanaimo. Early mornings and late nights sometimes. I loved interacting with the regular customers and upbeat staff."
good,The manager would never get back to me about my shifts and training to raise my experience. I did not have an enjoyable experience and I was never properly trained.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, the benefits are really great even for part time employees. The salary is minimum wage though, and it's a lot of work, but the team and the job itself is pretty fun. Really great company overall,would've stayed, but the management in Beloeil was awful, it was a shame to work there since we were always missing products and ingredients that were in most drinks,and most employees didn't have the right training to do their job. Our work was never appreciated, and it was managed by people with zero professionalism."
good,The customer is always right but solve problems in company's benefit - you get crushed. Scheduling is very flexible if but managers tend to push hard working people.
good,"Starbucks can be a great place to work.  If you're in the right role. Too much focus on numbers even though all we talk about is how we treat people.  If you don't hit your goals, the reasons don't really matter."
good,"In general I found the work to be fairly easy to pick up. I was able to connect with customers and build new friendships with not only the customers, but my co-workers as well."
good,Meeting new people everyday is great. Getting them what the need to get through their crazy day is something I look foward doing daily. My time management skills have been strengthened considerably since I've been working here.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for about five and half years and I am so grateful for my time there. There was a lot of room for growth which I utilize to become a barista trainer and then eventually a shift supervisor. I met many of my long time friends there from either working together or by becoming friends with my regulars. The benefits are also great, unfortunately, most of them you cannot take advantage of until after you have been working there a year. Overall a great place to work."
good,"You get benefits, free coffee during your shift, weekly tips, and even a free Spotify premium account. Flexibility varies store to store, but I can’t complain."
good,"Starting off, I worked for the Starbucks located inside of a Safeway so I technically wasn't an employee of Starbucks. With that being said, I enjoyed the overall aspect of being a barista and the customers. It was a great learning experience, especially for learning time-management. I just had a horrible manager whom made me do her job and then still nagged at me so I left. Other then that, it is a pretty good job."
good,"Employees deserve to be paid more than just minimum wage. As a barista role, we do literally everything! We make drinks, play a customer support role, Cashier, a lot of cleaning tasks, and are expected to treat every customer as our neighbor. The amount of hard work we endure and the high expectations the company makes for us, we deserve higher pay!"
good,I love my store but I don’t earn enough to live on. I work another part time job and am a professional musician and cannot make ends meet. Sometimes we are short sty.
good,"Overall, I had a good time working here. Things started to get a little overwhelming, though, when my manager was not keeping my school and externship schedule in mind."
good,"Working at starbucks is a constant battle of quickly making drinks while also maintaining a clean work area and doing your best to help those struggling around you. Not a job where you sit around, customer service and connections are key and constantly being enforced."
good,"I've been doing this for three years, it loses the appeal after about a year and a half. The pay sucks for the quantity of work in a day. Soul-sucking, to be honest."
good,"Great first job, but not one you can grow into a career. When the management is good, it's great. However if it's not, it's going to be rough going. Overall though, day to day operations can be stressful but manageable with a good team and good regulars."
good,I work by a popular theme park and our Starbucks is owned by a hotel. Most of the customers are tourists. The management here is horrible. I have great coworkers tho. This was my dream job but 1 and a half years in and I'm already looking for a new job. It's just not worth the pay or getting free drinks daily(and I love starbucks). No benefits at all no over time.
good,It's a fast pace environment and customer service and satisfaction is key.  You get to experiment with drinks  and make suggestions to customers but it's not a set schedule.
good,Like all jobs there is a good and a bad. Learned alot of the drinks and how to make them. It's pretty boring on slow days but If theres too much going on then it can get stressful.
good,"lots of opportunities to grow and become educated on the origins of your coffee. Allows you to have a higher degree of know-how when it comes to the best ways to brew coffee, and espresso, at the best temperature and with proper equipment."
good,Very fast paced and high energy. I enjoyed working there but it is an exhausting job. We were always learning new tasks and new ways to connect with customers.
good,"Overall Starbucks was fantastic, however, the only concern was the work/life balance. Be prepared to work very hard, but great people and great benefits."
good,"Starbucks is rapidly changing and trying to adapt and create menu items and services. learned how to run an espresso bar and cold beverage station and maintain cleanliness at a very fast pace. however with new things constantly coming in such as drinks, food, policies, and strict routines to how things are done...I found it slowing down production and overall business to try to constantly adapt just to wipe off 1 second here and 2 seconds there."
good,"Working at Starbucks was sometimes rewarding although it was mostly a stressful environment. I see most Starbucks are not this way, but working on campus is different. As students, I believe the very least we should have been given as far as benefits is some paid time off. We couldn't take a day off to study for finals without getting an official warning."
good,Tiene buen ambiente de trabajo pero creo que la paga es muy baja comparada a todo el trabajo que se realiza
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced work environment with high physical demands, stressful, and the store you work at can make or break the job. There are a lot of resources for partners, but they aren't always available. Not everyone can handle this job. The customers are especially demanding. It takes a lot out of you physically and mentally. If you can handle it it's the best job ever."
good,Some of the people that work there are extremely clicky and are not very positive towards their peers.  There is a lack of training available that will help to make sure you are successful and have opportunities for advancement.
good,Company and good to work for as long as you don't see yourself there long term. There is not much room for growth. One of the best parts of working there is the the fact the everyone supported everyone.
good,They hardly advance you. It almost makes working there not worth it. You work your hardest and they don’t rexognize it like they say they do. Great benefits even though it eats half your check.
good,Fun place to work but very difficult to move up in the business. Pay is not good at all especially with being with the company for 10 years and making the same as someone who is barely starting.
good,"Starbucks is stressful. The only reason I have stayed with them for so long is because they have amazing benefits for their employees and the people who work there are amazing. Starbucks ensures to us that the customer is always right and we have to do everything to make their experience perfect, even if it means getting coffee thrown at you or a customer screaming at you. Overall Starbucks does a lot for their employees but the expectations they set for their employees are just impossible to meet since we are also human."
good,"i have worked for Starbucks , both corporate and licensed for almost 6 years. for the amount of fine details that must constantly have been maintained, IE, 3 minute standard, Beverage repeatable routine, and the ever changing menu, the pay was not worth it."
good,"This position was fast paced and fun to work with the Air Force Cadets. The shop was a ""proudly serving""Starbucks so we had the recipes for the drinks but in a limited menu."
good,I worked there part time for a few months. The drive thru made the time go quickly. My coworkers were immature and rude and manager was kind of all over the place. I ended up leaving before I could get any real benefits.
good,Starbucks as a whole is a great company to work for. Management varies. Regular customers are fun to work with. Drinks are easy to make and understand and health codes are easy to follow.
good,"Company is great to work for, however the management that are in charge take out their anger and frustration on lower management. If one can get past that then its a great company to work for as lots of benefits."
good,"was a barista for 6 years, loved the people I worked with and most of the job, but truthfully customers are horrible and mean and baristas make minimum wage so not really worth scrubbing mold and having old white women throw their drinks at you"
good,While I liked managing Starbucks (inside of Target) there was definitely discrimination among upper management (in Target Corporation).  I'm older and have 10+ years retail management experience and still wouldn't be hired on as more than a department manager.  They only hired upper management directly out of college with a new degree.  It was really disappointing because this is a company I could've seen staying with long-term.
good,"Had to fight for overtime."
good,"I feel as though Starbucks is a good beginner's job, but it tends to lack in decent management. Starbucks does have great benefits for a part time employees, but apart from that it can be a bit stressful for the pay."
good,The job was nice and I loved the customers but the pay was poor and I didn’t get enough hours. My manager played favourites too which was unfair. Other than that I did enjoy the job
good,"A Lot of the time when you want to advance, you get stuck in what employees call advancement limbo. they do however provide decent benefits for both part and full time workers."
good,"As a salaried manager, I would highly recommend hourly positions for the perks of the complete compensation package.  Training is exceptional.  I do not recommend any salaried management position.  Completely overworked even in the most efficient times.  I worked as a barista by requirement OFTEN and had very little time to complete management tasks.  This lead to unpaid overtime.  Upper management looks the other way and anyone who struggles is blamed for poor skill.  I hardly lack the ability as I was employed so long."
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced environment, along with great partners, and the opportunity to learn new things every day. The drinks change seasonally and there is always an opportunity to advance and move up the chain. The benefits are great, and make up for the cranky customers."
good,"Pay was fairly low at the time, although it's been raised significantly and the already decent benefits have improved since I've worked there. Management at my particular location was awful but the job itself was a bunch of fun and I loved my coworkers."
good,"You have to learn all the recipes but you can't take any of them home to study. There's never enough time during your shift to study them well enough to learn them. Also, Starbucks hired me lying about their management training program. I was told I would be put in the management training program, and I was already a shift lead at another quick-service establishment, which I cut my hours for in order to work at Starbucks, thinking it was a better opportunity. It was not."
good,I appreciated management allowing me to have a flexiable schedule. They worked with my school schedule and it wasn’t hard to find coworkers to cover shifts.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you meet a few requirements: Have unlimited availability, love people, don't get swept up in gossip, and are self motivated to maintain standards. As someone who has a very strong work ethic and self- motivation, the company recognized this early in my barista career and did everything possible to maintain my employment. However, when it came time for me to cut back on my hours (40+ a week) they had a problem adapting. I had to quit to go to class and have a life outside of the store. I have heard that this combined with the dramatic atmosphere is a characteristic specific to the Columbia, SC district- so hopefully the other district in the company are better! Good luck!"
good,Happy with the time I spent working for starbucks. Just wish the pay was better for the amount of work you put in for memorizing all the recipes that are constantly changing! (Seasonal drinks) Starbucks always has a high volume of clientel.
good,Alright if you are a supervisor and make the plans. People won’t take you seriously if you don’t work your way up. Management is strict but attempt to be understanding when personal problems arise.
good,It was always a pleasure to see returning customers become friends. It was an amazing feeling when the customer would return just because you gave them the best customer service I can provide and on top of that always know what they were going to order and have it ready for them.
good,"I am sure that Starbucks is a great company; however, I worked at a location owned by Aramark and there were no benefits and pay was below minimum wage. The managers took advantage of their position and I was also expected to work even when I was sick. I do not believe that Aramark owned Starbucks properly represent the company. "
good,"Very fast paced and demanding, typically fun job. However the hours are incredibly sporadic and you tend to work shorter days more frequently. Many people tend to get pigeon holed into positions as well which can be good or bad. This is a decent part time job but if you need anything to actually support yourself look elsewhere."
good,My managers didn’t participate in working hardly. I did most of the work that the manager was required to do. Most likely just the location. Only worked in one store.
good,"It's a nice company to work for, decent benefits and pay for what your doing. The best part of the job is your coworkers and getting to know the regulars. The store I worked at suffered from poor management and there isn't much recourse for baristas if your being harassed or intimidated by coworkers."
good,"It's a fun environment and usually not too demanding, but if your manager is anything less than perfect you are in for a rough, rough ride. At best, store managers maintain consistent schedules and keep their employees in mind when making decisions. At worst, employees are disposable assets used to advance a lazy manager's attempt to suck up to the DM."
good,"The management is poor , the work place is great the customer are amazing and love your hard work. Dress code is very reasonable and comfortable. I enjoyed working for the company due to the amazing customer I came across"
good,"I loved working for Starbucks in the beginning. It's a great company with benefits(except Puerto Rico), flexible scheduling and most of the time a great team. In Puerto Rico the management is bad. Micromanaging, you won't advance unless you are liked, the pay is low and they don't enjoy outspoken employees. What truly makes the work enjoyable is the team."
good,"Typical day - Busy making drinks all morning, when morning rush dies down busy cleaning and restocking."
good,The customers are a big thing with this job. If you treat them well they will be nice. The only big issues I had were that of other employees and the management. The management obviously each have their favorites among staff and play to them.
good,"This is a fun faced pace job, but I would not consider it a career. You have to give up an arm and a leg and in some instances, multiple years of your time and total sacrifice to be promoted. Upper management is extremely out of touch. They ask a lot of baristas and supervisors- the pay doesn't meet the demands. Lots of corporate pressure. At the end of the day everything is about numbers. "
good,"Fast paced organized work experience. Sometimes understaffed, caused stress. Easy chores, working directly with customers. Good routines, good supervisors, bad management"
good,"I have tremendously enjoyed my time at Starbucks, but there is limited opportunity to move beyond a single-unit manager. Starbucks has also been making changes that move away from a coffee shop atmosphere to a quick-food service experience. Benefits are unmatched, and once you are a single-unit manager the job security is fairly good. Starbucks has been aggressively increasing/tracking certain metrics that make it less about the product and customer and more about the bottom line. Store Manager's workload has increased over the last 3 years, and corporate has been slow to recognize that the constant leadership changes make it difficult to prioritize the flavor of the quarter."
good,My boss was lazy barley came to work and the DM really didn't even care it was a stressful work environment..always had a no call no show always running out of stuff cuz my boss didn't listen to a word I said
good,"Overall, I liked the fast paced environment and servicing customers, but there was a definite lack of advancement in the store I was in and the management wasn't all that attentive to our needs."
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks, however management was poor. After having one store manager fired for deleting hours from fellow workers paychecks, I transferred to another store where the manager refused to work with my schedule regarding my class schedule. The job however is fast paced and is great for part time while you are in college."
good,Enjoyed working at Starbuck's.  It was a job that helped pay for my college expenses.  They worked with my class schedule.  The manager was pleasant to work for.  I enjoy their coffee and their food and it was fun to learn to make the different beverages.
good,Do what is expected of you and everything else falls into place. A typical work day consists of making beverages and ringing people up. Nothing is out of anyone's capability.
good,"Being in the food and service industry, Starbucks definitely is ahead of the curve in regards to its competition when it comes to pay and benefits. However, you really have to work for it. Constantly felt short staffed and rarely received recognition from top leaders other than what were our opportunities. As much as I loved doing coffee and meeting different people, I also often felt disrespected and belittled by customers which I was expected to continually ignore."
good,"Overall Starbucks is a great company to work for. They have great benefits such as health, dental, and 401k. The baristas were very warm and welcoming. A lot of regular customers come in everyday so its easy to get to know the people in the community."
good,It’s a good place to work for if you have good people to work with. People are usually friendly but sometimes you need to get on their good side in order to continue with the job.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work with room to move up in the company although you may have some managers that do not follow Starbucks policy but you will still get the overall great experience Starbucks corporate wants you to feel.
good,I love my job but the corporation itself does not care about their employees no matter how hard they work and they spread us too thing. over worked and under appreciated
good,It was ok. The store was clean. The employees were easy to work with. Customers were friendly. Nice environment. People dont stay long here and it hasnt been the same since the old manager left
good,I would recommend working at Starbucks for anybody who needs health insurance or looking for an opportunity to go to college for someone who cannot afford it.  It's a great place for someone who needs to get on their feet but the company does not provide enough for someone to move up in the company.  A barista gets paid dollars less than a shift supervisor although the work is almost exactly the same.
good,I learned how to work with a team and work independently to get a job done and done well. At this particular Starbucks it is super fast paced and a bit stressful due to its location. I loved meeting all of the different people and travelers that came through and also loved getting to know my coworkers.
good,"The best part of working at Starbucks is your team members and fellow baristas.The typical day starts with a rush of drinks and people to serve, followed by a short break when cleaning and restocking is crucial, and the day ends with another rush, a free drink to reward yourself for keeping your cool, and the excitement of tips the next day. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face, because people will have bad days, and take it out on you. Just remember that they are people took, so smile on and think about the free drink at the end of the day!"
good,"on vous donne du ""partenaire"", on vous dit que vous faites ""partie de la famille"" mais cela reste une entreprise, qui souhaite avant tout faire de l'argent."
good,I loved working at Starbucks we made sure our guest were taken care of it’s just a lot of people there were bullies in a way and so it drove me to leave but I love the job
good,"I would come into work and head straight into the back to clock in. I would assess how the shift was being handed to me. Meet with the current shift supervisor to get a rundown. See who needed to be sent home, who needed to go on break and then deploy my incoming employees to take over. Continue working, getting tasks done and setting up for the next business day. "
good,The day was typically fine. We would get rushes like every other store but the Management was just awful. They could easily make our stressful day more stressful. I was fired for something that should have been a warning. I had never been in trouble before and one day I go into work and my manager fires me.
good,"This company is well intentioned in some ways, but a person needs full time work and a living wage.  It is also difficult to deal with a schedule that can run you late into the evening and then have you back at the crack of dawn.  Furthermore, it is difficult to get coverage for your shift if you ever need it, and the management seems to act as though they would prefer you work your six months or so and then disappear, as there has been no mention to me of any possibility of advancement after eighteen months of dedicated service to this company!  Not the way to make people want to stick around."
good,"A typical day at work is very laid back, but also very busy and fast pace.  I learn something new every day, and not just one thing, multiple things...Management is just ok at times depending on what store location you are at.  I would say, the hardest part of the job is having to deal with the easy customers as well as the very picky customers on a daily basis.  But over time you get used to it.  The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to see my regular every day customers coming in and out of the store and always seeing them smile and having them give you compliments on how they enjoy seeing us everyday, and telling us they really appreciate us having their drinks already ready for them."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks.  The company itself cares for their employees and tries to promote from within.  Unfortunately, by ""caring"" for their employees, it makes it VERY hard to weed out bad eggs that create an unhealthy work environment.  My entire management team quit within two weeks of each other because of associates that we could not discipline due to corporate policies and nepotism (the problem associate was a niece of  a District Manager)."
good,"The workday was fast paced and provided interaction with a "
good,"Working at Starbucks I learned how to work under stressful situations whilst keeping a calm composure. A typical day at work consisted of stocking our area with lids, cups and milks and making backups of whipped cream, mocha, caramel, etc. to prepare ourselves for the next rush of people. The other baristas I worked with were the ones who really sold the job for me because when we were being pressed for time to finish and hand out drinks within 90 seconds, we calmed each other down. The most enjoyable part of the job comes 2 months or so later when you've adapted and can handle rushes without being looked over. Its a lot easier to grasp than most people would think. The hardest part isn't even remembering the drinks, its keeping calm and finishing through when stsorms of people walk through the door with big orders, expecting it to be done within a few minutes. If you can make it through that, everything else just comes naturally."
good,I was expected to have knowledge of things I was never trained on. Pay was fair. Employees are very personable but management is mostly unprepared to handle their job duties. Work-life balance is non-existent.
good,"when i was employed, the management was not very friendly and not very good at training, spent a lot of my work hours by myself. other then that my limited time at Starbucks was very fun i enjoyed being a barista and meeting new faces everyday."
good,"Great job filled with opportunities to advance, if you are with the right manager. As with any job, you will face bitter people that do not want to see you succeed within the company, especially when they haven't. You can get ahead here, just make sure you don't get into the wrong store. Lots of pet issues when you have the wrong manager."
good,"Be prepared to be running back and forth in a very fast paced environment. You do build great relationships with customers and staff but management when I was employed with Starbucks was pretty abysmal. With little to no room for proper growth, people were told that they were to be next in line for promotion and it never came. "
good,enjoyed working there for the most part because they were understanding when it came it life happening and needing to work around you instead of the other way around. relaxed except when target when invade and change rules or something
good,"Work with several college students on the floor. Incredibly busy. Can be stressful. Minimum wage. Not a Starbucks Corporate store, so we did not get any of the Starbucks benefits. Flexible hours."
good,"Bonne fondation de culture d'entreprise fondé sur le respect des gens et les résultats d'entreprise."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks because I was good at my job. I was more than capable to handle multiple positions at a time, as I did often since we were always understaffed."
good,"The work experience 100% depends on what store you are at and your manager. I had the opportunity to work at other locations while my permanent store was under construction and it really put it into perspective how hostile the management in my store was. It forced me to leave unwillingly and without notice because of drama and responsibility only being placed on baristas instead of on supervisors or management. I did feel that there was some specific targetting. "
good,Starbucks is a great job but doesn’t care about their employees. I don’t know why I stayed with this company so long . Starbucks cuts your hours tremendously and over hire staff . It’s very hard trying to make a living for yourself and child .
good,"can be very stressful depending on the mangers. Some managers are not fit for the job, People tend to take their stress out on you. But if you can hand that its a pretty decent job"
good,"The job was fairly demanding for the most part, didn't receive a lot of support from hirer up when I had problems with different employees not doing there jobs affectively"
good,"Fun place to work for a college job, high paced environment. The pay was great, but the hours can be long and getting time off was near impossible. It was a great first job and learning experience."
good,Good job but have to be able to multitask. Have to be open to working on your own. Be able to work in a stressful enviroment. Especially dealing with cranky customers.
good,Good for in-college or in-high school work or even if you are just looking to get some assistance to earn a degree. I would highly recommend as a temp (1-5yrs) job.
good,"it benefited me by working fast paced, we always stayed busy, it helped with customer interactions, it also was very stressful if you wasn't paying attention or got behind"
good,"Worked at a high volume cafe while I was in school. Corporate sometimes seems to hardly care about the baristas, but that's going to be the same for most positions like this, and Starbucks is much better then McDonalds or Jimmy Johns, etc. when it comes to pay and benefits. If you have a good store manager it will work out fine however as they are obviously the ones you will be dealing with on the day to day basis."
good,"The Starbucks was located in a Giant. It had the typical low expectation that all ""in-store"" Starbucks have. The management was lackadaisical but were very very supportive of my college studies; they were flexible with the changes in my schedule. I loved working the fast paced morning rush; I enjoyed memorizing and mastering the drinks and remembering the regulars who in return remembered me. The hardest part of the job was knowing that no matter how hard or long I worked, I would never make enough money to support myself or my college studies But this is to be expected for an entry level job that does not require any education. I was reluctant to leave since I enjoyed the work environment and the actual labor (I can't say that about many places, but I thoroughly enjoyed the duties as a barista)  I learned to think on my feet, to stay organized even during a rush and to communicate clearly with both the guests and my coworkers."
good,"it's all about the manager and the people in the store. the job really is great especially if you need benefits seeing as you only need 20 hours to earn them. the drama within the districts is also very petty. managers openly have disdain for each other and the store become pitted against each other. you can find a great store but know the handbook well and quote it often, they wiggle around a lot of corporate rules that would otherwise result in termination from the company. they move people up fast whether or not they're ready for it and the training is not as extensive as it should be. not a long-term job unless you love coffee and the Starbucks experience but expect to pull your weight, and everyone else's."
good,"Loved the job and was good at it but manager was not accepting when it came to gender, race, sexuality, etc. I loved the work environment and the fast pace of the job because I was always busy."
good,"was the young one in the workplace, got onto bar pretty quickly was lots of fun but coworkers were never the best. The company was great lots of benfits all you can drink coffee, would recommend to all those coffee lovers who want to learn all about coffee"
good,Everyone gets treated the same. I worked there for 2+ years and I still got paid the same as new employees. I loved how we got a free bag of coffee a week and free drinks while you work.
good,"Trabajo dinámico, en donde se pueden desarrollar diversas aptitudes del trabajador, en barra preparando bebidas calientes/frías, en caja atendiendo clientes, o en mantener el orden y la limpieza de la tienda."
good,Must be quick to adjust to problems. Flexible with attitudes and cool minded with co workers. Overall fun and lots of friendly people to interact with. Must have great customer service skills the job will be a lot easier.
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for almost two years, I used to love my job however I was promised things that weren’t followed through on and I also just don’t enjoy going to work anymore."
good,"*Customers and Partners are the best"
good,"Overall a great company to work for, great values, great benefits and pretty good culture.  Benefits being great have let pay be moderate, and honestly low for the work involved and the expectations set from higher mangemnet."
good,"For the first year and a half is was a nice place to work, then management changed and things went down hill. Cut hours. Harasssment. Toxic relationships with customers and management that caused issues with associates. "
good,"I worked there in 2013. I do not know if anything has changed. It was stressful and high intensity job. If you have competent managers and coworkers the environment is manageable, but demanding customers can make it not worth the time."
good,Company changed over time. Became more about micro-managing the Store managers and handcuffing them into positions in which it was hard to lead courageously.
good,"Depending on location and coworkers, this job could be amazing or devastating. Creating relationships with customers is one of the better parts of the jobs and creating delicious drinks. However, the fast-pace environment is not for everyone and you tend to need thick skin to deal with personalities and the entitlement some people have."
good,"Typical food service job really. Less food and more drinks. Learned how to multitask very quickly because it is necessary. Management was fine. That is to say that the shift managers were usually good at what they did. Store manager tended to be tedious and difficult to work with due to lack of knowledge of anything other than his direct responsibilities. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers while trying to close the store and get everything cleaned on time. Not that bad however. Best part of the job was that everyone, for the most part, got along quite well."
good,"you will work with a sense of urgency and you will always have something to do, the hardest part is working under pressure during rush hours. You learn a lot about time management, multitasking, and how you respond in difficult situations. The most enjoyable aspect will be the kind individuals you encounter."
good,"I loved working for starbucks, its not just a company its a family. It was always fun but to be screamed at quite often for $9.00 hour was not worth it."
good,"A typical day at work would include: opening store, serving drinkings, taking orders, warming food, counting cash drawers, keeping a clean area, keeping a positive attitude, and working efficiently but swiftly. I have learned many things while working at Starbucks: all the lingo, how to make the drinks, many costumer service skills, how to count the cash drawers and make deposits. Management at Starbucks has been constantly changing throughout the entire year and a half I have worked there. I have had four different managers and have gone through over fifteen shift leads. The hardest part of the job would be going through a rush and trying to keep everything clean and keep a positive attitude while being stressed and getting the drinks out quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job would include the relationships I have formed with costumers and other employees."
good,i  learned a lot from this company. i love the fact that they will help you pay for school and actually move on in life. a typical day at Starbucks can be very hectic and stressful but its fun at the same time.
good,A typical day working at Starbucks usually last a long time but depending on who you're working with the shift can be encouraging and rather fun. Customers vary and long lines form rather fast increasing irritability. You need to be able to learn fast and listen carefully
good,"Fast paced, fun, energetic, outgoing, constantly moving, slightly stressful, good benefits, friendly environment as well as coworkers, efficient and easy"
good,"Al Shaya is one of the famous company in Kuwait however we don't have tips and over time pays sometimes our 1 hour breaks becomes 30 minute break, and the management is complicated they're in favor to those stores who can achieve monthly sales and that seems to be unfair especially headcounts per store, no logo of Starbucks on newly opened store (which where I'm working at Fintas). I hope I can find a better opportunity in Singapore where I'm aiming right now."
good,"Starbucks baristas perform several job duties and provide customer service. Baristas at Starbucks take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications. ... Baristas at Starbucks also must often clean coffee machines, restaurant areas, restrooms, and preparation areas during a normal shift."
good,"Great learning experience, positive work environment, and great people, free drinks, employee discount, lots of fun, scheduled lunch and breaks and good pay."
good,"Starbucks has great benefits, and seems like a great job at first but over time it becomes something you actually like or hate. depends on the person."
good,if management for your store is bad the overall work experience will reflect the same. overall it is a fun job and the customers make it fun. you develop a passion for quality and perfectionism with making drinks to be proud of
good,"Starbucks is a really dynamite place. I got this job on a whim and ended up aiming for management! I became a shift supervisor and began my Barista trainer training as well but unfortunately had to quit due to a major issue with the management. My store had the most amazing boss for years and when she relocated, her replacement was like a bull in a China shop. She tore the store apart, replaced the fun environment with punishment, and drove 18 employees to walk out all at the same time including myself. Luckily there was an investigation and she was recently let go, but I will say, overall being a barista and shift supervisor at Starbucks was an extremely fun experience."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Great benefits, great compensation for Store Manager role and above, amazing company culture and support by corporate leadership. Unfortunately, the Austin market lacks in culture and genuine connections with District Managers and Regional Directors. Hours worked (even 50+ a week) go overlooked and unrecognized. Support is said to be given but when asked for it, it's nonexistent. The local leadership is very much numbers driven and less humanity driven as the company itself is."
good,"It was fun to work here,you get to work with a great team and learn new things about different people every day as well as make lasting connections with regular customers. "
good,"If you love working and being on your feet, this is perfect for you.  The locations here have had high turnover in the past, but I can't speak of it for the last year.  Co-workers are great."
good,"Like many chains, your experience working at Starbucks will vary greatly depending on the sore you work in.  Management can make or break the flow of a team, and the kind of customers changes as well from region to region."
good,"A typical day at work consists of handcrafting beverages and serving guests, and preparing for the next day to ensure smooth operations.  Depending on the time of day one could also open or close down the store.  At Starbucks I learned the importance of working as a team as the workplace operates as a chain with multiple people working multiple roles.  The workplace culture is clean.  The hardest part of the job is the unpredictable workflow since guests come and go as they please.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with guests and being able to see the smiles on their faces"
good,"When working with other baristas you age it can be a fun place. Must be a fast learner and should be able to multitask. Great customer service, always smile and be friendly."
good,I love Starbucks learning how to make acertain way was very different. I made all my coffees the same and the only time I had a problem was when corporate did a walk thru and and co workers was trying g to go by the book the entire day tried to make me look like I was a troublemaker
good,"Working for Starbucks is a great experience overall, but there are several factors which impact that experience whether for better or worse. For example, if your team members call out, you have to pick up their slack, and management oftentimes did not respond to that in kind. The customers could be very difficult during these times but it was important to remain calm and maintain a clean and ambient environment for them, as well as provide them with excellent customer service."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience. I learned a lot about being a Barista and also about the customer service industry. "
good,"It's alright to work for, the staff are nice but the shift situations are not very helpful trying to find cover etc. Even 2 month in advance it is hard to find cover and they don't help you out, they are crafty with hours and shifts as I was made to work every single holiday and made to work every weekend."
good,"Fast paced, rude customers, not good for a long time. On my 6th year and I am burnt out and jaded. Love the company, hate working in retail. People are garbage."
good,"Licensed stores appear to be more difficult to work in, because not only are you under one management, but multiple based on which location you are at."
good,You work hard and its all about who you kiss up to. They tell you to fake it until you make it. Senior leadership can be shady if you don't make them look good. Customers and baristas are a joy to be around. Management does not care about the team.
good,"good place to work but advancement takes a while sometimes, lots of cool people who work here, easy going, i love the rush of having to serve the morning rush"
good,Being a team member at starbucks and a great and fun way to learn customer service and also multi tasking skills. You have the opportunity to expand your skills as a barista which can also help with serving or bar tending jobs.
good,"Fast paced environment with lots to remember.  I have learned to prioritize very quickly and have learned exceptional customer service skills as well as, training new staff."
good,"Loved just about every minute of it. Liked being able to connect with the customers and put a smile on their face in the mornings. Loved the drive through. Had an awesome manager, when she left things kind of went down. There was no direction. Slow to promote. Perks were great. Almost got to become a Coffee Master. Difficult to transfer."
good,"I like working for Starbucks because it's easy to get the hang of how things work and worth sticking around due to the welcoming experience. I think the only complaint I really would have is having to always learn random new things, but that's always easy to learn too."
good,Some customers are mean and demanding but you have to let it roll off your shoulders. It can get really busy and crazy but have very slow periods. You need to constantly clean or stock. They are very accommodating. Fantastic store manager. Parking is horrible though. There is no employee parking and your car will most likely get towed unless you can pay for meter parking which is very high.
good,"Great work place, one of my favorite jobs. Only down side is the pay versus the amount of effort and work but into the job. Everything about the job was fun even the cleaning bits."
good,"Many Starbucks stores are being franchised, since Starbucks UK Ltd is a part of US company operations. "
good,"Working at Starbucks  has been great at times. They can be a great company to work for, but things have changed from when I start six years ago. They demand more then ever before and at the same time do not pay accordingly. Being a shift supervisor is one of the most difficult positions in the company, and even upper management will tell you this. We do most of the work of a store manager while also being relied upon to be a barista on the floor making drinks etc. but we only get payed about a 1/4 of what a store manager makes. It has become an increasingly frustrating place to work."
good,it is not easy for deaf worker to communicate to other coworkers and customers. i like seeing they have an  opportunity to teach deaf worker how to make a coffee and others make by communicate. the deaf workers have good vision and memorize it what they teach to make it.
good,"The first store I worked at had excellent management, the last one had poor. Like with every job it just depends. The company itself is wonderful!!!!!!"
good,I like working for Starbucks through Target. I do not work at a stand alone Starbucks so many things would be different than working for Starbucks through Target.
good,"Starbucks was an awesome experience, however the Kroger I was located in had very poor management and treated some of us very poorly. On the first day of training before the Starbucks even opened for the first time yet, he came and basically told us that we were only 1% of his sales and he didn't care if we were there or not. That wasn't a fun start, but my coworkers were amazing and the work was fun."
good,"I loved making the drinks, the workplace could've been way better. The best days was working on the weekends with the more relaxed manager.the job was honestly really easy, i just didn't enjoy half f the people i worked with."
good,managment was good at first but went under new managment and was terrible  the pay rate was good the co workers were nice and friendly the customers were amazing
good,"Working at Starbucks was a good experience, the day to day of the job; talking to and serving customers, assisting with any enquiries about our products and those we were offering, keeping the store clean and tidy. During my time at Starbucks I was trained as a barista, which was a brilliant learning experience, I also learnt on how to improve my customer service skills,  which to me is very important."
good,Working at Teavana was a mixed bag. Your success really defendant on how strong of a manager you had. Too many management decisions were based on personal relationships and not on Talent.
good,This place is an alright place to work and if your first starting out it's the job for you. However it is overwhelming and depending on how good the management is I'd say you are better off working somewhere else as they definitely need to improve on baristas needs within the company.
good,"Management is suspect outside of direct management. Pay is low and hours suck, but it is a fun starting job to initially get into the workforce. Blah Blah Blah."
good,"The health insurance and free coffee and food is great.  I believe the company is really forward thinking but if you get a toxic manager, none of that matters.  So like every job, depends on the people."
good,"This position was very challenging because most of my associates were students so trying to balance their schedules with trainings, or their class schedules to fit the hours of operations for the store."
good,"Very great benefits with great co worker. A great place to make genuine connections with customers and co worker alike. Training is lacking, little to no follow up."
good,"Typical day at work is busy."
good,"Pretty steady work pace."
good,Union dues are deducted from your check which in my opinion is too much and should be optional. The management isn't the best but not difficult to work with.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job...Worked from home and out in the field with the Associates.  Love working with people.  "
good,"It was a great place to work, but the store manager where I was working was horrible. Everything had to be done on her time and she didn't care much to hear feedback from employees."
good,Starbucks has really good coffee and they' sell a lot of it. They have good programs in place in regards to being environmentally consciences. They can alway improve as a comapmy
good,"On one days shift as a Starbucks barista, you may have have a just a normal day, or you may walk into something you were not ready for. From my first day on the floor at Starbucks until now, I have learned so much and I continue to everyday. Once you get passed drink recipe's and ingredients, the rest is just a piece of cake."
good,The location I worked for had horrible management and had employees that lacked the skill of the job. Very lazy and made working here difficult. There wasn't any organization or supervision either. Customers were allowed to scream at employees while management stood there and watched. I feel as if I were to work at another location with better management the job would have been more suitable for me.
good,"Starbucks is the perfect job for young students that would like a flexible part-time job to make some money, but that is pretty much it. If you're not a student, and would like a full-time position this job is not for you. Tons of work and responsibility for minimum wages. If you would like weekends off to be with family, it is an unlikely option."
good,"The job at the Grist Mill is very lay back and enjoyable in some parts of the day, but the co-worker and manager have no respect for other employees. Worker don't show up to work on time. These always an issue with people not listening or taking action. The hardest part of the job is nothing other than itself."
good,"The people u work with usually are really great , but the management is always bad at starbucks. Ive worked at three seperate stores over three seperate times and the management never was good."
good,The hardest part of the job is management and shift leads. Scheduling is ALWAYS a issue. But depending on your crew it can be a chill/enlightening place to work. You meet more nice people than crazy and Starbucks has great benefits.
good,"i loved represent starbucks in canons , i a brilliant time, meet and create amazing drinks and friends,i wish the paid was better a the value of work more appreciated"
good,Starbucks was good place to work. Dealing with customers overall was pleasant. Most of the supervisors were good to work for. The benefits were also decent as well.
good,"A typical day at work, would be being able to walk into work with positive vibes. Being able to go about the day happy and delighted to serve customers. Being able to have a boss you can talk to, knowing things will remain confidential. Having co-workers who you feel comfortable around. Being able to still maintain a smile, even if the establishment isn't going how it normally does. A basic typical day at work, is enjoying the workplace and being comfortable!"
good,"The job was fun at first, but then a lot of changes started, pay was supposedly increased, but the 6 moth raise was taken away and reduced to yearly. I never really got the hours I wanted. And if there was a problem with a co worker, the management did not handle it."
good,"The job is very fast-paced and very stressful. I personally didn't get along with many of my coworkers, but that's not to say that another person wouldn't strive there. I learned very quickly how to think on my feet and how to connect with a customer while also providing fast and exceptional service."
good,"I have learned that working at Starbuck's, every day is different even if you are doing the same thing every day.  I look forward to being with my partners & regulars every day as the people are the most enjoyable part of my job.  The hardest part of my job is getting everything accomplished on a busy day & you feel overwhelmed."
good,"Es un buen ambiente la gente es muy amable y es muy tranquilo , la persona que me contrato fue muy buena persona , son muy gentiles y agradables , no pude seguir ahí por el tema del horario en la universidad"
good,"Typical Day is reviewing threats, Designing new technologies"
good,"You had to really know how to multitask working at Starbucks, and handling rude customers is also important working there too. I mostly just worked drive-thru so I dealt with the same people almost everyday. I learned how to make drinks as I continued to work there which is where I liked to be, because I always stayed busy and it helped me get better at it, which didn't take that long. The hardest thing was probably just the people that came in, you'd have your nice people, but you'd mostly just get the rude grumpy people that came in arms swinging. I really enjoyed the people I did work with, they always knew how to make each day better, and more fun to be there as well. I learned quite a lot there, multitasking the very first, but also just learning to smile and handle the customers that don't talk to you all that well. It was a great experience that I will always appreciate being apart of."
good,I enjoyed the time at Starbucks. It was definitely a culture shock for me. Every single thing I did as an ASM was very thoroughly regimented though. The training program was a year long with weekly testing and skill set demonstrations. It helped to know there was a definite path for training and accountability.
good,"Temp job that ended in about a month. Not much I can say on this job as I was hired on to handle an upgrade project. I never got to know any of the employees really as it was your typical cubical position and the amount of calls you take keeps you busy. "
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for nearly three years, and within the past years I have met more people than I could have ever imagined. Through the customer service standards Starbucks enforces, you get to meet great people and the customers begin to grow on you as well as you grow on them. Through working here, I have had customers offer job opportunities toward my career, as well as lead me toward people that will help me toward my career. Though I work in a location that is beneficial for networking, I believe the personal relationships are beneficial in networking as well as building your character and social skills."
good,"I have  become a better leader and better equipped to deal with different personalities, also learned to adapt to different styles of employees to maximize there strengths and recognize there potential."
good,"I love working at Starbucks, and at Haggen in general. I love the people I get to work with, and the customers. I think the most enjoyable thing at work would be seeing people smile when you go out of your way to get to know a customer a little better."
good,"brew coffee, maintain relationship with guests, "
good,"Starbucks was okay but the location I worked at had very demanding and particular customers that were not afraid to let you have it if they were having a bad day. Starbucks also has the false image of a ""small cozy cafe"" while consistently merging with other companies and raising prices. They also only have one fair-trade certified coffee. The work was fun, but I can't really stand behind such a huge corporation."
good,I loved working for this company but due to the laack of advancement oportunities I had to leave and find something better
good,Overall I enjoyed my job at this company and met a lots of great leaders and learned from them. I develop and support my team.
good,"This was a great environment for me to be in because I got the opportunity to connect with so many customers on a day to day basis and I absolutely loved it. From answering customers questions that they had about any of the product to selling many different items that we had in the store to sell. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a school schedule while working ridiculous hours staying open till midnight every single night only making eight dollars a hour. Majority of the coworkers that I got to work with were absolutely amazing and I got a long with all of my night crew co workers. The new management that had come in was absolutely terrible, she was not focused on anyones benefits nor was she worried about how many hours you were working while going to school. I learned how to multi task, and tend to customers while I would make sure that they were a satisfied customer each and every time and would always want to come back to our store because of the great unforgettable service."
good,"The company was just newly franchised from the world's famous coffee cafe few years before I joined the company. Free coffee at the pantry that will make coffee lover love the place. However, they have limited benefits and does not want too many regular employees so once you have been employed, they will give you a contractual tenure. No promise of regular position at all."
good,typical day would be to watch the kids as they practice their mathematics. help them to figure out how to get the correct answer while still following the guidelines of the books provided.
good,"I liked the job, I worked at a license store so we were paid minimum wage, received no corporate benefits, and followed guidelines of the license owner. It was a fun job and I feel like I gain a lot of skills with the job. Management could have been better, but that's above my pay grade. I believe that if I worked at a corporate store, than I would have a much better experience."
good,"very productive as far as managing waste and time. not so much the fun place to work. Remember it use to be ""starbucks the third place between home and work.Childen really didn't fit in to that equation. Now it's all about profits; and children bring profits, Now you have all of the sugary loaded drinks that come with the changing seasons and a new and different drink; Notably, the Frappuccinos with a cookie to match."
good,"No one covers your shifts, and you have to work even if you are feverish, contagious, or injured. It may not be true of all stores, but it is true of the one I worked at. The job itself was amazing, I loved the interaction and the different drink-making processes. I even liked running the register and washing dishes. But the management, the other workers, and the general personal interaction atmosphere was lackluster at best."
good,"My schedule always starts at 4 pm, typical rush hour. In this job you'll learn how to balance your time, doing this at the same time without even noticing it."
good,Opening procedures and preparing ingredients for the day. Making an preparing various drinks for customers. Learned how to prepare ALL drinks provided by starbucks. The hardest part of that job was dealing with irate customers and keeping up with large crowds. What enjoyed most was making customers happy and satisfying their particular needs.
good,"Het is een leuke plaats om te werken."
good,"Great company to work for. Great Benefits, Providing excellent customer services to customer. Making drinks"
good,"I'm working in a  very busy ,the biggest store in all England.My typical day at work is most of the time working on the till or calling the line(taking a orders from the customers).I learned lots of things about best customer service,till work,coffee making secrets.I always had the best relationship with my colleagues,my supervisors and my managers.Probably the hardest part of this job is standing in one position for a long time.And the most enjoyable part for me always will be having a fun with a people around me.Stuff and even customers."
good,"While working for the overall Starbucks brand was enjoyable, my experience working at a licensed store was terrible. We had poor scheduling, constantly ran out of syrups and food and I dealt with incompetence at every turn. Needless to say this would not have happened at a ""real"" Starbucks."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for although they don't pay a great salary but the benefits offered are great. You really get to enjoy being there at times because you get to know the customers and regulars so well. My biggest issue was the manager not being what i look for in a boss.
good,"Starbucks is a face paced employment teaching employee the necessary skills need to excel in customer service, multitasking, and thinking quick on their feet. However, movement for advancement appears to be very slim."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks does not exist. Working at one of the most profitable locations in south Florida means that every day provides a new challenge. As the manger on duty, I am responsible to maintain superior customer satisfaction standards, deploy my team efficiently, and handle all administrative duties. The six years I have spent with the company has taught me how to act quickly in various situations, problem solve between a very diverse staff, and still maintain real connections between all customers."
good,"One of the things i did not enjoy about Star bucks. Well let me start by saying i employed the customers, that was the best part of my day. It was the management that caused the issues. As a former employee if you where not down with there grew and I am talking about good friends with management you where treated bad. It felt that no matter how many people complimented me it did not matter to the Store manager. I never once got any kind of good review or compliment from the manager. Where if you where her friend you got rewards. I wanted to work full time be a supervisor make my way up in the company. And i was not just talking about Management I was talking about there Marketing and graphics Advertising. I wanted to be at a corp level. And felt i was steered in the wrong direction by the Manager. She told me ohh yeah you can get here or there. but nothing nor help ever came my way. And lets talk about working with Valley fever. If anyone knows what that is then you know how bad and painful it can get. But i will tell you this i managed to get there and do my job on min wage. Driving 30 miles a day. Hard worker, not to them ."
good,Learned how the big corporate world truly works. No need to explore more.
good,my coworkers are amazing. very diverse company . Love my job
good,Fun working with my team just disliked the rude customers. Hsve to know the history of all the coffee was kind of a headache .
good,"Working for Starbucks Corporation has been a great period of growth in my life. Starting as a barista I quickly learned from leadership how to lead by example and how to be lead by being teachable. Through hard work, learning from corrective criticism and my own self observation, I rose quickly in rank from Barista to Shift Supervisor and was awarded with Partner of the Quarter of the District by the District Managers and my own. Multi-tasking, thinking quickly, staying calm in a high stress environment, integrity through cash-management and being task oriented are a few of the top duties that I mastered. From the time my shift started to the moment it ended I offered professional customer service and learned the importance of creating a third home to my customers, befriending them, celebrating milestones in their lives, and traveling over-seas with those I became close to, while not compromising a professional work atmosphere while on the clock. "
good,I worked for Starbucks as a supervisor for 10 years.  The company is so big you are just a number.  Apparently after 10 years you can take a sebatical and they pay you for it but due to the fact that the company is so large and you are just a number nothing important like that is communicated.  I you are below a manager you are not typically noticed for anything unless it is to repremand you on things you did not do correctly.  The people I worked with over the 10 years I was there were great and made me a better person knowing them.  The customers I got to meet during my time at Starbucks were amazing individuals as well.  They all made an impression in my life and knowing all of them made me a better person.  The benefits are not that impressive although people get a job at Starbucks for the benefits.  Some of the perks working at Starbucks were nice the free pound of coffee or the box of tea every week and the discount during the holidays.
good,Meeting people that were traveling out of town or locally.
good,"I enjoy working in a fast paced team such as I have with Starbucks, but the policy never to offer Full-Term contracts and that we seem to be institutionally understaffed has made me esquire if It is a good match for me."
good,Great if you love fast pace and don't mind learning things once you have your own store. Training experience is lacking a lot of training. District managers are not alway supportive. Company gives back to the community and has excellent quality products.
good,"Nearly everyone drinks coffee, so we were especially busy at early mornings and late afternoon. During the day, folks would stroll in for a leisurely cup of coffee and use our Wi-Fi. You got to know your regular customers and what their usual order was."
good,"El ambiente laboral es muy bueno, aunque el trabajo muy monótono, siempre era la misma atencion, creabas muy buenas amistades dentro y fuera del personal laboral."
good, Crew leader
good,Hectic days but fun days. I learned how to created amazing drinks. Management was good most of the time one manager was a bit bipolar. I loved my coworkers not one complaint about them. The worst thing was that i would be scheduled to close and then open the next morning.
good,Well a typical day was going to work and making coffee. Didnt agree with the new managment they never let us have fun but in the beginning it was a very fun job. My most enjoyable part was getting there at six in the morning.
good,"A typical day at work consists of opening the stores register, starting the coffee and stocking the pastry case. Keeping the condiment bar stocked and tables clear for customers to be seated. I have learned how to accommodate the customer because they are always right.Supervisors were very flexible with any schedule that needs accommodation. My co workers were fun to work with and reliable. The hardest part the job was keeping up with pace during peak hours and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting an variety of different people."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, easy going work enviornment. It has great benefits and perks as an employee. It's located every where so relocating and transferring your job is easy to do. Flexible hours is always a plus. The only thing I would tell a future employee is to research its store because working with bad management can make your experience at Starbucks a horrible one."
good,"I liked my coworkers, but the managers left a lot to be desired. However, I have never had health insurance like the coverage I had working there!"
good,My experience came with its ups and downs the management depending on where you are at can be helpful to your growth if you choose this company. So I hope you enjoy your experience.
good,"Can be a very fun place to work although stressful at times. The culture is very inclusive, accepting and supportive. That is not always what is carried out at store level depending on the manager. The benefits, especially collge tuitio, are amazing"
good,Pretty good place to work at . Not if you like spending time with fam open 7 days a week. Has couple of shifts you could work with. You meet amazing people .
good,"pretty fun and exciting, you must have a strong mindset to be able to work under pressure in quick and a rushtime environment. always keep a smile on your face and make friends with customers"
good,Honestly i've been disappointed with my experience. Having free drinks and some food is nice. But I would prefer to have more hours and more money per hour. Dealing with the public is the hardest thing yet customer service barely pays over minimum wage.
good,"Even though the employees are very easy to get along with, management, as in the Store Manager, there is a bit of a lapse in leadership. The store manager is hardly ever there, and when he is there is no clear definition of who is in charge."
good,"My team, and manager typically were good about helping me get shifts switched and/or covered while I worked here. At Starbucks there is always something to do, which is great for an active body."
good,"I loved all of my co-workers at Starbucks. They were all so helpful and willing to help at all times. I could definitely create bonds with all my co-workers because they were all mostly students, like myself."
good,"My coworkers are some of the best people I have ever been around. They genuinely care about each other. HOWEVER, the previous manager was useless. The store is heading in the right direction."
good,There was behavior that shouldn’t have been acceptable but was due to poor management. Didn’t work well with schedule even when I would write in book and remind my manager weeks in advance. Good Co-workers and good atmosphere.
good,"I had fun working at Starbucks, but the people I was working with did not seem to care about their employees and the image of the business. Sometimes they let certain parts of the dress code slide and this made it sometimes hard to work there."
good,"Ça dépend de quel magasin tu travailles, mais généralement ça requiert beaucoup d'énergie et de patience, ainsi qu'une motivation..."
good,"As long as you work within a team that is very inclusive than work feels like nothing. As long as you treat your customers positively and as humans then they will do the same to you (most of the time). The people you work with and around literally make the biggest difference in the experience you will have within any store, as a customer or a partner."
good,You are able to make friends easily and it is a fun environment. Able to interact with different type of customers as I work around tourist area. The hardest part about working is when I did a mistake and feel like I let everyone down but my boss and managers are bunch of understanding and nice people. I've learnt to interact more with people and understand customer behaviors.
good,"I loved working for starbucks and getting to know regulars. The hours were long, but I enjoyed working with my coworkers a lot. It is a fast-paced environment with a lot to learn and do!"
good,"Quite an adjustment at first; fast-paced environment with many tasks. Atmosphere was enjoyable, coworkers were quite friendly and helpful, making the transition much easier."
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced job that keeps you constantly busy. Workplace culture is very energetic and positive, with sometimes having stress, it's a great place to work."
good,"El ambiente en un punto llega a ser estresante por la competencia sana que hay entre los mismos baristas y tambien por los clientes, ya que en algun momento se junta el rush."
good,"Management was just bad in general, they were rude, irresponsible, and acted like they didn't have to do anything with related, never listened to any feed back and never took responsibly for their shift. The co workers are great and way to get along with tho."
good,"This is the worst job. The location I work at is on-campus and management isn’t super strong. The product quality, however is high,and it gives you something strong to stand behind."
good,I learned more about customer service and how to adjust to different behaviors of customers. I so not feel there was always enough time in a shift to accomplish all the tasks efficiently and correctly.
good,"Very confusing morals. No care for employees living needs. Great systems in place but, employees need more love. Benefits are decent but not easy to access."
good,"It’s honestly a good place to work. Yea, some days will be worse than others and really test your patience, but getting through those makes you stronger and helps you grow as a person. The pay isn’t worth all the extra work they expect but it’s very easy to bond with your coworkers and create lasting friendships with them."
good,There wasn't a lot of opportunities for advancement at my location. But I also didn't work at a corporate location which everyone says is great and comes with great benefits.
good,"For the most part, I love my job. The downfall is the pay. As a supervisor, I feel as if I don’t get compensated for all the work I do. The benefits are amazing, especially the tuition reimbursement. All in all, working for Starbucks is not an easy job, it’s a lot of customer service and retail work, but the benefits and the coworkers outweigh the bad."
good,"starbos was great but the abuse you receive from customers along with management and a corporate office that is disconnect from what actually happens in stores leads to deteriorating mental and physical health."
good,"Coming into work sometimes its busy sometimes its not. But you have to learn how to muititask and how to satisfy your customers needs while multitasking. Overall a very enjoyable job, however I would have to say the hardest part about working there is the multitasking and making sure the drinks and working efficiently with your co-worker."
good,This is a good job for while you’re in college. The pay isn’t the best but it’s not a very hard job. You do obtain stocks while working for them. The tips can be nice also
good,"Good if you like making connections with customers. You may have to wake up at 4am, so it can throw your social life for a bit of a loop. Decent benefits."
good,Great job I learned a lot I wish they could have paid better than I would have stayed forever. The great team great company great fun. The fast paced environment was fun to be a part of.
good,"Management is touch-and-go, especially depending on the location. Decent part-time benefits, amazing full-time benefits. "
good,"This is a good job to start at if you are just getting into the groove of working. Love my coworkers, management is good. Salary could be better. Overall a pretty good experience."
good,"Great place to work, relaxed but busy. Fast-paced at times, but enjoyable. I worked at an airport so different customers constantly, but the same starbucks culture."
good,Working at Starbucks was cool for the first few months and then I realized how much I hate working in food service and how hard they make you work as a barista to only pay you minimum wage is very unfair
good,"No health benefits, not enough employees for the job. It was a constant ruching to make drinks. It’s was ok for a little wild, but I would do it for a permanent job. Not worth it."
good,"Typical day: fast paced; you will generally change from position to position throughout your shift (as asked of you); this means, being able to run bar, drive thru, register, customer, etc. "
good,"Starbucks is known for more than just their signature hot espresso drinks and icy cold Frappuccinos. ... Part of what makes Starbucks one of the best companies to work for the benefits they offer employees, the teamwork that comes with the job, and great manager and partner relationships."
good,"Lots of memorization, Management was rough. Coworkers were nice and friendly. I would recommend it if you enjoy fast paced work and you get a good staff."
good,The people I worked with at Starbucks were extremely professional and every helpful. Our regular customers were super lovely. My mangers wasn’t very helpful which was one of the reasons I wasn’t happy. Along with the lack of hours.
good,"I regularly started at 5am and finished at 1pm, so I had the whole afternoon which was nice, (not good if your not a morning person, but late shifts were available) I learnt how to make a bloody good cup of coffee as well. There were lots of young, like minded people,  and I made a lot of friends during my time there, and very close friends - even now!"
good,"Management was based on favoritism, but what workplace isn't? It was great the first 8 months, but after that they put a lot of pressure and aren't too flexible with your schedule."
good,Overall I liked working at starbucks at times it was hectic but the store environment and people I worked with made it hard to leave when I did.  I do wish this was a more viable long term option for me
good,"Working at Starbucks, woke an enjoyable and fun job, is conflicting. While the job is fun in and of itself, advancement is near unattainable, raise structure does not exist, and while hard work is expected, it is rarely valued, commended, or rewarded, making it so that no matter how hard one works, one remains just one of the baristas. Overall an enjoyable job, but not fantastic for long-term."
good,"My experiences were that if you weren't buddies with the store managers (I worked 3 different stores, same distric) then your odds of getting promoted were slim to none. Pay was good, tips every week. Good place to work if you're looking to make extra money"
good,A typical day as a shift supervisor at Starbucks is far more stressful than the typical employee but along with the stress can also come moments of fulfillment when you know you've done a good job and made a customer's day just the teensiest bit better.
good,"Not the best, or worst place to work. Great for flexibility of hours for college students. They do provide healthcare, and tuition assistance as well."
good,"It all depends on your location and attitude. If you're at a good location and have strong co-workers (Starbucks calls employees ""partners""), the job can be a lot of fun. But make no mistake, it's a TON of work, especially if you're at a drive-through or otherwise really busy location. Customers are very demanding, company standards are VERY high, and everyone is expected to put forth their best effort, at top speed, while also maintaining a very strong relationship with everyone -- customers, vendors, and partners alike."
good,"Worked in a fast friendly environment where everyone was genuinely nice and had great customer connections. Very important to make connections before making drinks, letting the customers know we care about their well-being."
good,I work 3:00pm-9:00pm over there it’s fine working over there I learn a lot of different drinks. Me and my coworker works good no problem in my shift I feel comfortable working with them
good,"Starbucks is a fun energetic work environment! They provide great benefits overall. However, the pay is not consistent with other retail jobs in the Orlando FL area."
good,"The mornings were typically very busy. We worked on base, so the military personnel would get their coffee each morning before work. Typically, I'd move from register to beverage. I was good at remembering all the ingredients, also at giving great customer service. The most enjoyable part was meeting people from all over the world, specifically one who dedicate their lives for Americans."
good,"I enjoy my fellow coworkers and the job itself. the Assistant manager is great, the manager is a little tough and jumps to conclusions but other than that the job is very pleasant."
good,"The job was very involved and required managers to think about work well past the end of day. The environment could be fun depending on which employees were hired to assist in day to day tasks. Immaturity was something all managers struggle with and little support offered from upper management on things like sick calls and workplace drama. other than that, an excellent place to spend a work day."
good,"Good experience for a new manager, however no growth above a store manager. "
good,"You get to make drinks, try new drinks, work with many wonderful people, and get to meet the regulars. I have learned how to stay calm in a high paced environment. The outside hire SMs and DMs are not the best when it boils down to front line workers from making terrible decisions that affect the rest of us. The hardest part about the job is learning the ropes of certain things, appeasing some customers, and tolerating your SM or DM."
good,I worked there for roughly two years and the management over the last year went downhill very fast. I dreaded coming in even though I loved the people I worked with. I hope that the store can recover.
good,"Starbucks would be better if they paid a better hourly rate, if they allowed more leave time & if they reconfigure their promotion process. Overall I had a good experience though."
good,"Its rough if you're not fast enough to keep up. You aren't going to be working easy or living easy here, its rough work and you will feel like you worked out after this."
good,"Management very poor. Didn't now how to properly address employees constantly berated employees in front of others and customers all the time. Not constructive advice or training , just demeaning and disrespectful."
good,"While i loved the general environment,  with the customers and fellow employees. Management has always been sort of an issue in my opinion. I had 3 general managers, ranging from too lax, to over controlling."
good,I honestly had fun working there for quite a while but I was not being given enough hours but I was granted more hours when I asked but I felt with a new shift manager who had been a bully for me during my school days who treated me poorly at work I filed complaints but little was done forcing me to leave.
good,"The job has nice perks. Its more then just being a barista and making coffee, you have to work, you have to talk to customers be empowering take initiative and get the job done. its a Service job and those we serve only want what they want how they want it and they demand it from you."
good,"Its a really great place to work. If there are bad apples they get rid of them. They notice very quick who does their job and who slacks off. If you do your job you will get benefits and move up. If you are lazy you will be fired. They also don't care to fire people, like most jobs because of having to pay unemployment they won't fire you but Starbucks Will!"
good,"People gripe a lot about the pay and hours and whatnot, but the reality is it's a bottom level job, so it's going to be rough. Put that aside and they do a really good job of taking care of their employees, especially considering that they have well over 200,000. It's been extremely rough working there and it's made day-to-day living quite difficult, but that's not the company's fault. It's paid my bills and rehired me when other options failed, so for that I'm grateful."
good,"Although working at Starbucks was incredibly fun and fulfilling, sometimes dealing with customers was unbearable as they could complain about literally anything and get you written up for it. The company looks out for their workers by providing up to 1 free meal a shift and unlimited drinks however more recently I have heard that it has been reduced to 3 drinks a shift. Starbucks is an OKAY company to work for but it realistically falls upon your attitude and how you see it. If you like fast-paced, detail oriented work, Starbucks may be for you."
good,be ready to be on your feet and work in a fast paced environment. you are asked to learn regular customers names which in reality isnt that hard. plus they pay well
good,"Must have a positive attitude, standing and moving around the entire time on the job you are making drinks back to back usually see about 57 customers per hour so really busy."
good,"Great part-time job to do while also going to school. Providing health insurance very beneficial. Could have gotten college paid for by company as well, until manager started playing games with hours, which is directly connected to healthcare eligibility. Depending on management, worshiping at the altar of Howard Schultz required if you want preferential treatment."
good,"But I wouldn’t go back to same location "
good,"Starbucks was always a positive, fun atmosphere. Just like any typical chain such as Starbucks, a typical day includes cleaning and interacting with customers."
good,Just do your job. Don't speak too much about your personal life. Don't allow supervisors and management to take advantage of you! I fulfilled a number of duties where I found myself being the only one fulfilling them on a regular basis. I have trained new hires with higher positions than I was in. Just dont let them walk all over you like I did! Big mistake.
good,"Overall good experience. Typical day at work includes making drinks, front of house/till, cleaning, drive-thru. Management at my store was good. Very enjoyable building connections with regular customers."
good,People who come to starbucks are the absolute trash of society. I have had drinks thrown on me and I have been brutalized with no compensation. It honestly wouldn't be so bad had it not been for the fact the we have to go out of our way to appease customers..
good,It was My First Job It was A Good Experience and Learning tool to start My Career Off. Gave me General Knowledge In Customer Service and Making The Custor Happy.
good,"You get great benefits, tips are distributed among the workers, great pay. The culture is a little uptight and can take some adjustment, but overall it’s a fine company."
good,"Good environment, I did not work  corporate so I did not get all of the benefits that other stores offered.  The experience overall was good. Gave me a good work ethic, and regulars made my day."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Starbucks. The environment is fast paced. You must know how to cooperate with your coworkers and communicate with everyone.
good,"The people/customers we had were extremely friendly and were business people, so the location I worked at was perfect as we all had similar personalities. It was a happy workplace up until our manager at the time got let go and was replaced by a crazy manager who micromanaged every single thing we did, especially when we would be doing things perfectly fine. There was no positive reinforcement with our work ethics, it was constant negativity."
good,"It was ok. Not, the best. My coworkers were very helpful to be around. I enjoyed my time here. Making drinks was very fun and the customers were awesome."
good,"It’s a job for college students or a second job, it wasn’t enough to live off of. My first manager was great, but when she was replaced, our new manager played clear favorites and consistently hired people who would quit a few days into training. He never felt the need to advance people who wanted to move up or learn more areas of the job. If you have the right team it can be a goodplace to work, but not always."
good,"Starbucks has a lot to offer someone who wants to settle into a role/ position in the company.  Like a lot of companies, there is a lack of importance on training.  Most new employees are expected to hit the ground running."
good,Starbucks overall was a great company to work for. It was a fast paced environment which I worked well in. The only grievance I had was with the management.
good,"If you are looking for a fast paced environment with opportunities to develop, Starbucks is for you.  You can easily advance IF you work hard.  The company works hard to communicate it's corporate culture."
good,"I was planning on growing with startbucks in hope of working for corporate. I became a barista I grew into the different roles very quickly became partner of the quarter and a barista trainer, supported all of my partners and helped them when they needed it the most. I dedicated a lot of my time to show how much I wanted to grow with them. When it was time for me to start looking for jobs in the field I went to college for (Information Technology) I didnt get that support from my manager that he prided himself in having. It was really disappointing to see that my goal and dream to work and grow with starbucks was cut short because of the selfishness of the store manager .. what's more disheartening is that it showed me he didnt live up to Starbucks' mission. If given the chance to pursue that dream to be a partner once again but for corporate in the IT field, I would take it in a heartbeat."
good,The management has completely diminished morale. I am mentally drained. The only reason I’ve stayed for so long is because of the health insurance benefits and the 401k.
good,The boss was unorganized I wasn't getting trained to be a barista but I have experience being a barista few of my coworkers trained me instead of the boss.
good,I did not like working at Starbucks. It was extremely stressfull to work in an environment that customers were not always very nice or very understanding.
good,"busy days on week days than on weekends"
good,"I enjoyed the job while it lasted. I felt as if the area also affected my experience. A lot of foreign customers would come in and it was a struggle to write down their names down and they would complain. Or there would be times where customers would pronounce something and I would think one thing and it would apparently be wrong and customers would express themselves very rudely. I also had a second job and it was rough to have a second job while working at Starbucks because the schedule was never a firm schedule. They also claim to be flexible at first, but that's not true."
good,"My experience at Starbucks was not the best. It was probably due to the establishment I worked in, but we were very understaffed and I was not trained how to properly do most things. I was often asked to do tasks that caused me a great amount of stress, and asked to pick the job over my schooling. I do not feel like I learned anything of value while I worked there. I was not able to retain anything taught to me because of how fast I was pushed through training."
good,It was a good job to work under as long as you had the most understanding supervisors and or store manager otherwise they expect too much and especially from minors.
good,"Starbucks offers great flexibility for college students, and provides the proper environment for learning to understand a corporations developing vision, and making it your own."
good,Had to take notes on all the different drink recipes. Was challenging to a degree. Left for better opportunity. Loved that as part of training we were mostly required to taste ALL drink and sample the food! Yum.
good,"Great place to work. I enjoyed mostly everybody that i worked with, but the manager was a bit unstable somedays, and a bully. Loved everything about my job Except the manager"
good,i thought that this was a good place to work. I never had any problems. i would go back again. I thing that the best part was that we got to drink all the great coffee.
good,"we should have been paid more, atmosphere was fun but we worked long hours and a lot was expected of all of us with next to minimum wage that was unlivable"
good,the hardest part of the job is picking up the slack of others and if not you get the complete blame for it. many stores don't have the team effort. management handles the paperwork. if you are a student it is convenient with the flexibility of hours.
good,"MicroManagement around the stores. The gossiping is none stop. Expectation are very high for the pay. "
good,"pretty basic barista job"
good,"While the job was socially rewarding, compensation and pay weighed the difference. The owner fails in management and communication, leaving whomever is in management to take any responsibility, and broke contract with their clients multiple times, even to the point of forcing us to serve food that was explicitly disgusted by the public or putting us into positions that was borderline illegal. So while the environment for work was so great that I stayed for 5 years, my bosses weren't good, ethical people to work for."
good,"Working with Starbucks has taught me more than any class could. they teach you responsibility, perfection, teem work, communication, and much more. its a great place to start off in your life. It has given me respect for food chain, business, restaurants, and employees. that I probably not have anywhere else."
good,for the time i did work at Starbucks the environment taught me patient also how to interact with various people. How to delegate a team and perform certain order in the work place
good,"A typical day is full of quick solve problems, dealing with difficult customers are partners alike. Definitely not a job for someone who can not control stress and work consistently through challenging scenarios. Public speaking is the key to moving up as well as event planning and communal involvement."
good,"Great place for a first job, learning expectations of the workforce."
good,"Pretty much what you'd expect. The experience is completely influenced by the manager and the team you work with. If you like your manager, it can be very enjoyable. If you don't like the manager..."
good,The best thing i'd say is getting to meet different people everyday and creating a rapport with regular customers they become friends and make going to work enjoyable.
good,"Managers make a fair salary and quarterly bonuses with stock options.  401k match and free death benefit equivalent to your annual salary.  Hourly employees are underpaid and stores are constantly understaffed, which makes it difficult to motivate teams and manage turnover."
good,"I didn't like the people that I'm working with. The manager was nice, but sometimes I would receive racist comments about my culture and he didn't defend me. That's why I hated it."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I had a lot of fun with my co-workers and the benefits were great. Free coffee is always nice, and would consider working there again."
good,"Nice. Worked with a crew. Some people knew what to do some didn't. Too many bosses or at least they thought they were. I was there to make money but did not make much. To many expect"
good,Flexible hours and reasonable pay for college students. Benefits are amazing. Depending on location changes ability to advance within company. Must excel at time management and multi-tasking.
good,"This is no easy work environment- the training doesn't fully prepare you for the daily onslaught of needy, angry, picky customers who want nothing more than to get their sugary treat and leave. That being said, the (lower) management take time in supporting and preparing you for success, for day-to-day and long term. The ASU program is excellent, the company makes attempts at donation and giving back to local communities, and the benefits are nothing to sneeze at. Prepare to be endlessly understaffed and bombarded with promotional events that you're never adequately prepared for."
good,"It's a great place to get your feet wet in a number of roles. Great benefits, free coffee while you work, and stock options. I actually miss waking up at 0345 to go work an opening shift."
good,Great job to have while in college.  You get free coffee mark-outs weekly and also free drinks while on your shifts. Co-workers for the most part are easy going.
good,"It is a great place to work but they do not pay baristas well enough. If this survey is voluntary, why is there a minimum length for this review? I don't like that"
good,I enjoyed working at starbucks the management was an issue to me but i got the job done. The manager didnt like me much so i had to work harder. I was a bagger during the hyvee part of my job.
good,"Make sure you know who your manager is and what they’re like. I worked in a store in Sunnyvale CA and i LOVED the manager and the coworkers there I transferred because I was driving an hour to work at 3 am every morning but honestly I would have rather kept doing that. The manager would make assumptions based on what other people said and never actually gave me a chance. She would throw me on food warming and even when I tried my hardest she was still rude to me. She was extremely fake and had favorites which, personally, isn’t professional at all."
good,"constant push for unrealistic expectations, very stressful, customer service and patience needed. multi-tasking is a must. there is a lot of skills required to memorize and master. training requires patience and the ability to understand different learning techniques."
good,Depending on what you’re intentions are if startbucks is life for you then so be it but for me its not. Just waiting on a new job to finally quit 😩😩
good,"Fast paced work environment "
good,"Very great coworkers"
good,"A great place to work for baristas, however any position beyond that will blur the lines of your job description. I may have just worked in a particularly unfair location but personally I was taking on many of my store managers responsibilities that were not in my job description."
good,"Over-all, I enjoyed what I did at Starbucks, and the people I worked with. I loved seeing my regular customers, and even became close friends with some of them. It was for the most part, a positive environment. However, management has a lot of rough spots to smooth out if they want to keep employees around for a long time."
good,Working as a barista was fun but the working hours is very tiring to me. Overall a good experience for those who would like to be a part of the F&B industry.
good,"Very organised, small place, ran well, lovely staff and customers, everything was kept clean ec etc............................................................"
good,"It's been years since I worked at a lone standing Starbucks, but from what I can recall it was overall a decent first job. I don't recall much other than the manager at the time was unprofessional."
good,If the management team were more organized we wouldn't feel like we were constantly running into each other. We were always busy with not a lot of help. I always felt bad vibes
good,its was a fun part time job. very fast paced and learned displine of a fast paced work vibe. It was good however i did not see much opportunity for growth
good,"Starbucks is an upbeat place to work.  The products sold are amazing, and generally so are the people.  However, I do not see myself staying there permanently.  Mainly because it is a field I do not feel my skills are able to be used to their full potential.  The pay is not truly enough to establish a firm foundation in life independently;"
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work if your in need of a flexible work schedual. I really enjoyed the environment that the company was trying to create and the benefits that they give to its employees. Although, I had some conflicts with my direct management."
good,The benefits of this company are good. Like most jobs the environment is contingent upon management and mine wasn't very good. I worked here for 7 years and overall enjoyed my time.
good,"Your typical day at work usually starts around 5 in the morning. You learn a lot about how things work in the food industry and how you should act. Management was bearable, but it was from my own experience. workplace was fun at first but gradually became unbearable to work in due to complications. Hardest part of the job is dealing with both angry customers and management creating a stressed environment. Most enjoyable would be learning how and where coffee was obtained/made, co-workers, discounted food and beverages, creating your own beverages and learning about new things coming out."
good,"Starbucks is alright to work at if you don't mind stressful mornings and the occasional angry customer. People are generally nice and the work itself is not difficult at all, so the only hard part of the job is when customers get a bit distressed and decide to take it out on you. Can be very tiring, so please keep hydrated and get plenty of rest."
good,It was fast paced and fun. The other co-workers not working would make the day harder. The management was hard-working and cooperative. I enjoyed the coffee culture and the experience.
good,"Overall, management is poor and very unorganized. Learning about the coffee is very enjoyable and so is working with such nice people on shift but that's the extent of it. Management is very poor and you have to do all the wrong things to get recognized which is not how it should work."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty enjoyable, the hardest part to me was keeping up on the drink bar during a rush and only being paid $9.00/hr, other than that everything was fine."
good,"Working at Starbucks is great if you choose the right location. I didn't enjoy working there cause the pay was too low and I only got paid monthly so I would be expecting to have the money to pay my rent in full and my utilities and internet and buy food and other necessities but I always had to use the money I got from the job plus money from my savings account to pay for everything and I did not like that. Also, the people I was working with were not the best of people and everything was everywhere and things were not being done with the syrups and beverages the way they were supposed to which was nasty. But it wasn't a terrible experience."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks but the management was very chill and a lot of the employees took advantage of their freedom with the job and did not perform their assigned duties very well because of this.
good,I have worked with the company for years and after each year it just seems less exciting. The manager turnover rate is higher than that of their employees which is actually kind of sad. They do make up for lack of pay with benefits but that only goes so far. Do I enjoy it? Sure. Do I enjoy it like I did three years ago? No. It is a good starter job and each day is different from the last. It is a fun job just wish there was more support behind it.
good,"Starbucks if perfect for college students or someone who is looking for flexible part time work. They provide awesome benefits and compensation for a student, but it is hard to live off Starbucks alone."
good,"For being a barista, starbucks has the added challenge of learning new drinks every few weeks, but it keeps things interesting. My coworkers are very wonderful, and manager works hard as well."
good,"I assisted with returns at the customer service desk, as well as I was also a cashier and helped customers locate items they were looking for. I picked up many shifts for all job titles I filled for more hours. However, I worked in food service with the store as well most of the time (Starbucks and Pizza Hut/Food Avenue inside the store)."
good,"I was told that I was in charge of my own advancement I brought it up multiple times and the manages continually forgot or didn't put in the effort to help me advance. Besides that the Starbucks policies kinda forces managers to be good so they were overall a good manager. Benefits are given after 20 hours which is good and great stock options/401K however the pay for a barista isn't enough for cost of living. "
good,"I’ve been working at Starbucks for a minute now and although I do love the novelty of making drinks and connecting with customers and other partners, (in fact, that’s what’s kept me around so long) the management situation is such a deep shame. After picking up shifts at several different stores in my city, I’ve noticed that people like to pick and choose which rules they want to follow. Whether it’s regarding dress code, drink and food standards, and even the way we clean the store — it’s always different from manager to manager. It’s like a company run by teenagers, for christ’s sake. There’s a lot of turnover too."
good,"Starbucks is a great company that stresses the importance of great customer service, but the customers aren't always nice. There are busy peaks and it can become super stressful if you're not fast enough. Sometimes it feels more like a fast food service rather than a cafe because there's a push on drive-thru times and customers can become belligerent even if they see that your crew is struggling. Often times it feels like the pay isn't enough for what Starbucks baristas have to deal with, but the benefits are very good.  Many baristas at my previous store was not happy with management because we felt that they didn't see the importance of school/work life balance (We had many college students). Essentially, that is the reason I chose to leave the company. The new manager was not willing to work with my school hours. That semester was my graduating semester so I had to choose what was most important to me. It is advisable to not have too many school hours while trying to work this job. Other than that, I really did have some enjoyable time making drinks and connecting with partners and some of the customers."
good,"It was a played back job up until it wasn't. There was a lot of just sitting there waiting for customers looking like your staying busy by wiping down the counter (old bar tender trick) my hours where cutting in to my other jobs time and no one could cover me. "
good,"With good management, it can be fun to be at work. However, if unorganized, the fast-paced job can become hectic and overwhelming. It provides a place for creativity in the workplace and friendly visits with customers."
good,Working at starbucks is as good as youd expect. It's not bad for a part time job while in school. Learning what actually happens there was fun as I was a regular customer of starbucks.
good,"The people that work there are amazing along with management, however when working at a Starbucks inside a Target wages are cut. This makes it seem like it is not a starbucks at all."
good,"Starbucks was fun to work at. I learned a lot about different coffees and teas. It was very fast paced with a lot of customers. Starbucks is all about team work. Starbucks was very strict about sanitation policies, almost every single thing in the store is cleaned every night and sanitized throughout the day. The best part was meeting the customers and learning more about them, creating the beverages was very enjoyable as well! The hardest part was when the store was very busy and there's a difficult customer. That only made me be overall more patient because I knew it was important to do my best to make every customers experience a great one."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you're a student, recent grad looking for other work, stay at home mom with kids in school, etc. Advancement is possible within the company but only if you play their game. A typical day at work is so physically demanding and exhausting that it makes studying or job searching after working hours very challenging. The atmosphere depends so much on the other baristas, shift supervisors and managers in the store. Some managers take themselves so incredibly seriously that steaming a latte becomes a military chore. Some make it very enjoyable and laughter fills the days at the store. It truly depends. "
good,"Company has great values at the corporate level, if only they could get lower level management to adhere to said values. Not the best place for independent thinkers."
good,"i truly enjoyed being a barista but it was not enough hours, the pay was 12.50 a hour plus tips. it was pretty cool, and i worked in the airport so i met alot of cool new people. i was certified twice. it was pretty fast paced. u have to be on point in order to truly be a good barista."
good,"poor management, too many entitled customers that are used to the treatment that corporate enables them to have; starbucks did pay for three years of college, though."
good,"Starbucks does everything they can to make your working environment fun and comfortable. The only thing that makes Starbucks hard to work at is that the people placed in management are not reasonable or caring. Otherwise, I recommend it 100%!"
good,It’s a great company to work for for short periods of time and people in college. It’s not a career because it has low advancement possibilities. The discounts and perks make it great.
good,"During my time as a barista at Starbucks, my manager, on multiple occasions received terrible customer service ratings and tips. (which we shared at the end of the week based off of hours worked). My coworker was paid more than I was for the same job, and was never treated as an equal by the manager."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work at, but it can be too much at times. The pay is better than most places, as well as the benefits, but the environment can be toxic at times. It is very fast paced, and multi-tasking is a MUST!!! Sometimes you'll get rude customers, and the job sometimes can be overwhelming, but the people you'll meet are for the most part great!"
good,"It's always overwhelming when you start, but once you get the recipes down, it's easy peasy.  The only thing you really need is patience.  Patience for the customers who think they know what they are ordering (but really don't) and can be rude -or rude customers in general, and patience for when your fellow partners do not wish to help share the workload/or call out on a shift at will, leaving you short.  I don't think the amount of work you do there is commensurate to the pay you receive, but it is a job (not a career for many, for a reason).  The worklife culture is pretty decent."
good,"supervisor typical day , with a good team . "
good,"With my time at Starbucks, I knew from early on that it would be short-lived. I started out after spending multiple years with a local coffee shop, and wanted an opportunity to pay for school and have more stability. I quickly found out that with no cosigner, I still would not be able to get the initial loans, and my coworkers created too much drama on the floor. The customers brought me down on several occasions, to the point where I didn't want to be in charge of ringing out transactions because the attitude was almost as if the baristas working were machines, not humans with feelings. I have never been treated so poorly in a workplace, and I don't think I would ever return."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is filled with different customer interactions, creating beverages and handling cash. Every day is different, but very busy."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work especially during peak, but the pay isnt great enough to keep up with bills which i dont understand. It is a multi-billion dollar company. Least they can do is pay the employees well"
good,"I had many issues with scheduling.  I would be scheduled out of my availability frequently and then would be criticized for not being able to make a shift that was out of my availability in the first place.  Honestly, great work environment.  Co-workers and managers are fun.  Scheduling is the only issue I had."
good,Too much micro management with every one trying to give orders but no one willing to follow them. Wanted shift leads to take less of a role on the floor instead leaving most ALL tasks to other employees.
good,"Love working at Starbucks, the only down side is working every weekend. It’s exciting learning new drinks and practising latte art too! Everyday is a different day"
good,"in my time working with starbucks, i found my self constantly challenging myself too be better and work harder. all the employees there were very nice and super helpful ."
good,"I worked 15 minutes away, but because of the city line, I was making below minimum wage for where I lived. It was AWFUL. The hours were long and strenuous, the customers could get pretty rude, but I had some really nice coworkers and the perks werent awful."
good,"Starbucks was affiliate of the company i was working for. There  was also something missing. most employee were lazy and told customer customer than didn't the products even if it was on the shelf. manager did not convey their policy on paper therefore it was hard to see what was expected from the employee. I would love to try coraporate Starbucks ,because i hard a lot of good things about them."
good,The culture was great but the pay was horrible. I know it has changed since I left but I do not know what that is. There is room for advancement but again at the time I worked there the pay wasn't worth the extra responsibilities.
good,I worked at two locations. The managers for both couldn't keep staff and gave no room for growth. one location had 3 new General managers in a 4 month time frame. I loved the job itself but it all starts with your management team on how your day will go.
good,"Overall, it is a good place to work! You meet so many different people and there are so many benefits. You learn routine, discipline and respect for others."
good,I was happy to work for starbucks. They tought me a lot about coffee. It really showed me how to work in a fast past enviroment at a very young age. fun
good,"coworkers are the best part of the job. The connection you make with coworkers and customers worth it but definitely not the pay. management is not the best, depending on your DM or SM."
good,I really enjoyed working here but the location I was at was stressful and not managed well. I learned a lot but want something more secure and batter managed
good,I loved working at Starbucks. The only reason I quit is because of management. This is the only job I've ever quit in my life becuase the management was that poor. This is the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Starbucks.
good,Good for work during school. You adjust your schedule as long as your manager follows it. They all vary by location from high traffic to low traffic and community feel vs travelers. I've worked at both and you have to find your right fit.
good,"Working at Starbucks overall was great. The job was fairly straight forward and the customers were generally great. The downside was the lack of consistency in schedule as well as management. It made it difficult to plan your life more than a week in advance, as schedules were supposed to be posted 2 weeks out, but often were not and would continually change."
good,"➢ Provide quality food and handcrafted beverages in accordance with Starbucks’ standards."
good,"A lot of friendly people and it's very fun to have quick conversations with costumers. As well as get to know regular costumers, who always have new stories to tell us."
good,I enjoy getting to know my customers and coworkers. But the environment isn't the same like it was when I started. I feel like the company isn't like it used to be. Hopefully things will change soon.
good,"A company that offers good benefits for an entry level job and tends to attract good co-workers.  It is very fast paced, so if you're looking to relax on the job, you may want to skip this one."
good,Mensen waren oneerlijk over hoe ze zich voelde hier en dat zorgde voor een gespannen werkomgeving. Het werk zelf was wel leuk en ik heb er vrienden gemaakt dus boos ben ik niet weggelopen.
good,"Meeting new people and connecting to them on a different level besides small talk. Co-workers were amazing to work with and I always left smiling. The managers were great, although they changed often."
good,"Starbucks has been a wonderful company to work for! If you are placed in the right location with the right management, you can find yourself waking up and being excited about going to work!"
good,"With almost 7 years at the company, over 6 different stores, countless managerial changes, the company as a whole is spectacular. Unfortunately, as with most places, there will always be those few who ruin the experience for the many."
good,I worked at a Target Starbucks and the management is what really made it unbearable. But my team mates were fantastic! And the job itself was easy and quick paced.
good,I have worked here for about a year now and I am currently looking for another job because they will not give me more than 20 hours of work. I love this company because they pay for my online schooling through ASU but I am not given enough hours to work for them to be able to pay for it. I have worked at two stores and the managers seem like they are never there or do not put in a lot of effort into their store. It’s the shift supervisors that do a lot of the work. This job is great for a first job but it’s not one you would like to keep down the road.
good,"Exciting place to work! Hard to move up into management when working through ingles, no benefits but guaranteed hours for the most part. Very busy and will keep you moving!"
good,"The job itself is very fun, but I was always making up for mistakes of upper management.  It was very cliquish and you basically weren't going to advance if you werent part of the inner group."
good,Enjoyed the barista position and coffee shop atmosphere. Really helped me when I needed it after a terrible divorce. Starbucks saved my life. Hard work but great comradery.
good,"It was okay nothing special, working for cooperate was better than a store franchise that's all I can say. If you start your career here they have okay benefits but not for their part time employees."
good,"very attentive and informative district managers that really cared about the business and its partners. There are very high expectations placed on the managers and the baristas. So, it can be very stressful at times, but the culture is fun and high energy."
good,"Starbucks upholds very high standards that the company expects their partners to represent. However, the amount of labor required does not compensate the amount their workers are paid. For such a well-known company, minimum wage just is not enough."
good,Good place to work the only problem is the pay and the hours and it also depend on who your manager is and also the team that your working with.......
good,see below..  kind of a hit and miss place to work depending on management and which role you wish to be in. relatively poor work life balance for a part time or full time role.
good,"brewing coffee, greeting costumers, creating lasting relationships with costumers, cleaning often, must be okay with high stress situations and large volume of traffic while only working with maybe one other person."
good,"Lo más especial de Starbucks es la cultura de la marca y el respeto que tienen todos los Partners por esta. Aprender diariamente sobre los secretos detrás del éxito de Starbucks y sobre el mundo del café es increíble. Me gustaba mucho que cada día había algo nuevo que hacer y que aprender. Aprendí mucho sobre el trabajo en equipo, motivación y perseverancia continua, relaciones interpersonales, trabajo bajo presión. "
good,"Like any job, it has its ups and downs. Drama, rude people (not just customers) and stress. The job itself is pretty simple the drinks are all almost the same once you get the hang of it. It is a nice beginner job."
good,"The stores are all set up to succeed, but it's on the manager to listen to the needs of their partners. Typical days are busy, messy, and stressful. However, a positive and well-assembled and matched crew of partners can manage it."
good,Definitely a good place to work - they take great care of their employees. This company stretched and challenged me to be a harder worker and a better employee.
good,"The best part of the job is, with relatively open availability, this job is flexible in terms of scheduling. The daily workload is not too much, but can be overbearing at times."
good,Depending on your ability to work In an ever changing environment this job could be for you. Most times I didn’t get more than 17 hours (part time) even though I’d requested full time. The place can be fun if you work with the right people. However if you don’t like fast pace or have awful people skills this place isn’t for you. Set hours aren’t a thing and it’s very possible you will meet people that make you hate your job. But over all it was not a bad place to go and work.
good,"Not terrible, but not fantastic. Would recommend to a friend. Would work there again but under different management and with tips. Received none of the benefits that are promised to Starbucks employees."
good,"It's like working in a coffee shop. Not a whole lot of structure. Meetings held in ""soft seating"" in the halls or open spaces. Not very technically savvy company. It may have changed with a new CEO. A pain to commute, there's no onsite parking. You have to take a shuttle to another parking lot."
good,Starbucks has drastically changed their values. I feel that people who take regulations and rules seriously no longer have the support needed. I honestly believed that I would be retiring with this company.
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks the company but I worked at a licensed store inside of an Albertsons and the management was terrible they were very careless and lazy. They didn't really care about Starbucks the employees or the fact that the kiosk was in the store they were not helpful at all if you ever want to work for the company I would advise working for a corporate kiosk.
good,"I was thrown on the register for most part of the first few months I worked there. I enjoyed working with one of my supervisors, but the others were the no-fun, just work type. After awhile, you can pretty much get everything done that you need to do, and those managers get you to work on things that don't need to be worked on, just busy work."
good,I love Starbucks and the decisions that are made regarding social issues at a higher level than most other companies. I enjoyed working there but I personally and many others were treated unfairly. It all just depends on where you work I guess.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. You get a good discount and learn a lot about tea and coffee. It is fast paced and fun if you work with the right people. Customers can be rude but others are amazing. Management needed work and there is not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Not the job for you if you want a relaxed job. It is not hard to learn the drinks, but they are constantly adding new ones for you to learn. Overall, a good first job."
good,My Starbucks work experience would fall under the cutthroat category. The manager was unpleasant the workers gossiped and did not treat each other with respect. My shift supervisor once through a sharpie at my head while I was with a customer at the reg. because I forgot to put the cap back on. He was very angry at me for this. The managers and shift supervisors used more of a bullying tactic and belittled. I have them make workers cry (including me). I had a terrible experience with my manager. She was very unprofessional.
good,"Good atmosphere, next to the campus of my school. Ok job for a student"
good,"Just go work in a restaurant. Great place and nice people."
good,Every day at work is very busy. I have learned to multi-task while making little to no mistakes. I do appreciate everyone at work as we work as a team.
good,Loved the atmosphere and customers. Management was a mess and I worked there for three years and never made more than minimum wage. Was written up for being hospitalized
good,"A fun job, all the workers were positive and happy. Very high paced which would make the day go by faster. Fun to interact with customers and make drinks."
good,"I used to love working at Starbucks. The drink crafting and emphasis on customer service fulfilled a lot of my desired job description. However, communication at the store level is abhorrent, and so many of the employees are dissatisfied with compensation and management. After 2 years as a shift supervisor, and almost 3 years of employment with the company, I have noticed a level of complacency and lack of responsibility on part of my superiors. I work very hard for my store and the employees that work under me, and I seldom feel recognized for that dedication and commitment."
good,I worked at starbucks for 2 years it was overall a great experience for  me. The aroma of coffee when you walk into the place gives you a more at home feel.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fast paced. Employees have to remember an overly large amount of drink recipes. No wonder they get the orders wrong so often. Despite the difficulty, had I been able to keep up I think I would have enjoyed working there for a long time."
good,benefits are better than anywhere else but the management is horrible all the way up the ladder....pay isnt worth the job....doesnt offer much for advancement either
good,Wont be bored unless you're stuck on register and its slow. You have to deal with the good and bad like most retail. Benefits outweigh the crappiness.
good,"Experience depends on your coworkers and employer, my coworkers were great and I had such a fun time! Starbucks overall was a great place to work as a first job, their training program is very extensive and teaches everything you need to know about the drink menu. I learned a lot about customizations, and really listening to the customers preferences to make suggestions about drinks they would like, Starbucks is all about making the customer happy. Pay is terrible, basically no raises even if you are a star employee. So... a great place to start, learn about coffee and gain experience, not a place to end up."
good,"It's not bad for a part-time job in college, though I don't see it becoming a career at all. Unless you're really into, go look for something better, honestly."
good,"i really enjoyed being a barista and the customers . i learned how to improve my customer service skills , how to make different type of drink and how to work as a team to get fast paced things done"
good,I am a closer which is a bit different that the day time work.  I have to not only provide high quality handcrafted beverages at an expedient pace with a friendly facade but also have to clean sanitize and prep for the following day.  Its is a lot of fun and a load of work.
good,"The manager at the time did not know much about the company and that showed in every aspect of the job. It was a very fun environment, I loved how fast paced it was, and my coworkers were awesome"
good,I motivated partners into doing daily duties to maintain clean and welcoming environment. Assisted with any translations between customers and partners. Acknowledge anything that either required to be completed or assisted. Provided excellent customer service. Provided help to any Starbucks store when shortage on staff/partners.
good,"Messy job, expect to smell like a caramel macchiato by the end of your shift. The coworkers are great and treat you like family. It's not an easy job when you have to remember all the new drink recipes and when there's a line of 20 drinks for you to make all by yourself. If you don't have a passion for coffee, this job is NOT for you."
good,A typical day at work you go in and don't know what to expect on where you will be positioned for the day. People can be very demanding at times but you just have to meet all of the customers needs.
good,Open the store completely with accuracy and a positive atmosphere. Service and make comfortable as many customers. Keep coffee house clean & compliant
good,"As long as you do your part and get your  work done everything flows smooth providing a good day at work, at times of other workers playing and causing a disruption causes a hectic day at work."
good,"Starbucks was a fine company to work for. The culture and co-workers keep it fun but it varies from store to store. Be ready to deal with terrible, self-entitles customers and even if you do everything to make them happy you may still have to answer to management. Flexible schedule, work most Holidays, tips are not great but something. Great part-time job or in-between careers just don't get stuck and unable to leave for a better opportunity."
good,I met a lot of people and some of them I am still in contact with after working there.  It was either fast paced or very slow.  It was fun learning who the regulars were and what they liked.
good,"As a company I truly enjoyed working for Starbucks. In the district I specifically worked, there was high management turnover, which in turn over stressed the supervisors. Which is why I eventually left. They had a great training program when i worked there, but im sure much has changed in the 5 years since I left."
good,"grocery store setting "
good,A typical day in the work place would be getting to work joking with the staff before clocking in. Then once on the clock it then becomes all about business. I learned when working you have to be able to maintain a balance between being serious with your coworkers and joking. The hardest part of my job was working with my friends. Working with friends becomes a little challenging when everybody don't know how to cut the friendly side off and get back to being professional. I learned to over come that obstacle just by communicating the issue with my friends. One thing that was the most enjoyable was the energy and support that all my coworkers showed to each other each and everyday.
good,"As a manager you should be prepared to do the same work you expect to see from your baristas and supervisors. Expect roadblocks from upper management, but if you can prove you know what you're doing you will earn trust and get everything you need to succeed. Building relationships with your team is very important. Happy employees = happy customers!!"
good,Starbucks is another amazing brand with global appeal and lots of good opportunities. Innovation and technology support the ideals of the leadership team to make it easier on retail partners to support great customer service.
good,"- hourly rate is pretty low, but benefits are amazing"
good,"Overall, this company is great to work for and offers a variety of great benefits. As long as you are able to work at least 20 hours a week you receive a lot of amazing benefits. The only problem I have is that my district really over hires and I constantly struggle to get enough hours to maintain my benefits, and am no longer eligible because of this issue."
good,Starbucks was a good company to work for as they offered hands on training and really great benefits. I started with them with no experience at all and they were able to teach me and show me how easy it was to learn all of the ingredients to making Starbucks Signature drinks. My customers were always my favorite part of the job when we could make their day simply by making their favorite drinks and just having a few nice word to say.
good,Working here is very unrewarding and brutal. Management only cares about preserving their job and advancing while leaving us to fend for ourselves. It really stinks.
good,Everything was very fast paced. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people who surrounded me but didn't like the short breaks. The company benefits are great for those who are looking to make a living through starbucks.
good,Great benefits but management can make or break your experience with this company. Worst part of job is rude customers and power-hungry supervisors. Best part is the regular customers who you get to know very well. Provides a great training on the basics but there is room for improvement.
good,"I’m conflicted writing this"
good,"Starbucks has a lot to offer with benefits (401K, stocks, insurance, money for college), but if you don't take advantage of that, compensation is minimum wage. With the occasional raise of $0.50 cents an hour, it is hard making a living off of Starbucks"
good,made coffee talked to coworkers. laid back but management was not the best. too laid back for me. overall great experience would go back after I retire it just depends on the team you have.
good,I loved the manager that hired me. She was fun and youthful and easy to connect to and learn from. When they replaced her I was devastated and that was when all the problems started.
good,I have no issues with Starbucks it just wasn't for me at the time but I met the love of my life there. It is a fast-paced work environment and stressful at times but your coworkers can make it fun.
good,Very busy. Need to have great customer service and patience. Very routine job. You will come in and do the same thing everyday. Need to be able to work well with others.
good,Fun place to work with great people. There’s always something to do and it’s always busy which keeps us as employees at work.  The regular customers make the day great and it’s nice getting to know them.
good,Very upbeat and a lot of movement. very friendly people along each work shift. Everyone had a specific role to play that made the work day go smooth and quick.
good,It was ok because management wasn't very thorough or fair to many of . the employees. I would have had a great time if it wasn't for that. Great atmosphere and work environment. Not so great co-workers
good,On a normal day you meet plenty of customers each with their own drink that you make specially for them. You learn that the numerous drinks we offer can be altered in a way that makes the drink unique for each individual. Working as a cashier and a barista means you have to stay focused and maintain an easy going attitude in order to enjoy your job.
good,"They could definitely compensate their employees better than they do. Hourly wage as a shift supervisor was barely over minimum wage, even though I had been in the position for 5 years. Benefits are competitive with 401K matching and free coffee markouts every week. You get awarded stock which is nice. Wasn't given enough labor hours to meet standards. We were expected to go faster and faster but never had enough people to make it happen."
good,"Stressful and fast pace. Bringing top management with no or little experience will be down fall for most companies. Low salary, but good compensations. Good first job for most."
good,"a typical day at work would have its highs and lows as far as flow in customers. I had to do a lot of cleaning and maintaining the store but that's any food service job. I've worked at many different locations, whether it be covering shifts or a transfer, but there was quite a bit of inconsistencies when it came to management, especially store managers. Not sure if my age or just my focused work demeanor threw female managers off but both of my SM's at 2 different locations gave me problems to the extent that I felt targeted and ultimately hated my job. great company but the downfalls for me while working there from late high school to early college was rocky with the store managers. they never tried to help, just enforce, enforce, enforce, which is necessary but I overall was a great hard-worker in the midst of college, extracurriculars and regular life."
good,Often the picture perfect starbucks that you walk into everyday is not what it seems. The management and supervision are often inexperienced and crack under pressure.
good,I totally enjoyed working for Starbucks. At the store manager and above levels the competition is ferrous.  I you in the slightest seem to be more able or better at the job than your supervisor your job was in jeopardy.
good,Team was not treated like they mattered very understaffed for the volume and foot traffic that the store had employees was treated like they was not important to the success of the store.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is fast paced, collaborative, creative. You get to work with your friends and see your favorite regulars each day. Such a joy."
good,"A job like Starbucks can be good or bad based on 2 things: your manager and your coworker. It's flexible with your schedule, you get discounts/free drinks and food, you get stock options and more. It was an easy part-time job from high school until I finished college"
good,A typical day of work includes multi-tasking and a positive attitude at all times. I have learned to deal with a variety of situations and how to meet expectations. The management is above average and understand how to run a successful company. The most difficult part of the job was multi-tasking and making every customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know coworkers and developing friendships.
good,This Starbucks is busy and too fast paced for the amount of staff at the location.  I mainly didn't like the quickness of the customers orders. It started to feel like I was trying to throw sugars and syrups into cups as fast as I could.
good,Starbucks was great with amazing management. I loved working there and I probably would of relocated to another one if offered a better salary. Overall a decent company.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance"
good,a typical day at starbucks is all about smiles getting the customers in and out with a big smile. working for Starbucks I learn how to humble myself. The workplace culture was so amazing you get to meet all kind of people from all around. The hardest part of the job was when we were short staff.
good,"They dont give any hours and keeps hiring more people and cutting days. My manager doesnt help with anything. They have a good structure, treats every customer well and makes everyone feel at home."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a good company to work for and has great benefits if you can afford them and consistently work at least 20 hours per week to qualify for them."
good,Well for a barista job it wasn't that bad it was very fast paced in the heart of Manhattan and down the street from school so it was convenient but the work environment required a lot of movement and patience other than that pretty chill job.
good,"Clock In."
good,This is a job that offers lower pay but great benefits.  I was unable to afford to keep working there and had a manager who was fired for misconduct but I liked my experience overall
good,Was a fun place to work where you got to interact with a variety of people. Can be stressful at times. My favorite part of the job was learning about different coffees and drinks. Helped me learn a lot about order placements and helped me to work on my customer service and leadership skills
good,"Starbucks has helped me get my bachelor's degree, however, I could not have financially survive on their paychecks without the help of being able to live with my parents. I think Starbucks is a good ""first job"" or young person's job, and unless you move up the ranks, the pay is terrible. Starbucks raves about the benefits, but not very many people can take advantage of them when they make minimum wage. There are great people that work there, and the fast paced environment is always fun. But like I said, unless you move up the management ladder, the pay is terrible."
good,Things aren’t the way they used to be. I was with this company for a long time . The expectations to please the shareholders became a bigger priority then our common commitments.
good,"The company does provide more benefits than most similar jobs, and the people who work there are also usually friendly. However, the company encourages customers to verbally abused employees. Over the years, it became less about creating a perfect coffee beverage and more about shoving sugar down the throats of Americans. Customers are more and more entitled to scream, yell, throw temper tantrums in order to get free stuff, and corporate just let's them walk all over us."
good,working 10 hours a day on my feet the whole time. I was working on the off shift so I would not get home until midnight on the days that I worked. so this would cut into my time with my family.
good,The pay was a little low for how big this company is. The discounts definitely made up for it! It was very fast paced. I loved it. I would go back if I had to.
good,Tienes que ser rapido y estar atento de todo lo que pasa en la tienda.
good,"Annoying at times where some stores don't follow the standards so when a customer comes in, they complain that it's not the same for them."
good,"There was always a family aspect at our store among the partners. Even when management was up and down and unorganized, the partners always had each others backs and made sure the other person was okay, Starbucks in general is an amazing company to work for, they offer a variety of resources for their partners, Just sometimes you come across some members of management who put a damper on the workplace because of disorganization."
good,"A typical day at work would mean you are working with either your favorite set of workers on staff, or struggling to make things work as a team with some really different kinds of people. It could mean very positive things, or very challenging to work with very different cultured folks than you. If you manage to to make it work, then you should be in management for sure. I've learned many great work ethics here, and their training is superior to anything I have ever experienced. Management for the most part, are great! However, again, you are working in a fast paced environment with different attitudes and it can get rough on the work floor. Hardest part of the job is the hours. Work at 4am? Yikes. The Store Manager sometimes schedules you close, then open shifts and it can be hard to get someone to trade shifts with you. Best part is the fun people you meet on staff and customers. I've met some of the coolest people here that remain on my best friend list."
good,"I worked at a privately owned Starbucks. The owners were incredibly sweet people. Unfortunately, they were scared of the assistant manager. This caused a few issues and some tension within the workplace, as all the employees knew. It was also a very high-stress job, which is fine, and perfection was required."
good,Great company to work while in school and you can become shift in a year but the pay still sucks and moving from shift upwards is hard and you will get burned out but the experience in being a shift supervisor can help you in resumes. you also get stock options and health care and college reimbursement through ASU
good,"Not a bad place to work. They aren't as good to the employees as they make it out to be, but the atmosphere is good and you always end up making friends with a lot of the regular customers"
good,Working at Starbucks has had it's up and down and is definitely not for everyone it requires a great amount of patience and self disipline to be able to persue a career in starbucks
good,"The pay could be a little better, and so could the yearly raises. The benefits are pretty Decent, but kind of pricey. You have to be able to learn fast, move fast, and learn every position because you never know where you're going to be daily when you clock in. You also have to learn about the different coffees offered which was fun. I was not a coffee drinker when I started, but now I HAVE to have my morning coffee."
good,"After working at Starbucks for 7 months, I truly learned a lot. How to connect with customers, find passion for your work and much more. Yet the management was unreasonable and unfair. I loved my job to the bottom of the core. I enjoyed creating latte and tea art just as much as interacting with people, and finding out interesting things everyday. My manager did not care for the fact my mother was sick and would still expect me to choose work over her. I ended up leaving the company because i was never heard. Therefore, i love Starbucks company but will i ever work for another  Starbucks store again? No. Would i recommend it for any one? Sure. If you are the type to live at work."
good,"Is not a piece of cake. It is hard work, takes dedication. Quality over speed. It's worth it though. I love Starbucks. If you can get a job with them do it!"
good,As Someone who worked for the company for over 3 years  i wouldve hoped for better treatment from my manager. it was a great job when i just graduated high school but now that im an adult and moving on with life i just out grew it. i would say it is a great place if your still in school
good,The position is new and focuses mostly on data entry more than safety activities.  In time this should iron out and the safety aspect of the job could become more prevalent. People are great to work around and the company really does a lot for their employees.
good,"Busy, but fun. The management could use a revamp, but its to be expected with any major company. In general they provided good benefits and promotion opportunities."
good,"Your basic coffee shop experience. The only unfortunate aspect of participating in a nationwide chain is that there are a seemingly infinite amount of guidelines in place for employees. While this order works for sanitation, it negatively impacts the workflow of employees. Going by the book, employees can expect a nonstop avalanche of work and an imbalance between efficiency with customers and cleaning."
good,i loved my team and the job and the opportunities. i loved that you got full benefits even if you were only 20hrs a week. definantely a team environment.
good,The costumer contact was nice. I enjoyed the fast pace of the rush hours and balancing many different tasks at once. Time flew by and it stimulated your brain.
good,"Overall it was a good company to work for, the staff were all friendly and sometimes you really got to build a relationship with the regular customers."
good,"greeted customers, made drinks, engaged with customers, cleaned, brewed coffee, made garbage runs, restocked items, bussed tables. The management wasn't that genuine but the customers were usually always nice"
good,"Long hours - some fun things but you need to drink the coolaid in order to enjoy it."
good,"good place to work for students, and people with restrictive schedules. Pretty typical corporate work environment.  there are some great benefits. Health care, free coffee, stock options."
good,very high stress and poor management. Everyone that works there hates the job for the most part. I did learn communication skills and customer service. I think there should be more workers on staff instead of stressing everyone out
good,"the company itself is great I love working for them however the management at my current starbucks is not the best also the pay could be a bit higher  , I must say the management at my previous location was amazing ."
good,"Starbucks Provides a very competitive atmosphere, especially for the one I worked at, it was very small yet one of the busiest I ever worked at, several times a day there would be long lines and many orders. you really have to learn on your feet because the training you get isnt enough, the culture really depends on the manager, sometimes they are hard on you but that is true in most cases. The hardest part is doing the job of multiple people at once, especially when closing, frequently people would be sent home early, and we were frequently understaffed in the evenings. the best part of working for starbucks is the free coffee, and the pay was higher than minimum wage."
good,A typical day at Starbucks is interacting with your regulars and making coffee. Cleaning is involved throughout the day as well as conversation and laughs with other Barista's.
good,"Everything was pretty great except management. Free lunches after 5 hour workdays. Coworkers were pretty great, customers decent. Little to no training and too high expectations to start from management"
good,Starbucks has a beautiful set of values and they speak to many. It's a wonderful enviornment  to be apart of. Unfortunately there can be a lot of poor management and promotion due to need. Stick through it the benefits outweigh the cons.
good,The culture has changed and the work that is done is more and more about Wall Street.The days were often filled with meetings leaving little time to complete daily tasks. Because of this work is often completed at home later in the evening. I did like that I had the opportunity to learn and work with several company used systems. Most of all it was the people that I worked with that made the my time with Starbucks special.
good,"It's a decent job, the best I've ever had, and most people are friendly. There are a lot of good benefits, but that is despite the fact that it's not enough money to raise a family or have a savings."
good,You learn great customer service skills but have to deal with many demanding tasks given by both customers and managers.  You have to be able to deal with stressful working conditions but are compensated with great benefits.
good,"I enjoyed working at this job. The hours were chaotic and store rushes were definitely a work out. I loved my co-workers, they were always supportive, but our assistant manager and manager were always rude to us and provided no help."
good,"slow at the start, picks up after 6pm."
good,"Mis à part les horaires parfois vraiment difficiles, les périodes de rush me plaisaient vraiment, apprendre à gérer le monde, la rapidité et la bonne humeur est vraiment quelque chose que j'ai aimé faire."
good,Fun place to work but you'll never do anything more there. No room really for advancement. But fun job. It's hard during the winter when there isn't any hours because it's slow but you can always pick up others shifts.
good,"Although the company takes care of their hourly employees, the management gets mistreated and is poorly compensated. Long hours, limited staffing levels to come in line with company expectations will leave you tired and over worked."
good,I found working at Starbucks an pleasent place to work. It was very fast paced which I found to be enjoyable. I had to leave due to how hard it was advance within the store.
good,in a good experience to learn about coffee and team work you get to contact with customer and the employee you work with. the management is good great benefits
good,"Being part of a franchise is a bit different to company"
good,"Target was great, starbucks was great. But you had to decide whose rules you were going to follow based on which management was present. Team lead chose to ignore starbucks policy,"
good,It's okay. Good pay. They are flexible with my hours. It's a licensed store so it's not as strict as a corporate store but still pretty strict. You get one free cup of coffe so that's cool
good,My experience with starbucks is very different from those who work with the corporate organization. I worked for a company that involved a lot or favoritism and did not leave any room for growth.
good,It's good place to have skins work experenice people are friendly to work with but it is very hard to advance. It's a short term solution the health care is great but you would need another job if you work on the retail side
good,Working from morning 8 to evening 4 with people who are working with you with full heart and energy and not getting proper leaves and care makes you not feel so good.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at this location. A typical day on the job for me was interacting with customers and making very tasty drinks. I learned that sometimes, it is better to walk away from a job when there is nothing left to be fought for. The management was very unprofessional and I was given an ultimatum by an off duty manager, do this or it's your job, after I had already talked to the shift manager on duty. I launched a complaint against this specific manager and left the job. Most of my co-workers were very easy and fun to work with. Some of them were hard to work with as they made specific job duties difficult by interfering or going against company guidelines. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with that insane pace of the product production. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to connect with my customers and provide them with a shared love for coffee."
good,"Can be good, can be bad.  Be ready to feel overworked with little chances for advancement. However the benefits can be rewarding."
good,"Good opportunity to develop customer service skills among other skills like making late and other delicious beverages. Also great for someone who's multitasking is bad, because here you can obtain this skill."
good,Was a better company back in the day but still a good company for a season. I really wish the did not take away all the incentives. Plus the bonus is every year now . It use to be every six months. I trained  many shifts and external mgrs. never did they think I could do the job but I was needed to trained others. Just be fair
good,good benefits and pay but free lunch great tips good benefits personal time is very low and very strict 10 min breaks weeklymark outs on store products
good,"I noticed right away the co-workers that I would be working with for the next year and four months until my resignation were very negative people; they would complain about this job - one of the easiest jobs in the world. Most of them are young kinds with no work ethic or people with middle income families or on the verge of retirement seeking their outstanding benefits. It's sad that a hard worker like myself was taken advantage of and used at the cost of my integrity, be careful what you wish for; I always wanted to work for Starbucks, but their prices are really inflated and the quality of the product as well as the service is in the hands of a bunch of arrogant fools."
good,"Starbucks can either be a fun job, or one that makes you want to rip your hair out. You have to work fast and efficiently in order to not get swallowed by customer orders. It's a sink or swim situation for most baristas. There are many rude customers who come in, but there are a lot of customers who become your friends. The hardest part about my job is when I'm scheduled by myself for 4 hours and I don't have enough time to restock lids/cups or catch up on dishes. The best part about my job is working with coffee, one of the things I love the most."
good,Target/ Starbucks is usually a fast paste kind of place. The employees are great and the guest make it worth wild to come in to work. The hardest part about my job is that it can very overwhelming very quickly. By which I mean the angry guest or the lack of coverage on the schedule. my team leader Gloria is amazing. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to make people smile with polite conversation and  just by making a simple coffee drink.
good,A typical day in the life of a barista would include spilt milk and coffee if not once or twice a day. It was very high paced and high volume which made the days go by faster. Meeting and getting to talk to a variety of people a day was most likely the greatest part of the job. Co-workers are always upbeat and ready to work and crush the day. Management is the worst part of the job. Many people have left this particular Starbucks because of micromanaging.
good,"Typical day at work is seeing hundreds of people a day, serving them food and coffee with a smile. I learned a great deal on coffee and milk. Also that no one ever wanta to work more, so if you're sick, no one will cover for you. The store recently switched managers and things have gotten better but they're not professional enough."
good,Started as a shift supervisor and was quickly promoted to Assistant manager within eight months. I worked hard for my position and trained myself on a variety of things in this postion.
good,Siempre hay algo nuevo que aprender y es una experiencia nueva cada día. atender mucho de los clientes
good,"Fast paced environment, can be stressful at times. Very customer focused and a good place to start. Very flexible hours, not good pay."
good,"A basic work day with this company was a breeze. After being dazed on my first day alone in this small kiosk i quickly acquired the skills to work on my own. all of the drinks where simple to make after having good training and the repeat customers were so much fun.the only thing i have to say is the company has a serve waste issue and the kiosk i was in was under staffed it was only 3 employees including me, my assistant manager, and my manager and we worked one at a time; even though on busier days like holidays we really needed two people working at a time."
good,"People are chill, except when you ""make their coffee wrong"". Have been harassed by customers. Abused verbally by customers."
good,Literally stood in one place for most of my shift greeting customers and folding shirts with a board. I did not receive enough hours to get by so I found another job.
good,"I love working at Starbucks, it's a great atmosphere, the customers are awesome, and you can basically work around any school schedule you may have. But don't hold your breath if you're trying to progress in the company."
good,"I enjoy my job on the whole, but I can no longer afford to live on such a tiny margin. The hours have been cut recently and I am not able to cover my bills. I also am in an area with very limited opportunity to advance any higher than my position. "
good,"Starbucks is a good company. The culture is very good. Co-workers are nice but  turn over rate is very quick which I don' like. It takes time to speed up on projects then either re-org or budget issue, people have to leave. Also there are a lot of projects, but budget are on hold to next fiscal year.  "
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work at if your only looking for a short term job with not too many hours or a weekend job. Co-workers can be very lazy and unwilling to work. The one in target is less busy with is good, and I start my day with hoping on the register and cleaning, also making drinks. End the day cleaning and closing down"
good,An average day at Starbucks is and 8.5 hour shift from 4:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. We get extremely busy but having the co-workers I had made the day go by fast and fun!
good,Chaleureuse entre collègue tout en offrant un service rapide et personnalisé. Le contact client et les rencontres.
good,"I enjoy Starbucks - it's got a good feel for both partners and customers - the third place jive is strong. I found both of my stints with my company saw me constantly learning, and challenged, which I appreciate."
good,"This job is physically demanding. I love my co-workers but be prepared to work. The hours are long 10 hour shifts during normal season, however during peak season be prepared to never leave 12 shifts 5 days a week."
good,Work is emphasized strongly without much space for cooperation. The culture can be improved as any employees negatively view their work environment.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. It's an socially ethical company that cares about its employees as well as customers. The management could be better, as well as the attitudes and togetherness of the employees. Yearly raises are great! However, you aren't promised any hours. You can work 25 one week then 15 the next. Not good for stability."
good,I did enjoy this job but did not have a good future there. if I had to get a second job at this point I would love to go there again.
good,"Working for Starbucks was a great job at the time, it allowed me to go to school part time and work when I wasn't going to school. Management was very understanding of outside priorities."
good,"Starbucks is a great company for people seeking part time employment with full time benefits. It loses some of it's luster once you move into management, as there is no work-life balance."
good,"Fue una experiencia agradable y aprendí a escuchar así como estar bien con los clientes."
good,The company is a great place to work. Depending on life goals its a company that for most goes no where. Very fast paced and demanding. Offers decent benefits for the right person.
good,"As im a people person life at starbucks is great, new faces everyday and with the right people on shift the job couldnt be better! I would just like to find a job that requires more skills."
good,"The cafe that I worked is inside a hospital. Not many people visits the cafe. Very quiet, not busy at all. What I have learnt from this experience is communicating with customers and sometimes suggesting the customers what to order. My colleagues are very helpful and useful in the early stage of my working days as I was not able to complete a certain with the cash register. Teamwork is shown.  The most enjoyable part of this job was mostly because of the customers. I mean the customers that walked in to Starbucks give the kind of a positive energy. Harmony can be found in the cafe that i have worked. Overall it was good short term experience."
good,"Overall, A good experience. Suitable best for younger people(under 21)  looking for repetitive work, especially cleaning. Labor filled position with outrageous customer interaction constantly"
good,"Extremely fast pace, great team building experience, face to face customer service, sales and store budget deadlines, product quality, food and beverage knowledge, develop communication skills within team and customers. time management, safety and security, product inventory, cashier experience,and overall great training and great first job experience. making our customers happy and satisfied was the best part of my day."
good,Starbucks has lots of perks and is a good place to work. The treatment is good and the people are nice. Advancement and raises are hard to get though.
good,"The number of hours that are allotted per week do nothing to match the demand during the day. Afternoon rushes can demoralize a small workforce as many responsibilities must be split between few people. That said, the other partners there make for an enjoyable environment when the line isn't out the door. Time off can be had if you are quick enough, but often is too scarce around holidays and weekends."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks but the store I was located at is very shady and ended up picking on every flaw of mine and overlooking other partners mistakes and blaming me. Poor experience
good,I absolutely loved my job and everyone I worked with but I worked for a licensed Starbucks and not a corporate. I learned everything I had to in order to become a barista but could never get certified. Other than that I loved everything about my job. On a typical day I'd clock in and get right on drinks (most enjoyable part of job) up until my lunch time then I'd come back and go for a milk/pastry run to restock for the next day (hardest part of job). I then would either close the back and restock or make drinks until it was time to close.
good,"Starbucks offers a lot of great stuff, if you qualify. Free markouts every week ensure you will always have coffee at home and free markouts for food so you will never go hungry. Even full tuition reimbursement if you can get into ASU for your bachelors degree.   But the customers feels so entitled to this company and many believe they can do a better job working there and they do not feel shy about telling you how to do your job."
good,"Everyday at Starbucks is different because of the customers, and employees. We do a lot for the company, whether its cleaning our store, producing beverages and food, informing about new products, interaction with customers on each visit."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks because it really taught me a lot about multi-tasking and also helped me to be more outgoing. I also learned a lot about team work and how it can really help you and your co-workers excel at your jobs. I believe that after working for Starbucks and learning skills such as multi-tasking, opening up to people, and how to work as a team member will really help me in the field of cosmetology. I would love to find a job that requires a lot of team work."
good,The raise they gave US employees in 2015 was +$.28/hr. Salaried members of management complained about not getting a raise or bonus and acted as we should be grateful for an extra 28 cents. A lot of partners felt it was a slap in the face because with the raise came a reduction in hours and customers' having another price change in a year.
good,"Working at Starbucks is an experience all its own.  There are days of extreme stress and fatigue, as well as days that consist of working together with a great team and complete positivity.  A typical day at work consists of extremely busy moments as well as constant labourous activities such as cleaning, drink making, prep, and customer service, all the while working within a team.  The co-workers at this job really play an important part.  They become great friends and also become like family.  However the hardest parts of this job are definitely the horrible scheduling, constant anger from customers as well as on occasion fellow employees from stress, and the low compensation."
good,"This was the first long-term job that I had and I learned a significant amount of my skills at this job. It was a fun work environment and the experiences with coworkers and customers are invaluable. I would work for starbucks until I retire, however, I would like to experience more in other work fields. Who knows, maybe I'll be back!"
good,"I learned a lot in there. The job is fast-paced and I don't get easily bored with the job. The people I work there are fun to be with. "
good,"The company itself is stellar. Management within specific stores can make the job frustrating. Fun job, fast pace, and tons of people."
good,"A typical day in the life of a Stabucks employee is not the easiest. Taking orders, making drinks, all while remembering them at the top of your head can be challenging. I have leanred over the course of months to remember dates, numbers and facts better than before. As well as providing guests with excellent service. While my management has not been the best, I have learned to face the difficultites with trying harder. My co-workers, the same hard working people as I am have been amazing. Also as being the mostenjoyable part of my job."
good,It was a great place to work if you enjoy a very fast environment and love coffee! I enjoyed being a supervisor and handling the store while my manager wasn't there.
good,"a typical day at work we would be steady busy and when we were not busy we would be cleaning. I learned a lot for example what it feels like to stand for 8 hours and not to be shy and how to make the customers smile, and how to make some of the best coffee drinks in town. management could have been easier to get along with my startbucks manager was great. not so much the ingles manager he didn't seem to care to get to know his employees or talk to us. he just fussed. my coworkers were great I got along with each and every one of them. the hardest part of my job was stocking, and trying to get more hours, on a daily basic I worked maybe 16 hours a week. The most enjoyable part was I knew no matter how bad or good my day was my coworkers and customers could always brighten my day."
good,"Starbucks had a lot of great characters both in front and behind the counter. That being said, management struggled with maintaining the store and keeping things professional."
good,"•	Greets all customers with fast, friendly, personalized service and develops a rapport with customers by learning their names, favorite drinks and food items"
good,Good place to work that provides excellent benefits to employees that work 20 hours or more a week.  Fast paced environment that requires the ability to change quickly and adapt to new initiatives and promotions with very little turn around.  Company is lead by a group of individuals that truly want to see the company succeed.  Teaches you how to lead employees to be successful during periods of change while being able to keep their spirits high.
good,Provided outstanding customer service. Built relationships that generated repeat customers. Consistently delivered quality beverages for all customers. Maintained quality store operations. Contributed to store profitability
good,I have worked and transferred to 4 different Starbucks while in School in 2 different states and all of them I have enjoyed. They were all willing to work around my class schedules and transferring when I relocated with another school was an easy transition.
good,The people I work with are great. It is a fun place to work.Sometimes the hours can be long.
good,"Make personalized beverages all day ... great team building opportunities depending on the customers!"
good,"fun friendly staff, but not much room for advancement. perks were discount and free coffee"
good,"Generally, being a barista was fun and light hearted. Who you work with and their attitude and how you respond will have a great effect on your day so it varied shift by shift."
good,some days were fun others were very serious ive learned loads of skills that i will take me to other places most of my partners give all to helping me
good,On this Starbucks is where I perfected my cadence techniques to be a more efficient and faster Barista. Management was not taking in consideration the location to benefit the most of the frequent customers of the area. The team was a little inconsistent with recipe guidelines. The hardest part of the job was being a consistent and hard shift supervisor.
good,I love some aspects of working at Starbucks. I really like the people I get to work with because I can actually have some fun at work.  Most of the customers are pretty great too. The things I wish I could change are the amount of hours I get per week and how much I get paid. Also the time I work is a little too early for me because it makes it hard to get enough sleep but also find time to see my friends and family.
good,"A typical day at work is creating hand crafted beverages for our hundreds of customers that frequent our store.  I enjoy all my coworkers and have playful banter with them, along with coaching them. They are the most enjoyable part of the job, we are a team and without comradery we fail. The hardest part about my job is that we never know when we will be busy or slow, the uncertainty of every day.  I get along very well with both my manager and district manager and feel comfortable bringing up any situation to them. I've learned time management from my position at Starbucks and I'm very grateful for that."
good,"The job is more cleaning than coffee.  There are many customer interactions, mostly unpleasant.  The horrible customers you have to deal with is easily the worst part of the job, people are unbelievably crazy."
good,I would open store on most days at 5am obtaining keys and all funds for the day. ensuring all employees showed fr work and replacing if necessary. i was also required to stock and reorder any necessary supplies. i really loved this job and was up for my own store.
good,"Days started early at 5am, very fast paced since they are located inside a Hotel. Guests would line up out the door and to the lobby. Co-workers were always peppy and fun to work with. Management needed re-structuring."
good,"Prepare for the worst, expect the best.... It takes more than a recipe and the right ingredients to create an experience. I learned to make an experience of memories and fondness. Management was always willing to lend a hand and get elbow to elbow to accomplish the dire feats expected of us.  Hardest part of the job was leaving work, the most enjoyable part about the job was TIPS!!!!!!!"
good,"There is a lot of variation between stores, but the company as a whole goes to great lengths to promote product knowledge and customer connection."
good,"A typical day as a barista included making hang crafted drinks, managing long lines, taking ordering and operating the cash register. "
good,Company has been great. But like most companies they want more but don't pay you more.
good,"team work, helpful co-worker and i experienced a lot of different communication with different people ."
good,"Great benefit sand work life balance , this is the perfect job for any coffee lover."
good,"A typical day at work would be going to the loading bay to get the delivery, arranging the food first in first out. Soon as we open there is a que out of the door a very busy fast pace business. includes making coffees, taking orders, being on the till, answering phone calls and doing stocktake. I learnt everything in the job that I needed to know there is nothing else I could learn, and was offered a supervisor role but I feel I am ready to move on to my career. bigger and better."
good,I love working with Starbucks. Great company. I learned being confident and how to manage a store in a timely and efficient way. The hardest part of the job is to work on such a long period of time. I enjoyed working with the team.
good,"A typical work day in Starbucks is mostly routine. It all depends on were you work at. For me I worked at one of the busy ones on 42 st NYC. We would probably have between 3 n 6 daily rushes. So Objective be quick and efficient."
good,"Starbucks has high expectations of its people.  Financial goals are aggressive.  Hiring and staffing can be challenging, depending on the market.  The people are what makes the difference at Starbucks.  They focus heavily on competencies around leadership, results, team work, development.  Starbucks has an extensive benefits package."
good,I learned how to make coffee and also how to talk to people I have great  customer service now.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks--I developed a foundation of ""me"" that I doubt I would have had the chance to develop elsewhere."
good,I grew a lot with Starbucks both personally and professionally. I watched the company grow and evolve from a small coffee chain to something I didn't recognize anymore. I worked my way up through the ranks. I moved out of state twice to help the company open up new markets.
good,"Very busy, lots of multitasking."
good,I believe if you can make it at starbucks u can make it any where.
good,"My job was to take care of the costumer. Things like taking the orders, sometimes I had to make the coffee and somebody else would take the order. "
good,"I love working for this company and they give you an opportunity for advancement, I just wish I had more hours and could keep our tips we recieve. I love seeing our regular customers and love how this company trains there employees well."
good,"My time here was a largely enjoyable experience. My manager was fantastic at working around my exam schedules when I had to travel to Maidstone for my exams, she enabled me to improve my customer service skills, learn a vast amount of new skills and take pride in my work."
good,"Great atmosphere, amazing people, nice variety in caseload. "
good,"Cool for young people attending school, (high school, College, or 2nd job)..."
good,"Busy, Workers not willing to help each other, personal interest over look company interest, hardest part of the job is holding back your thoughts, most enjoyable part is building a relationship with the regulars."
good,"Starbucks as a company is great and I'm sure that a lot of stores are really great to work at. Unfortunately for me I ended up at the fabled worst store in the entire district (I'm sure anyone reading this who works in Rochester NY knows which store). It's so awful that partners from other stores are not likely to fill in there-you're not allowed to call in sick unless you have someone to cover for you which leads to plagues during flu season. It all boils down to very poor management (never ordering the correct amount of integral items, belittling partners, leaving the floor when it gets busy and letting the ship sink, screaming at, threatening and even pushing partners) and self righteous customers (I'm talking people who come talking on their phone who won't even speak a single word to you or treat you like a human being and then get angry with you for it, people who scream at you, people who forget to mention something in their order and then get unnecessarily mad at you when it's really no big deal and you can fix it, people who want you to break a $100 for a grande coffee-$2.11-and get p*ssed when you can't because you're not allowed to keep $20 in your drawer) if you're thinking of working at Starbucks make sure you visit prospective locations a few times first-watch to see how the partners act I.e. are they stressed out? Are there 2 people running things in a busy drive thru store? Ask baristas too. Chances are they will tell you if their store sucks or not. But something tells me that the jerk customers will occur no matter where you are though I believe it's accentuated"
good,Working at Starbucks was pleasant. I worked well under the pressure. The customers were easy to please and my coworkers were a great team.
good,"A typical day was opening the store, cleaning and help set up machines to brew coffee and stock up on supplies and food. I learned how to be quick and learning what different types of coffee's taste like. Management was great with scheduling. Co workers were very outgoing. The hardest part was learning all the drinks. The most enjoyable was being able to interact with people and making sure they were having a good day."
good,"I would usually work as a Barista and the customer interaction was awesome, more often than not. I learned how to stock and organize products well and meet the needs of unusual customers. Management was somewhat professional but had a tendency for favoritism and as an employee it didn't seem as if you were working for a large corporation, rather a control-freak yet scrambled business. Management mood definitely determined how employees were treated and the personalities were not genuine. As for co-workers, most were very friendly. The hardest part of working there was being understaffed when we were busy and management did not try to help. The most enjoyable part was pleasing customers and knowing that when they returned, they would ask specifically for my assistance."
good,"The company is generally good, a typical work day is 8 hours with management keeping your hours to a minimum a week of 30"
good,"Essa empresa me ensino muitas coisas que não sabia, e me fez crescer profissionalmente e me mostrar como faz falta trabalhar."
good,I enjoyed my job with Starbucks.
good,"The benefits and job security are great, but the pay and career potential aren't so hot, according to employee reviews of working at Starbucks. That shouldn't come as a surprise. But what might surprise the coffee giant's customers is that working there isn't as easy as you'd think. Just make a pot of coffee and pour it, right? Or mix in a few shots of this and that, and it's ready to go. Not necessarily, it is much more complicated."
good,"Through my time at Starbucks I have learned multiple things: I have learned to work in a very fast paced environment with relatively high stress level, I have also learned how to work in a very small work environment with many people. By being part of the management team, I have learned how to manage a group of employees, mostly students, who have very particular needs. I have enjoyed the group of individuals I have been employed with, and have had many good times. I have learned how to keep calm during stressful times, and how to manage other employees stress. I have learned the inner workings of Starbucks' ordering system and management system and have a working knowledge of the entire store. I have learned what not to do and what to do from my current manager(s). Lastly, I have learned that the employee's are not always the managers first priority and that if you need something done (benefit information, disability help, modified duties etc), you have to take initiative and do it, or the most part, without any guidance."
good,"If you have a great team with you, it can make any schedule you work pleasurable. There are a few unhappy customers that you have to learn to handle with care, but that is the case with any customer service position. Training is quick, and after the process is done, you just have to hone your skills on the run, but, once again, you have people there who constantly want you to succeed, not only from a teachers point of view, but also as a fellow worker. When I was employed there, I would rather teach someone twice, than have to fix their mistakes seven times."
good,"I currently work for Starbucks, I enjoy working with my co workers. We always have a fun relax day at work, it seems like the best way to make the day better. Where i work the customers are super friendly, at least some of them and I have learned how to deal with those that are not having such a good day. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i made a delicious drink and that i made that customer happy."
good,* in the morning shift we are not so busy compared in closing
good,"Though starbucks is a good place to work as far as looking at benefits, but you do have to put up with managers that don't know how to schedule and they often don't take into consideration your personal life. There is no work/life balance, and if there is it is rare. There also is a problem with pay, the amount of work and responsibility you take on especially with being a supervisor you don't get paid what you should. (that is my opinion)"
good,"The location I worked at is the highest grossing Starbucks in the company, therefore has a huge customer base. Working there polishes your ability to be fast and effective at what your doing. Making sure all of your customers needs are met before they walk away, maintaining equipment, stocking items, providing a positive atmosphere where stress can overwhelm."
good,"Overall the company I believe is a decent company. I do not think the manager in bourne should be the store manager. He is too young to effectively run a store, and is very dramatic. I was punished because I had to get a second job to survive and my hours went from 20+ a week to one shift a week. I had to give notice. It is a very caddy and drama ridden place."
good,Overall a very nice company. The benefits are good compare to other companies. The insurance is expensive but its worthy.
good,"I enjoyed most of my time working for Starbucks. My partners were great. We were like family. The store manager really knows how to manage, but she really lacks people skills. I know that it's hard to find a balance, but putting your employees down., making every mistake a catastrophe, and just being abrasive is off putting and doesn't really make you want to work. Being a single parent, it was hard for me to find time to be with my daughter between work and school. I was told that I was not allowed to have weekends off. That made it difficult for me to find a balance in my work and home life. I miss my time with Starbucks. I had applied again, but have not been able to secure a new store. I was told that I was rehirable, but have not been able to get in anywhere. Starbucks takes care of their employees for the most part. I just wish that there would have been a better person to talk to about concerns in the workplace."
good,Fast pace mornings and afternoon. Fun learning new drinks and trying out different kinds of coffee. Management always being there for you as much as they can be.
good,A typical work day could be very hectic depending on the management overall fun place to work at. Great place to build customer connections. Great befits as well
good,"its hard but its not that bad overall when you include benefits, free drinks, being able to have a loose dress code but its not for the faint of heart because its a difficult job"
good,"Overall, good experience. Would recommend to someone else. Workplace culture was iffy, you should be fine if you stay kind to everyone. Enjoyable: having fun with coworkers. Not enjoyable: when customers are rude."
good,"It is fun to work there, all of the managers are pretty laid back and seem pretty nice, the hours are very flexible and all of my coworkers are very nice people"
good,They have a good system for training a new barista and if your store manager is an active one you will get nice attention and training for your personal development. Work can be quite hard (lots of physical work than you would imagine for barista)
good,The benefits that Starbucks offer is really good.  It is the best that I have ever had on a job.  I like the College Scholarship Program.  The health insurance is affordable.
good,My year at Starbucks was fast paced. I enjoyed making lattes and the company of my fellow employees. I learned how to handle myself in tight spaces and multitasking as well as customer services.
good,"Depends what youre trying to get out of the job. Short term its a good place to work, long term there is no real pay off or ability to advanced based on my experience. This is not to say its not possible in other locations."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Starbucks but Ieft due to the lack of appropriate support from higher management. The role itself was good but instead of getting the support that was continuously requested, I was written up."
good,"We had a strong team mindset and worked very well together."
good,High stress and fast paced environment- need to have a knowledge pf coffee or be open to learning it. Need to be able to memorize orders and make them quickly
good,"It was an alright job. The people were nice, the pay was great, and the college benefits were amazing. Overall, I don't have much to say about this position other than it was a great experience."
good,All depends on where you work and who you work with. Its really up to you on how you want your work environment to be; if your positive and hardworking it'll rub off on those around you.
good,"Fue bueno trabajar. En la empresa, se aprende a tratar a la gente"
good,It was a fast worked paced environment and friendly a lot of measuring and making proper drinks to customers needs and orders learning new names and ingredients in a short period of time
good,I liked the job but the workers were clicky .they were not the best support system. Over all the job was a good job but it had a high turnover rate!!!!
good,"Had a fantastic experience working at Starbucks. The customers were nice, the coworkers friendly, and the managing was successful. Would say that it's very busy, and there is always something to do, which is nice, yet some people couldn't handle how stressful the job can be when it does get crazy busy."
good,I love my customers and partners I work with but at 15 hours a week I have to move forward. Starbucks have great benefits and will work with your schedule but as of now they luke in hours in the whole district.
good,"I am currently employed for the airport at the moment and also under the Starbucks branch and its two complete different worlds. Corporate stores are still high volume but a bit slower than the airport environment, of course. Management is the same, this company cares for more customers and lack of appreciating their staff/employees. "
good,Awesome job to build communication skills and learn how to work well under pressure. I learned how to resolve conflict with many different types of people and troubleshoot problems of all kinds.
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a great way to get some work experience for those high school students and college students. However, to be here long term is probably not the best. Even though the benefits are great, the pay is not that great for those beginning and they only increase minimally per year."
good,"Aprender a trabajar en equipo, lograr conexiones con los clientes,habilidad para resolución de problemas,implementar su filosofía del servicio( saludar,por favor, gracias, despedida)."
good,Was not strong in my department for work life balance.  At the time was micro-managed but then was expected to complete task outside of written objectives
good,Work flow and management we're a big difference in this job. If there wasnt a flow between you and your fellow employees the work did not get accomplished. Management had the power to place what people worked the best together and got along together for the flow of energy sake.
good,"A typical day at work is a day of teamwork. We as baristas have to be strong on our own but must also know how to rely on our fellow partners to get the job done, to get through a days work. If for some reason that sense of teamwork seems to fade, our Shift leads are there to bring us back together. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I can make someone else's day by making them a nice cup of coffee and connecting with them."
good,You learn a lot working in this company. I've learned how to multiask and push myself to talk to people. I have to memorize so many recipes and they push on memorizing customers names. There is never a dull moment.
good,"Great job , opportunities to advance . Great atmosphere with a diverse group of employees . Great connections and friendships were made . I enjoyed my time there ."
good,Starbucks is always evolving so you must be able to adapt quickly. Everyday is a new day and you must ensure coaching is happening daily or the standard is not upheld.
good,Working at Starbucks not only gave me a love for coffee but a passion to help and serve others. Providing excellent customer service and making others happy is a wonderful feeling.
good,"Starbucks is an incredible company to work for. However, the pay is not great for the amount of work we have to do to maintain our stores. We have to keep our stores clean and organized, a lot of the time we're doing two jobs at once."
good,This was a fun place to work.  The flexibility for working with another job was great.   The pay should be more. Management needs to be reviewed.  My manager was cushioning the schedule when she worked and leaving other areas weak.  The district manager should be reviewing her schedules her task delegation and her ability to do her job (not just the numbers)
good,"I enjoy this job, and i love my coworkers. I am always given room to grow and my skills are always used to the best of their ability. I love the flexibility and easy tasks that the job entails."
good,Love this company for its inclusiveness and kindness. Its hard to find companies so openly welcoming of the LGBTQ community and that's very important to me. However its so much work and Starbucks gets so busy that 9$ an hour is NOT enough. Especially when we're doing the work of 3 partners at once sometimes.
good,"A typical day consists of making and preparing food and drinks for customers to enjoy."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, taught me a lot of personal skills as far as working with other people, multitasking, talking to guests and being able to work fast."
good,"*unreliable coworkers make your life terrible. Get called in at 4am"
good,"Every store and staff is different you need to find one where you're happy. Unfortunately the pay is not enough for me, but they do offer good benefits. They also offer a great opportunity to earn your bachelor degree online through ASU and it ends up being free."
good,Fasted paced but fun place to work. The relationships you can build with both customers and coworkers will last a life time. Flexible schedule for anyone working and going to school.
good,"It is a better job than most but I don't get the hours I need. I get barely 20 hours and I am paid minimium wage. It's unsustainable, but it is a good part time job with a lot of benefits"
good,"Depends on the type of Starbucks. If it’s run by a different company, then the rules are totally different from a stand alone Starbucks. If you don’t want to be confused, stick with the actual Starbucks stores."
good,This job takes a lot but overall fairly easy and beat customer service experience for anyone! This job we make every moment right so if you find something wrong we will strive to make your experience better for you
good,"Fund and productive environment. Customers can be extremely rude, others are actually nice. My store is very fast paced so it can be overwhelming for new people."
good,"Payment was not enough to afford cost of  living while working 40 hours here. Also, so worried about over time it was difficult to get a full 40 hour week without excepting extra shifts."
good,"This is not a job to keep for a long time.. it's a transition job. That being said, some people like it more or less depending on how social of a person they are. Who your co-workers are is about 75% of the experience. Luckily for me, my co-workers were mostly all great and contributed fairly to the work load. My manager was great and was very supportive and made sure everyone was treated fairly with distribution of hours. Hardest part, as with any food industry role is dealing with annoying and picky customers, some of the best parts are the regulars that treat you great. I personally loved organizing and keeping things clean, but not everyone is good at that."
good,"My time at Starbucks was pleasant. I went through several terrible bosses but managed to work under a few amazing ones. The customers are honestly the worst part to the job, they just don't pay attention. Coworkers were always very nice, helpful and friendly. They provide a lot of benefits surprisingly!"
good,"most of thime its a great job but customers can be difficult. getting along with your coworkers makes the job even better in tough times."
good,"the environment was incredible but due to the experience of life the other workers had they were up to no good. Over the head set they were plotting to fire the manager and i of course being the honest one reported it. With the conflict and threat of how difficult my job would be moving forward, I choose to move on to hopefully bigger and better and more professional things"
good,"Starbucks does a really good job on training, new employees. the work environment is very fun and relaxing during slow hours. It can also get very busy during rush hour."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for the summertime. great people, great place, constantly busy, continual stress put on employees by customers, and management every day."
good,Es un trabajo que requiere mucha paciencia. Bastante metódico en general. Muy buenas propinas.
good,"Hours were too varied, people were losing and gaining them with no rhyme or reason. But, besides sporadic hours, it was a fun place to work with good people."
good,"I personally got hired at a very busy location. Naturally, things were a bit chaotic at times but overall its a great company to work for, especially if you take advantage of the benefits offered."
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks, I was a Barista for a few months I learn a lot and how to make certain drinks but unfortunately I wanted to move to another  job."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks when I did. The work is (mostly) fun as I loved to work on the bar and craft drinks. It satisfied my need to multitask and move constantly. Management is hit or miss depending on the store but most managers truly value hard work and notice your improvement and growth in your role. Promotion process can be difficult as there isn’t a lot of turnover among leadership and there’s usually a lot of people gunning for an open position. If you have a good manager and communicate with them openly they will work with you on your role advancement and appreciate your ambition. I only left because I ended up in a toxic store environment, which is something to look out for. A lot of starbucks stores are great, but a few of them have this unsupportive, gossip-ridden, work you to the bone and it’s still not enough sort of environment- and it all comes down to management. The manager at my last Starbucks store would pit supervisors against each other, not do anything at all in the face of conflict, ask you to do things way outside of your role responsibilities and then still get angry when you “didn’t do enough.” This manager got very personal with me when I was putting in 50+ hours a week, doing everything in my power to support the store and my colleagues, and I became tired and burnt out from all of the extra work- they actually had the nerve to ask me if relationship troubles at home were making me bad at my job. But that was just one terrible manager. I’ve also had many good managers at Starbucks who did support me and harbored a strong team mentality within"
good,"I need a job that is not going to randomly cut hours like starbucks. Stability is a big issue when you work for a company like this. Making drinks makes work fun but at the end of the day, sometimes you don’t make ends meet."
good,"Fun and relaxed atmosphere, store has a friendly team and good relationships with the regular customers. Flexible shift patterns and above minimum wage."
good,I loved working at my job waking up in the morning opening up the place but the reason I left is because the management was really bad I was never trained I felt like an outsider of the group but I definitely will go back to any other coffee shop like that I love the way I did just not my environment around me
good,Aggressive goals to meet. Not all district managers are supportive. Lots of ego at the top of the chain that should be checked at the door. Good benefits though
good,"Good work place, amazing people to work with. Busy atmosphere, there was always something to do. Hardest part of the job was learning all of the drinks, after that it was a breeze. You always ran into new people to talk to"
good,"It was a great experience, however the employers and higher in management could have more of a better dynamic when it comes to the job and being more of a business."
good,"The job itself it not hard, takes about a week to catch on to everything! Customers are overly rude, and pay is so little it makes the job suck, if you need something quick it’s perfect"
good,The company is helpful if you take a medical leave. The benefits are great. You can get free schooling and you can get medical benefits just for working part time. Just about every year the company gives free stocks to employees.
good,Great team of people to work with. You really do become family. Teamwork is amazing when it gets busy. I love the rushes. You build relationships with regulars and that is a nice feeling as well.
good,Starbucks was a wonderful company to work for. I had the opportunity to work with a great team and learn more skills within this career that better myself as a partner and an overall person.
good,Fast paced. Good job for people to get a start in order picking. Have to be careful because therw are a lot of others there working and pulling orders as well.
good,"Varying work hours (often early morning and late nights back to back), Scheduling wasn't very flexible, great benefits, pay and tips were average, other baristas were kind, minimum hours of availability always required, management was very passive-aggressive"
good,"It was a great place to work, just extremely busy and stressful. The job is not for everyone which is a great challenge. Starbucks is also very lenient with scheduling which is good."
good,"Working at Starbucks is great, great crew members to be with. Easy training and easy to do as a job. Wonderful atmosphere, and great management. Always willing to work with you."
good,I am a pre-closer so that means I come in around 3 and I leave around 8 or 9 pm. These are great hours to work as a teen because right after school I could go straight to work. For most of the shift I would be cleaning or setting up for the next day.
good,I love the job but for how much they make you think they would pay the supervisors better. We under paid and over work the turn around is high. Would have loved to stay but pay is very low for the work you do as a supervisor. Sometimes even doing the work of a absent manager
good,"It’s a great job while in college because they work with your schedules, but it’s not a good long term job for me. You get as many hours if not more than you want though."
good,"Kept work area clean."
good,Truly the best first job a young adult could ask for. The manager and other employees inspire each other to always do their best and continuously learn new things to better our diverse and family-friendly environment.
good,"Der Job hat Spaß gemacht, die Kollegen waren auch super. Der neue Manager war nicht korrekt."
good,The partners are amazing to work with but the customers are not so nice. I have had a hard time being authentic towards the people who treat the workers like less than them.
good,"Enjoy being creative, working with regular patrons and learning new things. Most tasks are repetitive and laid out before you.. therefore it's a faily fast role to learn in a short period of time."
good,"Starbucks is not a low key job. Physically demanding, must be a quick learner and have really good customer service and people skills. If you are going to be lazy, dont apply here."
good,"Pretty high stress environment, coworkers become your community, management is hit or miss and sometimes unprofessional and unreliable, expectations for day-to-day operations are unrealistic. Partners aren't necessarily always trusted to do the job."
good,It’s a good job that helped me advance a lot in my life. But oftentimes the management is difficult to trust and baristas are not paid enough for the effort they put in.
good,"Working at Starbucks in a grocery store has it's pros and cons. As an 18 year old it was a good job to have, although I'm always looking for improvements in myself."
good,"Just not for me at the moment , very structured good leads and management , just repeditive and long shifts it the job for you if u wanna advance in warehouse , if u been doing warehouse for a while it might be intense for you"
good,The hours are pretty early but it’s a really skilled job and fast paced. Coworkers were great and supportive. Don’t get a very long lunch break or any discounts on drinks.
good,"Some things to note:"
good,"Work is typically very relaxed, customers are nice, and the workplace is collaborative.  It fun to learn about coffee and make crazy different beverages."
good,"- I learned many types of coffee"
good,"Overall good culture, especially fun if you work afternoons. Hours can be long and your experience working there really depends on who your trainer is."
good,Starbucks is a great first job. I would suggest walking into the store before applying and figure out whether or not it is a good fit for you. Great people to work with etc.
good,"The job has certain benefits that are great but sometimes the work can be too much or communication may interfere. Otherwise, it’s a good job for youth because it teaches boundaries and mold them into other jobs."
good,all partners are friendly and willing to help one another to learn the daily responsibilities at work. I feel the pay should be increased being that the job could be stressful and difficult at times.
good,"It was a fun experience, but my workstation was very small and slightly claustrophobic. The regular customers were always nice. It would get pretty busy at times, but I was always able to handle it with my great customer service and upbeat attitude."
good,"Started off as a great place to work with one week of computer and hands on training with a certified barista trainer. Team was helpful and kind, playful overall. Once new management took over, work place became a nightmare and couldn't reach out to anybody for help. Most beneficial aspect of the job is the experience and the benefits you accumulate over time."
good,"Most of my time at Starbucks was great. I learned a few new skills such as making latte art, and how to clean the new nitro cold brew machine. A typical day at work would start with me coming in around 2 and either getting on a register or stocking up on milk, ice, and beans. When I don't have any customers I would work on gathering the dishes and cleaning all of the equipment. Such as, pitchers, blenders, sinks, and bars. By the end of the day I will have completed all of my stocking in the store, swapping and taking out trash, and prepping the store for the morning crew."
good,Work place was very upbeat and required very fast-paced. The employees work together to handle tasks that they are faced with and customers that cane more on the difficult side.
good,"The work was easy but mind numbing but atleast the time flew by. Starbucks is very hit or miss. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a decent paying job with good benefits. The culture is extremely progressive but also internally very cut throat. It's very corporate so there are people in the company that will actively throw you under the bus to look good. My main complaint was with management. They're all trying to move up and go to corporate for a salaried position so their focus on individual workers was rarely there and everything was self benefitting. I would recommend this job but make sure you ask the other partners in the specific store you apply to how the manager is"
good,"Loved working at Starbucks. Would have loved to continue on within the environment. Fasted pass, every day was different. You would be lucky to work in the places I was able to work."
good,"As you guys already know that Starbucks want us to provide the same service in any place. So when they do the interview, they focus on the customer service. If you need to prepare Starbucks interview, google it. You can find the question easily."
good,the service industry is hard and starbucks is no different. it can be really busy and i hated waking up at 3 oclock in the morning quiet times were also stressful because no one wanted to get cut because you make no money
good,"It depends on the store you work in. The last store I worked in had TERRIBLE management but the others were good to very good."
good,Was a great atmosphere with many different time slots available to work. Whether you like to work the early morning shift before your classes or the closing shift after you are finished with your day there was always a way to get the number of hours you were looking for each week.
good,"Working there is actually good. The one I am working for is a drive-thru, and it is always busy there so your days will most of the time go quick....."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks and my co workers were always friendly and a pleasure to work with. Management was lacking and also development was quite slow unless you make your own plan.
good,Starbucks helped me gain knowledge in managerial field. Their hours are flexible. Customer service is on point. Good coffee. Great team members. Friendly environment.
good,I would refer anyone that would like to start in the customer service industry. it  gave me the customer service experience and help me learn everything i need it to know
good,Some workers didn't put forth their best effort but some did. Really got to know nice people. The managers worked very hard to keep balance in the store.
good,"Shift supervisors at Starbucks run store operations during their scheduled shifts. This includes opening and closing the store, supervising employees, delegating responsibilities, training baristas as needed and developing positive relationships with the staff"
good,I really enjoyed working here and liked that it was always moving. Management was awesome where I worked and always worked around my busy schedule. Would recommend to a friend.
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks, but I am struggling with bills and rent and the hours available to me are limited, and I need something that allows me to work after school for loner than 4 hours."
good,"I worked at Starbucks as a temporary job during college. Overall it was a great place to work. Friendly coworkers and helpful, understanding managers. Paid above minimum wage for my location and was flexible when scheduling."
good,I liked the job. Long hours but I was able to move up the management ladder fast. Good training techniques and time frame. Partner support was helpful
good,"I learned how to deal with the public, and how to work in a fast paced environment. It was a great job to have in the summer to save money to go to school"
good,"Had an extremely pleasant work experience. Learned many useful things within different areas, and was able to significantly grow team-work, organisational, and leadership skills. Worked with many international colleagues, which made the job even more interesting and enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks taught me how to work in a fast paced environment while delivering superb customer service. Not an easy job, but a fun way to learn and develop your skills as a barista."
good,"Starbucks is a stressful and fast paced work environment. It requires your full attention, multitasking skills, and advanced customer service skills to make every customer feel like they are getting 100% of your attention at all times."
good,"the best part of the job is usually the coworkers, it's a lively environment but the pay isn't anything to write home about and management doesn't prioritize staff."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs thus far. I love interacting with people so I enjoyed the regular customers and the fast paced environment. There are job perks like discounts on food and free beverages. The benefits are amazing since they will pay for your online Bachelor's degree and even help fund adoption if you choose that path for having children. Medical, dental, and vision are offered if you work even just 20 hours per week. The cons are its hard to move up and sometimes potential can be passed over or unnoticed in an environment such as this. Definitely would work there again part time for fun."
good,All jobs have ups and downs. But I did love working for Starbucks and would go back if given the opportunity. Was one of my favorite jobs and I enjoyed the diversity.
good,Working at Starbucks allows for the flexibility to be available for other jobs or family.  The benefits both in 401K and medical are extremely good for everyone.
good,Good place to work at. Easy to learn and understand. The possibility of promotion is there as well as quickly too. Patience and a friendly attitude is necessary.
good,"I would open the store and get everything ready for the rest of the partners. Count the safe, balance the drawers, start coffees, and teas. Watch over barista and make sure that they are on track with their own tasks."
good,"really cool people and culture. the pay does not properly compensate for the hours and work - it is not a livable wage - however, the benefits are great. it's fun if you can stick it out, but its not easy."
good,"Learned to work as a team"
good,good company to work for with lots of opportunities to advance. can feel like you operate in a lot of grey area but they let you manage in your own personal way as long as you act with good intentions
good,"great team, great training provided, nice environment. free bag of coffee per month. discounts in other stores. possibility to relocate, would recommend as a place to work."
good,"The overall experience was good. The work isn't difficult and once you find a rhythm it's actually a little fun. The coworkers are all very supportive of each other and want to help you out. Making connections with customers is easy, the majority just want coffee."
good,"You do tip sharing based on hours. So your hours determine your tips but you can get tips at other stores if you work there. They do them weekly, usually Tuesdays."
good,The job gets really stressful when you first start and it goes on. Management varies on the store you have but for right now its not the greatest for my store. The stress and unfair environment is not worth the pay. I've even denied a manager position here simply because I do not want to run a store that cannot listen to its partners.
good,"Every Starbucks is different. If you get enough hours it’s a great job to work. I always had fun, and met new people! It’s a very fast pace environment, so you have to be ready to work and clean up after!"
good,"I worked here while in college and it was a great job for that. I personally didn't want to work here long term simply because it is hard work. However, they do have discounts on coffee, free lunch while working, and I personally had a great team I worked with."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced environment, that motivates diligent and efficient work ethic among partners. The daily routine involved regular brewing of coffees, restocking of the food cabinet, and making meaningful connections with customers."
good,"inclusive, faced paced environment with heavy customer service interaction. able to connect with team of employees with wide range of ages, backgrounds and work experience"
good,A typical day at work is getting there with a good attitude and with a mindset of getting things done quickly. The hardest part of the job is showing up with a good attitude and treating everyone equally.
good,"Starbucks can be a great place to work but it is not for everyone. It is high stress, fast paced, and requires a lot of learning.  A good store with good partners in a good area can be the best place to work. It can feel like a fun, well-oiled machine which is why I spent over 4 years working there."
good,Belle équipe de travail et de bons avantages sociaux
good,"Working for Starbucks is great if you're a student or you just need a part time gig. You'll receive great customer service training and learn a lot about the company and learn about navigating competitive work environments. But, your experience will greatly vary depending on the store. You go through extremely fast-paced and hard days (mostly Fall and Winter holidays, and Mother's day), and then the following week it could be super slow. This also means that the hours available to you can very quickly plummet from ~30 to ~20. Working for cafe stores and drive thru stores are also very different. Weekly mark-outs (bag of beans or something like that) and decent employee discount. Starbucks does have insurance, but it is extremely unlikely you'll make enough in your paychecks for it to actually be beneficial, really only affordable for assistant store managers and managers.They give you an apron, and there's a dress code. It's a company wide code, but some managers will be a little more relaxed or a little more strict about it. Feel it out."
good,standard making coffee and handing out to customers. working to keep the store clean and customers happy while dealing with huge lines and pressure to work quickly and accurately
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a flexible job to have for students or individuals with complex schedules. You start at minimum wage and receive increases as you grow with the company."
good,"The slightly above minimum wage pay and overstated benefits package are not worth the back breaking and emotionally exhausting work that is required of Starbucks Baristas and Shift Supervisors. We are perpetually understaffed and underpaid, often required to do the work of 2-3 people at once because this giant corporation does not want to pay to have an adequate number of people on the floor. Having a compassionate manager is rare, especially in the New York metro area. The only saving grace is that oftentimes there is a kinship among the staff who are all suffering together."
good,A typical day at work is always fun and exciting. The workplace culture is progressive and comfortable. Management is efficient and effective. I learned how to become a better listener and improve my multi-tasking skills while working for Starbucks.
good,"Starbucks was great for the first 6 months I worked there. I loved working with all my coworkers, the manger was friendly and got all his duties done, and we never had major problems. After that manager transferred to another store, however, we got a new manager who had been hired in through corporate. She was very unorganized and the work place quickly became a living nightmare. We constantly ran out of product and our manager would disappear for half the time. Overall, I really enjoyed working with customers and interacting with coworkers, but handling extremely unorganized management wasn't worth it."
good,je travaillais tout les dimanches ace une collègue dans le stand Starbucks d'un magasin Monoprix. C'était une superbe expérience tant au niveau humain que professionelle.
good,"Being a Barista at Starbucks has taught me to be a fast individual and multitasking and also developing a friendly atmosphere. A typical day depends on if you are a morning, mid-shift, or night, everyone welcomes you in (employees) then you sign in which takes two seconds. the workplace culture is pretty friendly. Hardest part about the job is probably learning drinks, but you could get it down in one or two weeks. I enjoy working there at night when there are not a lot of people and we are about to close because you just have to wash the dishes and get stuff done quicker because you have time."
good,"Loved thos job, get to meet so many lovely people and become part of a closeknit team. Although the job can be fast paced, the environment is always relaxed, with cooperation being the most important part of the job."
good,"Se cuenta con gran libertad de aportar ideas a la infraestructura de la empresa, y se incluyen en la administracion de la misma siempre y  cuando no intetfieran con sus solidas secuencias de rutinas y procesos."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks but with free drinks it’s easy to take in a lot of sugar so mind your calories! "
good,"I'm an older adult.  I love the benefits provided.  Otherwise, the job can be stressful and difficult.  Pay is not great.  Health benefits make up for it."
good,starbucks is a very fast-paced place to work with a very fun and encouraging atmosphere. It's exciting getting to make new drinks and getting to suggest new drinks to customers.
good,With a good team you can have a great work/life balance. In order to development you will need time and support of your DM which is hard to get sometimes.
good,"It was okay. A little drama, but nothing unmamangable. Crazy in the summer, most i’ve Worked is 50 hours a week and the least is 25. Okay policies but not all followed accordingly"
good,"Atypical day, is very fast pace. You can see up to a 100 hundred customers or more. I have learned to be more open to feed back from my other partners. They have helped me to grow as a person. When you have a great team to work with, it makes work fun. You don't feel like you are at work. The hardest part of the job, is to learn all of the drinks and standards on to make the drinks. Very thing that you do at Starbucks has a routine, that  must be followed. With following the routine you are guarantee quality beverages. Working for this company you get to meet many different people. They come from all walk of life. Its very fun to meet all of these people. To see that you can make someone day with just a cup of coffee,is very rewarding. People really enjoy that we get to know them and know them by their names."
good,"It was good. Overall, it gave me an idea of how to be collaborative, help others and be a good team member. I would recommend my friends to get the job in Starbucks."
good,"I worked in an airport starbucks.  I loved the job as I was constantly busy and shifts went in really fast.  However, I worked for an SSP Franchise starbucks and the pay was certainly not high enough for the shift hours and work."
good,A busy and fast paced environment where you are constantly adapting on the fly to changes within the business. A good environment if you like working with a team of like minded individuals.
good,I would rate Starbucks three out of five overall of places I would like to have as a career. My title was a shift supervisor and my compensation was poor overall for the type of work entailed. A typical shift started with counting several cash tills and setting up espresso machines. Then it was setting up the employees in there positions for there shift. Running a smooth shift was the goal and making there daily deposit was what ended the shift.
good,"The most difficult portion of the job is its customers. People are often entirely unpredictable and their entire experience is in your hands, you must ensure that everyone who walks through the door has a pleasurable experience with the desire of returning. This job has taught me how to talk people off the ledge and just how to speak to people in general. After working here for so long, I would now consider myself a people person."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for.  The environment in Starbucks is always a great and uplifting environment.   Starbucks is definitely one of my favorite environment to work in.
good,"Loved Working there, amazing staff who are very friendly. Busy and always keeps you on your toes. However, I feel like we should get paid more than what we get paid for doing the Job."
good,"One of my first jobs they gave me the ability to learn and grow in the company."
good,"Starbucks is an extremely fast placed coffee franchise, demanding a lot of it's Barista's. Whilst the pay is basic, they have an annual wage increase to incentivize the staff to stay with the company."
good,The job requires physical labor in the form of food and beverage preparation for the entirety of the shift. It is extremely fast-paced during peak times. The skills I learned during these times helped me in many ways in other aspects of my life.
good,"cela dépends du manager c'est une vrai roulette russe positif malheureusement j'ai eu le manque de chance de tomber sur LE manager pourris dans le lot  "
good,As a student I took the role of part-time barista it was a great opportunity to support myself monetarily during my time in University. I have developed my skills in working as a team to complete tasks. I had the opportunity to work with amazing people that were always happy to help when struggling and learning my way around the new environment. I think as a new person it is always hard to get into grips with the environment as well as learning all the codes for the drinks but with the help of a great team I was able to get myself settled pretty quickly.
good,great place to work as a parent. tricky to advance when you title can lock you into a department or focus area. since the new CEO took over the whole company shifted to a bottom line focused. less care for employees and well being of works (although benefits remained) they do not care about your ideas. what comes from leadership is what is done. unfortunate really.. i worked for Sbux for 11 years.
good,"Didn’t really enjoy it, but really good pay and good a ok first job, really good benefits, but I didn’t enjoy it cause I had to stay most of my day, and it would make me really tired, employees favored others, which made me irritated"
good,"Everyday at Starbucks has its differences. Some days can be fast paced and challenging, while others are slow and relaxed. But the connections you make with your customers make those stressful days worth it."
good,"Foi um excelente aprendizado ! No dia a dia aprendemos a dar importância a pequenos gestos de tratamento com os clientes, isso de fato e um diferencial logístico, para adaptação."
good,Quite busy throughout the day making drinks and serving food. Gained great experience dealing with customers and getting to know the regulars.Had a great relationship with fellow workers and enjoyed chatting with customers everyday
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. Solid customer service job, high speed and collaborative. Management could be challenging. Scheduling didn't always pan out when needed. Overall culture okay."
good,The company starts out giving you plenty of hours.  Sometimes you get changed to a different store and then your hours can be cut.  They do offer great benefits and discounts.
good,"Mi experiencia en Starbucks fue buena aunque la verdad no lo suficiente ya que promueven mucho un ambiente laboral agradable cosa que en sus sucursales no lo tienen, empezando con los gerentes que no se meten en la operación aunque no haya personal, no le dan seguimiento a tu crecimiento."
good,"Fast paced and sometimes tedious, but good environment. Good perks and free coffee. Learned a lot about coffee and the process behind it. Good place to advance if you want to do so."
good,"Manager was flexible with my ever-changing school schedule, took a lot of stress off my shoulders. Hard work when it's busy, but it makes the shifts go by fast."
good,I had a few great managers and co workers that made it very fun. A great experience comes from great people and that is what makes working somewhere worth sticking around.
good,"It was too easy to lose the tuition benefits. Other than that, the company is great, the culture could use some increased grassroots / inter-cultural feel. I would describe the flaws of Starbucks as ""bougie"" (too upper class considering its wal-mart coffee feeling, it feels like it's trying too hard to be elitist, just being honest). I loved the work/life balance and the products were good and they give back as best they can. I wish they gave back to the community more, instead of using homeless hires as marketing ploys."
good,Starbucks focuses on making customer connections and improving their business. Working at Starbucks requires fast thinking. In this job you have to be able to be good at each of the 7 positions.
good,"Not great advancement opportunity's, will take availability over job preformance any day, managment is not great at some locations, great benifits but awful pay,"
good,"Great work-life balance, very flexible with scheduling. Good benefits even for part-timers, and a really fun environment to work in. Sometimes the work got repetitive, but interacting with the customers was always the best part of the job."
good,"a typical day at work is very fast paced , what iv learned here is prepping the food before the customers came in , i also learned customer service how to handle with handling money."
good,"Starbucks is a fun company and environment to work in, even though it can be stressful at times. Making relationships with coworkers is a must, especially because the mamangemnt on a district level can make or break the experience."
good,"The overall team environment of Starbucks is lovely. I made friends in my coworkers and it felt like we could really work together on the floor. The company promotes a friendly attitude, and great training modules to speed you through your first days."
good,"The benefits at Starbucks are fantastic, I especially would have enjoyed taking advantage of the free spotify premium. Overall the job was fun and engaging, however it is very physically demanding, and working in the open is not a great workplace for those who suffer from social anxiety. Despite the air conditioning it always feel hot and stuffy after a few hours of running back and forth behind the espresso machines, and the anti-fatigue mats on the floor behind the bars and registers dont do much to prevent foot pain. There are almost no opportunities to rest, leaving workers exhausted and in pain at the end of every shift."
good,I really have no negative remarks to make from working here. Working at this establishment was a great experience. Very pleasing and fun place to work for.
good,Working there was extremely fun. Made alot of really good friends. Got to be creative and enjoy being at work without feeling too overly stressed. The management always had your back and tried to make everyone happy.
good,"A new experience for me as I have never work closely with users/consumers."
good,"Starbucks is a really fast paced job, customers are generally nice and understanding, although you do get crabby and mean customers. The hours are mostly inconsistent, and the manager did not make a huge effort to accommodate for my needs and preferences. There is a huge lack in meaningful relationships to your manger. He did not seem interested in what I as to say, or how I was feeling."
good,"- Constantly moving/cleaning"
good,"I have learned that I can be a manager. "
good,"I was employed as a supervisor.  Daily responsibilities included managing co-workers, ordering supplies, putting supplies away in appropriate locations. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with co-workers and especially customers.  The most difficult part of the job would be dealing with dissatisfied customers. overall very satisfying."
good,Management at the Chapters location was not the best but the job itself was a fun experience. There is a lot to learn including customers names and how to properly make all the drinks or prepare the food.
good,"I have loved my job as a barista at Starbucks, my current, store, has been by far my favourite and I like to think of my colleagues as close friends. They make the job truly enjoyable, running all the way down from the management team to my fellow baristas"
good,"learning about coffee and all the procedures an processes were overwhelming as it is very ordered an takes a lot of work and getting use to, as well as remembering every code for every drink. "
good,"Depends on where you live come in and proceed to clock in ,  you’ll be prepared for anything when working at Starbucks , washing you’re hands always comes first , find a shift supervisor and have them place you a role you  feel comfortable in.  Manage that , follow guidelines as Customers comes first until you’re shift has ended.  Typical day at work . Good Luck !"
good,"The manager I worked with at the time wasn’t the greatest. Overall though, good people, great experience and a great learning opportunity. If the management was different I would have most likely stayed there more than the year I did."
good,Customers  mean everything working at Starbucks. It’s about making the experience right for everyone that walks in the door and walks out. You meet a lot of people and learn regulars names and orders. Make really good friends. Training at first is always difficult and takes time to catch on but once you do you’ll love it! Hours can be flexible depending on if you want less or more or work a second job/go to school
good,"I loved the job, was one of my favourites and will always look back with fondness. However, favoritism ran rampant within the workplace, and I needed to leave."
good,"A Typical day at Starbucks could be a lot of different things. From your basic handling customers with care and giving them an impactful experience to completing task behind the line. "
good,"a good way to learn to work under pressure "
good,A wonderful fast paced environment to work in. The staff quickly felt like family. Starbucks is a safe and inclusive space and I am proud to have worked many years with this company.
good,When I first started at the company it was all focused on pleasing our customers. A year later it was just about hitting numbers and the people interaction became less and less to the point where we would get in trouble if we talked to a customer.
good,Working here can go from being super busy and fast paced to completely being abandoned for 45 minutes (I also worked in a casino starbucks). Very friendly atmosphere and great customers and peers.
good,Overall good employer. Large management turn-over leads to scheduling frustration and store inconsistencies. Typical day includes routine stocking and cleaning tasks detailed by task cards. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. Coworkers are the best.
good,"i really liked the work space when i worked there, very clean and i worked with friendly fellow co workers. typocal day would be cleaning, organizing, and stocking items neatly in shelves."
good,Starbucks is an absolutely wonderful place to work though it differs slightly on a store-to-store basis. Starbucks requires you to be capable of multitasking and able to handle unique and variable situations.
good,I started my employment in 2017 and at first it was a great learning experience & 2 years later the management has changed and it’s only gone downhill
good,"Being employed here means no day is the same. One must learn how to work well with others, and satisfy the customer by whatever means necessary. This job was challenging and also motivating because of the fast paced environment - in order to work here, one must be precise, clean, and enjoy creating. Having a positive attitude is an absolute must, especially for management."
good,The hardest part of the job is being understaffed on a busy day. The best part is working with customers and learning to read what they like and don't like. After a while you always get it right.
good,The organisation culture is formal and everyone is approachable. The management follows a direct communication style and pays attention to detail while passing a message.
good,"the job was very quick paced, always busy, and took focus. Good co workers, good team work, Fair break times and everyone was treated equally. rude custonmers"
good,Starbucks was a decent temporary job that provided opportunities for advancement. Management did a good job of keeping things running smoothly and efficiently.
good,"The Starbucks I worked at paid $16.45, I intend on getting the job back. A typical day stared 2:30pm and ended 10:45pm, some day 5:00am - 2:00am, the management was okay it’s was not very well."
good,"its okay i learned how to make drinks and how to properly talk to customers so that they come back, the hardest part of the job was memorizing how to make all the different types of drinks"
good,The managers couldn’t care less about you but other than that a great place to work. The Girls I worked with were great outside of the drama and it was fun getting to know many different customers
good,"Working in the fast paced environment at Starbucks was key in my developing positive communication strategies, time management structures, and team cohesion. "
good,"Loved everyone I worked with besides my store manager. Walked on egg shells whenever I worked with her. Every store is different though, I just had a bad manager."
good,"Na época em que trabalhei era ótima, isso em 2012 a 2013 "
good,"Working for Starbucks was a lot of fun and the management was very helpful. I was able to learn all of the skills necessary to excel as a barista in a short period of time, thanks to my wonderful coworkers!"
good,It was a great job but my manager was not willing to work around my class schedule.She continued to schedule me during my class times eve when I requested otherwise.
good,Most days included making beverages for customers as well as tasting coffee to provide better descriptions to customers to help them find their favorite beverage. Also had to keep the work area clean along with the machines we used.
good,"Some days the odd hours and stressful parts of the job could be very taxing and make it hard to keep working there. The job itself is the best part: making drinks, getting to know regulars, and fun launches. Working at Starbucks taught me a ton of very valuable skills I will carry with me though many other jobs."
good,"You're in charge of communicating with your co-workers efficiently and making sure the information you're relaying to them is correct; Otherwise, it slows down the pace of the business. Sometimes you'll need to be able to multi-task so it's important that you are fast and know ehat you're doing. Everyone has their own designated work area, so it doesn't get too messy and uncoordinated/chaotic."
good,"By far, the most fun place to work. Not great hours and not great pay, but very fun. The culture is very positive and uplifting and every step. The training is great too."
good,"Very busy: always something to wash, clean, prep. Need good communication skills and people skills, be friendly. Stay busy checking the supply levels."
good,"A typical work day was filled with multiple meetings.  Time management is key to being successful - balancing scheduled task deliverables with ad-hoc requests, and taking on different initiatives.  This is common as Starbucks is very much a cross-matrixed organization, where one works with talented individuals who have diverse skillsets and backgrounds."
good,"Enjoyed working there. Made coffee, cleaned the store, prepared for the next day (has evening shift). Management sucked there, but I’m sure other stores had better managers. All the baristas were like family to each other. Be prepared for very fast pace job."
good,I very much enjoyed the customer service but it was a very high stress environment and very fast paced but it was a very good job as far as perks go but my management was definitively subpar.
good,"Job overall is satisfactory. Job has great benefits but hourly pay is not awesome. Management typically works around your schedule and normally a relaxed, fun environment."
good,"A typical day at work would include closing, for me. I often tried to close, which could be enjoyable because of my coworkers, but stressful because we would end up staying an hour and a half late. I learned how to grin and bear angry customers."
good,This job can be fun especially with the right management and staff. I have worked at the company for two years and am only looking at leaving because of management issues. The benefits are amazing though!
good,It isn't hard once you get the drinks down packed. Customers are very distinctive about their drinks. Managers are sometimes lazy but the environment is great.
good,"Lots to do, diverse clients in the palisades, but between managers while I was there and a lack of communication from the managers on what we needed to know for events."
good,exhausting work life balance. worked at 5 stores. 3/5 managers were terrible people with vendettas against people. many of them were promoted to corporate positions. the managers that cared for the baristas were often targeted by district managers. such a terrible environment. but drinking coffee all day was great.
good,Overall working at Starbucks was a great experience. The customers were great to be around and working with coffee is always a mood booster. I do wish however that the manager took more initiative when situations arose.
good,Benefits are great. Interacting with different types of people every day keeps the job interesting. Fellow partners are great people. Free coffee is always a plus!
good,"Loved the diversity of work place, the sense of comradery.  The opportunity to meet new people every day and yet getting to know the regulars. The fast paced  environment."
good,"a great place to learn and grow. great benefits. REALLY depends on the manager and coworkers. Fairly easy job. Not that hard to learn the drinks. Pretty good with scheduling. Ive had bad experiences with managers and coworkers unleashing their anger, attitude and being passive aggressive. This is not the place if you strive for perfection because meeting all the expectations/""reasonable goals"" from corporate/store manager is not physically possible. I have worked for this company for years and worked with hundreds of partners. Out of the hundreds of thousands of employees, I would bet most, like me, feel like they can never be absolutely stellar at their job. You can certainly be amazing at parts of your job here but its nearly impossible to be great at all of your responsibilities here."
good,"early opening, late closings. I worked in a rich area so the customers were nightmares, one lady threw an extra hot drink at us through the drive thru window. co workers were nice and good managment"
good,"I left the people not the company. I did not like the direction of senior leadership or the culture she was creating!! It became a toxic work environment !!"
good,"Honestly Starbucks is a wonderful place to work at. Benefits are great was well as the insurance, I would have stayed longer but unfortunately the store I was in currently had poor management after the store manager left."
good,Only location in wentzville; Management could have been better; great company with great benefits; Nothing very hard about job just do what is needed.
good,"I made many friends, worked with old classmates from high school, and had lots of fun with my coworkers and managers. Unfortunately the workload was very much, and I was underpaid for the work that I was doing."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work... if you have the right manager. If you have a manager who is not very involved or allows issues to slide it can very quickly become a stressful environment, and not worth the hassle in my opinion. However, if you are one of the many who have the opportunity to work under a manager who is actively involved and truly cares about the welfare of their employees Starbucks can be one of the best places to work! The company is widely accepting of people and different lifestyles, the benefits are incredible, and the environment can be so much fun! If you get stressed easily and have a difficult time multitasking or moving quickly, this might be the place for you though. Just a few things to keep in mind."
good,Worked with the company over 3 and a half years under several different managers and 2 locations including the busiest drive thru in my district. Decent starting job but limited space for promotion.
good,It honestly all depends on the manager. I have worked at several stores and it depends on that heavily. They pay minimum wage pretty much. Tips are good if you work at a busy store though. Like a dollar for every hour you work. They are really good at working around your schedule. Good job to have if you have another job or are going to school.
good,"Every day is usually busy, one of the top five in East Texas for revenue. Coworkers are fun but the busyness tends to kill everyone's good mood. We close at midnight on the weekends."
good,"Between the 3 Starbucks' in Tualatin, my home store of Martinazzi is the busiest due to being a drive thru. Our customer volume is consistently higher than other stores, and our team is twice the size of either of the other 2 stores. As a barista I learned quickly and developed a strong sense of solidarity with other partners, and as a shift supervisor I took that solidarity and worked on being able to spread it throughout the team. I learned to trust my partners, to assume the best intentions instead of jumping to conclusions, and to coach firmly when necessary. I don't think it's a surprise that communication was always a point of improvement, and it was one of the first things I brought up once I was promoted to shift supervisor, and the same thing I have been continuously working on. It was important to break down the wall between ""opening crew"" and ""closing crew"" and to force all partners to recognize that they are one team, and to support each other."
good,Starbucks was a great first job to have. It really taught me that you have to come in to work ready to learn and push yourself as an employee. I met a lot of great people and began my journey as a barista.
good,My manager personally would hire too many people for our one little kiosk in the Ingles we were located at. Everybody's hours kept getting cut bad because there were too many people. On top of that she just generally had a bad attitude and would gossip to other coworkers. Whenever I was told my mother had cancer and had to call out my manager told my coworkers I was lying and also told CUSTOMERS. Starbucks in the Leicester Ingles has awesome workers though however the manager needs to be changed. She also does not train her employees. I was never trained by a manager another coworker took the time to train me even though they were not asked to by management and all my other coworkers said they weren't properly trained either. It's just a messy system.
good,I enjoyed working for them. They treated me fairly. I just needed more hours and that is why I looked for other work. The atmosphere was easygoing and friendly and the customers were a joy to work with. I would probably still be there if I could have gotten more than 15 hours a week.
good,"The people that I worked with were very kind and optimistic. It was fast paced , but I liked it because it kept me busy the entire shift. I would recommend this job to anyone because it's a great experience!"
good,"Learned so much about coffee and moving quickly but efficiently.  If you do not do well with a stressful environment this may not be the place for you.  Peak hours can be miserable in a drive thru store but off peak it isn't too bad.  You will be constantly working and if you aren't someone will more than likely give you tasks.  This can wear some people out but it makes the time pass faster.  If you can find a great and supportive store you are golden, otherwise it's hard to make it worth it - tips are weekly but you rely on customers having cash as card tips aren't allowed. Starting rate is $9 (or a few bucks over minimum depending on where you are) but for some insurance, school, and other benefits can make that worth it.  Plus unlimited coffee during your shift (30 min before/after as well), one comp food item, 30 min break after 6 hours, 10 min break on any shift, and 50% off all retail and when you aren't on the clock."
good,"Poor salary for quality of work, great student schedule."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work if you want your day to go by quickly and enjoy customer service. It is service industry work so it can be taxing and un-appreciated but the people make it worth it. Starbucks is a great company that offers many perks. Free drinks and food while you work as well as 30 minutes prior to and after your shift. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement, I became a supervisor in 8 months flat.They offer tuition reimbursement for ASU online if you do not currently have a BA. The will work with state disability to pay up to 60% of your usual pay which covers your own disability, caring for a loved one, or maternity leave. Free coffee and a 30% discount are other perks. It also teaches you valuable skills like problem solving and patience."
good,It was alright seasonal rush only lasted 2-3 months. The training was really easy and the pay was good. Great benefits to start and a nice break room. The hours were a negative
good,"The hourly pay wasn't good. Early morning shifts around 5 am were bad.it wasn't an awful job. Probably one of the better ""fast food""jobs you could get"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a lot of work, if you think all you'll be doing is making lattes, then this isn't the place for you. It requires you to do a variety of tasks simultaneously and if you are not a quick learner you'll find yourself overwhelmed. A lot of new employees don't make it past three weeks because of this. But the longer you stay the easier it gets because you'll get down your routines, which is what Starbucks is all about."
good,"This company is a great company to work for. They offer many benefits including an immediate invest 401(k), a general fund to help employees in need, personal markouts such as coffee, beverages, or food. The majority of leadership I have come across has given me new goals and a potential that I strive for as I work to become a player in the business world. They maintain proper policies and simple systems to operate while providing a relaxed and entertaining work place. The company also offers educational opportunities through online universities to partners who need it. "
good,"Although I loved my manager at Starbucks, most of my coworkers were not very nice and I felt uncomfortable come to work with them. I felt like my supervisors are unenthusiastic and did not amp up the team."
good,I overall had a good experience with Starbucks. It was a very fun and fast paced environment. They offer great benefits and there are many opportunities for growth within the company.
good,"Not a long term career because the expectations are too high with too little pay. But the higher-ups really do care about the employees, it's just the lower management that loses the translation."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, I believe pay should be higher for those who are experienced and benefits to part time employees as well. Loved the discount and the fast pace, it helped with keeping busy and time going by faster."
good,"Learning about coffee and its history, and the differences in roasts or how it can be made is very interesting. Also my customer connections have improved tremendously because Starbucks is very big on having happy customers."
good,"Positive and reinforcing work environment with excellent benefits including dental, life insurance and a 401K. However would schedule purposefully to make sure employees did not get breaks and would not have many hours available."
good,"The principles behind Starbucks are awesome. They offer medical and dental to partners who work 20 hours or more per week. They give free tuition at a select college to anyone who does not yet have a bachelors degree. They attempt to ensure that all of their partners receive a living wage and a means to better themselves, but there is a bit more to do. Often, the faults management get overlooked as long as a store is ""doing well"" financially. So if the customers buy coffee, managers who do drugs or treat their stores like an authoritarian dictatorship are overlooked. Fortunately, since I left the company, I've seen some of those issues being addressed, but there is still a lot of work left to do."
good,"Although it is stressful a lot of the time, I am grateful that I was able to work with this company, the benefits were amazing, & I loved getting close with everyone there. You get to learn how to mess around & make different drinks, connect with customer & your coworkers & make some memories with them. Sometimes the weekly tips are wonderful, & for me personally I love the feeling of cleaning & everything’s all neat & tidy & organized for the openers the next day. I truly am glad I got to work for this company."
good,"Gained fun experience crafting beverages and connecting with customers. Had a great team to work with and the workplace culture is quick paced, fun, and casual."
good,"As a store manager, I am responsible for all aspects of the store: hiring, staffing, training, sales, promotions, and merchandising as well as daily operations. The company is becoming more profits focused and changes are unfortunately not terribly partner focused.  Communication is not terribly consistent, nor is training."
good,"I learned a great deal on customer service, working machinery, and human relations. I really liked how many people I was able to meet and help. I didn't like the long hours and opening at 5:30am. My manager did work with me and helped me through the schedule changes. Overall, it was a good job!"
good,While at work you will be on your feet doing something. This helps with time going fast while you are at work. Starbucks helps you gain skills to complete your work and more.
good,"I learned numerous skills working for Starbucks.  Although there was a lot of change during my tenure, my team and co workers kept a smile on my face."
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me a lot in the sense of customer service, time management, and how to handle tough situations. The most enjoyable part of this job were the customer connections made within the store."
good,"Starbucks is a great summer job or job to work at while in school. Once graduated, Starbucks had little opportunity to move up the ladder. Management didn't care about issues between employees or fulfilling the hours each employee asked for. Management cared more about how many people they could hire than how many hours they could actually provide employees with."
good,Starbucks has regulations for each location and people responsible for double checking to ensure compliance is achieved.  The pace can be very fast paced depending upon location.  They provide training to enable you to be the best you can be.
good,"This job is very fast paced and may be difficult to pick up right away, but over all benefits make it worth it. Customer connections and partners you work with honestly are the most important part. Like any job poor management will likely drag the company and morale down."
good,"There is a great environment depending on which store you are working.  The benefits are great and there is a great focus on Partners and their needs,"
good,In charge of cleanliness of workplace area as well as the store as a whole. Receiving and giving out accurate orders to the guests and making drinks/pastries to customers liking; I was able to gain a great multipersonal experience. Developed the skills to work in a fast paced environment.
good,Good Environment to work.Collegues are very help full.Knowledge transfers are smooth.Flexibility in working hours.No pressure as long as the work completes on time.
good,It is a very sociable job. Made some friends. Quite laborious. The coffee is good. It was okay. Always depends on the store you get in and the manager.
good,"I highly enjoyed this job, however it is not a lifetime work field or place. there isn't much room for raises, but the benefits and all the other side/charity work the company does is phenomenal. it is wonderful for college student and even high school students since they pay a little above minimum wage, and the hours are very accommodating."
good,Starbucks was a great environment to be apart of. Management made a sincere effort to assist in anyway possible and took a particular notice to any one over achieving. Internal promotion was a strong plus and an incredibly affecting tool.
good,"Good. Shift managers and store manager make the differences between a good or bad working environment. I happened to have very good managers, and loved working with them."
good,Great place to work. The enviroment the partners create is very inviting and has many benefits. Learning all the drinks and measurements is very stressful but can be accomplished quickly. Customers at most stores are kind and come frequently. Working at Starbucks is like no other. The company itself strives to be inclusive and open to all walks of individuals. You will learn plenty about hospitality and working well with others.
good,"As shift supervisor, I managed 2-3 partners under me.  Daily duties as well as providing excellent customer service.  Management was not the best and advancement was not possible do to schedule conflicts."
good,"A typical day at work would include working either one of the three stations: warming, cash or bar."
good,A fast paced job that has taught me how to problem solve effectively. I have trained and supervised several baristas throughout the years. I learned how to keep the business running smooth and effectively.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work when your looking for benefits or if you're looking for something part time, such as to get you through school. It's not great if you're looking for full-time employment or longevity."
good,"I really enjoyed my time while working for Starbucks. It is a great company to work for, I've met so many great people while being there. It is a fast paced environment, however everyone is very helpful and you will get the hang of things really fast."
good,Starbucks was a good place to work while taking classes in college. There were flexible hours and free coffee. The people were fun to work with and the regular customers were enjoyable. It was a very high paced environment and it gave me good managerial skills.
good,"This was a fast paced job. The people were great, most customers were fun and kind. Benefits were great. Hours fairly flexible. The pay was low depending on your needs."
good,Depending on the day at Starbucks you could be really busy or really slow. I believe when you first start off you would be stressed because you feel like everything is happening fast but as time goes on it gets easier!
good,Great place to work if you are in college and need a few bucks. not much of a career job if you plan on not moving up. drinks are easy to memorize after a few times of making them.
good,SAA  I prefer not to share any information.  It was not as rewarding as I had hoped.  I had been in a corporate environment for 40 years and do not want to taint my thoughts of a different culture or environment that I was willing to try.
good,My original store was amazing. My current store has a “back of house” manager. The kind that doesn’t get involved and only helps out once the issues is the store have become so bad he doesn’t have a choice but to do something or he’ll be fired. The district manager isn’t doing anything either and sadly I’ve heard similar complaints from other districts. I’m six months I’ve been in my current store I have trained seven baristas and only one has stayed with the company. The job is fun and fast paced but when you have a busy store and an awful manager it gets to be too burdensome to deal with the low pay.
good,"Pretty decent starting job, I work at the Disney location where tips are unavailable. Getting hours can be a challenge and payment is pretty low unless you are a manager."
good,"Licensed has restrictions and the managers might run things way differently than other stores, it's odd and stressful and extremely tiring. Better to go to corporate starbucks where there is a set followed standard."
good,Working at Starbucks was nice. And i left the one at SIUE because of pay. Otherwise its a great company to work for. I learned to manage people during a shift while working through rushes. I am used to working in high stress situations now.
good,"I loved meeting new people and having regular guest. Being able to connect with so many people was amazing. In saying that management did not have control, the manager was biased and there was a large amount of bullying for a place that is supposed to be welcoming. For a small store it had a lot of drama and when corporate was called about the issues (after the issues were brought to the manager) nothing was done."
good,"This job is fairly easy but you have to learn and adapt quickly, be active constantly, be a multi-tasking machine, and be overall patient. This company can be bad depending on Management or a negative team, but overall you will have a great experience where you can gain skills for future oppurtunities."
good,"A typical day is fast paced, and requires a flexible form of management to adapt to problems as they arise. I learned how to provide effective and quality customer service in a hectic environment. Over the course of a two internal promotions, I leaned how to manage time better, comfortable navigate a complex web of technological and interpersonal problems as they arose in the day to day operation of a store. The hardest part of the job, was by far, feeling unsupported at time. The most enjoyable part of the job, was making meantiful and lasting friendships with customers and co-workers both."
good,"Typical day as a District Manager is built around your calendar and the visits you need to keep stores profitable and efficient. You will have multi units to check on. Typically your Monday and Tuesdays are used analyzing business trends. The rest of the week you are planning visits and meetings. "
good,"I did not like how much food and drinks we wasted every day. The amount if coffee we poured down the drain was ridiculous. The management was very poor, but the atmosphere around Starbucks is very positive and soothing. Overall, making drinks and talking to customers was fun."
good,"Starbucks was my first job out of high school and was perfect pace for me at that point in my life. I was at the time, working on earning my state license for cosmetology and was able to work around that."
good,Must be on your toes at all times. Customers are constantly coming and going. Must understand the recipes in order to ensure speedy service and to keep the store functioning.
good,"I learned how to please the customers and give or try to give them what they wanted. A typical day a work would be restocking the cups every 4 hours, making more and more coffee, taking peoples orders, and making the happy"
good,"Pays well for a first job. Personally, I struggled getting enough hours. I have many friends that had the exact opposite problem, they were assigned more shifts than they desired. It all depends on the location you choose to apply to."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a great company to work for. They offer quite a few benefits, free drink and meals, lots of training opportunities, etc. "
good,You'll make the best friends at Starbucks because you're all in the trenches together. Pay is not great compared to amount of stress. Not enough staff. Management is not on your side but the side of profits.
good,Fun place to work with some good customers and some bad customers. You will be on your feet for a full shift and sometimes work alone during busy hour of the day. You don't get paid the amount you deserve for the amount of work you do.
good,"It has been a long time since i've worked for starbucks, I enjoyed for the company and it provided me with the hours and financial needs I had at the time."
good,Working for starbucks in a mall is going to be different that working for a store front starbucks location. The people you work with make all the difference.
good,Great company to work for. Would recommend to anyone. Love the all the benefits. Perfect job for any college student. Love the atmosphere along with most of my partners.
good,the hardest part of the job was waking up early for opening shift and frapachinno happy hour. The overall flow of the job was great and you are always busy so shifts fly by
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks is going in with your uniform and starting immediately making drinks for customers. The number of customers that come in vary throughout the day. The hardest part of the job is when there is a surplus of people all at once that try and order. Overall, I would say it's not a bad place to work as a first job or if you just want something on the side but don't expect too much in terms of growing as a person."
good,The company is wonderful an I would have loved to continue my employment but the customers are awful and the management could use a lot of help. An amazing team environment as well.
good,"Loved working at Starbucks! I was always busy when I worked at Starbucks, never was a dull moment. It is definitely a great starter job, and if you can work up to management it would be a good career choice."
good,"I worked at a Starbucks at my college campus' library for about 2 months until I moved back home, and it was a great way for me to earn money at the time since I didn't have a car/license to go much elsewhere. The staff was mostly college-aged, but there were a few people in their 30s/40s and no older. As you could expect it was a fast-paced environment in the mornings, as tons of students would pour in for breakfast. Making drinks was my favorite part of the job, though I did much better with the hot bar vs the cold bar. Coworkers were friendly for the most part. I was paid slightly above minimum wage, but I was fine with anything since I just needed to make money. The cons weren't as abundant, but felt like it. I wasn't used to being up on my feet for hours at a time, so working 5-8 hours shifts several days a week destroyed my legs/feet. I woke up in the middle of the night at least 2-3 times during that 2 month period with a charlie horse. All hours of every day my muscles would be aching and I would struggle to keep from leaning/fidgeting/squatting during my shifts. Overall I really enjoyed my experience working for Starbucks and may one day apply for one again!"
good,"It was fun to work there, but there is a period of adjustment to get used to serving customers their drinks in a timely manner. I worked the opening shifts, so I was often dealing with a line of customers and had to work fast to get them their drinks."
good,"I love working for Starbucks. The company is fun and the work keeps you busy. There is plenty to learn and experience. The mornings are very busy and stressful. Since I've worked in two different Starbucks locations I have experience with many situations. "
good,Busy with regular customers. Working by starbucks standards to produce high quality beverages to customers. Working with a diverse variety of people and meeting new friends
good,"I enjoy my clients, not necessarily the company that I am contracted with.  I'm very focused on customer satisfaction.  My employer seems to be more focused on the immediate prospect of making money.  Not very focused on the future contract for the company."
good,Not enough hours available to be a sustainable full time job. The people are fantastic to work with and the environment is super inviting. Depending on location determines stress level during peak time.
good,"Felt like a second home, didn't dread going to work. Made some friends there that i still talk to today, excellent benefits and flexibility with busy schedules."
good,I liked how busy the environment was and how friendly some of the employees were. We would make drinks and serve pastries.the days were always very busy i worked in a drive thru and cafe store.
good,"Working at Starbucks is a calm and on going rush. Customers fill the store specifically on mornings for a lot of things but most likely coffee. The working environment between baristas and shifts are good, the communication levels are there in everybody’s head and we excecute big, long lines and waits in the best way possible."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a great company to sustain and grow ones tool box to further their career and or skills. Promotions past DM are not realist though."
good,"From my past experience as a barista, I loved working in a cafe environment. I always find it soothing. I loved and enjoyed serving drinks because I know I made patrons' day better especially remembering regulars orders before they walked into the store. The goal of making every drink count matters to me because as a regular coffee drinker myself, I would want an excellent full service. During my past experience,  I have learned how to prepare drinks by following proper techniques, maintained inventory,and enhanced customer experience by accepting different preferable requests. I always followed health work environment by following rules of safety and sanitation regulations."
good,Enjoyed working for Starbucks but the staff was over half students so if full time people called in people from school were the only ones able to cover the shifts but as we are in school you can see how it didn't workout
good,The experience will be on how you perceive it and what your needs are. It is suitable for young adults who live with family and wish to attend school.
good,"Very flexible schedule. Worked for multiple years and did not have any opportunity for advancement. Hire outside managers which sucks. Pay is okay, they do give raises frequently."
good,"Loved working for Starbucks! My management was fantastic, my coworkers were overall pretty good, and I loved my regular customers so much! The pay could have been better and is ultimately why I left."
good,I worked for Starbucks on and off for 7 years. I enjoyed my time there and found opportunities for growth and development within my store. I have found that the Starbucks experience is very dependent on your store location and the management team.
good,"Starbucks is a solid work environment as long as you have a good manager and team. Of course, that’s the way it is with every company. The manager makes or breaks your experience."
good,Starbucks is a mostly good place to work. Dealing with customers everyday is wonderful. The management is ok at communication. The corporate culture is good but occasionally contradictory. There is the ability to move up but there is a good amount of outside hiring.
good,I learned about controlling crowds and communicating with people. patience and collaboration. Typical make drinks for a few hours talk to some people and make sure the workplace is clean
good,long and stressful at times but wonderful people to work with. rushes kept the work day short. you're never not doing nothing. the most enjoyable is getting to know lots of cool people.
good,I really enjoyed how many connections I made through other employees and regular customers. One of the most rewarding yet difficult parts of the job was remembering drink orders for each regular customer.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with this company, but it is not a company I would be able to advance in, career-wise. There are not a ton of opportunites to advance and the hours are strenuous. I love the benefits, and those are the reason why I have rated the company 4 stars overall. Supplemental income would be necessary for any individual to live off of this salary, even with 40 hours a week."
good,The time spent dealing with dissatisfied customers and all of the unnecessary deals and promotions that Starbucks was constantly trying to implement was not worth the little pay and overworked hours.
good,"They do not care about sexual identity, gender, race. Very focused on you're work and don't worry about anything else. As long as you get along with coworkers and do your job well."
good,This job is not for the faint hearted. I learned so much from my time there and I regret leaving but it isn't the best company. Always short staffed company wide. Its great for college students and the discounts were amazing. I also had the best coworkers.
good,"It's a good place to work, the salary isn't the greatest but you can move up within a year or 2. The hours are great so you have options about what shifts to work. I always leaned more towards the opening shifts to have the afternoon for myself or to do something on the side."
good,"Fast paced enviornment and if you can't deal with customers yelling at you for messing up their drink this isn't the job for you. Pros: free drinks, free food if past expiration date, and coworkers are friendly"
good,"The Company was great even when I was out on maternity leave, but once I came back, they treated me differently and not in a good way. It was busy and stressful and not worth the pay."
good,"The work is fast-paced and rewarding. The benefits are amazing, but the base pay is not enough for me to live off of. My coworkers are amazing, but that depends on your store."
good,the pay was fair for the amount of work required. The job is very fast paced and there is always a rush in the hours before work and after work. Making drinks was always fun.
good,Learned a lot about customer service and time management while working at starbucks. I have enjoyed working with all backgrounds of people and the fast paced environment.
good,"The drinks that are made on the spot never disappoint me. I'm always satisfied, and I feel well relaxed after being served my beverage. The staff are so polite, always, and so very welcoming. I do, however, would like for staff to pay attention when writing customer names on cups, so that no one is mistaken."
good,"The typical day at Starbucks is at once hectic and casual, though that depends almost entirely on who you work with and the traffic for that day. While daunting at first, making drinks becomes second-nature. Making drinks is easy once you learn the patterns."
good,"Overall the company has great benefits for the partners and it reflects how they value their employee but in a retail store, the struggle comes in management."
good,I enjoyed my experience at starbucks. It was my first real job and I felt I could easily grasp everything that they threw at me in training. All of the coworkers were very nice and friendly.
good,A lot of hard work for not enough pay. Coworkers are great though. Benefits are great. But I can't use my benefits to pay rent. I would love to keep working here but you can't work at Starbucks without a second job or side gig.
good,"It was decent, the people i worked with gossiped so much which took the enjoyment out of the job. But aside from that the training was great and they really push for job advancement."
good,"We all know what the Starbucks life is about, fast-paced, high energy, caffeine and smiles. "
good,Sbux is my first real job and it's been pretty cool to work with and interact with people from all walks of life. I liked learning how to function in a high paced environment.
good,I was originally hired as a shift lead and was continuously told that the training would start the following week. Shortly after I started the manager that hired me left and the new manager was trying to make the lead position happen for me when I was offered a different job at what seem like a better opportunity.
good,"The team is a fun one to be a part of, although some need to be reminded to pull their own weight. It's one of those places that either everyone is on it, or slacking just a tad."
good,Starbucks overall is an excellent company u have to be strong minded & be willing to be very patient smiling is a must Knowing a regular drink is definitely a plus ...
good,"Working here definitely has benefits in job security and benefits as a student with their bursaries towards tuition. "
good,I liked it their maybe a little hectic if your trying to go to school during the day and work nights. I barely got any sleep and I even worked overtime at times
good,"-Lots of employee turnover, new trainees almost every week"
good,"Working at corporate and there is a lot of turn-over in last couple of years with new leadership from the top down, causes a fair amount of chaos.  The threat of layoffs looms often, at least annually as leaders make cuts to realign operational costs.  The company culture is changing from that lovable coffee company focused on partners (employees) to a more abrasive performance driven culture, struggling to maintain its presence and relevancy in a tough brick and mortar retail market.  It's still a great company, and if you love coffee or tea, this is your place.  Compensation is fair, and competitive, with stock for all, and annual bonus for higher grade positions.  Work life balance is mostly good, but depends on where you work in the org, as there are pockets of extremes."
good,As a former student they had been very flexible with my schedule. Which was very helpful for a full time student that had a long commute to their university.
good,A typical day is on and off being slow or fast-paced. Management is great. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and getting to know them.
good,"My manager was horrible in Mukilteo, WA. I really enjoyed one of my managers in Denver, but the pay is not enough. Even as a Shift Supervisor, you cannot live on that income alone."
good,"Great place to work if you want to stay busy! Discount is wonderful, free coffee while you work. Unfortunately, it is very busy and you are never fully staffed."
good,"Unfortunately I got pregnant and my manager just wasn’t considerate in anyway so I chose to leave the company at the time. Overall, I love working there otherwise."
good,"A typical day at work was quite busy. This location was one of the busiest, as it was located across the street from a high school. I learned how to make all of the drinks on the menu. The hardest part about this job was dealing with the hustle and bustle, however working with my co-workers made it all worth while. It was an amazing experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my days there."
good,"Normally, there are always things to do and get done at Starbucks. I learned how to multi-task effectively and work better with many people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with complicated customers, but the best part of it is also building customer connections."
good,"Grew to bond with, and become friends with, coworkers and regular customers.  Store Manager was pleasant, if gossipy.  My store was 85% female employees, so my store in particular was quite dramatic but I don't expect that to be the norm with other locations."
good,"A good company to work for."
good,It’s a great place to work at when starting out because you learn customer service and money handling as well as making drinks. Management could be better but you do get great benefits for part time as well as stock.
good,"A typical day at work consists of opening up my store at 5am in the morning, setting up the store and making sure that the entire staff is ready and set for the day in order to provide the best customer experience for our customers."
good,"If you're part-time you can enjoy the benefits without the long hours. As a full-time worker if you need the money you're better off going some-where else."
good,"You must think quickly on your feet and be able to adapt during peak  times to have your right people in the right places.  I'm a people person and to me that was the most fun part.  Training new people for new skills, watching them succeed, grow and advance.  I want everyone to be successful who works with me."
good,"Creative studio was a great experience, worked with a lot of super talented people. Lots of good, fun projects to work on. Management layers/approvals are a bit excessive and often results in too many cooks in the kitchen."
good,Starbucks fosters a community of entry level baristas who are usually looking for a part time job. The company values their employees and gives their employees several opportunities to build their career at Starbucks.
good,"There was no set schedule, and the morning shifts were the busiest time. Mostly worked by myself in a kiosk for four hours plus. Tons of rushes,typical"
good,The company is amazing to work for if your young and trying to get through school but if your looking for a career they wont be able to give that to you. They make empty promises for promotions time and time again. They also do not pay you enough for all the incredible insanity that they allow you to endure from the customer base.
good,"Starbucks can be busy and stressful. My co workers make it a positive environment! I try and provide top quick, efficient service in my position each shift whether I am making drinks or running drive thru."
good,"Good place to work. Fun and fast paced. Good people and nice environment. Works with your schedule. Some benefits, I don;t all the details since I didn;t take advantage of them."
good,"It was a fun place to work because of the team that I worked with. However, it was very stressful and they don't compensate you for the amount of work that you actually put in."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. The first 2 store managers I had were amazing. The last store manager cut my hours significantly because I was in school a few hours a week. She picked favorites. I had tried moving up in the company as a shift manager and she kept dragging me along. Another coworker transferred stores and she got a shift manager within months of transferring. It’s a very fast paced work place, you have to have a good memory."
good,its okay. memorable. clock in and start the day. management needs improvement. culture in my location was chill. hardest part of the job was to dictate.
good,it was good and difficult now that i have to go to school. the amount of people that you have to work with is a lot of pressure and its cool how they are from all around the world.
good,Starbucks as a whole is a great company. I have worked for several stores around my area and each store is very organized and clean. Starbucks is a fast paced environment but most coworkers are very relaxed when it isn’t busy. Having a good manager makes a huge difference with this job.
good,It was challenging trying to learn all of the different drink combinations and everything to only be thrust into working the window. It was very stressful and difficult
good,Fast paced work environment with many opportunities to advance if under the correct management. Great way to learn and meet new people.Starbucks does offer free education and 401k and stock options if still currently employed with the company.
good,Starbucks is a very fun place to work. It is a great work space to meet people from all over the world. Starbucks offers amazing benefits to its employees.
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for when you're a student seeking lots of caffeine and above minimum wage hourly rate. The benefits for a part-time position are really excellent and they even offer scholarships through Arizona State University. However, this position is taxing. Baristas deal with extremely early hours, fast paced and stressful environments, and rude customers. It is not meant to be a career, unless you plan on moving up in the company, which is not for everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed working there for the time I have, but do not desire to make a career out of it."
good,Working at Starbucks was not difficult but in my opinion it was not worth the work for the amount of pay I was bringing home every pay period. I learned many good work qualities that I intend to carry with me to other places of employment. I just felt like I could receive better pay and treatment for the same amount of work and stress elsewhere.
good,Customer Service is everything at Starbucks. I have had customers follow me from store to store.  Even have a customer who now lives in a different state and comes back to my Starbucks whenever he is in town.
good,great companies bad management . you can  work all times  at Starbucks you' ll found lot of conflict miss understanding the direction you took by diversity.
good,Overall great experience considering it’s retail. Learning regulars orders is a good way to connect with the customers and you look forward to making their orders everyday.
good,Empresa flexível com horários e turnos. Dias bastante corridos e necessário aprender a trabalhar em equipe a todo o tempo.
good,My store is fun for the most part. The customers are good. Being in Palm harbor some can be quite unpleasant. The bosses usually play favorites and leave more skilled people in the dark.
good,"If you like free things, making good, lifelong friends, and coffee culture, this is for you! The hours are not guaranteed, you have to work five times as hard as anyone else to even be considered for any kind of advancement and you wont be paid as much as you deserve, but the free coffee mark-out, the benefits, and the laughs can be worth it?"
good,I really enjoyed working there. Co-workers are great atmosphere was great. Most of the time customers were really cool. I just didn't care for the current manager so i left to finish school.
good,Starbucks is a excellent place to work. You will meet wonderful people who will help you grow professionally as well as personally. the pay and benefits are pretty good as well
good,"Can be fun but sometimes its can get very crazy schedule isnt really a set schedule. Company  tends to change wish they would go to basics  .(coffee master ,mug awards)"
good,"Starbucks is very focused on the employees, almost to the exclusion of other goals.  Priorities and strategic objectives change regularly, often at the whim of new executives. Fun and engaging place to work, but people can get complacent which makes it difficult to motivate certain personality types."
good,"Starbucks is a great starter up job that teaches  you skills required in everyday life from customer service to team skills, which is beneficial in my continuing life careers or pursuits. Allowed plenty room for growth."
good,Every store is a little different but always a fun job with bendable hours. There is always something to do but that just makes the shift go by faster plus  allowed a few free drink before or after your shift.
good,"A typical day for me includes opening the store, taking inventory  and completing the daily order, communicating daily sales goals and any necessary information to team. I've learned how to deal with challenging customer situations with patience and respect and how to lead a team successfully. Workplace culture is what you make it - try to keep things away from negativity!"
good,"It's a great place to work if you don't have another career choice that you desire to follow. It's also a great place to work if you want to get promoted to a better job because they promote from within a lot. Not a very difficult job in retrospect, can be trying at times because customer service jobs are never a breeze, but the company does its best to take care of it's partners and does a lot better than some other companies out there."
good,As a supervisor you have many roles and responsibilities so you need to manage your time well. The culture is meant to be warm and welcoming and when fully staffed that works flawlessly but if not it falls apart.
good,"The people I work with are great, but the work can be very tiring and stressful. This is an extremely busy and fast paced location, and customers can be very demanding. The hardest part of the job is just staying positive even when feeling overwhelmed. I also do not particularly like my manager very much; she doesn't seem to be very in tune with the needs, skills, and progress of the baristas, and puts too much of an emphasis on customer connection as a skill, when there are many more also relevant strengths other baristas have that need to be recognized that don't involve having lengthy, animated conversations with every customer across the bar."
good,"Management team was not the best, low pay for the work. Customers can be great or horrible. I miss my regulr customers but not the work. It was a job, not a career. Can be early hours and late nights."
good,"I needed a job where I could work later at night in highschool to pay bills, so this was a great job for that. I do not regret working at starbucks, wouldn't work there now though, as I have moved on."
good,Your job satisfaction  majorly depends on your manager. I got lucky with one of my managers and absolutely loved her. However after she left I was not so happy with her replacement.
good,"The work days are always stressful, understaffed, and slowly losing the Starbucks vision. It's hard to find someone who truly cares about Starbucks and its mission."
good,"First few weeks are gonna be tough and learning beverages will be tougher after that. Store location has a very large impact on how the store operates. Near a highway with a drive through, near a school, these will impact times of rush and if the SM isn't properly deploying then it could be tough shifts especially weekends."
good,I did serving drinks to customers and doing cashoer and also food warming I also did my coffe master programme to got a coffee master aporon and I enjoyable thing is to talk to customers. I also do a coffee master
good,On the day to day Starbusck was a fast paced environment. I very much enjoyed the many components of beverage quality and doing everything to make the moment right.
good,I would reccomend they get a better compensation for their employees. The employees should have at least every other weekend off for the people with families.
good,It is a great place to work when you don't have a family to worry about or provide for. If you want a fun work environment and don't mind working nights/weekends/holidays it is the right fit for you. It is fast paced most of the time and the majority of the job is cleaning.
good,A great place to work but is very fast paced and you will be on store support (cleaning and stocking in 15 min increments) if you get behind.                                                                                                                                     Not alot of training. Great support for the community and one free meal and free drinks. Free One bag of tea or coffee beans per week
good,"didn’t give me enough hours, too demanding of a job for the amount i was getting paid. other employees were very nice and helped when things got stressful, customers can be very rude and demanding."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to get a manger to help with conflicts between the crew. If there was an argument or disagreement we were told to handle it yourself. People were rude to each other and often made things difficult to work. some of the other employees would even mess up an order and blame someone else for the mess up.
good,"Starbucks is great in terms of restaurant type jobs. Fast-paced, somewhat fun, great benefits. Co-workers can be a pain sometimes, and after dealing with the 5 am rush 3-5 days a week for a year, you might start to become bitter towards your customers. You just start to lose patience because for the un-teenth time you hear ""Did you make this sugar free?"" right when you're trying to write down 3 drink orders and get 4 food items into the oven, now you gotta deal with this shmuck who doesn't care about your stress level so long as they get their precious Starbucks. We have all been this shmuck too, we all want the perfect $7.00 Starbucks beverage. After spending $7.00 on a single drink, yeah I'd want to make sure it was right too. Doesn't make life easier for the barista though."
good,"Starbucks is a good first job because:"
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 4 years. I worked at 3 different locations and it really just begins with the store manager. I’ve had a manger who is just sloppy, I’ve had one who showed favoritism and the last Starbucks I worked at was fair, hard working  and really made the atmosphere fun, playful while still getting the job done."
good,"Satisfied Customers, followed health codes efficiently, made drinks accurately, fast paced work environment, great benefits for a ever advancing company."
good,Great first job but they over work you and don't protect the employees when crazy customers attack. Pay is well if you need to just pay for everyday things.
good,"I loved my job at Starbucks as it was a great company to work for. They really care for their employees and provide a great work place. There were times where we would get really busy during a rush hour, so time management is crutial. The best part of the job is getting to try all of the drinks and giving recommendations to the customers. I would recommend this job to anyone who is looking for a job with a great work place environment."
good,"The overall experience at Starbucks that I had was practically phenomenal. The employees and managers were friendly and professional, and the majority of the customers I served were kind as well."
good,Work with you through the ups and downs of life. If you have to miss work they will usually work with you based on the situation. Very partner oriented.
good,"Opening shift with the shift manager can be good or bad depending on who is working that day."
good,"Many mangers slacked off, some managers walked out, easy job but many hours on your feet. Love drinking Starbucks so the free drinks were a plus. I could walk to work from my dorm."
good,"A fast paced coffee shop. Dealing with customers that want their coffee but you do have an opportunity to make an impact on their lives, along with your coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks for awhile, but the relationship between baristas is a key factor to look into if you want to work for them. The location I work at was amazing. All the baristas were great and were very much willing to help me learn the ropes. There were a few times that I felt uncomfortable with the baristas just because a few people acted like supervisors when they were clearly not. For the most part, I worked here for supplemental income. They pay minimum wage and they can be flexible with your schedule."
good,"There was no set schedule, and the morning shifts were the busiest time. Mostly worked by myself in a kiosk for four hours plus. Tons of rushes,typical"
good,"Starbucks is a good start off job, but Horrible management and under paid. The hours are cut and understaffed. People also do not like to work together a lot of drama."
good,"A typical day includes prep, cleaning, drink making, and guest interaction. The management is often flaky, but still cares for team members. The workplace culture depends highly on the management, but is usually respectful. The hardest part of the job is serving guests that are rude, disrespectful and cruel. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving kind, respectful and pleasant guests."
good,"This is a good job for a student or someone who only needs part time work. The company allows for very flexible schedules. This is a fun job, however, be prepared to work and work hard. Initially, the first few weeks of the barista's job is like a whirlwind. Learning routines and all the various drink recipies."
good,"I am currently working in Starbucks Lucena City and they have numerous benefits including incentives, tips, and bonus. But it was very tiring to work because I work there for almost 10 hours for a total of 45 hours per week."
good,"I worked at Starbucks at the University of Toledo for about 2 months. Although I loved my job, I was not trained properly and often found myself struggling and being held accountable for my mistakes. Even though I did not know how or what I was doing because I was not taught."
good,working at starbucks can either be great or awful. it all depends on who you work with. I was lucky to work with a great team so I truly enjoyed the job. I only left because of a better job opportunity. would recommend
good,"I had full control of all parts of operations which allowed me to learn some much as a manager. Also, I learned the difference of being a manager and being a leader."
good,Its a great place to work. Fun environment. Have to get work done at a fast pace and in atimly matter. Hours vary from 40 hours to 20 depending whether your full time or part time.
good,"As a shift supervisor there area lot of responsibilities which is fair but they started to dump a lot of the barista responsibilities on the shifts making our workload, especially for the closing supervisor, very difficult."
good,"I currently work for Starbucks as a shift supervisor. The workplace culture depends on your district manager's setting in accordance with your store manager's preferences. Thankfully, my new district manager and my store manager are excellent. I truly do enjoy the work I do at Starbucks, my employees, and my regulars. We are given retirement benefit options, higher education reimbursement options, volunteer opportunities, and excellent healthcare opportunities. I generally work 8hr shifts and see a wide percentage of my team in a day. The people I work with are excellent. I handle cash responsibilities as well as key-holder responsibilities. I also get to enjoy the barista life from time to time; meaning I get to talk with regulars/customers, prepare beverages/food, and help make everyone's day a little brighter. As a supervisor, I also take part in inventory counting, ordering, and organization. I also am in charge of our store cleanliness as well as training new baristas. I love what the company stands for, I just wish I didn't have to work two jobs to sustain myself."
good,"Impiego abbastanza stimolante e impegnativo. "
good,I worked at the busiest Starbucks I have ever been to. Not many people spoke English and we are constantly understaffed. The people I work with are great and really laid back although the manager won't give you days off unless you ask over a month in advance.
good,"you learn a lot at starbucks such as time management and team work."
good,"Overall experience was great, but the bad things left a bad taste in my mouth. Consistently understaffed, expectations were VERY high yet constantly not provided with the proper tools and set up to not meet those expectations."
good,"I actually had a lot of fun working at Starbucks. I was there for 3 years, longer than any job I ever worked. Yes, it was corporate and there were aspects of that that were annoying at times but overall I worked with great people, I loved getting to know my regulars, I was able to advance my position, I gained knowledge and leadership experience and there is room for upward mobility. I have considered working there again, Ive just been hesitant because I know they will start me out at the bottom again with bottom pay. There are so many Starbucks and so many people applying that there is not much value for a Starbucks employee. You are easily replaceable. They are quick to say no to high pay (even if you've earned it) because there is 100,000 other kids that will accept a minimum wage."
good,I enjoyed a lot of my summer mornings there and the remainder of the day at the beach or off doing whatever I pleased. It was a part time job that mainly funded hobbies. I enjoyed the customers and making all of those crazy and delicious drinks. I worked with fantastic women too. Over all a positive experience.
good,Great company to work for. Fun and exciting place to work. Ability to meet new people and drink all the coffee you want!!! Such a fun place  to be very fast paced.
good,"- earned how to manage register along with producing drink orders"
good,"Great place to Learn Customer Service Skills, Enjoy the flexibility ,"
good,"Starbucks made me the person who I am today, period. I valued the mission and the goals of Howard Shultz and become a district manager, but never happened."
good,"I couldn't cut it making the drinks, but I loved the customer service. When working as a team, things went well. But when there was no teamwork, it was stressful."
good,"All staff had a collaborative understanding."
good,"Es una empresa en la que se puede trabajar y estudiar a la vez, ya que hay distintos tipos de contratos/horarios. También resulta fácil ascender si demuestras interés. "
good,"Fast paced, customer service, barista served drinks on hot and cold bar along with any warmed foods or pastries. Keeping the bar clean while working and the floor where guests came to eat/relax."
good,"-As a shift, there is a transition phase when the shift before you hands over the floor. Depending on how their day was, it could be a bad transition. Therefore, that means you will have a lot of catching up to do. Then you have you team for the remainder of the time and you delegate where (positions) you want them and what you want them to do. "
good,"There was great communication throughout the shift. The environment is faced pace, but the baristas would establish a great connection to customers. The hardest part of the job would be preparing two drinks at a time in an efficient manner.  It takes practice. The most enjoyable part of the job would be connecting to new customers and seeing regular customers."
good,Learned quickly however the shifts are inconsistent and management can be awkward. Extremely stressful job will likely send you into an early grave. awkward customers also. pay is minimum wage.
good,A typical day wasn' anything crazy. Clock in do what you need to and then clock out. Management can make things harder than they need to be. Coworkers usually make the job worth it and the pay is definitely good.
good,Working at Starbucks was fun. It was an incredibly fast paced environment and stressful at times. I got to create interpersonal relationships with the customers and felt good about my job.
good,It was very enjoyable to be working there. My store was sometimes a little too slow for my taste but when it picked up it was definitely enjoyable. The management was below average at some times.
good,"I could write something pretty lengthy as I spent about 5 years with Starbucks, but I will keep it short. "
good,Starbucks is a good work place for anyone pursuing other career path on the side. It allows flexible working hours and a friendly and vibrant work environment.
good,This job used to be the best job of my life. I transferred stores where my pay got cut $2 and we were always overworked and always understaffed. The management that I worked with went from being super understanding to petty and untrusting.
good,"I was really only looking for part time work while in high school, but was constantly being urged to learn and try to move towards supervisor positions. Great opportunity, but not what I needed."
good,"Starbucks is a great job for anyone who loves hands on tasks and being involved in a team. There's a couple of jobs you can do during the shift you're scheduled for; drive through window, front cashier, or bar. Every position is just as important as the other because they all depend on each other. The team members are fun and easy to connect with so it makes the job pretty enjoyable. Whatever hardship comes your way, you figure out a way to get through it together. Communication is really key in a job like Starbucks because there can be misunderstandings."
good,the moral in the location i worked was not the best. i was personally was discriminated when i was pregnant by my store manager. i loved the company when i first started but my view later changed as the years went by
good,"Everyone was really nice, just wish management was more in priority. They tend to not communicate, at least the one that I worked at. It was difficult to talk or get ahold of them."
good,"Good if you’re looking for money and benefits. Management usually isn’t good, coworkers are full of drama and very negative. Very fast-paced. Going through security everyday is quite an annoyance."
good,Working in Starbucks gave me a lot of experience. If you work hard you can very quick develop yourself. As my first job in UK was amazing experience. You can always get extra shifts if you want. Salary as well is good.
good,"Boa empresa, equipe de muito fácil convivência, e oportunidades para crescer por meio de cursos oferecidos pela propria empresa."
good,"It is a great part-time job to start and to train my ability in connecting with people. With the practice of how to connect regular customer on daily basis, working at Starbucks provide me great training in interpersonal skills and work under fast paced environment."
good,the company overall is an amazing company to work for. lots of great opportunities and advancement opportunities. fast pace work. customer satisfaction.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks at HMSHost but this was more down to my fellow employees. The management at HMSHost were not interested in any problems we had and treated the staff as commodity. They have an incredibly high turnover of staff demonstrating the lack of dedication and interest they put in the individual. They are focused on profit - during quieter periods they cut everyone's hours massively but then expect you to work up to twelve days in a row during busy periods. They are only interested in how much money you can make them.
good,"If customer service is not your skill set or interest, then working for Starbucks would NOT be the right job for you.  There are lots of great benefits.  The pace is moderate to fast and at times can be stressful.  You need to be able to multi-task, keep a calm and friendly demeanor.  You also need to have strong verbal communication skills.  An outgoing personalty is definitely a benefit but not a requirement."
good,Very high stress and very quick moving. Get to know the customers is the greatest part of the job. Quick memory of the drinks and peoples orders is always helpful.
good,Have a wonderful training program in place! Enjoyed the organization and atmosphere. Great entry level job. Good initial job experience. Would recommend.
good,"The place was sold to Holiday Market."
good,"Working here was really fun, I loved the upbeat environment! Only thing I didnt like at the time was the wage. I was only working there part time so there were no benefits for me."
good,During rush there will be no time for you to stop and get a drink of water. You're constantly on the move. There is always something that needs to be stocked and cleaned. The work place is usually very fun and sometimes very stressful.
good,"Starbucks was incredibly useful in teaching me how to multitask and also how to work in a team. I worked between 40 and 45 hours a week, which gave me the ability to appreciate working hard for profit. I also did a lot of work in drive-thru, which taught me how succeed in doing multiple things at once."
good,"Would recommend working at Starbucks to a friend. I love Starbucks because it has very good coffee,And the people there are very nice to work with.And I also love Starbucks because its is a very clean place to be at and to work with.I recommend Starbucks to anybody that I know in my life.But if you higher me i'll be the best employed that's you ever had."
good,"Sometimes the work day requires a little extra effort to get through the day, but overall it's bearable. The pay isn't terrible for what is asked of you. Staffing is sometimes an issue with people not showing up or calling out, can cause a stressful day"
good,"I learned customer service skills that can be applied in any position. I also gained many leadership skills such as effective communication, teamwork, and motivation. It is a team based environment where if one person is not doing their job others are affected. The hardest part of the job was the training/transition time in remembering recipes along the rules & regulations."
good,"must be able to handle rude customers"
good,Starbucks is a good place to work... the job itself is pretty easy it’s just remembering the drinks that can become hard but once you get the hang of it you’re fine
good,Most people are over-worked and under-paid but enjoy the culture and experience offered.Benefits are the best thing about the company. Health insurance and college opportunities cant be beat.
good,The staff is friendly but can cause alot of drama. Upper management is not good. They do not care about you as an employee. The benefits are not good  but the discounts are good.
good,"Good job if you love coffee.  Lots of work, not much pay.  But health insurance is amazing."
good,"At the time I was with Starbucks, the company was very strong on business unit meetings, often 2 or 3 times per year, for upwards of 500 employees (Licensed Stores).  A bit of ra ra but also informative, and an opportunity to engage with fellow employees from around the US that we didn’t get to see regularly."
good,"Thanks but no thanks, I opt out to put anything in words.  Appreciate the offer though.  Maybe over the phone.  Have a great day.   Talk soon.  Anthony"
good,"It was always a very fast paced environment, but it did make the day fly by. You were constantly running from making drinks, making the food, taking orders in drive thru and at the same time trying to keep a smile on your face.  It did make it helpful having the customers that we did. It made working there that much better."
good,The job has great benefits but the management and work environment leaves much more to be desired. Initially I enjoyed the job relative to all of my previous work experience unfortunately for me I was awakened to the true potential of much more professional jobs and after taking a shift so much stress has compounded from the work environment raging from the change of management and the loss of interest that I decided to drop the occupation entirely.
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for, just had a couple managers that made my time not good so I decided to leave. It's chaotic when you are under staffed especially if you work in a major busy city. But with the right management it's enjoyable and a fun, good easy job."
good,"The day mostly involves working on the till or behind the bar, with occasional time spent cleaning tables and getting additional stock.I was on an 8 hour contract but ended up working well over this as we were under staffed which was hard for me as I was still at school but may be great for other people. The team were lively and friendly and were always willing to help me when I was confused as they were much more experienced than me. I would say the most enjoyable part is working behind the till as you get to engage with the customers, and I learned a lot about customer service and expectations working this job."
good,"I worked at the Starbucks inside Meijer, meaning we didn't get all the same benefits the standalone Starbucks employees got. We were paid less, but above minimum wage. We weren't allowed to accept tips because it was unfair to the other employees inside Meijer. Although many people offered us tips, it was most unenjoyable to turn those down. We were always understaffed, meaning more work for those of us who were working. My favorite part of the job was making the drinks and talking to some of the customers."
good,Great set up with training and great work ethic. I was so glad to have been able to learn the things i did about coffees heritage. Made new friends and made great relationships.
good,"Starbucks is best company I've ever worked for on a macro scale, but on a micro scale it is filled with all of the BS that you get any other fast food-esque location. Pressure from corporate creates unrealistic standards for district and store managers, which obviously trickles down onto the store associates. As a result, you're always understaffed + overwhelmed."
good,"Starbucks is a awesome company ... when it wants to be . You have to be dedicated to their needs and availability. Honestly, not enough time to deal with personal life."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for while in high school, pay is not the best but the company is extremely flexible with availability. You meet great people, they have school available and great stock programs."
good,"Was a great place to work at until new management stepped in. Forced people out of her store, refused to promote those including myself who were in the process. She was extremely unkind to workers, even going so far as to call me stupid a number of times. Partner resources did close to nothing following my complaints, but aside from the new manager stepping in, my Starbucks store was enjoyable to work at."
good,It was decent should've been paid more for the area. It was a very small space to work in as well. I wish we could receive tips and get a free drink everyday but alas only corporate Starbucks can do that.
good,"Starbucks is a fun and easygoing workplace. It can get busy and understaffed because I work in a drive-thru store. They tend to pay more attention to morning team than closing team because of drive-thru times so it often feels like I'm running around during evenings. Overall it's a fair workplace, chill and fun with a great, supportive team."
good,"This job could be a dream or a nightmare, depending on the Store Manager."
good,"I became a Starbucks Barista to expand my experience, & also to experience a fast paced environment & to get the feel of fast paced work I also wanted to try something new to see if I liked it or not"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a quick paced place to work. There is a variety of personalities and cultural backgrounds working at Starbucks, which makes it a fun place to work. There is more than just making coffee and drinks. There is a lot to learn and know for things to run smoothly."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They offer tuition reimbursement, and flexible hours for college students. However, the store I was in was frequently understaffed and the manager was hard to reach regarding everyday concerns."
good,"The culture is often really good, and you get highs when you interact with customers and others you work with. "
good,"Very very corporate but fun, great coworkers, easy flexibility, regulars that you could develop relationships with, strict break schedules, lots and lots of coffee!"
good,The environment is fun and great but the benefits and hours suck. Management is not that great and if you have dirty sloppy coworkers it can be hard. Not much advancement if you don’t suck up
good,None to really say Starbucks is a good place to work just wish the pay rate reflected on the amount of work you do there. Should be above the minimum for baristas and and way more for shift supervisors.
good,"I had a fantastic team behind me that made working there almost feel like I wasn't working. Management left much to be desired but hey, thats most corporate companies. The incessant need to badger the staff into delivering their script in order to boost sales on minimum wage was absurd. Show the faces of the actual company a little respect and give them proper wages."
good,"Working at Starbucks depends on the day. There are days that it's super stressful and there are other days where it's great. There are some customers that act as though they are more deserving of others, that they have a sense of entitlement. That's never fun to deal with."
good,Something you will always hear at Starbucks is the only thing consistent is change. They are one of the most innovative companies in their industry. The most enjoyable part of the job is FREE coffee!
good,Working in the kiosk of a safeway was very chill and easy. I closed alone most evenings and with regular customers coming every day its usually chill. The craziest it got was back when they had only one happy hour a day for like one week only.
good,I would highly recommend this job to anyone who could deal with the stress and physical demand of this job.Being able to make connections with your coworkers as well as customers is the most rewarding part of the job.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for almost 2 years and for the most part it was a good job. Some days it would be very slow and other very fast past so if you like jobs like that, Starbucks is your place."
good,"A typical day at work really depended on what time of the day you did work. In the mornings, it was fast past and everything had to be spot on so that we could reach a speed goal at the window. So it could have been quite stressful. However, it really does matter who you worked with in the morning. That could make or break the morning rush. Around lunchtime, it was much more calm. Regulars came in for a casual talk. It was a great experience. Then around 3 pm to 6 pm, we had a rush we called ""kid rush"" because the location was next to a high school, middle school, and elementary. During promotions, it was chaotic. It really should be considered as a holiday pay, if we work during frappuccino hour. Overall, I learned what it takes to run a business, train, and marketing. Management was well ran. The only issue I had with was the store manager. He wasn't all that bad but he was very indecisive and he would tell me that he will get me an interview and promote me to supervisor if I decided to stay but never really kept his end of the deal."
good,"I like the people, I just didn't like the way everything was being treated like numbers on a page. You have to be faster at register, but if you make a mistake because you're going to fast on register that's logged and you get in trouble if that number gets too high. I don't mean messing up a drink either, i mean clicking the wrong button and then fixing it immediately. That's logged. And i got told that i could be fired for that because that means ""I'm not listening to the customer properly."" Well, what happens when a customer changes their order? Do I get in trouble for that, too? I got timed doing dishes, doing floors, cleaning bars, doing rtd. That's no way to work."
good,It's not the most glamorous job in the world but I had fun coworkers and flexible hours. It could have been so much worse so I consider it a good job.
good,"I actually really enjoyed Starbucks. This was where I first got to take on a leadership role, and they set people up for it really well. You get to fowm good bonds with the people you work with, and at the end of the day....it's all just coffee."
good,"it was fine, the management didn't really care about the staff just the quick pace of everything. Pay is not bad but the waiting period before a raise is too long."
good,"I have been working for Starbucks for five years while i have gone to college. During this time, i have worked my way up to a supervisor position. The work is fast paced and requires excellent communication. the benefits are great if you are looking to invest in stocks, retire, or have access to healthcare and education."
good,L'aspect le plus difficile de mon poste était le fait que je ne buvais plus de café convenablement parce que j'étais plus occupé à satisfaire le client.
good,"A lovely company, friendly and team work oriented environment, and very fast paced. I was able to get to know customers on a first name basis and their orders. Connecting with the community."
good,Starbucks is great and I love that you can work anywhere in the world with their many locations. I moved states and transferred 3 times with Starbucks. Management however can be great or awful and it really affects the job. It’s a hit or miss whether you’ll get a good manager. Benefits are great but they hire outside the company a lot for management roles
good,"I worked there for 6 years, I worked my way up from a barista to a store manager within 3 years. The staff was difficult however my District Manager was great."
good,"Starbuck is an awesome company that values their employees. It was unfortunate that my career goals within the company was not supported by my last manager. That will not stop me from supporting the company or recommending it as a place to work, though! The benefits are almost endless. This was also a GREAT place to work while going to college full time. I am very blessed to have had the opportunity to work for this company for two years."
good,Was a decent place to work while in between IT jobs.The people i worked with were friendly and helpful and it was nice severing and seeing regulars in the area.
good,"Definitely not something I would want to do forever, but gave me a lot of great communication and team-work experience. Starbucks has great benefits, so I would recommend them highly as a fun, not-super-serious job."
good,"fun fast paste easy to get and very fun with the right coworkersn/a "
good,"awesome place to work and energetic and fun staff."
good,Offers good benefits and flexible schedule. Ability to move up in company. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet great people and customers.
good,"Every store has it's own little ""culture"" depending on the people who work there. Stores with a busy drive-through can be stressful during rush-hour, but overall a fun place to work."
good,I really enjoyed working here but the pay was not good enough for me because on how much effort I put in during work but other then that working at Starbucks can be a handful
good,"It was a fine job. no complaints. My second favorite place i've worked. I mean, it's Starbucks. You kind of know what you're getting into. So go for it if you want!"
good,Management will assure you that you are welcome and will guide you all throughout. Coworkers are like friends. Hardest part of the job is when the planner program starts.
good,"Very well-coordinated and efficient methods of running the store involving separate positions and jobs in one small area. Poor and illegal actions of management causing people to leave the company. Best part was benefits and fast-paced environment, worst part was coworkers and bosses"
good,"You have to put up with the following:"
good,"Good working environment very fast paced, and always busy. Teaches and makes you work hard and deliver to quality standards in a fast paced environment. Teaches very good customer service, and good company that looks out for their employees."
good,"Helped me grow a lot... offers many benefits such as 401K, stock, spotify and college education. Also had large amounts of turn over ( I worked at store near a college campus) so allowed for major networking."
good,"Lavoro di squadra, rotazione delle mansioni, massima attenzione al cliente"
good,"Starbucks was a good company to work for, however it really seems biased. If you work here, and you are republican or conservative, refuse from talking about it at work. Management was awful, unqualified, but you have to work for them so you should do your best anyways."
good,"The benefits of working at Starbucks include excellent insurance (health, dental, and vision), even for part-time employees, tuition reimbursement, and plenty of free drinks and meals."
good,Enjoyed working at kroger but not very much the starbucks part not quick at learning the drinks... loved the coworkers but would like to experience something within cashier or stock or click list
good,I worked there until I could further my nursing career.  I knew the company was very flexible with student school schedules.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with and making customer connections every day.
good,I found working for this company to be fun but after a while I was segregated due to being pregnant and my manager didn't like the fact that I was so I resigned due to the early birth of my daughter
good,Management was wonderful and coworkers were great. It was a super fun place to work and I really loved it. The pay was just not enough to cover my bills at the time.
good,"Great place, awesome benefits. Too politically correct/corporate. Met some amazing people. Was not a fan of the drive thru or quality of the coffee. The attitude of some baristas was a bit much to handle."
good,"Very fast pace job depending on location worked at. Great benefits, but stressful overall. The company tries to foster a culture of inclusivity and community, and does a fairly good job at it."
good,"It was an overall good place to work, fast paced and always moving. I didn't feel like barista, as it was more cleaning and stocking than making drinks. Morning shifts were better than night shifts. The employees were decent. But there was a lot of employee drama."
good,"Very fast paced. Given several tasks to do at a time as well as assisting customers. Some days were overwhelming. Enjoyed my coworkers, they made it fun."
good,"Working for Starbucks looks great on your resume. It's a fast paced environment that gives you plenty of worthwhile skills. I wouldn't say that working there was the best job I've ever had - they need a lot of help with management styles and employee support. While employed at Starbucks me and my coworkers were often the recipients of verbal abuse and threat of physical violence by customers who were consistently told by Starbucks that they are always right. Starbucks' motto for employees was ""just say yes"". No matter what a customer did to us we were expected to make it right for them. I've seen drinks thrown at us, employees spat on, and customers waiting outside for us. Not once did we feel supported by Starbucks in terms of our safety or well-being."
good,"A fast paced, stressful, exhausting, short staffed job. Free coffee, free food on breaks, make a lot of friends and decent money. I love the job but hate what it has become. I have worked several stores over the ages and I miss the slower cafe feel and I despise the fast paced drive thru GIMME NOW it has become. Casinos have their own ups and downs. I have never worked for one inside a grocery store."
good,I do not wish to review Starbucks. I learned how to make coffee and how to deal with difficult customers. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment.
good,The benefits were great. It was very quick paced and you have several number 1 priorities to accomplish. Every metric is measured. It was nice to be a part of the community.
good,I worked at Starbucks straight out of University. It was a great learning experience and my co-workers made the work go by fast. It is a fast-paced environment in which you will encounter a grumpy customer here and there. But after they get a scone and a hot cup of coffee those customers aren't so bad. The company is wonderful! They give health care to part-time and full-time employees.
good,It was good job while in college because I needed something to support for college but not something i could do full-time and also not something id recommend to others for fulltime
good,"I love working at Starbucks since it provides me with a place to communicate, either with customers or partners. However, as an engineering student, this is just a temporary job for me. It does not fit my career plan."
good,The company has flexible hours so it is a great job to work at while you are going to school. Starbucks also offers a lot of benefits such as spotify memberships and tuition reimbursement for ASU online.
good,"Good place to work, laid back, decent pay. Management was great. Good coworkers. Hardest part was waking up. Easiest part was getting off early. Learned what customers were nice."
good,"Starbucks was a wonderful workplace and did live up to the promised culture of friendship. However, the fast pace environment of morning rushes and promotional sales are not for everyone. When you have a strong team they are fun though! This company is a nice way to make ends meet, but doesn't offer enough to make a career out of for most."
good,"Good environment for a fast paced environment.  A decent part time job.  The menu, however is at times overwhelming.  But my coworkers were all friendly"
good,It was fun working as a barrista but once you reach supervisor level the store kind of owns your schedule. Managers seem to have little free or personal time and are always on call for emergencies. Your experience really depends on your manager though. I had one manager that was all about the people there and work experience and store culture was great. I had another who was driven by numbers and the store was divided and stressful.
good,Good job for students. Lots of standing and can be slow but very fast pace during the morning rush. Tips are fair. People can be very rude if you mess up their drink. And very picky on who they want to make their things. Same with how they pay for their drinks.
good,"Aprendí a gestionar un grupo de personas multicultural para servir a un público apurado y cambiante a lo largo del día, siempre manteniendo el más alto estandard de servicio, limpieza y buen humor."
good,Starbucks was by far my favorite job I have ever had. You have so much fun at work while getting to make a lifetime bond with your coworkers. The only downside was not being able to call in if you were sick as a shift supervisor. Shift supervisors in my opinion did not have enough benefits to take on that role. This was the only reason I left the company. I felt once I made it to supervisor there was really no other way to grow within the company. I will always cherish the time I had working for this wonderful company!
good,This is a very fun job. It is a fast pace environment that continued to challenge daily. Great employee benefits. Would definitely recommend this company to those that need a very flexible job.
good,"It is great to interact with customers and get to know them, and how to make great lattes, if you like a fast passed environment I highly recommend trying out Starbucks."
good,I liked the people I worked with here but management could have been more understanding. They need to adjust some of their management styles to better suit the work environment but I liked that they encourage their staff to improve and move up in the company.
good,It was pretty cool that when I worked mornings the whole team on the floor was engaged in conversation with each other and the customer. it made work a bit more fun and a lot more productive. it also build a relationship with the staff the customers.
good,it was fun to work at but if you have a bad manager it could be miserable. I liked that you could get free drinks. I really liked my  coworkers they were always fun to work with. it can be tiring when you have a large line and short staffed.
good,Starbucks is a great company and I enjoyed working there but the environment can be stressful and the workers are underpaid. The benefits are great but a barista position is a stepping stone for people.
good,"great to see when regulars come back/in and to get to talk to them and keep up to date, with their lives and make new friends. management would always, stop by to check up on you to see if you needed anything. hardest part was the rushes when you were alone but, the most enjoyable part was when you got to work with people that you know."
good,"It was a great experience. Met a lot of a new people with great stories. There is always something to do, so you will never be bored. The hardest part of the job, is when not everyone wants to help each other out. Overall, it was a fun job, made good friends and memorable moments."
good,"I have developed high productive, time management, conflict managing, project management. Manages the cash-flow ensuring tills were balanced at £300 in the morning and closing shifts."
good,Fast paced job. Learned how to provide excellent customer service. Hardest part of the job was when we had promotions. Most enjoyable was meeting new people.
good,"Working for Star Bucks I was able to quickly learn how to make drinks and take orders. At first it was intimidating but its easy to pick up. Star Bucks also offers health care, Stock options, and 401k with little to no qualifications needed. They also help pay for schooling too!"
good,"I loved working for this company. I learned a lot about myself, my community, coffee and leadership. It's a really supportive workplace and they give you the tools necessary to be successful if you are passionate about retails sales and coffee."
good,"This is not a job I can imagine working forever or even wanting to work for more than a few years. Getting out of college, it's a good way to pay off loans."
good,You are a partner not an employee. When you are hired you are not just someone who works FOR Starbucks but you work WITH Starbucks. They are very customer oriented.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers and simple jobs assigned to me. The company Sodexo that my location was under was often unfair and treated workers poorly, but it didn't hinder my Starbucks experience."
good,"The company and the culture are great, but the management is what really makes the difference. There are good ones and there are bad ones, it's just the luck of your draw."
good,"if the people around you are good its a dream job otherwise its just an average customer service/sales associate position, they offer mental health coverage which is kind of unheard of"
good,I worked and loved Starbucks as an employee and customer but my kiosk was managed very poorly which caused me to leave abruptly. I still am a loyal customer and would love to be an employee again
good,"Licensed Stores follow their own rules. The one located on the UCSD Campus did not allow tips and our benefits were really lower/removed. We were just as, if not busier than a normal drive through due to all of the student foot traffic in the center of campus. Despite all of this we were treated the same as any other student worker."
good,"The Starbucks work environment is largely dependent on your direct leadership. Although all stores share similar standards, your specific store management typically determines the environment"
good,The customers and the connections you make with them are the most rewarding parts of the job. While working for Starbucks I have learn many different skill sets. From being able to run a Drive-Thru by myself to strengthening my customer service and leadership skills.
good,"Good environment to work in, helpful coworkers, quality ingredients. Could be better organized regarding orders and other more clerical tasks. overall pretty solid"
good,"This was one of my very first jobs and I loved it. The manager was sweet, the customers were nice (except for the occasional misfit) and I loved being there. I’m still sad that I had to quite due to schoolwork, but I loved the job through and through."
good,lack of advancement and poor management made me want to leave. working different shifts wasn't ideal. 3:30 in the morning sucks. tips are nice but you tip share so if you work in the evening you do less work but get tipped equally. if you get with nice people it makes the job much more enjoyable.
good,"Over 2 and 1/2 years at starbucks, I've had the chance to work predominantly at 2 different locations (both in Chicago), but have covered shifts at 7 or 8 other locations. Some are relaxed, fun, and collaborative. Some are a living nightmare. In a company with hundreds of thousands of employees, everyone's mileage will vary. I think I lucked out--decent managers, busy but not difficult work, and being asked to train other baristas are all parts I appreciate. Plus, I've saved roughly $300 in Spotify premium memberships. However, the frustrating lack of communication from store-level to corporate is enough to make anyone want to drown themselves in a vat of hot coffee. From where I began to now, the number of things we are expected to accomplish grows, while the number of people we can have working shrinks. We get handed absurd limited-time drinks that require more and more complexity and specialty equipment to create, and added to our already-sprawling repertoire of drinks, are ridiculously complex--not to mention being leagues away from what anyone might call ""coffee culture"". Fewer partners, fewer labor hours to go around, more work and more rules about dropping everything to address a customer (instead of....perhaps....making drinks for the hundreds of OTHER customers) are all frustrating and seemingly unstoppable as corporate does not honor our requests or needs at a store or a district level. If you want a job that will teach you to stay calm under pressure, handle the worst of the worst in customer service, and how to craft a halfway-decent cup of coffee, Starbucks is great."
good,Must have lots of energy for this job! It can get stressful at times when it gets busy and there is always something to clean/stock/make so there really is no down time.
good,"Starbucks is a very good place to work if you are looking for a quick, involved work environment. You learn a lot of interesting things and receive wonderful benefits through Starbucks."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working at my Starbucks. I have met some of my best friends through work, and have created valued connections with customers who come in often. The benefits have also allowed me to further my education and advance toward my goals."
good,"if the pay rate was better to the cost of living, and for all they make you do, it would be totally worth it. good job to start at for entry level work."
good,"Very fast paced environment with a lot of stuff to remember! The drinks can be pretty hard to get used to making because there are so many and lots of steps. They do a good job training, though!"
good,"It's tough to learn all the drink recipes, there's a lot of them.  It really takes practice and practice, if your shift supervisor decides to give you bar time.  A lot of the job though is cleaning and keeping things stocked."
good,i enjoyed working with a team and interacting with customers on a daily. it helps improve your intrapersonal skills and helps you learn how to handle stress
good,I like working here thje enviorment is relaxed and enjoyable . i love making coffee and my customers. The managment is really cool and my co workers are awesome .
good,Good workplace if you really have the passion for coffee. You will be learning every detail about coffee from history up to the cup itself. Hardest part of the job is the shifting of schedule. Sometimes I can't have a work life balance.
good,"typically flexible. Usually very busy but doable. Sometimes the managment is rough, and needs work but that could be found anywhere. Free coffee on shift is amazing."
good,Working for Starbucks was a good first job. Although the management can do way better to make sure their partners are secure at the job. And the pay needs to be changed as for living in Florida the price gouging is making poverty level ppl stay there
good,"I worked at several different stores and each one was different environment. I would recommend Starbucks as a job to work at if you are flexible with schedules (example: don't have a preference on days or night shifts), college student, or as a part time job for the weekends. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the weekend rushes and working through unexpected circumstances like running out of products such as one size of cups or being low on milk until the truck shows up. My most enjoyable parts of working for Starbucks was my coworkers and seeing people smile when you handed them their drink."
good,Stabucks offers good benefit packages after 3 months of employment. They packages are easily affordable and the coverage is very good. They also offer fair hours for working and their schedule allows for a wide range of shifts to choose.
good,Depending on your store it can either be a very stressful time or an easy time. My store is very fast paced with a lot of business people but knowing your regulars makes it a little more rewarding.
good,the management give great support. working hours are frustrating at times. some customers can be challenging but great if you enjoy a challenge. Good team always helps
good,"With a fast-pace and lots of customers, it can be a stressful environment. However, Starbucks ensures you're trained properly and are surrounded by those who want to support your growth and success!"
good,"decent part time job, keep you under 30 hours so they don't have to pay benefits. making coffee was fun, dress code was cool. allowed you to express your personal style, more comfortable"
good,"I learned that no matter what we do as an employee, there will always be customers that will never be satisfied. The workplace was  7 out of 10 times a fast pace and moderate stressful environment. The most enjoyable part was definitely working with a fun group of people."
good,"Like any place, there were people who didn't to talk to the customers politely always spread negativity where whoever they could because they were miserable dealing with what they had to deal with on a daily basis. On the other hand, I had the best time o my life there because not only do you have the agency to do what ever you want, you can move up pretty quickly if you're into the culture. It can be a very fun place to be."
good,Starbucks truly cares about its partners. It's the customers that make the job suck. It's also difficult to move up in the company. Favoritism and nepotism are prominent.
good,"Starbucks can be an amazing job. However people ordering coffee are the worst part of the experience. Also, it was impossible to find flexibility with no one ever wanting to trade shifts and a shift mananger who wouldn’t look at requests."
good,I enjoyed my time with the company but mainly grew frustrated with a lack of growth and development.The company provides great benefits such as tuition reimbursement and free drinks and coffee as well as exceptional healthcare.
good,"Days are always busy, you can never count on your coworkers for actual assistance unless you've established friendships, favoritism is huge with managers whether they admit to it or not. Make sure to pay attention at training because none of it will make sense and no one cares to review it with you until you fail. People will always try to sneak you out of free drinks because you made it ""wrong"". Hardest part is dealing with peak and having to do cycle. Best part is that you get (1) free food item for lunch and gain weight while working."
good,"As far as I can tell, standalone Starbucks' have better pay, better benefits, better atmosphere, and more engaged management. Starbucks' within Targets always seem to be chronically understaffed (making it literally impossible for the employees on shift to accomplish everything required of them so they end up being encouraged to cut corners), poorly run, and frequently understocked. That was my experience with my Target Starbucks job."
good,"I developed great skills while interacting with customers, leadership was always fantastic. This is a place I would always return to work for because of how much I learned"
good,It was amazing to work in such a busy and productive work environment but it became stressful very quickly. I had a great time interacting with customers but there were times that the managers were disorganized.
good,"If you're looking to work at Starbucks be willing to be a quick learner but it comes with great benefits. Starbucks comes with its perks but its formed off of this robotic nice act to put on, not truly learning and bonding with the costumer."
good,went through 3 different managers in 3 years so management is not perfect. hardest part of the job is getting enough hours to live comfortably. definitely a good job for a college student.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for as a starter job. However, the pay is low considering all we are expected to do. Raises are given yearly but are very low. Also, job enjoyment depends heavily on management. One manager I had was amazing and made my Starbucks experience amazing. The last two made working with Starbucks close to misery."
good,Working at Starbucks was very fun although management at the store I worked at seemed to be fairly disorganized and the turnover for employees was very fast.
good,"A typical day at work consists of interacting with lots of customers and making drinks or working the drivethru window. Most Starbucks employees are high-energy and friendly. "
good,"I loved my years with Starbucks! I loved my partners and customers like family! I appreciated the career advancement and management training they offered. The compensation package was excellent. In the end, I did feel exhausted by the extreme focus on repeatable routines and efficiency (AKA micromanagement). It became hard to appreciate the customers. Engaging customers became a ""umhum...okay...sure...NEXT!"" situation. None the less, my decision to go back to school was leading me in a new direction; so it was time to move Onward."
good,"-if you work well in a fast pace environment this is the place to work, especially now with more stores being a drive thru than cafe. Most partners are either veterans (3-10 years) or new hires."
good,"Fun enjoyable work environment"
good,"Starbucks allows its employees to move up in the company when positions are available, but currently there are none open in my district. As a supervisor, I was given the chance to learn many different managerial skills to help my coworkers succeed whenever they come in to work. I am thankful for all I have learned from my position here. However, my manager and district manager do not treat their employees like they should. My district manager manages with fear and my manager is inconsistent and doesn't communicate at all with her employees."
good,Always alot of fun and engaging customers as well as coworkers.Never a dull moment as there is always something to do in the store. Had alot of regulars who would remeber you by name the better you treated them.
good,My overall experience at Starbucks was a pretty decent one. Towards the end of my time there the work atmosphere changed and I felt like I had just grown out of my position there. It all depends on the location of the Starbucks where you work.
good,"- friendly atmosphere to work"
good,"A normal day at work for me starts early, but I personally like waking up earlier in order to get off work earlier in the day. I personally think the pay could be better, but not bad for a part time job."
good,Overall I worked with some people who were really hard to get along with. My manager was alright but along with being hard to talk to he had his head up in the clouds lol
good,"It is a great place for teens, but not someone who has a family, real bills or a life to maintain. Or as a part time job. But for what they pay and for what you have to go through I would proceed with caution. It is a great place to work to meet others but not for long time employment"
good,"Starbuck was a fun temporary job. the amount of traffic the my location had they could've pay was better then what they have. "
good,It was my first job and I could say that I had so much fun being a barista yet it challenging. The salary is kinda low. The partners are incredible and awesome
good,"You learn to work and play a bit at work here. It's hard work, busy, but with a good team a lot of fun. If your manager empowers your team even better. I had a couple grad degree's but I needed this job to survive. I'm grateful for the opportunity when no one else would hire me because I was over qualified."
good,Fast paced but overall enjoyable. Once you get the hang of things the job becomes easier and less stressful. Some of the workers are a little bit sketch.
good,"It's not an easy job dealing with the volume of customers you do, but the company itself gives you a lot. ...Including some great friendships along the way."
good,"The customer and fellow employee interactions can be quite rewarding.  Like most jobs, failures at management, almost exclusively, negatively affect lower level employees.   Working at a bad store will leave resolutions out of your grasp at entry level positions.  Many of the stores I worked at were great, but a few were horribly mismanaged.  If the pastry display and lunch food is constantly missing items, do not apply to that store.  This is one indicator of a manager you will learn to rue."
good,I had a difficult time going to work and school because i was at school 5 days a week pretty much all day. They were very nice but it was to much to remember all the drinks.
good,"Overall I feel the company valued it's employees. The workplace is pretty supportive, relatively diverse and fun.  The hardest part is how early Starbucks opens, but it was still a fun job."
good,The job was not very difficult and the co workers were awesome. I had no problem with Starbucks management. It was Huber’s that kept interfering makining the job difficult
good,"Starbucks allowed me the opportunity to work on my own schedule which was nice, but I had developed a foot condition as a consequence of working there. This made my work unenjoyable, but I did my best work there and kept a healthy attitude. This job taught me complete patience."
good,I had a great time working at Starbucks. I always felt that i was growing and my team was very supportive. Also management was very involved in the the teams progress.
good,"Greeting customers, fixing drinks, working also as a cashier, keeping the work place environment clean, restocking as needed. "
good,"I love working at Starbucks; however, it can really wear down on you like many customer service jobs do.   The customers are demanding, some are friendly.  It all depends on the store you work at, the business it has, how supportive your management is and how well staffed it is."
good,"While I may not be in agreement with the company's policies now, when I worked for Starbucks, it was my first job and the company helped me grow into a supervisor position at a young age. I appreciate the opportunities given to me."
good,"I worked at a very unique Starbucks location but I noticed that at any good store they tried to promote teamwork as one of the most important aspects of the workplace. "
good,"Its a fun environment if you have a good team."
good,The store was normally very busy. The line was usually very long.  The staffing was normally well done but tended to be short-staffed from time-to-time.
good,"It should be all about the people--it eventually becomes all about the numbers and money, like any other business.  "
good,"have to use cash register to take orders. warm up food in oven, write names and drinks on cups. make drinks. sweep and mop, take out trash, wipe down everything. have great customer service"
good,When I worked there my co workers and I didn't feel valued no matter how much time or effort we put into the company.  The manager did not care about anything as long as he met his goal. The theory of working at Starbucks was great but I believe the culture began to deteriorate the further down management went.
good,"Eu amei trabalhar em Los Angeles, era bom, aprendi a fazer bebida, foi tranquilo"
good,"Basic job nothing special to it really, but they treat workers poorly sometimes and the pay is not something you can live off of. The customers are terrible"
good,I worked for a non corporate  store inside of a university so I don't have the best information for this job but I did enjoy my job and didn't have any issues
good,"Starbucks was a fantastic place to build skills, while studying at a post-secondary institution. Great place for fostering relationships and connections with partners across the region and networking with guests."
good,starbucks was a great job I would love to attend to again in my lifetime. learned a lot when it came to working with others and having more patients with others .
good,"My co-workers are awesome but, we had a really bad manager for a long time and even though multiple people quit because of him it took them over a year to get rid of him. We are short staffed a lot due to a certain amount of hours our manager is allowed to assign which results in poor customer service. Some customers make your day though."
good,"Starbucks gave me a lot of practice on my pokerface while dealing with difficult interactions. It taught me to recognize my position in the company and still advocate for change. If I didn't have to cohesive team to work with, I probably would have not worked here as long. Benefits are great, Medical, dental, vision, but difficult to afford the level of care needed and a living wage."
good,"The work experience depends on management. "
good,This was a good job. The hours were sometimes difficult (ex. opening at 4 am). My co-workers were really fun and challenged me to do well while creating an enjoyable environment
good,Working at starbucks was great. The benefits to working there were well worth the pay. I grew to love my working family. I made so many friends and learned so much about running a floor. the hardest part was dealing with he customers.
good,"It's not a terribly difficult job by any stretch of the imagination but it will put your customer service and food service standards to the test. If you can hunker down and remain professional, prompt and focused at all times then you will be rewarded. Just work at it, simple as that really."
good,"Working for Starbucks is definitely recommended if you are a student, looking for a job, or would like some experience. Work environment is very fast paced during rushes. You will be eaten alive if you cant keep up with the pace. Your experience at Starbucks is heavily influenced by your store manager. I didn't have any problems with management but I've seen other employees being mistreated."
good,Starbucks was a small little area to work with but it had a lot of coffee options you could choose from which was the fun thing about Starbucks plus you were able to try all the drinks that are offered to serve for the customers happiness that coffee brings them to enjoy.
good,Great first job for any high school/college student. A place to learn teamwork and problem solving amongst a diverse team and customers. Would recommend highly.
good,"location and manager changes everything. i had a bad manager and it was awful. pay is okay, tips help. location means a lot, customers affect work day."
good,"Productive, fast paced environment. Stressful at times but overall a fun day at work. Terrible management but that has since been handled.  Would recommend to a friend."
good,Very hectic but rewarding experience which can be enhanced or inhibited by management. The learning curve can be steep but the culture of the store is amazing.
good,"A good job for younger people looking to learn how corporate structure works, and how to navigate it. The pay is fair for the industry, but the work continues to become more stressful as the company grows and attempts to please shareholders and in the process continue to give partners more tasks with less compensation and smaller staffs to assist in the day to day operation."
good,I had a good time working at Starbucks and may look to work there sometime in the future. I ended up leaving mostly for education reasons and disagreements with the manager
good,"Overall, working for Starbuck's was a fun experience. I learned a lot about beverages and different ways to make orders. A typical day included taking, processing and making customer orders, opening and closing the store, cash handling and till counting and customer service. The workplace was very fast-paced and well maintained. The hardest part of the job was remembering so many orders when the store was completely full of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new drinks and meeting the customers."
good,"Great company with good morals and great benefits. Treat management partners and above really well as far as pay structure and bonuses. Lower positions do not get the pay they deserve. Once you get to management there is a real struggle to keep a work-life balance. As with any food-service or retail position there are challenges that come with the territory. If you have experience in this field and understand what is required of you this is a fantastic company, but work seeps into your personal life constantly. It feels like you are always on-call. There are a lot of changes that you are expected to implement with little support. The very high ups seem disconnected from what actually occurs in stores on a daily basis."
good,I loved working for Starbucks as a company. It’s fast paced and stressful at times but most of the employees help to make the experience better. Had an experience with a bad manager that hindered my experience but that varies from location
good,I’ve worked for the company twice it was great overall. Hours are never set unless you have a second job. Training is a long process. Learning the job once you get the hang of it is less stressful. Its a family oriented environment
good,Starbucks has slowly gone downhill. I love what it stands for but everybody gets the same annual raise so it's not performance based. Management has been a little weird for me but that's everywhere you go. It's more like a McDonald's of coffee shops. They don't care too much about coffee knowledge/culture and that's why they're stopping the Coffee Master program.
good,"-Working as a Team/Team work is important"
good,"Working here has always been very fun and easy. The job itself is fairly simple, can be done by most. Coworkers became close friends. A great job for students."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, however, I worked under a few bad managers who ultimately helped me decide to leave and pursue my educated career choice."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. I was able to learn so much about coffee, and there was a very thorough training! I just hated my location's management."
good,"The environment friendly,  fast past during rush hour. I learned customer service. The hardest part of the job is when we were under staff. My manager was great she was very helpful."
good,"It would be me and 2 other people from 1 to 9 p.m and that caused us to work very fast ,very efficient and work well together. The management wasn't what it was supposed to be. She need up putting her hands on a co-worker of mine and that's where I drew the line."
good,"Good place to work, always good atmosphere and partners are helping as much as they can."
good,"It would be very difficult to move up, hours are decent but we get short shifts. We are always busy and sometimes without a decent amount of staff. You are always learning a lot, especially at first, but after a while it can get old. However, with great coworkers it can be an awesome job."
good,"Management was great, helpful, and supportive. I learned how to make schedules, control labor, and different coffees and lattes. The hours were the only issue I had. Early morning shifts began to be harder and harder."
good,"I will always appreciate this time in my voyage. I learned so much about customer service and what I want in life. I also learned how important upbeat, organized leaders are in a business!"
good,"A typical day was very productive: we would prepare drinks and food, perform cleaning tasks, and entertain customers. I learned a majority of my leadership skills at this job and a lot of team building qualities. The hardest part of the job is having to keep your area clean while trying to be as quick as possible for customer convenience. I really enjoyed working with such kind-hearted, patient, and thoughtful people."
good,"O dia de trabalho é bem movimentado, uma vez que localizada no shopping, a entrada e saída de clientes é constante. A gerência sempre tendo uma boa administração, buscando o equilíbrio dentre os colaboradores e suas vidas pessoais, trabalhando sempre com motivação e gratificação para manter os ""partners"" motivados e satisfeitos. Aprendi muito sobre a a historia do café e afins, aprendi a trabalhar com o publico e a gostar disso também. O mais chato de trabalhar é com certeza é o horário."
good,"Typical Starbucks job. Shift supervisor does not receive tips like regular baristas, a lot more responsibilities and not too much of a pay difference."
good,Not a horrible working environment. But you don't get paid enough for what we do especially if you work in the mornings whenever it gets busier. I feel that it is a great job for a high-school student trying to work a livable wage.
good,"PROs:"
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks and tell all young people that they should apply there for the benefits. I don't however think it is a long term job for someone with a family in certain areas. When I went back down to a shift manager I had to pick up shifts serving to make up the money I needed to make. It was tough. I do think they offer amazing benefits that I miss on a regular basis.
good,To work here you need to have a lot of focus. It is a very fast paced job. There is a great deal of team work that takes places with the employees. Overall a great place to work.
good,"Starbucks as a company treats their employees fairly. We are compensated for travel to other stores for our mileage, we receive tips each week, and our benefits we choose from are fantastic. They provide many opportunities for personal advancement through education and community involvement. The work environment can be stressful but it depends on the team and management."
good,i love working at starbucks. it is fun and easy and i look forward to going every day. however the only way to make a good living there is if you are higher in the company. the discount is always good though
good,"All sales positions; all demonstrated different workplace cultures--really learned something from all the places I worked--but MetLIfe Auto and Home, I worked the longest and learned the most about Personal Insurance."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place where to work, gives you the possibly to meet new people, make frienships and develop you as a professional and a team worker"
good,Could have been better. The management was seriously poor. I was told one thing and then backstabbed by the manager. Lost my stock options. It did not bode well
good,"There is bad attitude in every store and the worst part is that supervisors and managers always work the baristas harder than anyone else. A lot of people get fired just because they are not liked, irrelevant to work."
good,"If you are a student, It’s great. If you want to survive your life with starbucks, wage is not enought to support you. Working times can be terible. Stressful job."
good,I had fun working at Starbucks because I got to know my customers. It's a giant family if you're willing to put the time into getting to know your customers.
good,Starbucks is a wonderful wemoyer that offers many great benefits and a fun work environment. It can get busy but it also provides relief in the form of breaks and food. Breaks are short and I believe workers should be paid more.
good,Starbucks nationally is an amazing coporation - to it's customers and partners!  I loved working for them for 10 years.  The only time you will have problems with the company will be if your store manager or district manager becomes a problem.  It has nothing to do with the overall corporate value!
good,"Starbucks was a decent place to work, just not capable of really satisfying my needs. I have a degree and wanted a job that actually represented my college degree. It's an alright job, but not for long term or for life. I know several people that can't seem to get out of that job."
good,"Overall I enjoy working for the company.  You really have the chance to connect with great people, both customers as well as partners.  The drinks can be fun to make and lively spirits can make it a great place to be.  However, when it comes to promotions, I believe the company should adopt a metric based promotion policy.  From my experience, promotions are based on the manager's discretion.  This has caused issues with partner morale because, typically more diligent partners are overlooked. Hopefully the company recognizes this issue and addresses it before loosing great employees."
good,"Think on your feet"
good,"a typical day at satrbucks was just like any regular day. I learned how to make different drinks and things. my manager was great and very understanding. the job was fairly easy, its all in leaning the menu. the most enjoyable part of the job for me was the tips and whipped cream."
good,"Great Company, The first few months can be stressful, must be willing to be a team player. During the winters hours can be greatly reduced, the overall very nice place to work."
good,Open extremely early everyday. very busy all the time there was hardly ever any down time to clean but we had to clean twice to three times a day everyday. we never closed not even on holidays. it is a year round job.
good,"Enjoyed my time there as a shift supervisor, had many responsibilities such as safe handeling, keyholding, daily ordering. Loved my experience working there, compensation was more than great but it is time to seek new opportunities for myself elsewhere."
good,"Management does nothing but participate in the drama, so if you can separate yourself from your work it’s ok. Also it can get really busy and stressful. The job itself is good though. Good pay and benefits. The health insurance is pretty good and free tuition is nice. Also free coffee."
good,"Working for Starbucks was overall a good experience. I worked with a great group of people who were friendly and helpful, and also made great customer connections. Although it could be stressful at times, I almost always went home feeling accomplished with the work I had done."
good,I worked at the Starbucks Roastery building in Capitol Hill for about 6 months. It is a great atmosphere to be in and an exciting experience to see the coffee process from start to finish.
good,"Parfait pour un job en temps partiel !"
good,"I liked working at Starbucks when I was just out of high school then I realized I couldn't make a career out of it. My manager was not a nice person and didn't work with us for when we wanted time off but it just depends on the manager you get, some are really nice. I recommend this job for young people or working moms and retired folks. It just wasn't a career for me I didn't make enough to support my family here. It was a great place to be while going to school with a flexible schedule."
good,"Meeting new people (customers) and crafting their drinks and pastries is always a delight. Even though during rush hours it maybe hectic, having coworkers that are supportive, reliable and supporting coworkers make the time go by a little smoother."
good,"Very flexible, and great company to work for. You get great perks like free drinks, as well as stocks with the company that you can either cash out every year or let it build through your time at starbucks."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are willing to put in the extra time.  If you get a good store manager who knows what they are doing and a good store location, and you love coffee culture but need better pay, this is totally the company for you.  But if you get a poor store manager, theres nothing that can be done about it.  Working as a barista under a poor store manager is less frustrating, but working as a shift supervisor (which is what I am) I basically do my store manager's work for him, and what he actually does he doesn't do well. My DM won't approve a transfer to another store, so I am stuck.  Just keep your head up and stay positive and keep working toward your goal because with this company, you have to be your own advocate."
good,"A typical day includes: brewing coffee, maintaining a clean lobby, restocking, performing cleaning tasks while assisting customers. I learned how to multi-task as well as handle high stressful situations. Management overall was good, had some issues with management showing favoritism towards specific employees. The hardest part about the job is keeping up with the fast-paced nature of serving customers drinks with several possibly modifications, as well as maintaining drink quality. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing repeat customers and being able to make their day by remembering their order or having their order done before they are done at the register."
good,"Definitely have to remember the what goes in the drinks. Every drink is different. But it’s the same routine to make them all. Imagine a line out the door, each person is ordering 3 drinks. And your more than likely one to a station, 2 on a lucky day."
good,"It was an intensive job, and there could have been better management at the store I was working at. Overall, I enjoyed my experience with my coworkers and made some lifelong friendships. Salary was acceptable for this type of job."
good,"During a normal workday, you either have the craziness of a morning rush, which will wake you up, even if you were the opener and got up at 3:00, or the immense lull of the afternoons and evenings.  The people were great, the managers solid.  The staff was turning over as I left, so who knows now."
good,"its nice working for Starbucks, more than everything you are very likely to find very nice people working there as well. My team was my family when I first got there and I had the best manager in the world. sadly for us she went on maternity leave. after that everyone was starting to look for a better job. everything was fine until the management changed and it got to be a very stressful job for a £1000 a month for a supervisor and less for a barista. for a student or for a part time job is more than fine, you will get your contracted hours, no more, maybe less if you wish so. My shop was in Central London and I loved working there, I loved the customers that were coming to the store, genuine nice and polite people."
good,"a great job to train yourself to work hard at a fast pace, complete multiple tasks at once, and take pride in your work while still having fun. Overall a learning experience."
good,"Starbucks is stressful and physically tiring at times, but they take care of their partners with better than average benefits- especially the ASU College Achievement Plan - and pretty frequent company-wide raises."
good,"Its really easy to develop close positive relationships with your coworkers, but the amount of effort you must put into your job is not reflected in your paycheck. Working her is not just about making drinks, it also involves ALOT OF CLEANING. But overall I definitely recommend working here, just don't stay too long."
good,"Constant work, overall fun but at times stressful. A lot of memorization. Competitive. A wide range of customer interactions. High standards. Great deal of teamwork."
good,I basically learned about making drinks. But most of the times I would deal with costumer service. Such as taking orders especially on the drive thru.
good,"good place to work at great people and environment, good pay and great benefits. good pace of work to help the day pass by always moving and busy. could use a little better management team"
good,L'environnement de travail était très agréable avec un travail d'équipe  nécessaire pour moi.
good,"It all depends on location and how you're experience working will be there. The decent hourly pay rate, along with other benefits like stock, paid time off, and free product perks (Spotify) are included. If anyone is looking for a part time job that will provide high quality health insurance individually or to a family for the lowest price possible."
good,I worked for Starbucks for 2 years. It is a very fast paced environment with its own culture. I did enjoy my time there and sometimes miss it. I had to leave for family reasons. Overall the company is very good.
good,"I have worked at 6 locations over an 8 year period. Job enjoyment depends completely on the management per store location. Starbucks benefits are great, and schedule flexibility made it the place to work in teens and early 20's. Beyond that, there are few, highly competitive career advancement opportunities. The job itself becomes simple as you grow accustom to daily responsibilities. Times of high volume and locations with a drive-thru are extremely stressful. Add that to angry customers and a bad boss if you aren't lucky and it isn't worth the pay. Also, your boss can choose how much or how little of a raise you receive based on your review. If you get a boss who doesn't like you (even if you do a great job) good luck ever making more than a 5 cent raise. Benefits make it worth it to many, but I am glad to have moved on to a better career."
good,"When departments were understaffed, employees from other departments would jump in to help. Everyone learned the basics of the other departments so no one was left alone during peaks."
good,I have really loved working with Starbucks but lately it seems that they just care about getting as many baristas to hire on and then lack helping others to move forward in the company. Favoritism is shown from management to certain baristas. Hard to move up in the company if you do not have the support and guidance of management.
good,"If your manager doesn’t like you, you’re not going to succeed. The pay is awful for the work that you do, too. Fun job with good benefits if you like coffee."
good,"Cadre paisible , bonne experience , enrichissant. clientèle agreable"
good,"The best part of this job is definitely the Target culture. Everyone is very supportive, and we all work together to give guests the best experience possible. Management is usually willing to work with you and be flexible if problems arise."
good,"I learned to be even more efficient working here.  Management made sure you were busy doing something at all times.  The workplace culture was good but not a lot of time to actually socialize. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for the whole time."
good,"I miss the simplicity of the job. Ultimately customers are annoying, but for a retail/food job, this is where it's at. I worked with great people and had fun being creative."
good,"The rush in the mornings was crazy but if the team was working together, it would all go smoothly. Good management helps and when it wasn't there, the machine would not work as smoothly."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful first job with opportunities to move forward as well as give you experiences across the board that can help you in the future. A typical day can be an interesting rush of both people and problems that require you to think on your feet and constantly be ready for anything. That being said I had four different managers in the span of a year and because of that never received the promotions that I was promised.
good,"Good job, just not for me. It had good benefits and they took care of the people, but as a manager it was micro managed. I felt like I couldn't be myself and bring my personality to the store"
good,"Very relaxed environment as a workplace. Very fun place tons and tons of benefit. only problem upper management were friends, so they were always gossiping around"
good,idk what to say they talk a big game about their benefits and stuff but the customers are just awful and the pay in Virginia is pathetic so i had to find a better paying job
good,"For the amount of work you have to do the pay isn't enough. "
good,"I learned how to connect with individuals and create more than just an employee and customer relationships. I was able to interact with people and befriend them eventually. Usually was accommodating, however, could be high stress when its busy and you just started working there."
good,"A typical day at work required waking up at 3:30 am for the first shift of the day. Days are long and tiring, you are constantly on the go. You better hope you have a good store manager, or you are guaranteed to have a miserable time working there. Our store went through three managers. The first one was amazing and I'd love to work for him again. The other two were out to get you, miserable to work for and did not enjoy going to work."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consisted of a very active environment. At Starbucks, teamwork was key as well as a very fast paced mindset. We also always thought of customers as very high and thanked them for choosing Starbucks!"
good,"My typical day at work was coming to work prepared. Clocking in right away, checking what position I would be working that morning. We would also get two 10 minute breaks as well with a 30-minute lunch. We got as many free drink's as we wanted as long as we are working, as well as getting any food item that we wanted. I learned a lot of the customer's orders and their names. We had shift managers as well as just a regular manager. The workplace culture was fun, we got along and joked around, you get pretty close to them you become a little family.The hardest part of the job was learning all the drinks and what all were in them. I enjoyed the conversations with our customers, as well as the memories that were made with my co-workers as well with the customers."
good,The lady manager doesnt put the incentive your suppose to get. Just found out when i called the support center. Now its too late to get it coz your only allowed to get it within 90 days
good,"Fun working environment but also busy! Always something new to learn! "
good,It was a fast paced environment that was fun and challenging. It was a great place to meet people both as customers and coworkers. I really enjoyed making and learning about coffee!
good,"The management isn't always on point. They don't always give you enough hours. The staff is generally nice, but over worked for those that actually get hours while the rest of us struggle to get enough."
good,Often customers are rude and expect everything to be done fast when we have other customers as well that are waiting to receive their drinks/food. Management could be better. Not that much communication among employees.
good,"A typical day at work for me is like nothing i go to work, I'm placed on bar every work day then clock out. its fast paced sometimes stressful cause of customers but thats what customer service is."
good,"-Fast pace"
good,"•	Prepares and sells coffee drinks by following prescribed recipes and preparation techniques for coffee drinks"
good,"Depending on the area you work/community, there may be more customer issues, it may be harder to work with other employees, but overall the benefits are decent for minimum wage/close to min wage job."
good,"management at Starbucks is lacking.  it is very difficult to get promoted.  the atmosphere is fun and fast.  the average employee, in my experience, was a hard worker...except for management."
good,"Productive work place and a very friendly environment. The most enjoyable part on my job was interacting with the clients. Putting a smile on their faces. Enjoyed all of the products Starbucks offered.  I developed many relationships through Starbucks while also developing leadership skills. I was able to learn in a fast pace environment without feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Overall, Excellent place to work."
good,"Benefits at Starbucks are great. The workplace seems to be more directed to sales targets than customer service, which is the opposite of what they claim. I don't personally like upselling and pushing products on customers, unless it will benefit them."
good,"great benefits - tips etc great company to work for and they treat you really well in terms of tuition reimbursement, health coverage, tips, leave etc !"
good,"A typical day at work was pretty chill, being on your feet all day but always staying busy. Ive learned a lot about retail and working together as a team."
good,It was a fun place to work. The environment is fast paced and entertaining. My coworkers were kind with agreeable attitudes. I would recommend working here.
good,Starbucks was a good place to work. The pay was fair and the hours were regular. It has been several years since I worked here so my memory of it is not great.
good,"Working for Starbucks is a great place to work at when your a friendly and outgoing person. Customers turn out to be more than just customers, they turn out to be friends. i learned that at starbucks you have to have really good memory. there's so many drinks to learn and with all the promos and seasons that starbucks has,you learn one or two more. the most enjoyable part of working for starbucks is the connection you get to make with the customers, some of them turn out being your regular and really good friend."
good,"not many opportunities to advance. poor management. temporary work, not a place for a career. You have to memorize so much information that it could be overwhelming"
good,"Great people all around, great place to work, great benefits, room to grow, flexible schedules, always busy which makes the time go by fast, fun place"
good,For anyone looking to get into a customer service business this is a good place to start. I was hired on at 16 and as a young man trying to get my foot in the door in the working world it was a great kick start.
good,"A typical day at work was making drinks and preparing food items for customers. Sometimes, there was nothing as a typical day depending on what came in the door. The hardest part of the job were the morning, lunch time and after work rushes, but I got used to it after a few months. In this environment, team work is one of the most important components and you learn this pretty quick."
good,It was a pretty good job while I was going through school. Working retail changes you and makes you tough and compassionate for the poor people that get stuck in those jobs.
good,"The staff is always kind and ready to help you prepare to become a barista. It can be stressful if you are not assigned the right trainer but for the most part, this job has a lot of growth and is a good career to have."
good,"I have enjoyed working in this particular Starbucks as I have enjoyed the team I've worked with. With any workplace there is that repetitive drama. "
good,Starbucks has a way of finding people who truly enjoy working hard to ensure guests are taken care of. Quick paced and team oriented. Must be willing to wake up early.
good,"Fun place to work but hard work. And some of the upper management seems like they have sipped some of the kool aid. "
good,Love everything about it. The hours the customers the pay was good. You learn something new everyday. All type of different coffee i didnt know bout now i do thanks to starbuck.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. They provided Tuition Reimbursement, health benefits, and discounted stock options. There were various shifts that you could choose from"
good,"Its a decent job, depending on which location you work at. One of the bad things with some locations is getting enough hours, but the environment is very friendly."
good,"Serving coffee sounds easy right? Wrong. This job is anything but easy. You have to be a fast learner and have an efficient way of thinking. Problem solving skills are needed. You have to be quick, friendly, and most importantly dependable. It's stressful most days when you are taking orders, while at the same time making drinks on bar, cleaning along the way, and having customers yelling at you that their caramel macchiato is supposed to be iced. Now there's your warning. The job might not be easy, but it's a job that I love. You make so many relations with your co-workers and your regular customers. There isn't a shift I have where I don't laugh or smile. Every job has it's pros and cons, however, I believe Starbucks is a great job."
good,"My moments at Starbucks was fairly okay and easy! It teaches you how to be a better you also helps with being kind and to think before you speak, so everyone can finish off a lovely day!"
good,I worked here while in college. I decided to leave my college and tried to transfer to a different starbucks but my manager refused to work with me to help me. I couldn't transfer in the end. However I did like working there. Co-workers were friendly enough and customers were friendly for the most part. Loved the regulars.
good,Not a bad place to work whether youre just getting yoru first job or youre going to college or youre a mom. Flexibility and benefits are what draw people in and keep them there mostly.
good,"A typical day at work would be pretty productive because i sometimes works mornings (the opening shift) and sometimes the nights ( the closing shift). The easy/fun part about my job was making all the new and cool drinks, expecially the secret menu drinks. The hard part about my job was dealing with the very few hardheaded costumers that would want their drink perfect or just expect you to make it exactly how my other coworkers did before."
good,"Great place to work, fantastic benefits. Only complaints are that chances for advancement are few and far between and once you advance it’s hard to balance personal and work life. Gets stressful."
good,You learn everything you need to know about being a barista. You also get a discount on all other Equity Starbucks stores. The store is not too big and never understaffed.
good,You're always guaranteed a lot of working hours and overtime. You also get a good discount on food and drink when on shift. Also discount on some merchandise.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Starbucks and learning about all the teas and coffees out there. Even though I left the company, I still use what I learned while I worked there."
good,"The job was great during college, it was face paced but easy to learn. The management was okay, but not fair at all times. Overall I liked the position but there was no room for advancement."
good,"It was stressful for me and some coworkers were lazy, but I gained experience in how to deal with different people. I learned how to adapt to a busy environment."
good,Starbucks encourages a fast paced and quick learning environment for entry into the workforce. Here you will make great personal connections and learn about personal responsibility.
good,Starbucks is a very busy place and is super fun to work at. There is always something to do so even if slow there will be something to do. You get to meet different people everyday.
good,"It can be a career or just a buffer job. It doesn't matter because it's a good place to be. It's a company you can grow in and they offer benefits for part time work as well. It's a company worth working for and the job is a lot of fast pace, hard work. It's non stop from clocking in to clocking out but it's worth every second."
good,My day usually started in the early morning.  The store opened at 6am.  I learned how to provide customers with friendly service along with specialty drinks that required a want to please faithful clientele that came in as part of their morning ritual.
good,The management plays favoritism with their employees. (Perfecting one over the other) I worked there for 9 months and I had social anxiety. They didn't understand how hard it was for me to talk to people and carry on a conversation
good,"The mornings are definitely the busiest and you need good communication with everyone you work with just to make sure you are able to open. You learn the menu pretty quickly because it is math oriented. Management is different everywhere but generally good spirited people only manage at Starbucks, good vibes."
good,"This Starbucks licensed store gets very busy, so it's definitely a fast-paced work environment. Management was good and the work environment created was friendly and fun."
good,Fun place to work. Taught me a lot about customer service. Helped me advance and get out there more and learn to not be so shy. I would recommend working at Starbucks to anybody.
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for overall with excellent benefits and pay for a retail/customer service position.  However, certain stores (especially drive-thru stores) can be stressful and demanding.  There is room for upward mobility in the company, but it can take a long time to move up if there are many people attempting to do so."
good,The staff at Starbucks was friendly and the customers were usually pleasant. Day to day activities were preparing and serving food and beverages to the satisfaction of each and every customer. Overall a good place to work and I would recommend.
good,Great job for a college student looking for a bit of side income. Managers are young and lack experience and there is a fair amount of micro management.
good,"On a typical day after clocking in you would put on your apron and your name tag then talk to the manager to see where help is needed most. Once your task are settled you make sure that you help either the front or window cashier or the person at the bar. If you were assigned to the front register then you would go into the lobby and check to make sure everything was fully stocked and cleaned which included the bathrooms. "
good,"Although I have grown distant to this job, all in all Starbucks is a great place to work. With plenty of room to move up and a team based workplace, theres not much to dislike about working for Starbucks. The most difficult challenge anyone will face at this company is the occasional difficult customer."
good,expérience inoubliable qui m'a beaucoup appris sur moi-même
good,"Starbucks is filled with manuals on how to do everything, including steam milk. So long as you know the rules, and can work quickly, anyone can do the job!"
good,"I remember that even under stress, people were really nice to each other, working hand in hand... it was quite a hard time but i still remember great times and great peoples"
good,"- Working with full of fun and friendly staffs, everyone is willing to help if needed"
good,Great company but horrible pay. Was with the company for 2 yrs. Advancement is very rare regardless of experience. Pay is much less tha  deserved for the work load.
good,"This location at times you had to be quick on your feet and know the recipes for the drinks. It's also near a high school and we always had lots of teenagers in during the summer months. "
good,"Cut-throat and cult like in nature, I always felt like someone was trying to find a reason to get me in trouble. That said, I made friends for life at Starbucks and the benefits are unmatched in the industry. Great for college students."
good,"Can't say too much about it. Good job when you need work. Coffee and some food is free during your shift. Benefits are good if you opt for them, from what I hear."
good,I did not work at Starbucks very long.  I loved the manager that I was hired with but the new supervisor that come to the store I did not get along with.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks, a fast paste job that makes you keep your head in the game. Everyone is always doing something one task after the other. The hardest part of this job is memorizing drink after the other, when its rush hour. The most enjoyable is that your crew is like your family."
good,"I love the job and I love the atmosphere, but at the level of pay and the amount of stress associated, I would prefer not to work here.  Where I work, inside a jewel osco, there are no benefits, and management is weak. I will say the Starbucks atmosphere is present, especially with the enthusiasm of my associates. My manager acts like a child when presented with real issues and treats her associates terribly. A lot of my decision to quit is because of her."
good,A typical day at Starbucks encompassed all aspects of providing fast friendly services to customers that live a similar and varied lifestyle.
good,"Starbucks was my first place of work after college. I gained lots of on the job training and experience, friends, and even had great interactions with customers who were regulars."
good,"I worked at several locations and there was a general consistancy with standards and management at each location.I found each manager to be genuin and consistant to both the staff and customers,  The pay at starbucks isnt the best but its a coffee house..."
good,"Fun environment to work in during college, relaxed atmosphere and quick career advancement, as long as you work hard you can quicklty become a shift supervisor"
good,Great place to work while in school. Will accommodate school schedule and family obligations. Community based employment opportunities. Warm and welcoming.
good,"Each Store is different, I worked in 4 different stores."
good,"A typical day at work included time as cashier, time taking orders, and times making drinks and food preparation. I learned to balance work and school. The most enjoyable part was the environment and my co-workers. Management was not on top of schedules coming out on time."
good,"The environment working for Starbucks is very stressful unless the crew works together well. It is fast paced and stressful but if the leadership is good and the crew listens, it is a great and satisfying feeling when everything comes together."
good,"It really depends on your location for this one. If you have a great manager and coworkers, you'll have a good time. If not, it won't be the best but hey, a job is a job. As well as you work well under pressure, you'll be fine."
good,Interacting with many customers daily while giving them the dose of happy they need in a busy environment with amazing aromas. Become well rounded with how coffee is made and where it comes from.
good,I have been with Starbucks fir 17 years. I love to work with the customers and my fellow partners managment can and is extremely trying most of the time. Some people cause unnecessary drama which should not be in the worl place. There are times when it feels high schoolish
good,"I thought that Starbucks was fun on occasion when you were working with some friends or a good supervisor, though over half the time you wouldn't be. the management at my Starbucks kept changing making it difficult to get used to even after a while of working there"
good,Good dedicated people.   Work consists of licensing the Starbucks brand to others to execute.  Decentralized field leadership. Complex operating plan.   Challenging to get licensees to properly execute the brand experience.
good,"It was a very cultural experience , to interact with different kinds of people and to serve them was the best experience. I also enjoyed my co-workers , how the was always helpful and kind. The most I loved to do was to make sure people left with a smile."
good,It is easy to learn and is a great job to start off with. Your work experience definitely depends on the type of people you are working with. Very repetitive and can get boring.
good,"Working for Starbucks isn't for everyone considering how fast-paced and detail oriented it is, but I have really enjoyed my time as a shift manager at my store."
good,I loved my coworkers and learning how to make drinks. The atmosphere was always pleasant and I liked the perks we got for food and drinks. The location of my store was my favorite part.
good,"It is a great starter job, super fun if you enjoy talking to people and working with your hands. The training is very comprehensive and most supervisors and managers are patient with new employees. The customers are wonderful  most of the time."
good,"As an opener I had to be at the store at 4:30 am and get the store ready for clients who started to come in at 5:00am. I am talkative, so I usually took orders and interacted with the clients at this time. It was multifaceted because it could get very hectic and one had to give good and attentive customer service, while running and getting the drink and food ready. Team work was necessary to have a successful shift, and I got a long with my co-workers."
good,"Provides excellent benefits for employees. Fast placed environment, must be able to prioritize, multi-task, and work quickly. Customer service is a must, cannot ever show frustration or irritation on the job, just like any other workplace, a professional attitude is required. "
good,Working as a Barista with Starbucks was a great learning experience. I worked with many personalities of all ages and learned to productively manage my time at a young age.
good,I worked in a Starbucks inside of a Kroger store so I'm sure an actual Starbucks would be more fun. Corporate people treated us unfairly and we didn't get any real benefits other than discounts on Kroger products which I felt indifferent about.
good,"Starbucks baristas perform several job duties and provide customer service. Baristas at Starbucks take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications. Starbucks baristas may also operate cash registers and credit card machines. Baristas may field customer complaints or questions, as well. Baristas at Starbucks also must often clean coffee machines, restaurant areas, restrooms, and preparation areas during a normal shift. Baristas work to maintain good customer relations and speedy delivery of all beverages as well as complete assigned tasks from management every day."
good,"always be nice ,have a human connection with your client and always ensure him that you are going to solve his problem or find a way to satisfied him.be nice with customers, help your partner to understand what they are doing"
good,It was alright. the company as a whole is great but the middle management needs work. Sometimes i felt that with time and more growth this company could far exceed others.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for anybody who likes fast-paced work environments. "
good,Very friendly Coworkers and Manager who are helpful and easy going.  Very busy with all the college students were trying to stay patience with us in long line within peak hours in between classes. I love the atmosphere and having this place in campus.  I dislike the most was closed during the summer and one month off with no pay.
good,Lo que aprendi de mk experiencia de starbucks fue el maneji del trato hacia el cliente
good,I had a lot of fun working at Starbucks. I learned a lot on how to make drinks and coffee tasting. This job is a very fast pace environment. This job will test your patience and multitasking skills.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. Great environment with great benefits, great coffee and food. I love the coffee and specialty drinks. Busy lines and lots of customers for a busy day."
good,"The company is great  to work for for the most part. They provide a flexible schedule when needed, and benefits for most employees. The people that work in the stores are all usually very tolerant people"
good,"This company is very hit or miss. The rapid increase in size has really taken a toll on their ability to ensure quality control. The management in my district was HORRIBLE and despite frequent complaints from entry-level partners, they failed to do anything to improve working conditions."
good,"Hard to promote in certain areas, and can be a stressful place to work. The managers can be hard to work for, and the pay isn’t very great, but the company is trying to better itself."
good,"For the amount of work in a supervisory role, the pay is not competitive enough. The schedule is inconsistent to maintain a work/life balance. Stress level is high."
good,"Depending on your location you could have an average of 1000 customers or half. Good energy, free weekly pounds of coffee, 6 month review with raise no matter how performance was. Great job for a student because they are flexible with availabilities"
good,"This was a great place to start as a college student.  You learn how to work with others and get great benefits. It is very fast paced, so don't expect an easy job."
good,Eine gute Zwischenstation um meine Fähigkeiten weiter aufzubauen.
good,"This company has great job culture and they really work with you if you have school and job conflicts. Along with flexibility, this company has some great perks when you become a partner."
good,The best part is the people you work with. Time flies when its incredibly busy and having competent people alongside you helps make everything run smoothly.
good,Need to stay on your toes and follow policies closely. Communication skills are important. Manager is great and caring. Tips are nice and done weekly.
good,"I Love the customers. Especially my regulars!!! I Had to leave because the manager was horrible will talk about everyone ""how bad i was"". I will cover at other stores and other managers wanted me to transfer to their stores because i brought in something new."
good,a typical work day at starbucks was fast paced. it tested your skills at levels. I was able to start early enough where I got myself settled in and ready.
good,It was interesting to see the type of people that came in to order. Some are very generous and polite while other are not. People really dont see everything that goes on behind the scenes.
good,Crazy work environment. Starbucks is all about numbers.  Working with them made me feel like I was part of a machine. Labor is always being cut and it's always about sales--not the employee.
good,"Starbucks is a solid company that has the potential to be either a great job, or a terrible job depending on you supervisory and management team. make sure you have thick skin and can handle a different experience on a day to day basis"
good,"typical coffeehouse job. Making coffee, gathering muffins, smiling to grumpy people who have not had their coffee yet. If you enjoy customer service and making people happy, this is the job for you. the management is usually  very relaxed and usually very nice. Although it does differ from store to store. The best part of the job is the free drinks. And it is a very stress free work environment."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at starbucks, despite the issues I had with bullying from one of my coworkers. The job perks and the overall ambiance of the place made me feel at home and the management tries their hardest to make everyone feel like a valuable part of the team."
good,"Starbucks is a very professional workplace and has a well structured organizational system that helps workers navigate the fast paced environment with a clear head and positive attitude. Each part of the job is broken up into roles that are switched each shift with duties changing every half-hour. The benefits for full-time work make it even more worth your while, however it was the management that drove me away. Working at Starbucks demands long shifts and heavy weeks, so it is important to have a strong team leader. The downside to job advancement is that sometimes workers are promoted before they are ready for the roles being assigned, and this is what contributes to poor management."
good,Very high expectations with lack of labor in order to get managerial tasks done. I enjoy being a leader but was not capable to accomplish or execute store plans I had to succeed
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work at, morale was good most days. You have customers smiling and employees happy as well. Only hard part when dealing with Starbucks is the advancement program"
good,"I had very unprofessional managers. I had a very difficult time working there, they were supportive and they did not manage employees well. Also the shift supervisor at my store was narcissistic and very rude to both customers and employees."
good,"Everyone I worked with was incredibly hard-working and passionate which I think Starbucks brings into their environment given the high-stress levels. Additionally, the little benefits that I got here and there like tips on top of a slightly higher than minimum wage pay was great. I left because I wanted to start a career although many people stay with Starbuks or have even returned to Starbucks because it provides them with so many opportunities for advancement and even has a matching 401k for any level worker within the company."
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers. Sometimes it is very fast paced, other times it's slow, depending on the flight schedule. Some of the mangers are cool, others not so much."
good,"put in 10 years and got passed up for someone who came from a chick-fil-a."
good,If everything is under control then the store will run smoothly. This gives time to enjoy the work and get to meet new people. Hardest part of the job was keeping on top of all the cleaning and maintaining health and safety and food hygiene standards.
good,I like working at Starbucks and the only thing I don't like is how automatic all the machines are. But it does make it easier to learn how to make everything.
good,"I worked with a cool team and management. This was a great start in my career. I learned a lot of about management, paying attention to detail, and working in a fast paced environment,"
good,"Unless you can get lucky with a quality Store manager, your time will wont be fun as it could be. Coworkers will make or break your time there. Customers can complain but just pass them off to your supervisor."
good,"Was a good practise of independence and customer service.made my memorization skills stronger. was left alone in starbucks to do cash make drinks , clean and serve for many hours"
good,"Customers are great, work life balance is awesome but if you are looking to move up they are reactive not proactive so good luck letting your work ethic get you promoted, you need to wait until they upset someone enough for them to quit"
good,"Great atmosphere, love the costumers. teaches you how to communicate with others. The toughest thing really is the amount of work but that's not an issue because of all the great people you meet."
good,"I enjoyed working there. Great customer service experience as well as cashier. It was hard working there with younger people, And scheduling wasn't great."
good,"fast paced, not enough hours given, managemebt was horrible, was bullied here. too much drama for such a small coffee shop. met cool people that I still talk to at this job."
good,"Great benefits, great discounts, nice work culture, however we are extremely underpaid. For the people that choose not to access the dental/health/vision insurance benefits or the 401K, the wages we received are very underwhelming and they do not motivate one to stay with the company on a long term basis. Especially since performance based wages are NEVER given."
good,"We make coffee at starbucks and its nice for the most part. They offer a lot of benefits, which are great if you work the required amount of hours a week."
good,"Hard work, sometimes frustrating if a person isn't familiar with a ""good enough to get by"" attitude. Great benefits with only 20 hours per week, which allows you to develop yourself through school, pursuit of position in your field, or you just want to work less than a 40 hour week. Seasonal, so the holidays are crazy; during low periods you may not work the necessary number of hours to keep your insurance."
good,"It's fast paced, competitive, always changing. The culture is what makes this company and is enjoyable. The down side is the hours needed to be successful, work/life balance, and for some roles extensive travel."
good,"Work culture is good."
good,I feel like the work place is good if the people there are fun and nice . If one person is in a bad mood it will ruin everyone mood. Is good and cozy but sometimes the students just have to ruin everyone mood
good,"Some days not enough labor and staffing levels can be hard to maintain. Other competitive pay companies that take away workers. Managers could be more supportive of their workers, stores that perform poorly is because management doesn't lead or is too lazy to do the work."
good,Often relaxed work environment with the early morning rush hours and busy holidays. Great way to get experience into the world of customer service. Hardest part is being under staffed and busy at the same time.
good,"Great place to work. Everyone was really friendly, they gave you respect. You wanted to come to work everyday, managers were nice, friendly environment."
good,"Typical day includes stocking products, making beverages, engaging with customers and having fun. Co-workers may difficult to work with but customers coming in makes the day better."
good,"It's about what you'd expect, it's customer service. On your feet all day, making drinks for people. Coworkers can sometimes be cool, sometimes not. You'll be around the same people for 8 hours a day during stressful work situations, you'll either make new friends or you won't."
good,Die Arbeit war sehr Entspannend und Voll Interessant aber manchmal auch Stressig
good,"Though at times the work was stressful, at the end of the day I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people. I loved seeing the regulars that came in and meeting new customers. I also loved all of coworkers. It was an energetic and fun place to work."
good,"Starbucks in Kroger was a challenge only because we dealt with a lot of high school kids, and elders  that were  very serious about the way the want their coffee made.  enjoyed the actual job and what services I had to provide it was just more so the customers that would make it kind of difficult at times."
good,I only did  market research for school research on Starbucks and the coffee industry in general. I tried to skip this part and the website wouldn't allow me.
good,good company.  working completely remote.  looking for a team in town.  would like new challenges in role.  looking to add to my resume by accepting new challenges a new career would bring
good,"Management during 2016/17 year was amazingly easy and understanding to work with. Shifts were easy to get, but also time needed off for school was understood by management."
good,"I loved the atmosphere of this place, I did not like the customers. this place really makes you realize how picky people can really be. If you're young and need a good first job this is the one for you!"
good,It was fun to work at Starbucks. You get to meet a lot of new people that become your regulars. You get to learn about the new coffee beans and tea leaves. It's fast paced but it isn't stressful because it's a job you can enjoy.
good,"once you get into the shift management, or salaried roles your protection of personal time does not exist. It has great benefits for a customer service job, but it is still food/retail/customer service and comes with all the problems of dealing with the demanding public"
good,The job is a fun experience but just like every other job there's some things that could use a little work. The employees can be nice at time but they can also be fake. That's why I killed them with kindness.
good,"At the stabucks where I worked the employees unfortunatly wern't too patient with me and got frequently frustrated that I would ask questions. I had fun on some days but others, the customers would get to me."
good,A normal day would included turn over at the beginning of shift. Then followed by another turn over from partner working in your area. During my time at Starbucks i have learned to be more hands on and more team oriented.
good,"Starbucks felt like a regular corporate fast food gig. There was a lot of management in different tiers to create a environment of repeatable experience for customers. There was no individuality or creativity. However, for a basic job it did come with okay benefits if you opted into them. The pay was dismal but it was pretty basic work. If you worked hard there were plenty of opportunities for advancement. With all jobs like this, you aren't getting satisfaction with your work so it is important to like your coworkers. Otherwise, it'll be pretty mind numbing."
good,"A typical day of work is pretty faced paced. I've honed my soft, customer service skills working here coming in contact with and  dealing with a large diverse group of people. It's a fairly relaxed culture, not too serious. The hardest part of the job is working with team members with poor attitudes and work ethics on a busy day. The most enjoyable part is working with positive, energetic team members to make drinks that put smiles on our customer's faces."
good,loved working at starbucks wonderful people to work with low stress work great customer base and very helpful staff and management I would return as an employee
good,Everyone that works there is depressed and complains everyday. You will get sick of the smell of coffee. When pumpkin spice time of year rolls around you will want to jump off the nearest bridge.
good,"Starbucks brings in speakers for a wide variety of topics for Partners. They have many optional groups to join such as Global Sustainability, Women's Network, Veterans Networks, etc."
good,"Dependent on location - can be extremely busy during peak hours."
good,"Great structure with know what is wanted by the company and training is great"
good,The store I work at doesn't function well as a team. Employees don't help other employees. Partners from other stores have said the work environment at this particular store is unhealthy.
good,"Starbucks was a fun place to work and very professional, only problems were management was not consistent with paperwork. but over all was a good company"
good,"Managed 20-30 employees including selecting, hiring, scheduling and staff reviews. Dynamic customer service, inventory management and spending within a budget. P&L and budgetary decicions made"
good,"This is a good gig for a student or another young adult who only wants to work part time. Do not drink the kool aid and believe that you will advance past supervisor. You have to kiss a ton of butt to get to a store manager role, and then the stress is not worth it."
good,"Its perfect for college students, but everyone must move on. Flexible hours are available and it is easy together your shifts covered. You also get free coffee."
good,I liked being able to make the drinks as well as be able to try to make new drinks that you could make for your self. It made everything go by much faster.
good,Very fun. High movement and multitasking. Healthy rivalry among coworkers and multiple chances for advancement. Work can become physically tasking and repetitive.
good,"This is a very good place for start your Carrier. People are friendly, helpful and ready for action. Lot of new faces every single days  , every day is like a adventure, you never know what is going  to happen."
good,"You have to be a quick learner to enjoy working here. "
good,"4:30 am shift every morning is crippling. can barley get my sleep schedule, leaves me no room to trian for other positions beside cashier. and benefits are tough to mske eligibility"
good,The partners I've had the opportunity working with have made me feel welcome and a part of the team and it has made it tremendously fun to work for this company!
good,I worked as a barista and shift lead while here and loved my job. Compensation was fair and the work environment was fun. I had great managers and co-workers.
good,"-Benefits can be nice. 30% discount on everything in the store. One free coffee/tea/via/pod markout per week. Free drinks while working, one free food markout per shift. However, when it's near impossible to be scheduled more than 20 hrs/week at many stores, it can be impossible to afford those benefits such as healthcare. It IS possible to pick up shifts at your own store or other stores, though. (Some stores are lucky and always have plenty of hours, or plenty of tips to make up for it. This is something you should inquire about during your interview). My store is ""guaranteed 20 hours per week on average"" to qualify for benefits, but any schedule changes later on can change that. And at my store, that basically means we only get 20-25 hours per week. I have begged my manager not to hire on anyone else when someone quits so those hours can be distributed between current partners wanting those hours."
good,Great job to help you develop further growth in your career. Having good customer service skills helps out! Stressful and moody customers at times. District managers can be too hard on partners and pick favorites.
good,A nice change when working in a licensed store as compared to being on the cashier side at Target. I am unhappy with Target's grasp on the treatment of it's Starbucks stores as well as the Target Cafes.
good,"Esta muy bien él ambiente, te capacitan muy bien y te dan mucha confianza al igual que te apoyan con los estudios"
good,Engage and meet knew people. Has a union so job is secured. Starbucks has great quality beverages and product. free lunch everyday. Just have lazy managers.
good,Flexible hours were great and necessary for a full time student. The job was easy but enjoyable. The people I worked with were what made the job as great as it was.
good,fast paced and demanding. Fun place to work at and the coworkers are very understanding with new employees. Majority regular customers that come in every day.
good,"Like many workplaces it seems to be the staff members that get you through, customers have their on and off days but once you learn the barista skills they become universal."
good,"Although the company is focused on the development of its baristas, there is little room for growth for the store manager. Most district manager positions involve relocating and monetary compensation is low because it is market based. Starbucks is successful because of its extreme attention to detail, high quality custom products and excellent customer service. These qualities are wonderful in a company, but I believe the managers should be compensated more for delivering on these high expectations. Benefits are great."
good,Ambiente organizado e bem estruturado. Porém os benefícios poderiam ser melhores.
good,"o	Developed concept culture and branding for Garbonzo’s."
good,"I work at a Target Starbucks so typically a day starts and ends with only one barista on duty. This makes it difficult to do any backup preparation for the day because we are responsible for manning register, hot bar, cold bar, and warming station. Management, especially district, are way too picky. They want everyone, at all times, to follow precise cup marking, beverage assembly, drink calling, and be connecting with guests all the time."
good,Starbucks is a good place to work with especially if you have passion on what you do in fact if i have a chance to work there again I would gladly comeback and work then work y way up.
good,"While I loved my time working for starbucks, there was some variance in management styles. This is a great place to start working, and has helped me to grow as a person."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. They offer free drinks and food, but most importantly, healthcare options for both part time and full time workers."
good,"Highly flexible to the needs of your schedule. Easy going at work. Management is great, depending what location you might work at. Workplace culture is good. Most enjoyable is meeting new people and learning about things on a day to day basis."
good,"Working at Starbucks was an enjoyable process. A regular day at Starbucks would entitle customers greeting you as soon as you came in because they always recognize the person who gives them their coffee to start their day. I learned at my job that most people need coffee to go through their usual day. Management was one of the great things, managers really care about to make it easier for you to come in and are flexible with hours."
good,The shop is a well run busy environment of 10 people with everyone working as a team and making sure the company is run to standards and together to give the best customer service.
good,the work eviorment was good the pay was based out of safeway since it was an in store set up. the hours wernt to long and the days flew by. pay was fair but we didn't get tips due to it being inside a store.
good,"A great place to learn customer service, multitasking skills, and teamwork building. I learned how to deliver great customer service and interpersonal skills. The management team is supportive and always makes you strive to be the best you can be. The culture is positive and has a very family feel. The most difficult part of the job would be learning to balance all the tasks along with drink making, customer relations, and making sure the store is clean and stocked at all times. The most enjoyable part is mastering the craft and imparting your knowledge onto new partners."
good,Starbucks as a company is phenomenal.  They are supportive of all partners.  Store managers must be able to stay self-moivated and balance many ever changing demands while supervising parters and cascading information and hurting the work life.
good,Great benefits kick in after only 90 days. Be ready to be on your toes- all the time. If you can survive the vicious Monday morning rush you could probably handle nuclear fallout.
good,Here one can learn the fun and delicious art of coffee and and its many ways of enjoying it.  if a fast paced sometimes cramps work environment is what you are looking for apply here.
good,"Working in this company let me learnt how to serve different types of drinks. Also, I have learnt the daily operation of coffee shop. Beside, I made many friends during working in this company as the partners there are very nice and helpful."
good,"learned much being an assistant manager for the first time: selecting, hiring and training new staff but there was a price to pay; i learned assistant managers have ZERO time remaining in which to spend with loved ones, and even less energy."
good,"Its a coffee shop! Employees are always friendly and love chatting. You talk to customers all day about how there life is going and at the same time, you get free coffee!"
good,I learned plenty through working within this company. I have worked at three stores and I got promoted at the current store I work at. Although it became difficult at times to work with the public I managed to surpass the expectations to handle many different situation that I was put through. I like working with people and with this job I learned to work with several different groups of people from various backgrounds.
good,A lot of customers and very busy environment. Management was not helpful. I learned how to multitask and work on my own. It was so fun to get to know the customers.
good,Be adaptable. There is constant change and flux. For many positions there may be no such thing as a typical day. Benefits are good. It's a large company so there are a variety of people to work with. Experiences may vary depending on the team you work with.
good,Making drinks was fun and able to interact with customers everyday. Get to loosen up at workplace due to the energy provided by other workers. Work and have fun at the same time.
good,"I have worked at over seven different locations. As years went by, I felt as though the company decided to take a step back from their roots and grow towards a more corporate centered environment. As a result, each store I have worked at has very different management types, none of which are helpful for growth in the company. It's disappointing and very disheartening to see a company I once loved so dearly take a turn for the worse."
good,Flexible schedule hours with benefits for part-time and full-time.  Fast paced work environment with lots of changes periodically.  Can be difficult working with minimal employees on shift at once.  Great overall experience.
good,I love working at Starbucks because they try all technology. They don't panic even during production failures. And they always work toward improvements.
good,"I rang up customers on the cash register and provided them with accurate change."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work while you are finishing school. It provides great benefits and allows you to pursue other interests while bringing in a semi-steady paycheck.
good,Canad Inns is one of the largest hotel chains in Manitoba and offers great opportunities to anyone looking to grow with in the hotel business. They value loyalty and commitment and is a place you can build a career around.
good,"A typical day at work is kind of slow starting off but the business of the store fluctuates. I learned ho to make coffees and hot drinks that I love to do. The management needs some TLC. Hardest part about the job is making sure you meet the expectations of the customers, you want them to leave happy. I enjoy almost everything about it from the team, to our customers. I'm always happy to be there"
good,Only worked at starbucks for a week as this was my work experience. The co-workers seemed very nice and it was a very fast paced environment as the starbucks I worked at was in a busy city.
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers and it was a cohesive and diverse group of individuals. Something out of my control was the occasional rude, entitled customers."
good,Employees and manager were very friendly and easy going. Everyone was hard working. I had a lot of fun working here while I went to school and made some awesome friends.
good,"It was always busy at work during the day in the drive thru and in the lobby. At times it was difficult to keep up with all the orders when there was not enough people scheduled to work or if someone called out. The manager kept scheduling me when I had school, even though I was promised to have a work scheduled around school. Also, if the manager made a mistake with scheduling when approved time off, she would not correct the mistake."
good,"Typically it is balanced work day, there are several different jobs that you can be put on to shake it up. My schedule is not consistent and wished I was able to work more hours with my open availability."
good,"typical day at work consisted of always moving doing and getting beverages out quick, learned to become fast paced under high pressure situations, became fast learner and trained then managed a store, hardest part of the job was deescalating and problems that came through, but i loved the work i did"
good,Starbucks was one of the best companies I have worked for. They were very flexible on my hours and had great benefits. I learned a lot about customer service and interaction. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers and management.
good,i love what i do be it can become overwhelming when we are under staffed. the management sucks very unprofessional. its a very fast pace which make the time go by fast.. love my hours usually off by 1pm. to enjoy the rest of my day. also i like experimenting trying  every new drink that come out.
good,"Very fast paced but the team was amazing!!  I got to know so many people and got to make a difference in people's lives daily!  I actually met my wife at Starbucks, and we are living happily ever after!"
good,"We recently received new management at our location-a store manager that was hired into the role and has only had about a year of 'starbucks' experience prior. Nice woman, but really poor at her job. Anyway, the job is very fast paced and enjoyable if everyone is doing their part. Benefits are great if you are one to need them(I don't)."
good,"Es una empresa excelente para trabajar, el clima laboral es bueno y los clientes hacen muy ameno tú trabajo, lo malo es el equipo gerencial: déspotas y no capacitados para ejercer eficazmente un puesto de tal envergadura, ahí asciendes por relaciones y no por méritos laborales, salvo una gerente que tuve que es muy profesional y buena líder los demás gerentes son déspotas e ineptos."
good,Employee turnaround is high. The company has excellent benefits and the managers try and accommodate schedules.  Training of new employees needs to reevaluated and structured in a more interactive approach.
good,Great training available for new employees tailored to just about every learning style out there. Very busy no matter the location but great benefits available to all baristas.
good,Starbucks is a great organization that strives to do as much good for the world as a publicly traded company can. Workplace culture is extremely people oriented which can make navigating the organization somewhat challenging.
good,"Great Company to work for during college. Flexible hours, competitive pay, lots of opportunity, good people, experienced management, and good coffee.."
good,"The hardest part was getting used to all the drinks and to the environment. Each store has its own environment and its just something to get used to. But other than that it will take time to get used to everything, it does get way easier though."
good,"I have been with Starbucks for 7 yrs. I've gone from barista to management. I learned speed and accuracy with maintaining excellent customer service. I enjoyed the interaction with customers and my partners. "
good,"Learned a lot about how to interact with customers. Starbucks is BIG on customer experience. Enjoyable place to work. Management could use some work, but overall, nice job."
good,"Managerial problems, 3 managers in one year.  Some task workers works more than others in the bar with no help, even when another worker is at the register doing nothing.  Company doesn't factor in mobile orders and doesn't schedule enough worker to cover therefore customers compliant about the long waiting lines."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to be the people were friendly clean and safe place to be , Tough work but satisfying. Very busy everyday especially during peak. You have to be on your A Game at Starbucks."
good,"They wouldn't let me do really anything besides cashiering and washing the dishes, so i really didn't learn all that much from that experience. But it is usually a fast pace work place."
good,Working at starbucks is very fast paced and busy. Allowed me to enrich my communication and customer service skills. Have to be very patient due to dealing with costumer in a rush.
good,"Fast paced work environment, but compared to other comparable  restaurants the environment was at least good.  It felt good to make a quality product."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work with a lot of flexibility. You are able to meet a lot of people and create connections with the regular customers. Fun place.
good,"I worked at two different locations for over two years. The pay isn't great, but the atmosphere is fun and fast paced. I would recommend working at Starbucks."
good,Let's just all agree people in the world are no longer nice to each other on a regular basis and no where does that show up more than in service. People who make 6 figures a year complain a lot about coffee. I also had a store manager that was head and shoulders above the others in the area so unless you work for her odds are job won't be as enjoyable.
good,Working at Starbucks was the best decision of my life! I had a great experience at Starbucks. I improved my customer service skills and I had many lovely customer who would come to our location just because my co workers and I were so friendly!
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work, however you don't really go anywhere in the company. Their Benefits are amazing! And you get a few perks during your shift. The Friendships you create can last a life time.But really working at Starbucks is a first job kinda place, you can't really work your way up."
good,"50% cashier"
good,"fun place to work, fun place to work and provided a great learning experience in a fast paced operation. Then upper management was awesome and they always listened."
good,"Quality of service to the customers is superb. Always focus on the needs of the customers, friendly baristas , and also they have trainings for additional learnings not just focus in making coffee.."
good,"A fun place to work if you like to be busy. Managers are very picky but it is a good thing. It will be a busy time, but it is a very fun environment to work in."
good,"Overall Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. They will pay for your first bachelor's degree in its entirety and will give you benefits for working an average of 20 hrs a week (including your domestic partner)."
good,"Cool place to work. Great staff, flexible hours. Everyone is generally friendly. Sometimes its very busy and a little overwhelming but you have great support."
good,"Love working for Starbucks, but management can be quite underwhelming.  I thoroughly enjoy going into work daily. Double standards are obvious with management. Extreme pro/cons working at Starbucks."
good,"It's not a hard job. You show up, do the work required and leave. If fellow baristas don't do their job it just adds more work for those who do. The hardest part is rude customers, like any other customer service job. Busy hours with rushes and peak hours can be crazy but with the right team and good leadership things work."
good,"This is a good part time job for artists or college students. It does not offer much potential for growth, but it is a good starting point as a job, instead of a career."
good,"Specifically at my Starbucks, there was a rush every 2 hours, so handling the rush and keeping pace is the hardest part.  Otherwise, my coworkers, management and our customers were generally pleasant.  Expect to be constantly on your feet, and doing something – not a slow, sit around and wait kind of job, it requires a lot of energy and attention."
good,This job fostered in me a great number of customer service skills. They value a strong work ethic and really know how to keep up appearances. Many of their employees are very satisfied and it shows in their seasoned veterans.
good,"Was fun and enjoyable great staff and people but they had major management issues, for whatever reason they couldn't keep a manager or assistant manager or even a shift supervisor which led to a lot of scheduling problems"
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced work environment, must be on your feet for full shifts. Very fun co-workers, I have considered working there again because i miss the environment."
good,"As a whole I really enjoy the hospitality at Starbucks, it's friendly environment, the diverse community of shoppers and the respectful employment team."
good,"Es una buena empresa, cuida a sus trabajadores, buen ambiente y trabajo en equipo."
good,We always got to really interact with customers and it was just a fun and productive workplace. The management was great and the team members were always friendly.
good,"Be prepared to begin working as soon as you start. If you are the type to take orders without question, and can tolerate a daily stressful work environment and hurried customers , then you'll do great."
good,"Easy place to work, everyone get along with each other. Would continue to work here through college if it went along with my major. Managers of start buck and target will help you with your needs."
good,"Because of the fact that the Starbucks I worked is under the Follett Corporation, the employees are underpaid and do not receive tips. The management was extremely poor and we were expected to uphold Starbucks Corporate effort, which includes a lot of hard work and constant dedication to upkeeping the store, but we were not incentivized with the pay that our efforts deserved."
good,"Great place to work for college students. Right on campus at CSULB, easy to work with student schedules, and very fun fast paced environment. Everyone helps each other all the time."
good,"I didn't even work at a real Starbucks, I was at a kiosk. Our management was run through the food service provider for my university and they treated us poorly. I really enjoyed our direct managers but the higher ups were the worst. Do not work for Aramark at Susquehanna University"
good,starbucks was an enjoyable environment and I enjoyed working there and learning the coffee trait and that side o serving every day customers. I would most definitely recommend it as a work place and a place to grab good coffee.
good,You stay very busy through the day and the costomers are for the most part great and personable. great shift leaders and a very fun place to work. great management
good,not a hard job just fast paced and have to deal with annoying people easy to learn everything the manager is uptight the shifts are very cool coworkers don't know anything
good,"Working at Starbucks is a lot of fun, mostly due to the fast-paced environment. Along with that comes a level stress, because of the pressure to perform well."
good,"I was personally stuck on overnight crew while finishing my degree, I needed 2 classes to complete my degree that was available on the M,W,T evening schedule, I was not allowed to interview for any 1st shift manager positions and was told I could not leave the 3rd shift because of the success I had since taking it over 21 months ago.  Their solution was to offer me a increase in pay for not allowing me the chance to interview for a 1st shift position and finishing my degree."
good,"Who doesn't love working in a place with coffee that is delicious?  Each location differs, but benefits and other assistance is available to employees."
good,"Awesome job - you really learn a lot working here. I worked part-time with this company for almost 2 years. They can be quite flexible with your hours - especially if you are a student. Also they are pretty giving when it comes to breaks - (3 in an 8 hour shift). However, since Starbucks is popular it can get busy & hectic. It teaches you how to be patient & really gives you the experience of customer service. Rewarding experience - great customers, great people, but of course you may meet the occasional employer that isn't so great. I've had a few unfortunate experiences with unorganized employers which made things difficult (hence only the 4 stars) but the company itself is awesome. Another thing is - employers tend to really stick down the ""job expectations"" down your throat, which is of course expected however it can get a little much (especially if your employer is expecting you to make full conversations with 15 drinks in your line.... a little unnecessary). Overall, I'd definitely recommend this job for anyone looking into food/retail. Great experience & awesome benefits."
good,I always loved going to work because I loved hanging out with my fellow barista's. I worked the early morning shift which took its toll on me after awhile.
good,"Each Starbucks store has a unique atmosphere though the company works hard to minimize differences between promotions. Applicants need to be quick paced, mild-tempered, able to accept criticism and learn from mistakes to provide consistent quality. Customers can be both enjoyable and difficult, so patience is required."
good,I appreciated the work in customer service and the chance to manage two other employees.
good,"Starbucks is a great and fun place to work for the time being, and it has been an awesome learning experience for me. I love meeting new people and getting to know all of our regular customers."
good,"Creo que deben mejorar el sueldo de sus trabajadores , ya que las exigencias son muy altas que no es coherente vi el sueldo."
good,Starbucks has good pay plus tips everyday once certified. Maximin of 40 hours a week for hms. They are good with working around college school schedule.
good,"Starbucks supports your education and is always willing to accomidate anything. Has amazing benefits and stock options. Can be physically tiring, on your feet for long periods of time."
good,"Friendly people to work with, and usually good customer experiences. Tough to keep up with some of the expectations of certain customers but nothing that can't be overcome."
good,I loved this job and most of the people I worked with however the head management was not very helpful. It is very frustrating when your manager doesn't work with you or understand your work style. The benefits were good but the pay was not livable and hours were scheduled poorly and limited.
good,"Starbucks is a great part-time job for high school and college students. Working at a very busy location that is in the middle of my campus, keeps all employees busy for the duration of their shifts."
good,Professional workspace and the managers are aware that most of their employees are college students so they are extremely lenient on working with your  availability
good,"Great environment, great customers and crew! Low staff lead to poor scheduling and issues within store though and management was very poorly done. Overall it was fairly fun though"
good,Working at Starbucks is rewarding because of the people that you are in contact with. Your regular customers are what keep you going an excited to be at work everyday.
good,"In my years of working for Starbucks, I have learned that while it is important to be swift with making a customer's drinks and/or what ever products that they have purchased, it is also important to create and connect with those people."
good,"An extremely exciting place to work. The first store I worked for was okay but not a good fit for me. When I put in for a transfer, the new store is AWESOME!"
good,"I loved working with my team and making customers feel special.  Corporate didn't protect the retail employees very well.  They were more concerned with keeping customers happy that they would throw retail employees under the bus to save face.  However, working in the stores with my team was lots of fun and the experience taught me a lot about sales and teamwork."
good,"Starbucks has been a pretty good employer. The work atmosphere is always laid back, and I really enjoy working with my coworkers, and shift leaders. Starbucks has been the best company I have worked for so far."
good,"As previously stated, my employer was King Soopers. I worked at a licensed store inside a grocery store. I really don't know what else to say about my non-existent employer."
good,"great to employees, or partners as we were referred to. you can get full benefits with minimum hours. great opportunities for advancement with time. pay low to start out."
good,"If you get along with your coworkers then you will likely have a fun day at work even if it does get busy. It's a lot of work, but it is a great experience that provides you with many universally applicable skills."
good,I really enjoyed working there. No benefits. Not the best pay. I met a lot of  people that I still keep in contact with today. Friendly workplace but I wish the pay for baristas was better and benefits were offered.
good,"My Starbucks was managed through Aramark food. The Aramark managers were terrible, going as far as to tell employees they were not permitted to carry their cell phones despite campus police telling the director that this put us in danger in the event of an active shooter"
good,"Being a barista at Starbucks taught me valuable skills in customer service and teamwork. Through the extensive training that was provided by the company, I learned a lot about what it means to provide quality products and connect with customers. Working in a team was also important, and I grew close with many of my coworkers because of it, many of whom I am still close with today. The job was stressful at times, and the hours were sometimes long, but overall, I learned a lot working at this company and can safely say that I grew as a person in my 4 years there."
good,My time as a barista was great experience. I was able to meet and serve some amazing people. The team I worked with were great and together we were able to bring joy and happy times to each other and our costumers.
good,Being a barista at Starbucks has taught me to build a relationship with my customers and give them the best service i can offer.  My customer service skills have become incredibly stronger since i became a partner.
good,"fun and peppy"
good,"Worked as a part of a fun team"
good,"Then environment is suffocating at times. My co-workers can be unhelpful and rude at times. However, I have gained good salesmanship and work ethic throughout my time with the company."
good,"el ambiente del trabajo era agradable de ser una empleada de mi jefe que tiene discipline y aprende mucho de mi jefe y mis colegas. "
good,I learned a lot of really important skills from this job and it allowed me to develop strong leadership and customer service skills. Great pay and benefit structure as well.
good,"A typical day as a barista consists of opening the store, setting up the pastry case and other food items as well as brew teas and coffee, this should take no more than a half hour. Once opened baristas connect with guests providing quality hand crafted beverages as well as pastries and other food items."
good,"This job will definitely test your communication and people skills. Daily rushes are stressful and if management is weak, it can make for long long shifts!!"
good,I enjoyed creating new drinks and liked that Starbucks came out with new drinks promotions often. I use their iPhone app whenever I go and i have had a positive experience with it.
good,"I liked working at Starbucks. I just find the crazy hours difficult for a work life balance. I do miss all of the perks they give, such as a free pound of coffee every week."
good,"When I first started, I loved the atmosphere of education: learning about coffee, learning about my customers, and learning how to work with my fellow baristas on the floor. I was motivated by the challenge to improve our store, both in looks and in numbers."
good,Employees are treated relatively fairly. Amount of break time is nice. Rotation of duties instead of being stuck on one position forever.
good,The work environment was very fast paced and upper management was constantly checking in on productivity. Perfect for motivated people looking for career growth.
good,"I worked there for over a year as a barista, shift supervisor and trainer. My first store was great but I wanted to continue the chance of promotion in the company and that store wasn't able to so I was transferred to another store to become a shift supervisor. "
good,"tolle Arbeit, musste leider wegen meinem umzug kündigen. Perfekter Nebenjob"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. They treat their employee's with respect and take great care of the partners. They offer medical benefits for part time employees, investment opportunites, and training for promotions."
good,"•	Handled store operational tasks as delegated by Store Management"
good,Class A company to work for in retail.  A bit dirtier than some mind you considering the milk and sugar bit about it but that's tolerable with a decent paycheck for entry level.
good,"The Starbucks I worked at was inside of a supermarket therefore it differed from a normal Starbucks. A great number of people quit when I started which often left me working alone or with an employee who did not know how to do anything but use the register. Other then that it was a fast paced work environment which I enjoyed and the employee's were encouraged to try making new drinks. While I worked there I learned how to make a drink that tasted like captain crunch cereal and another that tasted like a turtle cheese cake. This job taught me how to handle and keep happy many people at once while it also improved my ability to multitask. The hardest part of my job was working by myself during rush hour. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning how to make all the drinks, to this day I can still remember how to make all the drinks I enjoyed."
good,the pay was way to low and the work was overwhelming. but great team and customers. i enjoyed the management and the advancement options that were available
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work while still enjoying yourself, your time, and the wonderful customers and coworkers you surround yourself with. You can enjoy how fast the time flies by, how clean and productive the management is, and how efficient the store runs throughout the day. I love the people who come in, the people I work with, and the only complaint I could have is standing in one place for too long."
good,The hours worked were in the early morning serving coffee to the surrounding community. Management maintained a high standard of service and emphasized that on a frequent basis. Job duties were strict and assigned at the beginning of each shift.
good,"I enjoy how people oriented this job is. I am usually given opportunities to exercise my social abilities and ensuring our customers are 100 % satisfied. The training is very thorough, and I enjoy training new baristas a lot. Flexible hours, and a family like environment among my coworkers."
good,"j'ai beaucoup aimée travailler chez Starbucks. J'ai appris à faire beaucoup de chose (café, caisse, entretien, nourriture,etc.)"
good,"I enjoyed workin at starbucks, my typical day consist of serving coffee,cashier & Greeting customers. the management was ok , to me their was'nt any hard part i had adapted quickly"
good,"Decent Company, very good benefits.  Good Staff, and friendly atmosphere.  Created a good team environment.  Enjoyed the time I had there."
good,"Starbucks gives great benefits for people who are even part time.  The fun environment is really dependent on your manager, crew and the majority of customers you see regularly."
good,"The location of the Starbucks I worked at was consistently busy. Being a full time student, the training process took about six months to complete, and over 40+ hours of work a week. I had to end up resigning."
good,This is a fun place to work. There is always something to do. It keeps you busy. The time goes by fast because it keeps you busy and you have a good time.
good,"O ambiente de trabalho era muito tranquilo, apesar das tarefas exigirem agilidade e atenção."
good,"Interacting with customers ,asking them how there day is going, how they like there coffee, what exciting plans they have. The hardest part of the job was just having to drive a distance to get there."
good,"The customers make this environment the casual space it is. I enjoy their interactions. The scheduling is truly personalized to the needs of each individual and its a solid community. I feel like there is rarely and interpersonal relationship  problem, which creates a positive experience for our customers."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be tough with the demands of so many customers; however, the Partners I worked with made it a fun experience overall and the benefits are some of the best in the industry."
good,"very much enjoyed my time at starbucks, fun, friendly co workers and overall staff. the drive thru was incredibly busy but the fast paced environment was fun and would make the day go by faster."
good,"From working at Starbucks I have learned new ways to interact with customers and have definitely improved on making a positive impact on a persons day. I work hard to meet Starbucks standards, while adding my own personal touch. To me it is important to make sure the customer is satisfied because I want them to come back! Our culture is very welcoming and we strive to get to know each customer personally. Being able to have a good relationship with my customers and co-workers is one of the most enjoyable parts of the job. The hardest part of the job would be trying to make up for any mistakes we may have made. We all strive to make the customer happy so for example, if they are upset with their drink we go out of our way to make them happy."
good,I am getting 40 hours or more a week. College reimbursement each semester. Free coffee and benefits. I get tips each week which is about $50 per week.
good,Good for when your are in school but can be challenging at times. Good benefits but the customers suck. There are good days and bad days. Free coffee!!
good,very fun and fast paced environment. they definitely do slave you but the pay is good so its pretty worth it. And they pay weekly so that's even better.
good,"good place to work. Liked the customers and other staff, had great perks and was happy to go to work most days. Always something to do to keep you busy"
good,"This company help me get through my first two years of college and it was great, fast environment but a very fun job if you are a coffee lover. Workplace culture was very welcoming and good for a person who has an engaging personality."
good,For a first job this is okay as a kind of start up place to learn experience but it is difficult. At times it can just seem unprofessional as well.
good,"Great job for college students, HS students, and young adults starting out. Starbucks has many benefits and with a great team you will really enjoy your time there."
good,"Reviewing, interviewing, and hiring store applicants."
good,"This company offers good benefits, and you don't have to work full time. All the interactions with customers are great, and fulfilling."
good,"wonderful atmosphere , great people to work with( baristas ) hours need to be improved . some managment can be rude and lazy , often taking credit for the work of other staff"
good,"The benefits and culture at Starbucks are great, however it is not a liveable wage in a city like Vancouver. Flexible hours for part and full time."
good,"Working at Starbucks is an interesting experience because it truly is unlike any other job I've had. You meet a lot of caffeine-addicted people which is interesting in and of itself. The work itself isn't rocket science, it's all a routine that you just have to memorize and become comfortable with. Working in such a small team has its downfalls though and it can often feel like people are breathing down your neck and you can't get away. It is rewarding work though when you see people enjoy the drinks you made for them and have them express that gratitude."
good,"It can be a very fun job, fun, high energy. However if the management is not willing to take charge and make sure everyone is working as a team. Its not the best place to work."
good,I enjoyed my time there and the people I worked with were very nice. I feel that I have learned a lot in my time there. I learned how to multitask and work in a busy environment by handling both lobby and drive thru.
good,"Didn't work there for the longest time, just under a year. I do not believe I am qualified to make any real judgement about the company, especially from such a long time ago!"
good,"Starbucks can be an amazing place to work. You learn a lot about coffee and they have AMAZING benefits. Promotions happen quickly for those who work hard, and partner accomplishments do not go unnoticed. However, from recent experience, corporate is more sales hungry than ever, simultaneously cutting labor hours and adding workload with new products and all the while raising prices. Ultimately, pocketing more profit making one person do the work of three people. The company provides fantastic benefits, like free pound of coffee or k cups per week, and free college to partners, and excellent health coverage to name a few, but if you don't utilize them the pay being only a little more than minimum wage may not be worth it. They promote quickly from barista, to trainer, and then to shift supervisor, but it plateaus after that and often promotions to assistant store manager take years and labor cuts have created a high turnover rate right now."
good,A day at work was never slow but with the constant pace and a great team following there wasn't much we couldn't handle. Very busy work days but worth it if your there for the right reasons.
good,A typical day at work for me starts out by making the coffee and making prep before the store opens and after opening I attend each customer that walks through the door. I've learned how to deal with difficult customers and how to manage a store and how to approach a customer when a situation has occurred. I get along very well with my co-workers and managers. The most hardest part of my job is when a customer isn't pleased with their visit at starbucks for whatever reason. The most enjoyable part of my day at starbucks is when a customer is very pleased with their visit and having great communication with a guest.
good,"Employees are overwhelmed on a daily due to cheap staffing leading to angered customers that express themselves creating an environment of unnecessary stress. On top of that shift supervisors are placed under a lot of stress to meet unreal goals on a daily. As a result regular baristas as myself are sent home early on a consistent basis when business is slow. "
good,Excellent organization. Company driven to make customer experience amazing. Turnover and training issues. I worked at the Somerset North Mall which is extremely busy especially during holidays season. Enjoyed provide high quality customer service and was excited to see regulars day after day.
good,"Great People, Love Starbucks. Its great to form Relationships with the staff and guests as well. Starbucks is such a fun environment"
good,"Starbucks is a great fun, fast paced working environment. I greatly enjoyed my time there and I would definitely recommend it as a place of work to anyone looking for a job in customer service."
good,"Job is nice for making connections"
good,"The Starbucks store I worked at in located in the Krogers marketplace in Bossier, La. I've had a good experience at Starbucks, I've learned many things about coffee. Starbucks is a great place to work that allows me to interact with the customers."
good,"Aside from my managers not having everything together mentally, the company itself is pretty good to work for. Nice benefits and it's a good place to work part-time if you enjoy fast-pace environments with a lot of personal interaction and teamwork."
good,"Colleagues were amazing. Fun and eventful days at work. Making coffee, practicing the foam art, all in a days work. When we weren't getting orders through the window, cleaning and ensuring the areas were clean, were also a part of the daily duties."
good,"Customers are amazing and loyal once they know you put them first.  Working in a drive thru store requires multi-tasking at a whole other level if you are a shift or store manager.  Must ensure routines are followed at all times, otherwise good intentions from staff can cause chaos quickly.  Great company and AMAZING benefits if you work for corporate store.  Don't waste your time with license store though, because it doesn't come close in benefits."
good,I enjoyed being around my nice and helpful co-workers. It was fun learning how to make drinks and explaining to customers what their drinks consisted of.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, the only thing I didn't like was the fact that we have a lead that hated his job and it showed he left messes for everyone to clean and would leave people alone to work. they didn't want to fire him because they didn't have anyone else to take his job, I don't feel like that was good managment."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks the my coworkers and management were great! Couldn't of been happier with that career choice in my life thanks Starbucks for the opportunity
good,"Daily interaction with customers and fellow coworker in a fun, friendly environment, where every members work together as a team to provide a better morning/day to the customers and team members as well."
good,"Most days it's a little hectic, but it is nice to see the same customers every day and get to know them a little better. It really does take a good team to be efficient as possible and Starbucks does a good job training employees."
good,"As a shift supervisor I helped run the routine of the baristas working at the time. I give out breaks and assign tasks."
good,"Great company, great benefits. Low hours. I have had great managers up until my current. Co workers are great and customers, for the most part, are pretty great. Expect a very fast paced environment."
good,"good place to work, good hours, good management, good benefits, pretty decent pay, tips are always a bonus.  super fun atmosphere, chill dress code"
good,"I liked the high energy of the environment, but it was a little unorganized, and I have complaints about the the level of professional my managers were. I wasn't taught very much during training."
good,A typical day in my store is fast pace. A lot of customers and very with very little time so the experience needs to be right the first time. The hardest part of my job is keeping my baristas happy and with the want to be at work. The most enjoyable part of my job is guiding and helping new partners to be excellent baristas. As well as seeing the succeed and grow from where they started.
good,"Management was great when I started, but quickly deteriorriated. Hours aren't consistent and pay as a tenured barista isn't that wonderful. Co workers and bond you create with them is fun and uplifting."
good,"The people i worked with were awesome but the work was very repetitive although this is the same with any sort of retail work, its making coffee and clearing tables."
good,I enjoyed working with the Starbucks staff. I learned to work quickly with my hands and adapt to a system of business that I knew nothing about until I worked for the franchise.
good,"Starbucks is a great job, if only minimum wage. Mine is particularly busy tho it is a fun place to work at (I made awesome friends there) !"
good,"Starbucks has been a fast paced and upbeat work environment, which has allowed me to grow and increase my knowledge of customer service and sales.  During my time with Starbucks, my most enjoyable time has been being able to meet new customers and employees."
good,The pay is not worth it.  I've worked through all of my breaks (unpaid) just to keep the store afloat.  Eyes on the prize: benefits and paycheck: enough to get by UNcomfortably
good,Fast pace skills required in order to respond for customer needs. The flow how they organize all of the partners(staff) and the business.
good,"Starbucks can be a very good company to work for. The people are great, the product is excellent, the culture and environment fr the most part is very satisfying."
good,Working here was fun but definitely draining. Your staff team makes all the difference for whether or not you can get through the work day.
good,"•	Responsible for maintaining drive-thru times, drink accuracy, and customer service. "
good,"there are 3 main responsibilities for a barista making drinks, supporting customers, or being on the register. Most often during a shift people get to alternate jobs so that it isn't a long day on one thing. Managers are very flexible with scheduling and appreciating people who are in school or work a second job like myself."
good,"A typical shift included greeting guests, preparing coffee, taking inventory, leading and attending meetings with Hyatt Management, and supervising staff while maintaining a clean and inviting marketplace"
good,Starbucks is great company to work for. Its retail so it has its downsides but the benefits make it worth while. It is all about the people you work with. They cn make or break a store.
good,"it is a very good company to work with. not enough hours, fast pace. modern, good image of the company."
good,"Agradable ambiente de trabajo, dinámicos, mucha simpatía con la gente, cercanía"
good,"Despite it's stressful nature, life as a barrista was pretty great. Management clearly outlined what was expected of their employees. Great co-workers and a fun work environment."
good,"Starbucks is a fun company to work for, especially when I did part time and college. Really gave me experience to learn and talk to people along with managerial experience."
good,"Unfortunately for me, I worked with 2 different managers within a year, my store location was not ideal but other than the time and some of the customers due to the area the job itself is easy and fun!"
good,I would go back in a heart beat.  Loved the company.  It just so happened that the certain district I was working for was a little violent.
good,Short staffed not enough people to do everything needed to be done effectively. Hardest part is managing time to get things dine as well as giving breaks while being shirt staffed on a regular.
good,"50% off food on shift"
good,Starbucks is a very good company to work for. They take care of their employees and have very good health benefits. If you wish to move up in the company just put in the hard work and you will find yourself on your way.
good,"I started with Starbucks in my early twenties, and have worked my way through the ranks over the day twelve years. No company is perfect, but I appreciate the concern for partners' quality of life, the environmental stewardship, and the progressive business practices."
good,"On a typical day I would work from 11am to 8pm with a half an hour and a ten minute break. "
good,Starbucks is the best job I've had so far. They have a lot of great benefits and care about their workers. Management could be better. I feel like they should hire managers who were already baristas. Sometimes it's hard for the managers to understand the struggles of a barista because they have never been one.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, they have great benefits and stock options.Each day normally went well and everything was organized, co-workers were friendly and management was manageable. The hardest part of the job was getting drinks and food out on time and correctly when the line is wrapped around the store and the line inside is out the door. What makes this job enjoyable is the  customers who know you by name and go out of there way to ask how your day has been or how you're doing. I'm a people person so I love interacted with the customers and getting to know there name and what they drink."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a fun and busy job, constantly making one of a kind drinks for customers from all over the world. Favorite area to work in was the Cold Bar making only the best Frappicino's."
good,"A typical 8 hour day"
good,Of course in any job whoever works there the longest will get favoritism but its unfair to other employees trying to move up when theyre not given the chance. i was always stuck making whipped cream all day and never got a chance to be more hands on and learn new things.
good,Very busy and fast paste environment was a typical day as a barista. Being able to make customers happy with good service was the positive aspect of the job.
good,"A typical day would require me to prepare cash drawers and manage safe banks, as well as deposits and interaction with courier services. "
good,"I had a blast working here and learning all that I did. I had an incredible manager and I made some great customer interactions. Corporate can be a problem, they are so harsh for it being coffee. I hated the hours too. No one should be awake at 3:30 am.. It was the best first job I could've ever asked for though."
good,Fun and productive workplace. Management wasn't very inviting. Co-workers were great. Days would get busy. Most enjoyable part about working at sbux was getting to work with great individuals and creating friendships with customers and co-workers.
good,"Clima laboral bastante calido, estandares de la empresa bien estipulado en cuestion a los procesos de producción, innovación constante dentro la empresa, evaluaciones bimestrales de desempeño que generaban la posibilidad de un aumento de puesto."
good,I loved the co-workers and supervisor. Starbucks is always busy from when it opens till it closes. Hardest part of the job was when it got understaffed.
good,"Helps get professional training "
good,"Always busy and chaotic, but a great environment. I learned so much customer service skills and how to react and handle stressful situations. My co-workers are fantastic and make the job so much more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was getting to work along side friends and getting to know the regulars and having their drinks memorized."
good,"Management has provided me compensation and flexibility in work schedule in my time spent working there.  Many times the turn-over is a bit much, but we made it thru.  Good opportunity overall."
good,I learned a lot here. Benefits are well if you're full time. Very fast paced. Management sucks! But a job is a job. Don't expect to grow unless you kiss butt. Other than that not a bad job.
good,Working at Starbucks has taught me a lot about adapting quickly to different working conditions such as a rapid change in pace and continuing costumer service thru unexpected complications. My time at Starbucks has prepared me well for further management opportunities. Overall I have developed a strong appreciation for team work and serving the community.
good,"Was a great place to work if the store vibes with you. If you don't fit, personalities collide and makes close quarters hard to work in"
good,"Working at the Brent Cross Shopping Centre shop, I have the opportunity to get involved with the other staff and costumers, not just for making a very nice cup of coffee, but to interact with the public and the local culture"
good,the pay isn't very good at. but if the cost of living was less I would have stayed a barista all my life. making coffee for people and having them leave with a smile was always worth it.
good,"Early days."
good,"For a couple of weeks during the summer, Starbucks has Frappy-Hour, which is half off all frappacinos for the specified time period.  The first day of frappy-hour, we were short a couple of people at work, which forced me to have to endure the half off frappacino special on my own.  Normally there would be 3 people working bar but this day there was only 1 and it was me.  I think I did exceptionally well due to how unbelievably busy it was and to the rate of frappacinos being ordered during that time.  This example shows my willingness to persevere through difficult work moments when most of the responsibility is on my shoulders."
good,"The company gave me the opportunity to develop myself. it has trained me to be a competitive individual. i have grown so much with the help of the management team, co workers, and up to the big bosses who nurtured us to be the best in our field."
good,"Starbucks offers a fun environment to work in and has great benefits, but doesn't pay you hardly anything. They want you to work all the time for hardly any money and they also never work with your requests for days off. Even when you ask months ahead of time. I learned that the hardest part of the job is trying to get enough money to live off of. Its a fun part time job but I wouldn't recommend it if you need a livable wage."
good,The typical day at Starbucks  I would be on register ringing up customer and after all the rushes are over i clean and restock the building .  The hardest part about working there is the management  there are 3 different managers and the all prioritize different things.
good,Hand crafting customers beverages as they were ordered and with that creating a special experience for each and every guest.
good,"I began working at Starbucks a year ago and I can't say I have many complaints. The employees at Starbucks are treated with respect and are constantly appreciated/encouraged by management. "
good,"Hard, physical labor, repetitive movements.  Oftentimes the management is either too focused on business and not employees and customers.  Or too focused on just having fun and not sticking to policies.  The starbucks plan works, but not everyone works it like it should be worked."
good,"Great place to work at , enjoyed serving my customers. Easy to learn.Easy to keep up with once you get to know how everything goes."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced, customer focused place of work, where the product quality is always held in high regard. They provide great benefits and flexible hours, and are staffed with hard-working friendly employees."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful environment for employees and customers. Dedicated to delicious beverages and food as well as speed of service.
good,"In order to advance within the company it didn't matter what your performance was, as long as you were part of the correct employee clique."
good,"Opened, trained and operated fast pace high end cafe. Reviewed P&L daily operations, admin, schedules and employee training"
good,I mastered the art of being a starbucks barista and it was not worth the minimum pay for such physical labor. My boss definitely played favorites.
good,"Not enough hours, but good solid work.  Good benefits if you actually take advantage of them.  Mostly everybody you work with is awesome, no matter what store."
good,Great for students. Flexible schedule with a variety of perks including but not limited to free drinks and food mark- outs. Immersion in community service and stock and bond options. Lets not forget 401k
good,"High volume, production atmosphere.  I love seeing the regular customers and fulfilling their needs.  "
good,"Fun place to work, very busy but still learn lots of important things about coffee, drinks and the customers. Happy I am here."
good,It was always a high energy environment and everyone always worked hard which made me want to work hard as well. Everyday was different and that kept it interesting and fun to work there.
good,"You get to work with coffee, so life cannot be too bad. The only thing I disliked was after being slammed ALL day you then had to do a million and one dishes."
good,"Starbucks provides a great friendly working environment with challenges along the way. A typical day includes many MANY tasks, including, Cashiering, making drinks, cleaning, food handling, maintaining a professional atmosphere, handling customers and providing goods and services, all withing the same day. The hardest part of the job can be keeping track of everything that needs to be done and making sure that the customer's orders are always correct and accurate especially if working in a drive thru. Overall, Starbucks is a lot of fun for those who love a fast paced atmosphere and who like to make other people smile by making sure their day starts off right with a great cup of coffee while making friend and memories along the way."
good,Working at Starbucks is rather nerve racking at least in my position. The location of the store I'm a supervisor at is always packed and there is never a slow day. This being said it is exhausting and there are days I end up having to stay an extra hour or two after close because of how busy we are. This is still a rewarding job because it has taught me how to better manage my time as well as learn how to take a leadership role.
good,"Starbucks can be a fun place to work, in terms of retail work during college education. However, the amount of stress that comes with working, especially to shift supervisors (who are essentially treated as managers, but without the pay) is not worth the low pay grade that Starbucks has not been keen on raising."
good,"Busy environment, crammed quarters but often times fun nonetheless. Television directly in front of register so it passed the time."
good,"Aprendí que el ambiente laboral es muy necesario para que los trabajos se sientan a gusto con su trabajo y puedan desempeñarse de una manera correcta. Con un grato ambiente laboral, puedes brindar un excelente servicio a los clientes."
good,"A typical day at work is never boring, you're always around new people.  I learned a lot of hands on, customer service experience.  Serving the public is hard and definitely not for everyone, but I loved it.  Management depends on each store.  Your co workers are aren't always going to be like you, or easy to get along with but my co workers were a blast.  The hardest part of the job is being fast and on your feet.  The most enjoyable part is making people happy."
good,"im in need of a job,  i cannot do for my children without a job"
good,Starbucks has a very fast paced and productive work environment. I learned excellent people skills working with the general public on a day to day basis.  Management was very encouraging and patient with partners.  Co-workers were very friendly and enthusiastic about the company.  The hardest part of the job was trying to be personable with customers while juggling multiple tasks in a timed environment.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to work with the public and meet all different types of people.
good,"On a typical day, I made beverages and followed health standards to provide a great customer experience. At the store, I learned how to resolve conflicts and always assume positive intent. My manager was great and so were coworkers."
good,"This is a great company to work for. Aside from the occasional HORRIBLE customer, applying here is going to be one of the best decisions of your life...IF you can handle Starbucks controlling you with no consideration to your health or social life."
good,I loved working at Starbucks and would recommend this job to anyone looking for a first job. Great management and senior staff. Starbucks takes customer service to a whole new level. Great.
good,Starbucks upheld a small corporate atmosphere while serving thousands of customers a day. The coworkers and managers gave constructive criticisms that produced great work ethic. Barista positions held no down time and required powerful ambition alongside motivation.
good,"Starbucks has a great training place for employees at all levels. They have a great atmosphere, and good developmental opportunities."
good,Love being a barista and it could be a fun exciting environment to broaden skill sets for the workforce and build creativity given the right circumstances along with the environment.
good,"It was a fun place to work at simply because of the co-workers and the customers. You develop a certain intimacy and friendship with them and it makes everything feel special, also because the product was good and it was fun to sell as well. The hardest part of the job but the one I loved the most was the rush-hours; the excitement, the rush, the adrenaline, it made time go by so fast. In a blink of an eye, it was already over."
good,"A typical day at work would be meeting people through common interests."
good,Overall working at Starbucks was a good experience with customer service along  with learning skills such as multi tasking and organization.
good,"Perfect for college student addicted to coffee. Easy work if you are passionate. Good for part time work. Benefits are good if you need them, not many of my coworkers actually use them"
good,"a typical day consists of greeting customers, serving them, making high quality beverages and food while providing a choice of various cakes, cookies, muffins and snack bars. Also clearing tables and making sure that the work place is cleaned to a high standard at all times."
good,"Too much pressure for the pay. Management expects you to smile every second and heaven forbid you stand still for half a second. "
good,Enjoyable environment with great coworkers. Plenty of perks and great experience overall. I enjoyed the communication with clients and getting to know people. Very personable job with great rewards.
good,"The hardest part of my job at Starbucks is learning to accomidate all my co-workers to ensure that they are enjoying their job. I have learned how customer service should look like and how important it is. I have learned how to manage and balance the safe, how to close tills and how to distribute tills. The best part of this job is not only my co-workers, but the connections I have created with the customers."
good,"A typical day at work involved rotating positions on the floor and dealing with all kinds of customers.  I learned that in order to be successful at this job you must be very flexible and have the ability to give excellent customer service while simultaneously doing behind the counter work.  My co-workers were my favourite thing about the job as everyone was very welcoming and I made life-long friends.  The most difficult part of the job was closing shifts where baristas were expected to complete cleaning tasks & duties, as well as provide outstanding customer service.  Overall, if you are a flexible and versatile person who has excellent customer service skills, a job at Starbucks would be a good fit for you."
good,Your shift will go smoother when all employees are well trained. Your availability will decide which of your co workers you will be working with the most.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of just making drinks and keeping the work area clean. I learned how to make a variety of drinks. Management was good, never has a problem and they were very understanding in some situations. My co-workers were decent. Sometimes they wouldnt show up for shifts so that became an issue. Hardest part was getting to and from work because I lived on the other side of town. And as a full-time student it was difficult to get to work RIGHT after school. The hours were inconvenient in the sense that on school days I would either work at 3PM or not at all because they closed at 7. (I worked at a Starbucks in a Safeway). But the most enjoyable part was making some new relationships with the customers."
good,huge company the pay is okay for college students and part time workers after 6 months you get benefits over all it okay working here
good,Very pleasant place to work and employees are well respected. I would recommend anyone who loves coffee to work for them
good,My time at this company has been great! Sometimes you can't predict how busy each day will be. Learning to provide great customer service is a major part of the company and it teaches you a lot on how to make guests happy!
good,Coworkers were sweethearts there was never a time that people did not want to not show up at work because of another employee. As always and like in any work place there are occasional disputes but nothing that couldn't be solved. Some stored had AMAZING managers and some had HORRIBLE management it was really how lucky you got. My experience was great management and coworkers were supportive and always there.
good,"A typical day at work consists of getting things ready to open the store, making customers drinks, dealing with complaints and trying to make it right, cleaning, and closing. Co-workers are amazing to work with, with a variety of ages, experiences and points of view. The most enjoyable, as well as sometimes most difficult, aspect of this job is the customers. I have learned that I am capable of doing anything I set my mind to."
good,"I worked in a really busy store in central Croydon. Thanks to that and my position within the company i was required to think fast, make important decisions on the fly to meet expectations of store as well as district managers. I set up plenty of new promotions within the store, dealt with orders on a daily basis which required planning in advance. Apart from that my role was to manage the team to make sure everything goes smoothly and company's standards are met."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for they have great training and are very flexible with scheduling people. they help you succeed in the areas that you need support in.
good,"I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. There were so many people that came in early in the morning on their way to work still tired and dreary. I would tell them, ""Good morning."" and have a nice little conversation as they waited for their drink. It was nice to be able to learn about people that way which was a huge perk.The hardest part of the job for me would be learning all the different drinks and being able to make them efficiently."
good,"Managed shifts which included up to ten employees"
good,"A typical day at work included working and communicating effectively with customers, as well as coworkers. Employees learn different aspects of the job and learn how to do each position, including hot bar, cold bar, drive through operations, front counter, and store support. "
good,"Less artsy than I had expected, but a great place to work for college students.  Flexible hours and fun work place. It seems like the workplaces tend to vary depending on where the Starbucks is located."
good,"A typical day at work included:"
good,"I worked for Starbucks in my Albertsons grocery store. It was a fun job, it was not too difficult. Most of the customers were very pleasant and I enjoy making the drinks."
good,"What I loved about Managing Starbucks was the customers. I quickly learned names and drinks of my usuals and could sometimes start their drink before they even step up to the counter. I not only mastered every beverage but I was given the opportunity to sample concoctions I made up. "
good,My duties included weekly and daily deep cleaning. We would get a large volume and I would have to keep a cool demeaner while making drinks correctly and not having anyone wait more than 3 minutes. Great customer service was a must.
good,"Work experience at Starbucks was a blast. All of the partners I worked with are supportive, wonderful people. Every day was different, and I learned a great deal in the month I was there."
good,Starbucks is a great place for you to gain customer service experience and connect with customers on a reoccurring and significant level. It's been a blessing to gain the experience of providing world class customer service.
good,I enjoyed working  with and helping different types of people. I worked morning shift so I would help with the set up for the day. I learned many different  facts and types of coffee anyteas.
good,"The job overall is a great job, and I enjoy it a lot. My concerns are for the management team. While my supervisors are superb, my manager needs to work on his communication skills, and building a team."
good,"On a typical day I am constantly multi-tasking making customers drinks, and keeping up on our tasks for the night. I have learned how to budget my time and multi-task efficiently while I've been at Starbucks. The management could be improved by opening up options to advance in the company. My coworkers were all fun lively people who were great to be around. The most enjoyable part of this job is the ability to work together towards one goal and the satisfaction that is reached when that goal is reached."
good,"Es una empresa líder que te ofrece algunos beneficios, pero desde mi punto de vista te quita otros."
good,"Lots of room for advancement. Great place to work, but management is sometimes hard to approach. Although it is difficult to approach, they are usually quite pleasant."
good,"Working as a barista has improved my multitasking skills along with the ability to think and act fast. Even more, it has taught me the importance of customer service while strengthening my skills with customers and coworkers."
good,Great place to work as a college student. Most exciting pro for me was the weekly disbursement of tips. Decent managerial staff. The most enjoyable part about working at Starbucks was the different connections I made everyday with my customers.
good,"Open store, prepared the coffee, cleaned work station, great atmosphere for work, no future to improve, staff friendly, hours ok, and management was good also."
good,"Every day is different. New people, new situations and new solutions. I am grateful for opportunity to develop myself and to get promoted while I was a full time student. Over my four years of experience I have seen a few managers and how their performance affects store's performance. Starbucks have taught me what it takes to run a successful store and how to achieve targets with the people and tools that I had. I have learnt how crucial a good communication with the team and managers is to the business. "
good,Starbucks was the same routine everyday. Got to meet new people and conversate with the families and residents. Get to have 3 days off no matter wat
good,"I enjoy working for the Starbucks Coffee Company.  I have expanded my knowledge on various types of coffees and teas the company has to offer, and I can successfully explain to customers the differences between the various drinks that we offer."
good,"Working at Starbucks you are required to be fast, multi-tasking effectively and socially engaging. Customer interaction is an enjoyable part of working there - meeting great people and finding out more about their lives. Working along great coworkers and management is enlightening. Starbucks has great benefits and tuition reimbursement - even for part timers!"
good,"The most enjoyable aspect of this job was interacting with customers face to face. You knew immediately how your service was received. As a large company it could be challenging, at times to meet with nationwide expectations, but this also served to foster a solid team environment where we looked out for each other. Personality conflicts happened from time to time but were never insurmountable and everyone did their best to work as a team and get through the harrier parts of the days. At times the expectations of head office were a little unrealistic but that's understandable with such a large corporation. I learned to work calmly and efficiently under pressure and to lead my team through clear communication and setting positive examples."
good,"At Starbucks, I've made lots of long lasting relationships between my coworkers and regular customers. No job is easy. Management really understands that you're a person and you have your needs."
good,"I lead a team of up to 15 members during busy mornings. If you don't mind waking up early, it's a great job with decent pay and wonderful benefits."
good,"Best part of work is your co-workers. Working as a team for business success. Flexible hours, great for students or for people with two jobs. Don't expect a significant raise as a barista or shift supervisor."
good,My experience with Starbucks has been a sorted tale. But regardless Starbucks has always been there when I needed a solid home to come back to. Welcoming me back with open arms and smiling faces.
good,"good workplace, great place to learn how to be a manager. managerial decisions not always in the best interest of the employee"
good,"Great place to work! Learned a lot about a lot of customers, coworkers, etc. Every day was a different day its not just showing up and making coffee all day but the overall experience of the day that counts."
good,"We brew coffee every half hour and make drinks for our guests. We are employed by Target but are trained by Starbucks. I learned how to create all drinks on the Starbucks Menu. I don't have any management skills except for training new baristas how to complete a closing shift (cleaning tasks and closing down). It really is a team effort with my co-workers. One barista would take orders and ring up the guests, and the other barista would make the beverages. The hardest part of the job is managing daily tasks (making coffee sauces) and also helping guests. Sometimes these tasks overlapped and it was stressful. The most enjoyable is honestly making people's day by bringing them the coffee they ordered."
good,Co-workers always there to help and coach employees on new products. Management flexible and approachable when it comes to questions needed to be asked.
good,It's a very fun place to work at. Very active and interactive with guest. Good benefits and great co-workers. Hardest part would be learning all the recipes in a short time.
good,"Busy in the mornings. Weekly tips. A relaxed yet high paced place to work. But you would enjoy working there. There is not much else to say, but they have a writing minimum, which is weird."
good,Working with Starbucks is fun as we work as a team. Management is giving equal opportunity to every team member. We are considering each other as a partner at Starbucks. We respect each other and helping each other at every phase. We always walk an extra mile to help our customer. We genuinely believe that our product and the way we make our product is exceptionally top class.
good,Everybody brought something towards our second shift team which made us the best shift along with that we made our job a competition we wanted to make everybody better at their job as well as create a bond and be productive it was a good experience.
good,"Von der Kassenübernahme bis zum Kassenabschluß fallen viele Tätigkeiten an wie z. B. Geträke zubereiten, Shop auffüllen und Reinigen, Beratung und Bestellung der Ware."
good,working for Starbucks for so many years gave me the opportunity to make many lasting relationships with other employees and our customers. i enjoyed training and leading my baristas
good,Starbucks got my foot in the door and allowed me to grow and gain basic skills needed to thrive in business. I took it as more than a normal job and reached out to the resources they make available for me to grow personally.
good,i enjoyed working at Starbucks. My customer service skills have greatly improved. Ive learned to stay calm in stressful situations and i work great with others.
good,"We've all seen the jokes out there of ""I can't keep calm, I'm a barista"", well it's kind of true. It can become very stressful when you're in the middle of a rush and one person is slowing everyone down, but if you focus and breathe and just take it one step at a time, it can become a lot of fun.."
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits and Bean Stock options for all full-time and even some part-time partners. My position as a shift supervisor has me busy all day with serving customers, daily cleaning duties and other responsibilities such as placing the daily milk and paper order, food inventory count, bank deposits and running breaks and deployment on the floor."
good,"Very fast paced work environment with emphasis on creating a wholesome customer service environment."
good,"Co-workers were easy to get along with.  Custom ers could be difficult at times.  Benefits were fair.  Hours were difficult.  Different "
good,"Starting out You get to learn the basics of the basics, after that you get thrown in there, learning through practice. Moving from one station to another until you get it down.  Over all it is a very fast paced environment with little room for error."
good,Very fast paced work environment. Perfect for building customer service skills and abilities needed to work well on a team.
good,The experience sharpened my customer service skills and interpersonal communication with others. The most enjoyable of the job was seeing the customers enjoying their experience and their beverage is made to their satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was irate customers that are being unreasonable when we are trying to accommodate their every whim.
good,Starbucks was a good place to work at. All the partners were super friendly and helpful. Management was understanding with most situations. Hardest part was learning how to delegate as a new supervisor.
good,"Starbucks was a great company to gain experience.  It pushed my limits for customer service, business acumen, and leadership style.  What I found the lacking was the compensation.  The company spends a lot of time focusing on the total pay package which is extremely comprehensive but for the role of store manager I think the financial compensation is not enough.  The work life balance of a store manager is severely compromised by the fact that the store manager is expected to be on call 24/7 and they are reprimanded by district managers for not being available, no matter what that person may be doing in their personal life.  The position of store manager is highly underrated in the Starbucks Corporation.  They really should be paid +$20,000 more than they are paid."
good,"A fun and relaxed work place where partners make each location feel the same for customers."
good,Gave me the confidence that I can handle many tasks at the same time with out loosing my head or quieting. I really did enjoy meeting and greetin so many personalities.
good,Working with Starbucks was a very fast paced job. The people and the environment made the employes want to succeed. The company is also very keen on making sure all of their products are fair-trade and made with the best of intentions.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. I've made great friends working there, the benefits were excellent, and everyone was always friendly."
good,"Starbucks requires their employees to be personable and provide exceptional customer service constantly! You're provided with thorough training on how to create Starbucks beverages by exact recipe and gain knowledge on different kinds and qualities of coffee. You must work well with others and adhere to the corporate policies at this job. You need to be able to multi-task well and work under pressure. Certain hours of the day are incredibly busy and for some this can feel too stressful or overwhelming. There are many cleaning tasks. Shifts begin very early in the morning in most stores, but luckily, you don't have to worry about stopping for caffeine on the way! Employees, or ""Partners"" get a pound of Starbucks coffee beans (or there are other options if you don't enjoy coffee) each week!"
good,making a lot of coffee drinks and make sure the area is clean. periods of really busy times but is a good company to work for.
good,"Great place to work while you are in school. Flexible schedules, benefits for part timers. Plus tips and discounts. Great way to connect with people."
good,Fast paced and high volumes of customers. The partners are very close and work well together as a team. Management is helpful and supportive of partners. It is a great place to work and earn extra money.
good,Fun environment with co workers while working at a fast pace. Quality is important as well as the ability to handle stress.
good,"A normal day at starbucks was to be there ten minutes early, get clocked in and get moving. I learned so much about the products, company and people for my time at starbucks. I learned better customer service, more patience. The management was pretty good overall. I would say my only complaint was the managers were never on the same page and made it very known to everyone. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rushes, morning, after school, etc. The most enjoyably was seeing the regulars everyday and really getting to know them in a personal manner."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, part-time job that college students would love. Starbucks focuses on the young savvy guests, and keeping tones upbeat."
good,The company Starbucks overall have taught me to always be understanding and listen. Learn What the customer want and to fix problems with smiles. Learned to communicate on a personal and professional way.
good,"Overall I loved my time at starbuck's and wish i could have stayed.  great benefits, smart upper management!  Fast paced multi-tasking is a must or your life will suck!"
good,"Co- workers made it a pleasure to go to work. Daily ambiguity made for challenges that allowed me to learn to think with haste, resolve customer and partner relations in a timely manner, and to handle difficult situations with ease"
good,Poor quality standards at Harris Teeter Starbucks because management simply wasn't involved and no one was held to the standards that the stand alone Starbucks' are.
good,"its a good experience because you will have good knowledge about coffee and barista skills, meeting interesting people(customer). Its a good working environment because we treat our co worker as partner who contribute together for the growth of the company."
good,I had a very high volume and high stress store. We all worked hard and worked together to make a functional store that met customer expectations.
good,"was fun to make coffee and interact with customers, and hand out samples of new products, enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,The hours were really long and the job was rain or shine but I loved the work so it wasn't a big deal. I got to work with some of the top vets at UC Davis. I got to help with all aspects of the horses from birth to track. It was a great experience.
good,"It was so much fun! My typical shift consisted of me coming in and starting right away on helping out the staff that was already there. I would refill syrups, milks, change the garbages, warm up pastries, etc. I would also jump onto cold or hot bar depending and start preparing and serving beverages. It can be busy sometimes and that can be overwhelming but that also is adrenaline boosting. I love the customers, I love making that connection with first time customers or the regulars that come in every day. My co-workers were mostly students although there were a couple union employees and supervisors. We all had such a great rapport and would cover one another when we could. The management was fun as well, firm but that's what made Starbucks run well."
good,Great big company with great big plans for Teavana. They are still finding the right mix of Teavana and Starbucks as the head office relocates to Seattle.
good,"the managers are very helpful  they love to see you succeed and eventually move in the career field the employees and customers are very nice its a great place to work, keeps you busy"
good,"I enjoyed making drinks for customers, and cleaning up was easy. Co-workers were decent. I rung up people for their drinks and provided friendly and fast service."
good,"I meet some amazing friends here. Plus, it was a great way to learn how to interact with customers in a corporate setting."
good,Really enjoyed the people and connecting with customers on a daily basis. Advancement seemed slow and difficult. Overall aspects of this job were clear and fun to do.
good,"Good enviroment if you like working in customer service. Free coffee while working!! Hard work, but rewarding. Great benefits!!"
good,"Fun place to work if you don't plan in advancing in the company. If you want to move up you will be expected to do lots of extra work; most of it off the clock aka unpaid. They want you to go above and beyond your pay grade for a potential chance at a $2.00 raise and 10,000 more responsibilities. Great if your just a barista but not worth it to be a supervisor."
good,"Maintained exemplary customer service while perfecting orders from customers, kept a balanced cash drawer, worked as a team with other crew members and management."
good,"Working at starbucks was a great job, it had many benefits and perks. However, the company tried to hard to make us make connections with customers. This made conversations forced and the company seem pretentious."
good,Open store close store make drinks take orders prep give breaks and lunches give change set up retail displays and end caps
good,"was a face paced job where you always had to be on your feet, my coworkers were great and most of the customers were really nice"
good,"A normal day at Starbucks would include cleaning tasks, customer service, drink preparation, constantly washing dishes, brewing fresh coffee, sweeping and wiping down tables in the cafe, making sure the ready to drink (RTD) case was stocked, restocking pastries throughout the day, and doing it all quick and with a good attitude. This does not include the delivery days where everything needs freshness labels, be put in the fridge, unpacked, or restocked. While the job was at times tedious, I did enjoy Starbucks. I learned a lot about time management and being able to operate by myself, how to deal with customers, especially on days when you really don't want to deal with customers, and overall the responsibilities of a job in food/customer service. Would recommend as a first job to anyone. You'll definitely be thrown into the deep end, but even a doggy paddle can keep you afloat."
good,"Very energetic, productive and fun."
good,"Typically I would stay at cash taking orders. I would make drinks often, and learned to handle large orders at once and to be quick and efficient. Management taught me to handle rushes as well as keeping the customers happy. I got along with all my co-workers as we depended on each other to run efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job was the connection I develop with customers. The hardest part of the job would be the constant standing as well as the heavy lifting."
good,"Going into my job everyday was always enjoyable. Getting to interact with different people everyday and learning more about the regulars that frequented my location each day. My job allowed me to really interact with people on more than just a "" here's your coffee have a great day"" moment. I enjoyed creating inspired moments in each person days starting with a delicious cup of coffee.. The community work I was able to do, donating coffee to local organization that were raising money to better the community. Seeing how appreciative everyone was to have me offer to help in anyway I could. Being able to donate left over food to those that were less fortunate. Yes the hours were long and you will always have people that want to make your day bad, but being able to work with my peers to overcome getting angry and dealing with situations in the best way possible."
good,This was my first Job that really required PATIENCE and really learned that the customer is always right. This job could really take a tow on you unless you're willing to work for the experience. They really push you to your extreme
good,"Very busy fast paced fun environment, meet new people everyday. always being able to put a smile one at least one persons day!"
good,Management was ok. I received good hours that worked with my school schedule. I enjoyed learning how to make the different drinks and meeting new people
good,Regulars were very common in Starbucks and eventually they can just walk in and you'll know what they are ordering. Memorizing all the different drinks took a little bit of time but this job taught me how to multitask and work fast and well under pressure. Hardest part of the job would be costumers asking for your opinion and so you recommend something chocolate (my favorite) ad they inform you they don't like chocolate so you will recommend something else and they don't like that either so you ask questions to better get an idea of what they want and after everything they order something chocolate....
good,As long as your friendly and can brew a mean coffee this is a good job while your a student! limited room for growth with in the company however an employee gets a raise every 6 months and gets wicked health benefits!
good,"The weekly pay and the perks are what makes the job tolerable but overall the Mangement (Shifts, ASM, Store Managers) is a bust and are only looking out their own jobs and best interest. It teaches you to deal with rude customers and helps hone your customer service skills."
good,A typical day would involve correct shipments and timely dispatch to over 150 stores daily.  It was a daily challenge for on time dispatch.  This was a great learning experience for the Operations side of distribution.  I enjoyed this job.
good,"I've loved the two years I've spent at Starbucks. I'm only 19 and they helped me promote within the company to a Shift Supervisor position. A typical day is DIFFICULT and definitely not for everyone. There is a lot that needs to be done in a given day, and the store is consistently busy. If you have a good store manager, and they staff you properly, you can have a good time and get all your work done if you focus. If your manager does not schedule you properly you are royally screwed. I've had to stay 2 hours late on days when I came in 2 hours early when we are poorly scheduled and/or staffed. A bad manager can make a store really bad. "
good,"Everybody works hard and very productive."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks as a part-time job while studying at University, as it was relatively flexible around my lectures and deadlines."
good,"- A typical day at work would be, attending customers needs with great attitude and serving their order at their request."
good,"The best part of the job was the fast-paced style, as well as the coworkers. Customer service is difficult, because some people just love to find things to complain about. This job has definitely raised my patience and problem solving skills."
good,I have been working here for few months. The first thing I was able to notice is the company has a great culture and brand. The area of growth is the way personal development is handled (i.e. there is a lack of delegated time for it as well as it is not held as a priority).
good,"being a barista at Starbucks good and bad.."
good,I was a supervisor and learned how to be a team leader at this job. I learned a great deal of costumer service at this job. Working here i learned how to be in charge and how to lead others.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. In the management positions far more than 40 hours a week were required, but the benefits package was very good."
good,"Starbucks really help me develop my multi-tasking skills. I was having to do five different things all at once. I was making sure the coffee was being brewed every 20 minutes, helping people at the register, finishing my tasks assigned to me for that day, and also making drinks customized to each customer. I was already skilled in giving great customer service to people, but Starbucks helped further those skills. I learned how to thrive in a fast-paced environment and learned to love that type of atmosphere."
good,"Great environment, great benefits, love the starbucks culture. It was a fun place to work, however the company is very strict with policies."
good,I worked my way from barista to manager.  It was a great company to work for.  Overall the time I spent there was rewarding.  They had pretty good benefits and the pay for work was good.  They really take care of long term employees.
good,"Outils de gestion efficace"
good,This was an enjoyable job with a lot of interaction with people on a daily basis. It's a perfect job if you're looking for something fast paced and fun.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun. If the typical barista is looking for advancement though they have to be with the ""in crowd"". Otherwise there is no chance to advance and climb the corporate ladder."
good,"Worked here a couple times at several different locations.  Good benefits, great co-workers. Free coffee is always a perk!"
good,"In this job, I learned how a classroom should be managed, as well as what data entry entailed. It was a great internship and I enjoyed it."
good,"I worked with the Siren for about 2 years, in a couple different locations. I always had a great team of partners, but management really makes or breaks it."
good,"A good place to work when you have an unusual schedule, the hours are flexible. There is a lot of turnover and management can be a bit frustrating."
good,"Working for Starbucks has been an experience like none other. I have learned customer service skills, working alone and with a group. A typical day there is cleaning up around the kiosk and helping customers with their drink orders."
good,"Not repetitive, throughout the day - always switching tasks. I learned a lot working at Starbucks, both about the company, work world, as well as myself. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers constantly, and the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with coworkers."
good,This was a great and fun place to work. I left due to I only worked 4 hours a week and that was not cutting it.
good,"I enjoyed the regulars"
good,"Great company, fast paced environment, great for college students looking for great benefits!"
good,an extremely fast paced environment with no room to move up in the company.
good,"Very upbeat tempo job"
good,this job helped me be constructed and helped me build my speed in a fast working environment. The employees helped me progress at a very fast rated and in a matter of days i came up to the same speed as they where. The overall experience helped me in and out of the job environment.
good,Walking into the smell of roasted coffee in the air and the fact that we sold an experience to the customers was a great feeling. I learned a lot about coffee and up-selling a product. I learned that if I find a way to believe in a product that I can sell ice to an eskimo. My co-workers were great and the ones that were not were usually fired. I only had difficulty with management messing up my schedule but I always had proof of their mistake because I took pictures of the schedule. The hardest part of the job was also my favorite part of the job and that was the multitasking. I love to multitask because it gives me this sense of gratification when it's completed correctly and the customers enjoyed the show.
good,"Starbucks is a great place for potential employees to start off as entry-level jobs. There are always pros and cons in working a retail environment. I did love working here, but management was sketchy in terms of work hours."
good,"I am a team lead for Starbucks which means that I am in management.  I am a key holder for the store and am responsible for closing or opening the store, running shifts, safe and cash handling, and management of other employees.  I learned a lot about honing my people skills and how to manage and work well with other employees.  My co-workers are one of the best parts of my job and getting to know and work closely with them.  The hardest part of the job would probably be working such late hours while still trying to manage going to school."
good,"I absolutely loved working here! Great environment and it was so fun getting to know the regulars!! My only complaint was my manager. To be specific, whenever I would make a Mocha I ALWAYS stirred it so that the chocolate didn't stay on the bottom and I was very quick at making drinks and the customers favorite barista so it is not like stirring the mocha slowed me down but if I was working with her I would get in trouble if I stirred a mocha only because it was not how she made them! I wanted to serve the customers the best product and make them happy! I think it is poor quality to serve a drink half done like that!"
good,"interact with customers"
good,Early mornings preparing coffee and espresso beverages for customers. Engaged in healthy conversation with customers and allowed a steady productive work environment with other employees.
good,"As a Barista I would be using the till, I had to make sure I knew the cup marking so the customer is getting the correct drink, cleaning the toilets and cleaning the tables. I have learned a lot whilst I was working in Starbucks as it has made more confident in myself. the management there are friendly and are always there to help me if I made a mistake and I would then not the mistake again as they told me the correct way next time. my co-workers are friendly and welcoming when they have a new member to Starbucks. the hardest part about being a Barista is that I was doing long hours and when I had to learn the cup markings as I had to learn quickly"
good,"My typical day at work includes serving customers food and beverage at their request, doing daily maintenance tasks, and providing a 3rd place for people to spend their time."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. I have worked in several different cities. "
good,Although my time working for Starbucks coffee was brief I would say that I enjoyed the experience. It was my first part-time job and it introduced me to the world of Sales and Customer Satisfaction. It taught me to think quickly and confidently in order to meet the customers needs.
good,"Learned a lot, first manager position, great benefits, lots of great connections."
good,"A very hands on job, running shifts from the front. Serving, making drinks, making sure the cafe was clean and all Health and saftey adhered too."
good,This job is good for some people but not for all people. Free coffee is a bonus.
good,"I had never worked in a food industry before, and everyone helped me feel comfortable, confident and gave me a chance to learn at my own pace."
good,Company was great!  work was fun ! Management was another story.
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for! It was energizing, always had someone to lean on and the customers always left happy. The benefits to partners and willingness to support goes above anything I have seen since. A connection is built not only with coworkers but customers as well that makes it a blessing to work and create connections. The hardest part of the job was memorizing each and every drink Starbucks had to offer to its customers, which had a very distinct pattern and could be easily memorized within your first six months of employment. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling accomplished and valued for a company. The only reason I had to leave this job was due to company closures in 2007. If this event had not happened I would have loved to grow with the company."
good,"Working at Starbucks will be one of the busiest jobs you will ever have or it will be completely dead, here is no real in between. The pay sucks, but they off set this b offering a good amount of benefits. Overall I would recommend the job"
good,I love working in Starbucks I enjoy every moments. the only reason I left the job was my education was full time and I couldn't make it .
good,"My favorite thing about this job is the flexible hours and the catering to your scheduling needs.  Coworkers that evolve into friends make the job 10x better.  Patience, efficiency, and communication are a few skills that I perfected here."
good,"My duties included deployment of partners to ensure tasks were accomplished, execute store operations, follow cash handling procedures, communicates information to store manager and maintain company standards."
good,good place to work if you like coffee as there is free coffee once a wee
good,I liked the experience but not the management thats why I quit honestly
good,Overall good work experience I enjoyed  the individuals I worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a large volume of customers by myself.
good,"Typical day of work - rude customers, rude co-workers."
good,Very fast paced environment with many different tasks.  Always something to keep you going and your day is never the same from one to the next.  Supportive company and engaging lively customers.
good,"It is a pretty cool place to work, you get free drinks and discounted food. You learn a lot of starbucks and how to make their drinks, its pretty fun. The environment is fun and the benefits are great. However, the management is poor."
good,Overall this job was a fun one. Great employees and team. Busy environment that requires problem solving abilities. allowed me to develop leadership sills and helped me evolve them to fit my personality.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks (I was an opener 5am-12pm), we would prepare the pastries, get the machines cleaned up and ready to go, and of course sanitize. I had a great relationship with 90% of my co-workers. 2 of 5/6 Managers within a 5 year time frame was rough. I definitely able to get along within any surroundings, but 2 of those many managers was rough. They just seemed to not want to either be there or not into that job. I thrived to move up, but fortunately I got a little surprise of getting pregnant with my baby boy, who is 7 now. I have a full time child care (my mother is lives close), and that has never or rarely been a problem. I learned the ability to truly multi-task with this job, before moving onto Frontier. I moved on, to search for a more clerical and financially beneficial job. I was always on top of my game (even while pregnant which I worked up until 2-3 weeks before having my baby boy). I was able to take orders while making drinks and punching the orders into the computer. I also was always giving our customers a 2nd home away from home, which we thrived on. The hardest part of this job was falling a few times, which hurt my back (3+ times), from co-workers not cleaning up spills, which happens! My most enjoyable part of this job, was the overall atmosphere  of working with people I liked and customer service. I have been in customer service for over 15 years and still love it."
good,"I absolutely loved this job.  It was demanding but very rewarding.  Days consisted of many things; cleaning, crafting drinks, helping customers, and interacting with team members, etc."
good,"Starbucks Coffee is not as easy as they say it is or make it as, from learning the Starbucks lingo to the handcrafted drinks to greetings to stocking to cleaning up for the day its more of a multi-tasking kind of job when I think about it. In Starbucks I am taught speed, efficiency, to listen and most important take care of your customers needs and wants. Team work is a must because if one goes down then we all go down, there's a orderly system that has to be maintained or your going to have major complaints and angry customers coming at you. Working in the Airport, you wouldn't think so but you could never be more wrong, angry passengers from delays and cancelled flights are my customers even though they had had a horrible day its my job to make it their best day with a cup of deliciousness.  Overall seeing and making people happy and yet satisfied after they take that first sip is what I enjoyed most."
good,"Starbucks provides great benefits and an opportunity to meet really great people. Overall, Starbucks takes really great care of their employees"
good,"Very strong team environment, and high standards for cleanliness and customer service."
good,"Very attention detailed. had to be on the go at all time, but all together the best part was getting to interact with the customers all being able to make someone's day."
good,Learned a lot about the history of coffee and differences of blends from across the world.
good,I open mostly so I arrive around 5am and help get the store ready for the day. The first customer arrives around 5:30 and that's when I start taking orders and making drinks. It is a fast paced environment and a very social one as well. You become very close with your co-workers and that helps you work well as a team. I really enjoy the work and the people but the hours can be a bit rough at times.
good,"Daily routine was opening the store and prepping everything for the day. Then once the  store opened I would take the customers orders and make sure they received their orders quickly,"
good,"great atmosphere, insurance options, fun work, fast-paced, pay is pretty bad"
good,"perfect part time job for students, however not for someone who is looking for full time work. shifts only 6 hours and a maximum of 30 hours per week."
good,This job put into the work force. I learned how to follow routines and provide high quality customer service. This was a wonderful first job to have had.
good,"Starbucks is one of the best places to work - great coffee, good people, and strong mission/values."
good,"A typical day at work starts with prepping all the essentials (coffee, tea, etc...) to meet the customer needs. "
good,This is a fast paced and high standards job. Multitasking is a must along with micro managing to keep Starbucks Coffee looking good. Customer satisfaction is the number one priority. Great place to work with good benefits but not a life long career.
good,Very busy everyday but fun. You have to know how to work under high volumes of stress.
good,"Communication among managers should inprove"
good,Working at starbucks is rewarding and enjoyable! You meet so many different people every day is just as good as the previous
good,"Open tills, prep store for the day's customers, and provide a cheerful, memorable experience for customers. I learned how to provide a great experience for customers to my store and to give them fast and timely service. Working the morning shift (0400-1300) is hard for a lot of employees but I lived for it. There was never a shortage of customers at my store, especially with the ""morning rush"". There was always a new face, a new drink order, and almost an overwhelming stream of people that all need their orders done fast and correctly. Also, as a shift supervisor it was my job to train new employees on the ""bar"" and to see them grow and master the basic skills, to then in turn become a supervisor themselves was the most rewarding experience I had and honestly would never trade my experience there,"
good,"Situated in the heart of Dublin city, surrounded by office buildings and retail outlets this store was one of the busiest Starbucks in the country."
good,Starbucks has been a great place to work and interact with people .
good,"this s a busy place, especially when you start in peak summer time is slightly harder. hopefully they try to employ enough members of staff"
good,Usually an up beat and hip environment. Perfect for interacting and meeting new people! A large group of Co-workers/Partners/Team members who are diverse and super friendly.
good,"Starbucks is all about 'working with you.' When it comes down to it and you want them to, they treat you horrible."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty good. Over the years I've learned how to multitask very well. Management has changed recently and it was a bit of an adjustment, but all is going well. My co-workers are great. We all get along very well so it's like being able to work with your friends everyday. I would say the hardest part of the job is that sometimes it gets a bit chaotic with a big rush of customers, but if you keep calm everything works out fine. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing our regular customers. They are always friendly and know us all by name."
good,real nice and friendly enviroment where all my co workers and customers are easy to get along with. Easy to get a hang of and very organized company.
good,"A typical day at work consists preparing a guest's beverage/pastry, clean the area to sanitation and health codes requirements, prepare the next shift worker for duties, etc. I learned connecting with your guests is very important to fulfill their needs. Management has flaws just like every other place. My co-workers are amazing! They are fast paced and friendly. The hardest part of the job is having to see a disgruntled guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see them smiling leaving the store because their beverage/pastry was prepared perfectly to their taste buds."
good,"fun place to work, lots of freedom, many nice people, and good drinks"
good,"great team members, nice costumers, more or less flexible working hours"
good,Excellent job for someone that is going to school. Very flexible hours
good,A company to work for if you like dealing with people and love the smell of coffee.
good,Alot of person to person interaction on a daily basis. Dealt with teenagers and college students everyday.
good,"As a barista, your day is full of 15 sec- 1 min interactions with customers. I serve 1,200 customers on a daily basis. It's important to make an impression on as many customers as you can. The hardest part of the job is balancing time and production as well as maintaining great customer service interaction."
good,Great place to find yourself. Lots of new things to be interested in and find a new interests.
good,"Working at Starbucks in Longo's was great, hence why I have remained there for a long time. A regular day at work would consist of working in a fast-pace environment, serving customers with excellent service, and processing cash transactions. The management were a great team of individuals who would always be willing to listen and help to any concerns one may have. There were no hard parts of the job, after you get accustomed to the routine. It was basically the same thing require from you on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the the fact that managers would trust you in handling more advanced tasks, such as inventory and management, and being able to fulfill those tasks."
good,"Interacting with baristas and meeting different people everyday was a pleasure.  Within this company, there is a high capacity of diversity, which is what makes it a great company overall."
good,At Starbucks we were like one big family working together. It was an enjoyable work environment where no one was uncomfortable at any point.
good,I love the interaction with the customers. I have learned a lot about the world of coffee.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for.  They provide great benefits for their employees.  Each day is fast paced but if you are a well rounded barista that is the type of environment in which you can thrive.  As an employee you interact with many different people and rely heavily on teamwork with fellow employees to ensure every costumer leaves having had a memorable experience.
good,"Typical day at work.."
good,"I learned not as much as I thought I was going to. The hardest part was being to work sometimes at 5 or 6 am, very fast-paced job when done efficiently."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time working at starbucks inc.  A typical day at work was fast, quality customer service, efficient cleaning to strict hospitality standard and making lots of different beverages."
good,"Being a Barista at Starbucks is not ""easy"" work by any means, at least not in my opinion. Starbucks prides itself in quality customer service and outstanding cleanly standards. So a typical day at Starbucks revolves around being overly nice to any customer that walks in the door and maintaining Qasa standards. Which basically means, you will be on your feet all day long and working toward any number of daily required cleaning tasks. Also, one huge thing about Starbucks, as I am sure is with any store of this nature, is that the manager makes most of the rules per store. Starbucks managers are skilled at being able to look you in the eye and tell you they can give you a certain amount of hours and then a couple months later throw that whole agreement out the door because they decided to hire more people. Then when you try to complain about this, they tell you can always use your days off to borrow out to another store and cover a shift if someone needs it covered. So basically you have to drive to all the Starbucks stores in the area and give them your name and number and hope and pray for hours so you can pay your bills. I think each manager is different, but that is how my manager has chosen to treat me."
good,There are managers with rampant time theft and the district mangers don't really do much about it. The district mangers should probably be in pairs in districts instead of delegating 15+ stores to a single person. This makes it nearly impossible to make sure everything goes as it should. The customers at my particular store have been great and for the most part the partners I've worked with are pretty good. There are some people who do not deserve employment who hang on to their jobs here for YEARS while not doing much of anything. This is infuriating to put up with but I guess it can happen at any job.
good,"Fun place to work."
good,Very fast pace.  super fun.  I recommend working there.  This job taught me a lot
good,I was able to learn how to work on a team setting and provide customer service in a wonderful environment.
good,"Fast paced and very challenging at times, I enjoy fast paced setting. Its not just the drinks you have to make, but it's all about making the customer feel welcome with your attitude and the Starbucks product."
good,"I loved my customers and most people I worked with. I felt that there was minimal room for growth and the poor was pretty terrible. For the work that is required, they could take better care of their employees."
good,"Good job with decent benefits."
good,Always something exciting going on with new promos and products. Learned a great deal of respect for orginazed work environment and following guidelines of strict policy. Co workers were like a family everyone looking out for each other for the team.
good,everybody is friendly and know what they are doing a very team oriented place to work at
good,Starbucks offers a great environment for customers and for employees. I have learned many new skills that I know will be extremely useful in years to come.
good,"Nice place to work."
good,Training here was pretty informative and helpful. Manager took the time to get myself familiarized with the work invovled. Co-workers are pretty young and most with no University Degrees. Hardest part of the job would be the constant making of different types of drinks during busy periods of the day. Most enjoyable part of the job is probably learning various techniques and methods to make the beverages.
good,"I think this job would be great for a young person in school. I, on the other hand, feel I am outgrowning Starbucks. I am looking for a little bit more professional work enviroment."
good,"It was a pleasant experience, i enjoyed learning new things and meeting great people. Management was excellent and Starbucks treats their employees well. The hardest part of the job was probably the early hours you would have to wake up for. I enjoyed every aspect of Starbucks and being a Barista."
good,"I would clock in, then I would organize my area while waiting for customers to arrive. I would greet each customer with a smile and take there order. The hardest part of the day for me would be dealing with mad customers. The most enjoyable part would be putting a smile on each customers face. My co-workers would be respectful."
good,"Very fast paced. Always focused on creating the perfect beverage and experience for the customer, making them feel like its a third place. My co-workers became more like family, we grew as a team helping each other grow. The hardest part of the job would have to be the high-volume and urgency, but you get so used to it that it just becomes second nature. The people are hands down my favorite part of the job. I loved making connections with the customers and was happy to know that i could make their day a little brighter."
good,"Go to work, work my station, and go home."
good,"One of my favorite places to work.  A great set of people in most areas, as well as management.  The culture over the years changed greatly and made the environment less enthusiastic, and less centered on what made them famous, their coffee."
good,"Busy location, learned about coffee and how to make espresso beverages, enjoyable interactions with co-workers"
good,pick orders for delivery to stores.  palletize product according to location
good,"Pretty good place, I would say that I could recommend it to others."
good,Fast paced friendly customer service. Main responsibilities were to prepare and serve customers food and beverages prepared by company standard.
good,"I would interact with different people everyday, which I really enjoyed.  Although it would be very busy at times I was able to keep my composure and ensure that every guest was treated with respect and received their order in a timely manner.  I also helped with inventory, ordering and maintaining supplies, as well as keeping things orderly and clean."
good,"Tracking and analysing inventory levels, orders, sales and deliveries through the use of inventory management software"
good,"learned how to operate a full barista bar, POS teller, Cash Handling Skills, Customer Service, Etc..."
good,I worked in store management several years ago and enjoyed the experience.
good,"A typical day was quite routine and completely different all at the same time. Drinks needed to be made quickly, employees needed breaks, and the store needed cleaning, but customers were the difference. I learned the importance of building relationships with regular customers, the power of intentional connection, and the value of cleanliness. Management was difficult at times, what with sales goals to meet and young over-caffeinated employees to guide. Coworkers were sweet and genuine, and the witty repartee was constant. The hardest part of the job were the hours I had to come in earlier and leave later, especially when you start before 5:00 am or leave after 11:00 pm. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the customers I developed relationships with and saw almost daily, and the skills I honed leading my team to success."
good,Typical days are fast paced and fun. Management very friendly and always willing to work with any coworkers needing help.
good,"This job is a fast pace environment that allowed me to meet new people, and provided valuable experience in customer service. Depending on the time of day it can get very hectic which allowed me to work well under pressure. My co-workers are diligent people and showed me how to be a team player. The hardest part of the job can be conflicting hours. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and building strong customer relationships."
good,"Uma empresa ótima para trabalhar. Desde do diretor até o funcionário da limpeza. Uma empresa com muitas regras e bem organizada. Um lugar bem agradável de trabalhar. Foi uma ótima experiencia, aprendi muito."
good,"I probably would still be working there if i have not decided to go back to school. Great staff, management. Great place to work overall"
good,The atmosphere is always nice and welcoming. I learned how to be a team player. My co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is unhappy customer who can not be satisfied no matter what you do. The most enjoyable part of this job making the drinks for the customers and having a conversation about how their day is going.
good,"Great for college students! Easy to switch shifts, fun, consistent policies."
good,"In my time at Starbucks, I met so many wonderful people and made  many friends.  Once you get the hang of it, the job is usually not stressful, and is more customer service than anything.  The company does a good job of looking out for employees and customers, and has been a leader in the customer service and coffee industry for as long as I can remember.  I've known quite a few people who get out of the stores and into the corporate office, and I only hear good things."
good,"Working at Starbucks has taught me a lot about myself. It has taught me how hard I can push myself and how I can problem solve in a calm manner. It has helped me understand the ideas of perception and customer interactions. Starbucks taught me the importance of creating a special experience for customers. It has taught me how to discipline and coach in the moment as well as prioritize. "
good,Greeting customers with great enthusiasm while making there beverage and managing your team. Greatest part was all the people you get to meet everyday.
good,"As a Barista at Starbucks it was my duty to aid Customers, at times helping the person on bar in making the drinks and handling cash. It's a busy environment but if you're dedicated to it, its definitely rewarding."
good,"The hours at minimum are four hours a shift and it could be busy or slow. The co-workers are nice and the customers are who the customers are. Its an easy job, most of the time its very slow and you don't have many customers."
good,"A typical day at work either started at 4:45AM until 2PM or 2 to 10:30PM. The long and unpredictable hours always kept me on my feet and ready for new tasks. As a shift manager I was in charge of any employees working at the time, completing paperwork, deposits, handling registers, assigning tasks and breaks, and basically making sure everything ran smoothly. All the while handling customers, making various lattes and sandwiches, and keeping the place clean of course. This job provided me with management skills, multitasking opportunities and lasting relationships with coworkers and customers that has changed my life."
good,it was great and i liked it and i dont understand why i have to write a review for this place
good,"When you come into work, with a smile on your face and an attitude prepared to offer legendary customer service. "
good,"Fast pace environment, love the coworkers, pay is ok but good benefits"
good,"I liked it a lot, friendly environment but, not the type of career I am looking for."
good,Good company with decent benefits. Definitely check it out.
good,"I work night shift, So when I come to work, its time to clean up the store. talk with the customers, make drinks. get people to try new things."
good,Fast paced and great attention to detail required. Great staff who all worked towards a common goal of great customer satisfaction in the lowest time possible.
good,"The staff here is great. I have learned how to work in a very busy and stressful environment by the help of everyone and am very grateful for that. My only problem with this job is it's inconsistency to give me a proper work schedule (one week I'll be full, then the next two weeks I'll have at least 2 shifts at most)."
good,Great Place to work if you love coffee and chatting with people. You gotta work in fast-paced environment and learn to deal with customer issues.
good,"I loved this fast paced job. My supervisor was helpful in maintaining a consistent schedule for myself and my partners. I worked different shifts throughout my time with this company, and night shift was definitely the best. The best thing about working was the consistent scheduling and ability to move up quickly through the ranks."
good,"Great place to work while attending school, customers were friendly"
good,"This is a great company to work for but it the work environment can vary based on coworkers and management. If you get a good store manager and decent coworkers this can be a great job. It requires early hours- some stores open as early as 4:30am. Hours can be varied and are never guaranteed. One week you may work 35-38 hours but the following week you may only get 15, which is why I am leaving."
good,"-Serving coffee"
good,"good benefits, great friends, and flexable hours for students."
good,"Good location, good coffee. Learnt to train employees. I was even able to do the visual merchandising."
good,"In my last position as a manager for Starbucks, I was continually confronted with challenging situations and responsibilities that have helped me grow tremendously professionally and personally.  From setting and overseeing staff deployment, handling employee and customer issues, promotional and sales ambitions of the company, the general public, cash control, as well as, everyday store operations, while maintaining city, state, and company-wide regulations and standards, all in order to run a successful business (one of the top 3 grossing stores in the Houston, TX area), Starbucks truly tested me, and taught me a lot.  "
good,"My typical day at work would usually be on the tills, or making the coffee. I'm a trained Barista and learned  a lot from interacting with customers on a daily basis. "
good,Loved all of the customers and the managers. Truly and enjoyable place to work at.
good,"I am continually learning and growing in my current role at Starbucks.  I get to meet interesting people, and help them with their needs.  I have become a certified Coffee Master, as well as a barista trainer to help further the standards of Starbucks with new hires."
good,"great product "
good,"As a Starbucks store manager your day is 90% on the floor customer focused tasks and 10% is back of house management. Typical day boh management includes but is not limited to; checking email multiple times daily and responding within an appropriate time period, reviewing weekly sales and adjusting daily targets for for based on trends, completing all inventory orders and audits, daily employee till audits, daily deposits, employee bi-annual reviews; face to face or phone connections with employees, mentee's, peers, and district manager.  i have learned that my analytical nature is valuable in most circumstances but that challenging myself to think in different ways to expand my business has been crucial. my co-workers are typically part-time to full-time young adults. It is my responsibility as the store manager to ensure that they understand and follow company standards to ensure that the best customer experience is given. The hardest part of the job is the weight of responsibility on the store manager. There is very little support from upper management and very little ownership of hourly employees at times. This can result in difficulty in finding a healthy work/life balance. As a store manager if a team is not willing or able to support the store to get all tasks done it is the responsibility of the manager at any point in time to cover any and all on the floor shifts necessary to complete what is needed with no consideration for days off and overtime without pay. As with many company's this is a standard in management as it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure all"
good,great job for teens looking to grow into a career now. high energy retail industry job. learned multi tasking and working as a team and building relationships with both partners as in co workers and customers.
good,"Highly paced retail customer-oriented work. Engaging and exhausting. Extremely well-organized company to work with and for. Retail workers are somewhat transitory, which makes consistency of staffing difficult. Compensation is relatively low, but benefits are somewhat generous, if you can afford to avail yourself of them."
good,"A lot of benefits to working at starbucks in terms of the discount, partner scheme and pay.  I enjoyed the enviroment working style -as in being a barista and learning the in's and out's of coffee making."
good,this is a great place to work for. although they start out at very low pay for how successful the company is. they still have great benefits
good,"My particular store was the 2nd best in Seattle (2nd only to the flagship store), and the manager  and customers were amazing. Loved that job and think about it often."
good,Loved working there. So many good memories and you always work with the strangest funniest people. Loved going to work!
good,"atendimento a clientes da operadora vivo"
good,It was a great working environment.  I learned how to work with others and also how to interact with customers.  It was under good management and i had many great co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was making sure that everyone was staying on task and putting their best foot forward to keep the team working at its best.  I enjoyed the environment and the customers.
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace environment. "
good,"A typical morning shift at Starbucks, which is what I worked a majority of the time, may start off slow, but as soon as that 7:30 am rush came inside and through the drive-thru, you had to be ready! For three hours there was a constant flow of people telling you their order, making drinks, heating food, dealing with complaints with a smile; just constant chaos, but organized chaos most of the time.  Most of the management was great.  There was one particular manager that most of the seasoned employees had a problem with, but that person was able to be dealt with, with a smiling face.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant new employees we had, as well as the crowds of people one had to deal with.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was the camaraderie between the employees.  At the end of a rush, it was always fun to joke around and laugh while preparing for the next rush.  I worked with the best group of people.  Starbucks is a family."
good,"Flexible working hours, friendly staff, benefits such as free drinks and discounts."
good,"Working at Starbucks in a management role requires the ability to adapt quickly to change, work in a fast paced environment and have the ability to multitask. Being a forward thinking company there are a lot of new promotions, products and processes that are constantly being implemented. Managers are given one day a week to complete all administration responsibilities and the rest of the time is working the floor, observing and coaching."
good,Working at Starbucks may have been the perfect high school job. I enjoy interacting with people and making them smile and this position allowed me to do that. I learned the meaning of being responsible and the value of growing up while working here before I left for college. It was a wonderful experience!
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work with a fast pace and lots of customer interaction.
good,"Each work day was quick, fun, and easy."
good,"My work day was typical of a food service manager. I wasn't fully connected to the job, though the company is great. They take care of their employees and I was always able to be myself."
good,"Loved it for the time I was there, Just time to move on to something more challenging."
good,"A typical day at work is a busy non-stop flow, dealing with a different variety of Military People from all over the country. I've learned different things about people an they're dislikes from our many regulars that stop through every morning before work. My co-workers are also the best part of my day. We have great laughs and experiences working together and creating new drinks an ways to satisfy our customers each day. Although the hardest part is to train our newbies (New employees) it has its flaws, but at times I enjoy teaching someone what I've learned an easier ways to accomplished getting things done. What I love most is seeing the smiles on my customers faces when they come in and I greet them with a ""Good Morning"" and crack a joke with them. I love my customers, especially my regulars i've grown to know. They are very caring, humorous, outgoing, and can brighten up your day if your starting off at a ruff start."
good,"Starbucks was my first job, and even though the hours were odd and you were on your feet all day long I never left work in a bad mood.  Going to work was fun, my co-workers were wonderful, and the customers were even better."
good,We were constantly busy and the fast pace makes the work day goes by faster. Meet some wonderful regulars(Customers). Love the smell of coffee.
good,"This is a coffee shop that wants their customers to keep coming back. The staff is to be upbeat and ""perky"" in the mornings. I had a good time with meeting and interacting with all the customers. We learned drinks that returning customers would order and have them ready by the time they paid. This was a competitive job, but fun."
good,"An average day would start with opening up the store, then assisting customers to start their day out with a delicious beverage and a smile. Three of our employees would successfully serve sixty cars through the drive threw in a hour. Starbucks was a very fun and upbeat place to work."
good,Enjoy making people's day serving them a great cup of coffee
good,"It was fun work and I really enjoyed my co workers. It also had pretty decent pay for a low skill job. My manager at the time kept promising to make me a supervisor though and then backed out on it after a year of training, so I'd say advancement opportunities aren't optimal."
good,"Responsible for: "
good,Alot of clients you build relationships with  and get to know new people
good,"As a Starbucks Barista, you create the Starbucks Experience for customers by providing legendary customer service with prompt service, quality beverages and products, and maintaining a clean and comfortable store environment."
good,This is a fast pace environment with a calm atmosphere and has great benefits.
good,"Since I have worked for Starbucks there has always been new and exciting changes that go on. From new products and new beverages, to training new partners and helping other stores out. I currently work with a great group of partners that keep a tight ship, we all know that can make or break or business."
good,"I manage the opening and the closing activities of the store including all cash handling procedures and cleaning duties.  I delegate tasks on a daily basis and review food sales and waste on a weekly basis and adjust ordering accordingly.  I work with a great team of people but the hardest part of the job for me is when I have to go from friend to boss and enforce rules and regulations.  It's a fine line but I walk it well.  The most enjoyable part of my day is when I make a customer smile.  That is what I am there for, to be the reason that that customer visits that store on a daily basis.  There are 17,000 of our stores that make drinks the same way and have the same products to offer, I want them to come back to my store because we have the friendliest, most helpful, and courteous employees."
good,Starbucks was a great job to share ones' love of coffee with others. Everyday customers and co-workers became a second family.
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers with orders and drinks. It is a challenge to learn all the drinks and a great place to begin a great career."
good,"At Starbucks here is not a typical day, everyday had different challenges to overcome. "
good,"Fun workplace, easy tasks, busy, friendly co-workers and customers. "
good,Really nice place for meeting new people and improving my English skills and also for learning how to provide the best customer service.
good,The managers were amazing and set the vibe for the entire café. Customers definitely loved this Starbucks
good,"I really love working in a cafe/coffee shop atmosphere. I'm a little disappointed that they don't allow piercings, tattoos, or colored hair. Other than that, it was a great job."
good,"It's not that I can work with anyone out there right now, but Starbucks certainly introduced me to how different people use different methods of communication. However off-putting someone might be--whatever pressures one might be experiencing--in the moment we're all working towards the same thing. Why let things bother you? Do you enjoy delivering customer service to someone who would rather be anywhere else than standing in line and doing so in spite of themselves? Would you enjoy being served by an exhausted barista with a cloud over his head? Let the small things fall under the greater purpose: to create an experience that will bring you back again and again regardless of whatever life throws at you on a given day. Can I claim to be an expert on the delivery of said experience? Truthfully I have my good days and my bad days. After being on both sides of the till, I know what to work for. I can smooth things over. I can humbly apologize. Working with the partners at Starbucks has pushed me to change myself, and progress is forthcoming. "
good,"good benefits, comfortable atmosphere, upbeat, awesome, fun, exciting"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming in and cleaning up/stocking the entire drink-making space, since it was always a mess when I got there, and then making drinks, helping customers, and maintaining that cleanliness until I got to either go on a break or leave. I learned a lot about working hard, time-management, and how to deal with insane customers. High-level management were consistently awful, but usually avoidable. Coworkers, by contrast, were consistently pretty cool, which really made the day go by quickly and painlessly. The hardest part of the job really was dealing with management being incompetent, and with the few workers that every retail establishment has who don't do anything whatsoever. I did, however, really enjoy interacting with my better coworkers and making friends with customers, as well as making really high-quality drinks whenever I had the time to. All in all an occasionally stressful, but generally decent job."
good,"I  trained and coached a team on a daily baises. Interacted with customers of a wide variety. During my time, I've learned how to effectively manage my staff and manage inventory. I also have experience with the hiring processes including; interviewing, hiring, and training new employees. "
good,"This Starbucks is actually a location licensed by the Faculty Student Association at SUNY Fredonia. Being on a college campus, it is always bustling with activity and it is easy to connect with the people around me. A typical day involves a big variety of different tasks, and each transaction is different. I learned how to strengthen my ability to be a team player and hone my communication skills to be as concise and understood as possible with this job, and my co-workers made it that much easier to feel comfortable at work. They are a blast and probably one of the most enjoyable parts of this job -- that, and the customers with which I interact. Being around people is fun! The management is great, too! They aren't like your typical, intimidating bosses; they're like the leaders of a second family away from home and are always interested in your input or your stories!"
good,"I have worked at two Starbucks locations over the years and both have been drastically different experiences. I worked as a shift manager at a Starbucks in Easton, PA from 2007-2009. I was hired to open the store and work at the new location in a small PA town. This store was not very busy and we would typically see the same customers every day. By working at this store, I really gained a higher sense of community with the town. The management at this store was great and all of the employees became a close-knit family. We would volunteer around the community together and bond over the slow nights closing the store. After moving to Baltimore and while attending Towson University, I began to work as a barista at a Starbucks in Baltimore. This store was much different from my first experience with Starbucks. The store was much busier than the one in a small PA town. The customers did not connect with the employees in my Baltimore Starbucks the same way that the customers connected with the employees in the small town. Additionally, the Baltimore location did not have as many community service projects or community-based activities as the Easton location. The focus of the Baltimore store seems to be more on the business aspect of the company. I do not feel the same compassion and caring that my old store manager expressed to her employees."
good,I didn't have long to work with this company because of its closing but I got a lot out of working here. I enjoyed it a lot.
good,"Different every day"
good,"Preparing specialty beverages, maintaining a clean working environment, and brightening up peoples day was thoroughly enriching. "
good,"confidential witch we cant shear with  others."
good,"- a typical day at work was crafting artisan beverages, discussing nutrition and merchandise with customers and completing daily task sheet"
good,Starbucks strive to provide it's customers with high quality products and excelent customer service so that the experience would be more than just getting a cup of coffee.
good,"Cash Drawer Operations"
good,"Manage a team of individuals during shifts, handle cash and banking procedures."
good,Starbucks has great benefits for part time/full time employees (over 20 hrs. per week). The work is extremely difficult if you are not familiar with food service and multi tasking. The pros are that you still get to have fun at work and get to know regular customers and make some great friends with your co-workers.
good,"Great place to work. Never a dull moment, especially if you are a people person."
good,"a lot of work through out the day especially in the morning, but its fast pace enough for the days to pass by"
good,"debut du travail 9h  et fin de journée a 17h  "
good,"I didn't see much room for growth potential.  I got into some drama with a local DM and SM and any chances of moving up or moving out were squashed. Starbucks seemed like a nice place to work for, though.  Definitely gay friendly with benefits for partners' partners."
good,"Starbucks modo is "" If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."" After serving a customer either at the cashier or bar restocking is always needed and cleaning. There is never a minute you are not doing something. Starbucks has taught me great customer service, cash handling skills, team work, and management skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how you can change a persons day with one smile and a coffee."
good,"The location i worked at no longer exists, but Starbucks is a great company that creates a fun work environment and a great atmosphere to feel comfortable in."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is a bit hectic. I have learned many things while working at Starbucks. How to make drinks, ring up customers, and do inventory. The management is efficient and hard working. I love the people I worked with. It made work that much more fun. The hardest part of the job was the customers and the rushes. The customers can be rude and not happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the people I worked with."
good,"Starbucks is just the ideal job for anyone who is looking to be free, happy, and express themselves. The customers are the best part of the job."
good,Man lernt viele verschiedene Menschen und Charaktere kennen
good,Simply we could be our selves and do our daily task every day at the same time with a smile in our faces.
good,"I liked the job because it was a very fast pace location. This particular starbucks was busy 24/7 and i love to keep busy. I didnt like how we barely got our breaks, or didnt get any at all."
good,"Starbucks is a interpesonally demanding, high-traffic work environment which has forced me out of my shell and help me grow as a person."
good,"The team I worked with was a wonderful, diverse group of individuals. The customers were wonderful."
good,"I have learned a great deal during my stay at Starbucks, including how to handle a variety of situations and people as a manager, as well as inventory control, especially research variance. I have been introduced to P & L reports and have a working understanding of the underlying store needs. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with the repercussions of the turn-over rate. Constantly having new employees while trying to never allow sub-par service or product during extremely busy hours is not an easy task. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with your customers and co-workers. Starbucks does a great job at providing repeat customers with a home-like and friendly environment which you, as the barista, become a part of and get to enjoy on a daily basis."
good,Getting to know regular customers and building friendships with co-workers makes working at Starbucks feel like more than just a job to pay the rent.
good,Great job for students. Great benefits package provided when you work part or full time.
good,"I love Starbucks because it can be a very flexible job, especially if you are a college student."
good,Enjoyable to interact with customers and a fun environment to interact with employees.
good,Starbuck's goal is to treat everyone with respect and dignity at all times. Co-workers are partners because all of us have stock.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks because we had a lot of regular customers that would come in every day; I like to get to know customers somewhat personally. My coworkers are wonderful girls, we still keep in touch but I decided to move to Surrey as there are more opportunities for me here."
good,"I love my customers, co-workers and management even! Patience is something i've learned through dealing with the customers on a daily basis and connecting with all types of people is super fun as well."
good,I loved my coworkers and my regulars. I definitely miss the smell of coffee and tea brewing fresh all day long.
good,The typical day at starbucks would be meeting the customers needs above and beyond in a high pace environment. I learned how to work with others you may have differences with as well as learning how to lead new workers. I would say the hardest part of the job was to put up with customers who were always angry. The most enjoyable part was just working with many new people and meeting new faces everyday.
good,"I Learned So much at Starbucks, they are truly serious about making the customer feel like a guest ."
good,"My typical day at the job was as if i was the cleaning lady, constantly on the cash register, never shown what I needed to get things done at the drink making station. I learned that I can't rely on my co-workers or what my manager says because they won't go through with it. My co-workers were easy to get along with, they were nice and friendly and some actually helped me with things that I needed to know. My manager was extremely driven, she loved working her fast paced job and she didnt like it when things slowed down. It got in the way of her attention to the new empoylees who were still learning. I'm a fast learner so the only reason the job was hard was because I still was learning and wasn't given the attention so I could learn. The most enjoyable part of my job was working on the register, interacting with new people and recognizing the regulars who I've become well aquainted with."
good,"Everyday is an adventure, from meeting new people to interacting with partner. i enjoy every day of work!"
good,"Fun place to work, people are great to work with and excited to make a difference."
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for. Great leadership, team atmosphere and amazing benefits. Great employee development. While being part of a large corporation, each store has its own neighborhood feel. There is great energy amongst employees and we have wonderful regular customers that have developed into great relationships over the years. I enjoy the fast paced environment and the customer interaction. The most challenging parts are the inconstant very early and/or late hours; including weekends and the low pay."
good,"Great place to work,"
good,"It was a great company until it started to go under. When hour start getting cut, the jobs became to stressful to enjoy them by any means. It is ashame that it had to become that way."
good,"I worked here for two years, enjoying the opening shifts at 5 am the most. Got to work with great people, meet awesome customers, and have fun work days. As time went on as I worked there, things got more and more corporate. Wages were being cut left and right, and the original feel of the coffee house was fading."
good,Nice to work here for my second job. I would come in to make beverages for everyday customers.
good,"Provided customers with a positive, high level of satisfaction."
good,"A typical day at work at ""The Beast"" (one of the few flagship stores spread out around the country) could be described as controlled mayhem. the culture was overstated and under used. My typical day was as just another cog in the machine, weather it be on a register or on the bar."
good,You pretty much make minimum when you first start as a barista. Perfect job for college or high school students if you're old enough.
good,"This was a very fasted paced but very enjoyable job. I had wonderful managers and shift leads the entire time I worked here. The store manager is probably the best manager I have ever had the pleasure of working with/for. My co-workers were also extremely awesome to work with. We had a wonderful team effort going at all times making work that much more enjoyable. I was typically cleaning and making different beverages for customers, as well as food on the occasion. I truly enjoyed the customer connections that I made while working here. It was part of my job to establish more of a relationship with customers and it was quite rewarding when it was noticeable that the customer really enjoyed that as well."
good,working there was great had lots of fun and met all kinds of people
good,"The most enjoyable thing about working for Starbucks is the people you interact with on a daily basis, but it also the most difficult depending on the store you're assigned to and the customer base."
good,Uma grande empresa e que forneci muitos treinamentos aos seus colaboradores.
good,A typical day at Starbucks was working hard and enjoying for the most part you work very in depth with everyday. Management was a bit up and down and some co-workers were hard to work with but overall it was a great place to work. The hardest part of the day was pallet building a tough lane and the most enjoyable part was good communication between co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking peoples orders, processing their orders, making them their drinks, and serving it to them. I also would restock the shelves when needed and consistently clean up my work station, i.e; washing dishes, wiping counters, etc. I worked with a great staff and had a very fun boss. I learned how to be a better people person and how to make all kinds of different coffee drinks. It was a lot of fun."
good,"I was taught a great deal in customer service, multi-tasking in the environment, and up-selling our products. I exercised my memory a great deal when it came to matching a regular customer's face to their drink."
good,"A typical day involves coming in and finding a task to do, which typically meant taking over someone's task while they either take a break or clock out. I usually made drinks. There is usually a set daily list of tasks to accomplish for the day, so once the store slows down at bit, it's your job to complete those tasks before the next shift starts. It primarily consists of deep cleaning the store, reorganizing, stocking, etc. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job are the customers. Most customers are very nice and friendly and understanding, but there are the few that needless to say, are kind of difficult to handle. But overall it's an awesome job. It's not an easy job at all, but I loved my experience at Starbucks and everything I learned from it. I know that I can handle any situation handed to me after working there."
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me a lot. I learned how to lead a team and make them enjoy their work while still meeting business goals. A typical day for me would involve cash handling, giving people their breaks and lunches, preparing beverages for customers, inventory, stocking, supporting my team. Starbucks was a good company to work for, they really work with your schedule and at times their is room for growth within the company."
good,overall i enjoyed the job and the environment it was a good way to better my skills and move forward in the work place.
good,"You must be good with people, and work well with others. You can have some awesome friends that become your family. Customers are picky, but as long as you are patient, you will survive"
good,Organized and fun at the same time
good,Typical day is ringing customers up and making drinks.
good,Starbucks was a place where you could meet a lot of interesting people. Regulars would come in every day so it was fun to see how their day was going and to interact with them. My co-workers were a lot of fun to work with and everyone seemed to get along well. The atmosphere of the store changed once our store manager got let go as everyone seemed to leave the store right around that time or close to it. The hardest part was probably waking so early to open the store but the best part was interacting with customers and co-workers.
good,This job really helped me get a grasp on a wide-variety of people and challenging customer service related issues and how to deal with them appropriately.
good,"exciting to work with many different people, fast paced place to work, and good coffee"
good,"I learned valuable skills that helped me become a better manager, leader while building lasting relationships with customers and coworkers"
good,"Requires hard work, lots of cleaning, but at the end of the day, it's worth it to see your customers leaving happy with what they got"
good,"Working for Starbucks has taught me alot including the following : Drive thru, Customer service, science of coffee, working in a busy enviroment."
good,"A typical work day consists of making high quality beverages for all customers, while providing excellent customer service. The goal is to make people feel as though Starbucks is their home away from home."
good,Great company to grow in!
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. The day to day job interacting with the customers and fellow partners was great, I learned a great deal in the five years with the company whether it be from making a latte, to learning the LEAN way of thinking. (work smarter not harder)."
good,"Most days working with the customers is great, there are a few instances of unruly customers but those are incredibly few and far between. Management could use a bit of work but over all it's a decently run store."
good,Opening shifts start at 6am with the morning rush usually getting there around 7:30/8am until around 10:30.
good,"The barista at Starbucks performs a wide range of tasks in the span of a full shift. Among these are the broad categories cleaning, food and beverage preparation, cash-handling, and customer relations. Management is highly stratified: shift-managers, assistant store managers, store managers, regional representatives, etc., all of whom the barista is either directly or indirectly responsible to. Some are good, some are not. The same applies to co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant interaction with your community, at the least the well-caffeinated portion of it. This, unfortunately, can also be the most challenging part of it."
good,it was good experience to work but again short hours was a big problem
good,"My mother and I have both worked separate times and locations for Starbucks and have had the same problems. We love the coffee, the customers and sales, but management either has favoritism or allows drama in the workplace. My manager was on top of things most of the time, but there were two feuding supervisors that caused a whole mess of drama in the workplace. This should have never been allowed in a professional setting, but the manager was young and not very experienced. I am young, as well, but I know what should and shouldn't be allowed. You get decent benefits and lots of free food at some locations, as well as measly tips."
good,Learned valuable customer service skills. Working with others to achieve desired outcomes was also a valuable lesson one learns at starbucks.
good,"I started working at Starbucks six years ago when the company was more focused on the employees, but now it has become less employee-oriented and it's values have drastically changed to suite the share holders. I love the people I work with, the customers I serve, and the benefits that Starbucks offers; however, I feel as though the company is not the same one that I entered into so long ago and that after so many years there, advancement would be more easily attainable, but because the company is cutting back on the amount of supervisory positions, they are not. Because of such focus on profits for the corporate offices, hours have been cut back for all employees. I hate to leave this company but I just feel as though it is my time to leave Starbucks."
good,Everyday is a very fast paced day
good,"Fun to learn the makings of different drinks. Co-workers easy to get along with, job is pretty easy to do, most enjoyable part was taking with the patrons"
good,"A day at work is easy and yet challenging in some areas. Being that I am located on the beach and there is a huge language barrier being that it's a huge tourist attraction, but in all I enjoy the diversity and being able to meet new people from different places."
good,starbuck was my favorite job i loved meet different people each day
good,"Communicates clearly, concisely and accurately in order to ensure effective store operations. Filters communication to the shift team as directed by the store manager."
good,I had the a lot of fun and team work. The job was a place where you can come and work however it wasn't really work but a place that you can come and meet with friends and co-workers.
good,"Good job, burns you out if you are trying to make your 40 hrs every week. Corporate culture is very strongly pushed, which eventually can be stifling."
good,"was trained and promoted very fast, love the people i work with, fast pace"
good,"Worked for starbucks in a variety of differing locations and for a number of years. In all I feel this is a very flexible, supportive and encouraging company to work for if you are willing to work hard and be a good team player"
good,"I worked for a Starbucks, within a Target store. There was always a positive attitude and happy co workers."
good,The job is great but I feel I need to move on and it's not a plus for me to stay in one place. I'd rather move up the ladder.
good,my main task each day was to be on the bar preparing drink orders.
good,"Generally begin work at 4:30 am, prep store for the day; audit tills, prepare coffee, espresso machines, pastries. As time permits, I analyze daily numbers; food sales, coffee sales, proper inventory management, labor efficiency week to date. Deliver in the moment and timely feedback on partner performance. I enjoy the relationships I have developed with my customers, as the majority of my guests are regulars that I see at least 4 times a week. The hardest part of the job is the down time in which we are not able to make connections with guests."
good,"There was no ""typical"" day at Starbucks. I did something different everyday which was something I loved to do. I learned how to work expediantly and efficiently. My co workers were fun to be around. The store manager and I had our differences in opinions but I respected her judgement. The hardest part of my job was trying to be neat. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to be artistic and help make people's day just a little better."
good,"Fun, fast paced, various task required, sales experience gained, customer service skills greatly improved"
good,Fun and exciting place to go. The partners are valued. This company is very community oriented.
good,"Busy coffee shop catering to local ""regulars."" Excellent manager and staff made it fun to come to work. Enjoyed the knowledge I gained about coffee and all its possibilities."
good,"It is exciting working at starbucks because i am able to learn about starbucks, and their coffee. i learned how to make different type of drinks, able to meet new people, getting to know the customers; what they like in their drinks. i feel like my manager have the lack of management. i enjoy working with my co-workers because they were there to help me out from the beginning until now, they would tell me what i am doing right and wrong to help me improve on my work. The hardest part of the job is memorizing the customers drinks, some customers assume that i would remember their drink after a few days. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with the customers, when they are having a bad day, i can just tell them a joke to make them smile, it is nice to know that my sense of humor can turn their frown upside down."
good,"The days were always very fast paced and busy. The Management were good, both were new and learning but still good at their jobs. I had a great team to work with."
good,Fun and exciting. It's a great place to work if you love to meet new people and work with different type of personality.
good,Starbucks is a fast paced environment with great customer interaction.
good,"This job taught me a lot about how to treat customers, and how to work in a team enviornment."
good,Enjoyed working there it was very fun and they provided good benefits.
good,It is quite nice to work here. The compensation is relatively good and I can't really complain much.
good,Working at Starbucks has been a great experience because it has allowed me to work on my Communication skills. We have regulars at our store who are always enjoyable to talk to and my co-workers are the best.
good,Hard work but rewarding due to company benefits and advancement. Most of the managers arent very nice but it's due to the amount of pressure put on them. I liked working there and appreciated their willingness to work with my schedule for school.
good,"Altogether it is a fantastic company to work for. There are some flaws store to store on the standard operating protocols. We all strive to do our best at work. I believe this is still a beginning job where some people come in and just want the paycheck so they give minimal effort. The management of the stores tries to keep everything even and flow smoothly but sometimes they out too much effort into one thing and another things falls behind. I enjoy coming into work, somedays harder than others but I try to come into each shift assuming the best and with a smile on my face."
good,Made a lot of life long friendships and gained new skills that helped me in future employment. I enjoyed getting to know the regular customers and going to the coffee specialist school
good,Work at Starbucks is straightforward. Difficult at peak times but the rest of the day is easy. Tasks are all easy to learn and perform. Management was hostile and played favorites.
good,"I worked at a location inside Target. Starbucks was fun to work for, but Target was not. I had friendly co-workers, however the LOD (Leader of the Day) at Target was often unfriendly and downright rude. I was younger than other employees, and therefore treated like I was less ""worth it""."
good,"Taught me lots of great interpersonal communication skills, basic food service industry skills, and overall great work ethic skills. "
good,"Starbucks is the perfect work-place for students. Schedules are very flexible and the workplace is overall fun. You get to make many friends and the connections with customers are almost always smooth. "
good,"This location has some great customers and an incredibly busy drive-thru. This location is not for those who want to sit and play on their phones, for sure. Employees seem to turn-over more than necessary due to lack of management training and poor hiring choices. I would have stayed longer and worked to advance with the company had those two issues not been part of the consideration."
good,"It is a very large company that does care very much about both the well being of the customers and employees. Super respectable in methods of marketing, selling, and outreaching."
good,The high turnover rate with managers made it harder to establish a good relationship which is important when running a business. It made working there more complicated
good,"Managers are expected to work longer hours and the benefits are not the same for managers versus hourly employees, especially the educational benefits."
good,Being lead Shift Supervisor at Starbucks I saw all aspects of the job front serving to banking. Although for this role there is a learning curve and a LOT of paperwork once you nail the basics the job becomes second nature. Making and mm serving coffee and providing excellent customer service was easy to do as the environment I was in made it so.
good,"I only got 8 hours a week at a meijer Starbucks, but I'm pretty sure they were trying to get me to quit. The work was fun though. I enjoyed learning all the different drinks. A little hard to remember them all though"
good,"The job really depends on where you work (tips, customers, how busy the store is) and management is a hit or miss. My recommendation is to thoroughly talk o your managers of supervisors to see if the store is a fit for you."
good,"I had no problem with the actual job, the drinks take a little while to fully master and some customers are rude but overall not the worst job, all my problems came from the management at my store we replaced our store manager 3 times and the most recent replacement played favorites with the Batista's she personally liked allowing them to ignore their side work while cutting the hours of the baristas she didn't like"
good,"Starbucks me hizo aprender mucho al momento de interactuar con clientes. En muchas ocasiones me vi en la necesidad de solucionar encuentros con clientes. "
good,The job itself was great i learned a lot i learned quickly and made the training i received as effective as they taught me to prepare for the future of my job there. the only difficult thing i can remember would be the memorization of current and new drinks.
good,"Though the job was very stressful, I still"
good,"Everyone I've ever worked with at starbucks has been kind and friendly. The motto of starbucks once you're hired is that we're all part of the starbucks family. And for the most part that is accurate. But you're overworked, and expected to do 7 to 8 tasks at once in a very fast paced and stressful environment."
good,"I think working at Starbucks can be great if you like the work and you have good local management and a good location, but there is a lot of stress sometimes and it feels as though management—for all the benefits they give us—doesn’t hide the fact that we are disposable workers."
good,Some of the benefits are the metro cards. You can get a yearly metro card for 127 dollars which they slowly deduct from your pay check which good!!!!!
good,"Definitely good first job, plenty of perks and benefits that you get to enjoy. My coworkers were the best thing about the job, but the lack of scheduled hours we were given to meet customer demand was abysmal."
good,It was great working in a licensed store. I felt supported by both Starbucks and the license owner. Starbucks had high standards but was still willing to work with owner to accommodate things.
good,"Lots of memorization. Must be able to excel under pressure. Customers can be the best or the worst. Must be willing to talk to people and go above and beyond in getting to know them and making their day. At the end of the day, it's just a cup of coffee. But during, it's so much more than that. It is cashier work, drink making, recipe memorizing (new ones are always added), customer service, cleaning (don't skimp on this). Must have time management. Do not call out every day. Choose your availability and stick to it. Plan time off in advance."
good,"Its a great company because the employees make it worth it, the company itself isn't great. I have learned many great things along my Starbucks career. Since day one, I understood what it really means to give your 100 percent best customer service, even in a difficult situation, however I don't think its fair that as employees we have to put up with a lot stress from customers."
good,"Never bored "
good,In Starbucks I've learned a lot of things like interacting with different kinds of people and being more extrovert. It's fun being a barista you make friends as well as you make other people happy and satisfied because of your service. Training in Starbucks is totally a world class I can't compare it to others because for me Starbucks is one of the best.
good,Engaging job that you can learn a great deal from. It is challenging to move beyond the Store Manager role. Experience is greatly dictated by the field leaders in place.
good,"Starbucks is fun. But if you’re serious about moving up in the company, they will ask for your soul. They continuously introduce new additional responsibilities without much of an increase in pay. But you get benefits with 20 hours a week, so some aspects of it are great."
good,"If you think this job is going to be ""easy"", think again. What it lacks in mental complexity it makes up for in speed of service and demand. So, if you are looking for a job that is slow pace go elsewhere. If you can handle multitasking, long lines, and catering to customers then the benefits are worth it. I worked with a good team of people so I do not regret working there. I am a different person because of it."
good,"I enjoyed the people and the diverse atmosphere , very fast paced and constant. The benefits were awesome as well when it comes to opportunities for scholarships and certain programs. Plus the health benefits covers dental,and regular medical."
good,"Starbucks is a very flexible place to work.         "
good,"Although there are many fun people to work with, higher management can tend to ignore the Starbucks team. You can be alone for a full shift but they would not care as long as you are open. The hardest part would just be working alone since you have to stock in between and some times not even take breaks. The people you work with are fun depending who they are, but overall its an okay job to get experience."
good,"I used to love my job, I still do. But recent labor cuts & demands from DM's is killing my third place. It's heartbreaking. Low pay, but employees stay due to a sense of loyalty, for most of them, the benefits."
good,"Customers make the job amazing, fellow baristas can turn into family, starting may seem like it’s a lot but training is very easy and easy to retain, very easy to build relationships"
good,"Have to get used to working fast pace yet connect with customers as much as you can. It’s all about patience and understanding what a customer wants and then satisfying at the end, even then when things are too much, always encourage your team and keep it positive."
good,"Rythme assez soutenu et pouvant être stressant. Vaut le coup si on a un certain intérêt pour le café et les challenges. Le dur travail payes mais il faut avoir un certain esprit combatif. Le travail peut vite empiéter sur la vie personnelle. "
good,really fun fast paced work environment. I had a lot fun while I was working their got a long really well with our regulars. Learned how to make a really good iced latte their to.
good,"In this job you learn many things like multi-tasking, customer care, and maintaining cleanliness. Hardest part of the job is dealing with very picky customers with very little patience."
good,"Great company, though they compensate for low pay with great benefits. Corporate management doesn’t always help with in store problems and expects everything done regardless of the task, turns down any raise inquiries."
good,star bucks takes everyone and everybody very seriously and it is a very professional work place. it may depend on which location you work at but overall very serious.
good,"Starbucks was a lot more strict in dress code when I worked there, they were unwilling to accept that people had tattoo's and / piercings, and staff were not allowed to show either. Since my time there, Starbucks company have drastically relaxed on the dress code, both in clothing and the fact that people may have tattoos and/ pericings. It's a customer service job, so you have to deal with customers, that is always unpredictable."
good,"The company has high business growth opportunities, it’s constantly evolving to meet the needs of business. It struggles to keep baristas because their “total pay package” as this does not appeal to their minimum wage workers. They cannot stay competitive with pay when it comes to people under the age of 25."
good,"Starbucks is a very hectic job, especially at my location with a drive-thru. Rush hour is intense but manageable because each employee gets their work done. Everyone is nice and there for each other."
good,"A typical day at work includes positive interactions with customers giving them the best experience possible."
good,Starbucks will FULLY take advantage of working you if you let them. You must be firm! It does not pay great but pays well for a first-time job. I do not regret working at Starbucks. I wouldn't go back unless I was working at corporate.
good,"Great customers and free drinks for employees, free bag of coffee every week, great benefits and maternity leave, tuition reimbursement for ASU online"
good,"The benefits are amazing, but the pay and the workload requirements are not good. Low pay, overworked and abused by customers. With the right team, it is a great place to work, but it does take a toll on your mental health."
good,The company is great to work for but had a bad manager that made my experience less than happy. I started out training in a good store environment but the store i was moved to forced me to leave. Overall i worked well in fast environments and loved the company itself.
good,Even though the culture of the Starbucks I attended was a bit toxic I loved the job and enjoyed the people I worked with. Management needs some work as he did some very unprofessional things however other than that I have no complaints.
good,Every store is different--Starbucks itself has great standards but it depends on how well the store manager and team follow those standards. Drive Thru can be very stressful/fast-paced versus a cafe store.
good,Super expérience dans un petit shop très détendu. L'ambiance peut être pesante dans certains moment de la journée au vue des rush. Mais en globalité génial.
good,"This is a very fun and exciting job if you can handle the stress of long lines of customers expecting their drinks to be made correctly. I cannot speak on the management because during my time as a barista, the location was in-between managers."
good,"i transferred to a new location moving from florida to cali. my fl store was pretty good  my current ones is a bit awful  if you’re in a big city, i suggest working at a cafe only location  drivethru will end you lol i guess it rly comes down to management tho. idk."
good,"This is a good job to start at as a high school student or young adult. The advancement from barista to shift supervisor can be quick if you show the right aptitude. Pay is generally fair and tips are decent on a weekly basis. It can be difficult to get time off when you need it, especially around the holidays when the store is at its busiest."
good,I enjoy meeting new people and connecting with customers. I enjoy getting to know customers and their drinks. I also enjoy making drinks. It’s always exciting when Starbucks comes out with new beverages and food.
good,"It was mostly very hectic, but’s found it very rewarding. I experienced a great team environment plus the free coffee is amazing. It could easily go either way, I suggest looking for a cafe location not a kiosk."
good,"Was a fun job and loved my coworkers but when it came down to it, poor management and bad pay were enough for me to find something else. Wish I would have been able to enjoy the job more."
good,"Great company and great work environment."
good,"I think Starbucks truly tries to integrate their love for coffee into the training their staff.  The managers are expected to share with you more information about the drinks, from the coffee bean in its origin country to the one at the store.  As a result, you feel well-prepared to talk about the coffee and different drinks that Starbucks has, with the customers.  It's like having an actual conversation with them because there's so much to talk about when it comes to coffee.  In a way, it makes customer service easier because you actually get to be passionate about what you're selling to the customer.  You also believe in what you sell because you know that the product you're offering is great and worth the price."
good,"overall a good company to work with. gave you free coffee beans or tea once a week,  free drinks during the shift, good co-workers, but busy all the time."
good,"My typical day at work started with me asking the supervisor on the floor what role i was going to be for the day. As a barista we either on register, warming, or on bar making the beverages. If i was closing i would be on bar all day. In between making drinks i had several task i had to finish before the night was done i always made sure to have my tasks done ahead of time so i didn't have a lot on my plate at the end. The hardest part of the job was probably having to deal with rude customers. But my favorite part was seeing all my regulars come in happy to see me and vice versa."
good,"Starbucks is a phenomenal  company but it unfortunately wasn't my type of job. Its too fast paced. The training was very thorough, and the benefits were great too"
good,"I actually liked working at Starbucks but since its not a store that has a high volume of people, our labor had got cut and my hours were cut back. The hours are not enough to pay my rent."
good,"To be honest, it's a great place to work but... if you have the right people working with you. If you don't, it becomes a living nightmare that you won't escape from unless you get ""separated"" (their term for fired). Moving up is basically impossible if you didn't come in under the right circumstances. "
good,"Starbucks is fast paced and i'm fine with that however, some customers do not care about you. They just want their drink right away no matter if their drink is in sequence. They're just no nice to us Baristas, call us names, swear at us, and belittle us. Other than the rude customers working is great and can be fun."
good,Fun Place to work. Good pay and Great benefits. Also a good starting Job right out of high School. Good Management and friendly Staff. All around good Place to work.
good,Working at Starbucks gave me insight as to what it takes to be a barista during the morning rush. Making lattes was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Over all good company to work for , as a manager can be stressful, but with the right district manager you can really develop and advance. Leadership makes or breaks the work place"
good,Adoré la relation client. Adoré l’équipe jeune. Mais tout dans le sérieux.
good,"This job is nice for a college student or someone in school, however if you are trying to advance or make it a career good luck.  The atmosphere is fast paced and there is a lot of things that is expected of you for a part time minimum wage job."
good,"Being in a licensed store is a little different than working in corporate, licensed are a little more strict when it comes to prices and charging. Most of the time the reward program isn’t available at licensed stores.  Every store of course is different when it comes to management, so I cannot speak on management"
good,The benefits are awesome but the hourly wage is horrible. If you work store level the employees will become your family. Loved dealing with clients. Not much room for advancement. Wage increases are horrible. Insurance and other benefits almost make up for it.
good,"The model and concept of a company such as Starbucks is a great environment, but there were unfortunately common instances of bias, favoritism, and unprofessionalism in the elevation of some employees."
good,"This job was fun and challenging but made harder by hamstringing baristas in customer interactions and a lack of labor. A lot of the benefits of perks of the job were pretty subtle, like being able to hand craft your own perfect cup of coffee before starting work every day and working in a high energy environment usually with young people."
good,Tired but not stressful kind of job. It's the best company that promotes team work and a fun workplace for every co partners. Every new partners undergo trainings which what makes the job to understand easily fast
good,"My personal experience started off with lies. "
good,"Good company- good people; promoting from within is confusing"
good,"Benefits are okay, location could be changed and the actions of some could be changed. Fun coworkers and crazy managers don’t mix. Starbucks is an okay first job to anybody."
good,"A typical day at work would be cleanliness, cleaning and making sure the necessary ingredients for each drink was stocked. Management was nice and the people were great. The hardest part of the job was making sure, inventory was up to date, some would over order, some would under order which made the rest of the day vary depending on the situation."
good,I worked at Starbucks for two years and learned a lot about myself and grew as a person. Working there taught me how to remain calm in stressful situations and how to deal with upset customers. It taught me how to delegate and reinforced my love for working as a team. I enjoyed coming in every day and getting to work with my amazing team and make customer connections with new and returning customers.
good,"Management was always changing at my store so it was never a solid manager... they did their best to appease everyone, it was never enough."
good,I had fun working with my team. Management needs a lot more support. Hours are hard and sometimes we were so short of labour that it made the workload unbearable.
good,Starbucks is very worthwhile for those with little work experience looking for a starting position. They have good training and coworker relations are generally good.
good,"great company to grow inside of , great customer service skills . fast at drinks . flexible working hours . amazing benefits. help with people skills. help with college"
good,"Typically a very physically strenuous job if you are making drinks, closing, or cleaning. Workplace culture is to respect and create a pleasant ""third place"" for customers. Well thought-out training modules, but majority on the job training. Most enjoyable part of the job is definitely your coworkers; you bond through the chaos!"
good,"The specific location I am at is not good for personal growth.It is very very annoying. Also, management seems to go along with favoritism culture. However, I have made great friendships with fellow few coworkers."
good,a typical day at work consists of continuously making drinks and learning  skills in a fast-paced environment. the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with regular customers and helping people find drinks that they love
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. Does not pay well compared to similar jobs. Store managers are not empowered enough to do what needs to be done for success of the store.
good,"Fast paced environment and a fun place to work at.                                                                    "
good,"Do not work in Starbucks in a grocery store, you have to follow the rules of the store as well as the rules of Starbucks so I had to wear a hair net, wasn't allowed to make my own drinks, and it was always understaffed. I was often alone with 10+ customers ordering things like 5 venti fraps when we only had one frap machine so it took forever to get customers their drinks. I had people at the counter asking when their drinks were coming like they didn't just order multiple drinks at a Starbucks in a grocery store with one employee and a line of 10 people. It was incredibly stressful. Management was poor."
good,"You are definitely reminded you are working with a larger company and not everyone works with you to help you out: while at times you enjoy it. You are always being pressured into figuring out what is wrong and how to fix it. Sometimes, you will be saved by higher up reps, but at times you will be left on the floor by yourself with angry customers or angry crew members. The food and drink crafting can be exhilarating, and you can never stop craving that specific seasonal item, such as a pumpkin spice scone, and then after 3 you finally stop."
good,I enjoyed my time with Starbucks alot! I'm still good friends with alot of my co-workers even years later. It gave me many of the skills I needed to bring into many of my other future jobs
good,"With all the ups and downs life can throw at you, I loved working for Sbux. I would love to return to the company, but the only store in my area will not re-hire me due to labor costs. The only set-back I ever saw personally, I interviewed for upper management 3 times and continued to be told I needed ""more experience"". Yet I was training the people they hired out of store for the position 8 interviewed for. Didn't make much sense to me."
good,"So I started 4 years ago and I love the company, and the values and the goals the company works to achieve. Across the board however the partners that are good at their job or have been there for a while tend to be overworked. If you want to work here for just a check, maybe try again. There is so much interesting culture that you can learn and get involved with. Keeping an open mind and continuing to learn is how you'll be able to survive here. There's sort of an imbalance of work load that happens depending on what shifts you're working. Generally it's a cool company with great benefits, find a store that you love as a customer. If you don't want to learn or you think it's gonna be a breeze, don't apply."
good,"A typical day of work will consist of continuous customer interaction, frequent cleaning, restocking, and team work."
good,"Fast paced environment, the people make it fun, a lot to learn. I have really enjoyed working here for the time I have been there because learning to make the different drinks has been really fun."
good,"I learned to be confident in what I know, I worked extremely hard and have gone through managers getting fired, people coming and going, trial after trial and i know how much I can take now without compromising my self worth."
good,I worked for the military on Fort Hood so this is very different then a Corporate Starbucks.  We didn't have the same benefits nor did we get free stuff.
good,I enjoyed it but it was a fast paced environment and most of the time we were pushed to make numbers with not enough staffing so it became a toxic environment and stressful for everyone.
good,"This job is not for the faint of heart. You've got to learn how things work around there, and you've got to learn them quick, otherwise you get left behind."
good,"Over all it was a fun and rewarding place to work. The job is very routine based, we had a checklist to follow in the morning and at night. We had many tasks to accomplish that if we're not done what affect you the next day. It gets very busy and people are very specific but you learn very quickly how to deal with a negative situation. It can be stressful at times but at the end of the day the people really make the job."
good,Customer connections make the job feel super impactful. The ways that we are able to make connections and build relationships with people simply through a cup of coffee is wonderful.
good,The hardest part of working at Starbucks is the precise attention to detail and managing the customers. I believe they need to train managers how to be flexible with their staffs and cope their feelings.
good,For a close to minimum wage job its pretty cool! My cowokers are pretty nice for the most part and Starbucks has a pretty good culture all around. There is good benefits and discounts that help outweigh the low pay!
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you're looking for a job that keeps you busy. It is a very fast paced, customer service based job. I like to emphasize how important it is to build and maintain that customer experience but its also important to do it in a graceful manner that allows you to keep the lines moving and the customer on their way. If there ever is customer down time, there is plenty of maintenance to do such as stocking, cleaning, preparation, etc. I have a lot of fun on bar and genuinely enjoy crafting drinks with quality. The hardest part of the job must be when the cafe is understaffed, because it can get hectic at times and every person plays their role, so if you're missing someone, you have to double up on the role, it can get crazy but very possible with staying positive, genuinely serving the customer experience and being efficient."
good,"I worked with starbucks for almost 4 years. Great xompany with great benefits, but all depends on who you work with. I started out with a great  team of people. But the managemsnt slowly changed after i joined and changed the entire enviroment for me. "
good,It was good. Benefits are great. Managers could be better. People were alright. Basic good job. No room to advance in the company and puts its employees through the ringer with new polices every few months.
good,"i dont really have anything special to say, it was a decent company to work for. But nothing that i would brag about or run around praising like it was the best thing ever. Just, so-so."
good,"A typical day at work was comforting."
good,Got canned because i got sick and could not work for 2 weeks. Did not feel valued. Did not respect my disability. Not enough hours as well. Loved the assistant manager but i would not work there.
good,"Very fast paced. Many tasks to be completed during your shift, other shift leads seem to not want to help. Drama in the team. Pay is okay, small raises often, good 401k match and stocks. Opportunity for growth is given by favoritism."
good,Great job for those just entering the work force or those who need a flexible schedule. Benefits are great and pay is okay. Enjoyment depends on the manager and if they are committed to the their employees or themselves.
good,"The coworkers were awesome, however management played favorites and wouldn't provide many opportunities for advancement. Also didnt work to well with child being born"
good,Required to handle extremely heavy workload with little time for clean-up and reset for next shift after chaos has ended. Unrealistic time to complete tasks assigned. Nepotism was abundant within the management.
good,I have a good manager and good working partners. Flexsible working time and get a lot of experiance in food and beverage work. Making new friends and team.
good,"Some days are fine but when we have special drinks or other things it becomes a high stress situation and then once you run out and people start yelling it spikes your stress even more. Given I love the company and the friendships I have made with the people, but the hardest part in all honesty was the customers. Sometimes they would get frustrated at you for no reason that you had control over and just start yelling."
good,"I often recommend working at Starbucks, especially for a full time position. The benefits are really good, and can even provide an education. My only problems occured in my specific store about scheduling and management. Overall I still highly recommend."
good,"Working at Starbucks was nothing short of busy and fast-paced. I worked at the highest-grossing Starbucks at the time, since it had just opened on Gonzaga University's campus so the lines were always very long. However, it was fun being able to serve students and collaborating with a team to create an efficient system."
good,Working with friendly people and better customers to make a work day seem short. Fast paced and always busy. Getting great experience making hand crafted beverages and knowledgeable on all that you do.
good,"The company as a whole was great to work for. They are very focused on their employees and making them feel heard and apprecited. Afterwards it depends on your management team (ASM, SM, and DMs) whether they feel as passionate about their employees as the company expects them to. Essentially thats what will make or break your experience at starbucks."
good,Decent company-very stressful work place.fast pace environment. A lot of cleaning everyone do the same job you get a free meal and drinks each day you work and discount
good,There were too many outside hires for upper management that had no idea how Starbucks even ran. Every store is different of course. The store I worked at was very fast paced. The hardest part was having to stand there and let strangers call me names for mistakes that were easily fixed. But there were many regulars that were very kind. My coworkers were really the ones that made doing my job worth it.
good,Honestly it’s a great company. You just need to be careful with upper management. They tend to let DM do what they please and that can include belittling.
good,"Pay was good, job was easy most of the time, long hours and messy job but fun experience overall, I have made life long friends which I couldn't be more greatful for"
good,"I worked at a university, so it was a bit different from normal Starbucks, but it's usually fun if you have fun coworkers and managers. It's also fun to talk to the customers and try all of the ""secret menu"" drinks."
good,"Working as a barista at Starbucks was an overall neutral experience. While the job and tasks to be completed were themselves easy, the clientele that our store saw was at times very unpleasant. The job shifted from handling the products and learning/mastering the products to learning how to deal with unhappy customers. While this is a valuable skill overall, it was not a positive environment."
good,"First position out of college, eager to learn but felt belittled for being “young.” No direction or support was provided from my supervisors which led me to feel stress and like a failure."
good,Overall it was a good company but with lack of leadership and follow through in promises for advancement I have grown tired ! The benefits offered are great but beyond my affordability due to my low pay as a manager.
good,"Good place to start your working experience. You are able to grow your knowledge in different areas like, sales, customer services, team work, quality assurance and so forth."
good,"I’ve had amazing experiences and pretty rough experiences across different Starbucks stores. If you have a good manager, you will have a great time, meet great people, and have lots of fun making coffee for people. If your manager is bad, however, the whole thing can turn very sour. Make sure you choose a store that’s a good fit for you."
good,"Everyday at Starbucks is a new learning experience whether a new recipe, drink, or even just for self betterment when it comes to your tasks and job. Also be prepared to become a fast-pace learner because Starbucks is known for and is big on customers satisfaction. You will have days it may be more stressful and others and days where you finally feel like you've grasped everything you need to know to become a successful barista ."
good,"Working for Starbucks is great for someone currently in high school or in college. They’re always willing to work with schedules, they offer tuition reimbursement if you’re enrolled online for ASU, and the training is both hands on and envelopes the partner in the culture of Starbucks. Starbucks is one of those corporations that genuinely care about their employees as well as the environment and how they impact both. The only downside is that a barista job doesn’t offer much opportunity to make it a career due to the pay. Being a store manager obviously offers a better opportunity to become a life-long career, but the barista position is really set up as a temporary job for most partners."
good,"A company that's as large as Starbucks has many benefits and positives. But simultaneously there are areas where it can lack area to area. The culture of the company is rewarding and great but not every district and area has the ideal management."
good,Very laid back place to work at. Very kind and out  going people for my co workers. It was deffintly  a pleasant experience.  It was my first job in the food industry  so it taught me alot
good,Working at starbucks was a love hate relationship. Yes the staff was great and there were wonderful managers but they required 100% from each employee
good,"If you thrive in a very busy environment, then Starbucks is for you. Great people work there. It's a very diverse company with good benefits. Customer is king at Starbucks so be prepared to bend over backwards for the customer. (A lot of the regulars are great though)."
good,"Starbucks is one of the few companies that give benefits to part time employees.One only has to work 20hrs to get medical and dental. That being said the numbers we are expected to get while having outstanding customer moments is unrealistic. If you work in a drive through you are expected to hit 30-42 second cars-meaning that the car's order is taken, tendered, and handed out within the 30sec time frame."
good,They teach you all about coffee culture. You must learn all of the beverage recipes including seasonal ones. Depending on the manager of the store will be the quality of staff members. Due to that the quality of service can be different from store to store. It can be a great work environment. The company values are great.
good,"The Starbucks experience could be great, but it depends on which you choose to work at. Not every store is created equal, or paid attention to equally."
good,"This job was perfect for being a student, the hours are pretty flexible and the job is straightforward. Typical work day had a reasonable amount of work to do while not serving customers. It's a lot of cleaning, but fun when you get a rush of people, especially in the summer."
good,I loved working there. My environment was almost always fun and I met so many people while working there. There was almost always an opportunity to get more hours and the tips were decent
good,I liked starbucks a lot but as a supervisor my last manager at rosemont location talked a certain way toward me that made me feel stupid. She wrote me up for something that was partially her fault yet made me feel fully responsible to protect herself. I would reccomend starbucks though i loved it for a long time. My favorite manager (from golf/milwaukee) was fired which was odd.
good,"Fun and flexible job. "
good,"I originally applied to Starbucks for a full time job, but I have not been given full time hours since I had applied.  This would be a great job for someone graduating high school and a college student."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a very fun experience at first. Making drinks and the close relationships between partners made for a nice environment. It's a good company and it's definitely reputable. The only reason that I left was because of the change in management, otherwise I would have worked there through high school and maybe while I was in college."
good,"Oversaw development and training of new partners, sought ways to improve team cohesiveness. Lead supervisor team in implementing new company policies, products, and management techniques. Built on stronger customer services skills and quick communication. Individual attention to consecutive orders, works with a small well-functioning team to keep store operations at exceptional levels. Key-holder and safe management. Have experience working all day-parts for store operations, from early openings, peak sales, and closing."
good,"A typical day at work requires fast-paced movement and customer greeting, this job teaches one to persevere being on their feet the whole shift. It teaches patience, routine, and standards of beverage quality. Management differs from store to store, and if you have a great leader who uplifts their partners, the workload is lighter. Partners enjoy a workplace culture of warmth, while being professional. The hardest part of this job is the task of delivering under pressure when a great number of customer orders have been placed. The most enjoyable part of this job is learning about coffee and developing meaningful relationships with regular customers."
good,"I loved working with coffee and met tons of great people, but it can be very stressful overall with how fast-paced and angry customers will be. It can be hard to find tie at home as well because of consistently being called into work."
good,Customers can be a challenge and when coworkers don't have a teamwork mindset it can become challenging. Excellent for part-time work during school due to the flexibility of hours. Horrible if trying to grow within the company.
good,"Workplace culture was welcoming, warm and strong. A strong community of team players"
good,"Enjoyable fast paced job that makes the shift go by fast. Coworkers are typically very friendly and helpful. The hours are extremely flexible. Sometimes the corporation and management give baristas the short end of the stick in regards to pay and unneeded meetings, but it was perfect for a college part time job. The hardest part of the job is at the beginning. There is definitely a learning curve to sequencing on the bar as well as memorizing drink recipes, but once you understand it and develop muscle memory, it comes very easily. Troubleshooting and deescalating  difficult customers can sometimes be frustrating, but 9/10 times customers are understanding. Overall, pretty good job!"
good,"Because Starbucks is such a popular coffee shop, many of its locations are particularly busy from around 6:30 AM to 11 AM. It can be somewhat stressful when first starting out, but my advice is to power through it. Try to make connections with coworkers early on; that's what will help you the most in the long run. The job and the store function best when you work as a team, instead of focusing only on your station."
good,Very fun workplace. Managers treats their employees or partners equally. Creates positive environment. Solid teamwork for better execution of tasks. Helps each other.
good,"Starbucks, as a whole, is a great company to work for, but there were times when the store was understaffed, there were low amounts of product and the pay did not match the amount of work."
good,Fast paced and fun. Many opportunities to meet many new people and teaches great work ethic strategies. Great culture and great company principles. Provides free coffee for working staff during the shift.
good,It's a faced paced job where you can experience anything between a really great day and an awful mix of rude customers and unrelenting demand.  Overall it's a decent gig to toughen you up.
good,"I suggest it’s a short term job. It was ok."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for two years and I enjoyed my time with the company. The company offers full benefits even when you’re part time. The typical work day is hectic if you work for a drive through store, and more relaxed if it’s just cafe. "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consist of making coffee, taking orders, and satisfying customers. I learned the proper way to operate all places in the store. Management is very helpful and puts the right people to help me when needed. The workplace culture is full of positive energy and hard working team working together as one. Hardest part of the job is maintaining focus and your duty while on the floor. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting wit customers."
good,"Many customers are mean, this makes it difficult to do my job sometimes. Starbucks corporation has short staffed this year. nobody knows what to order because the displayed menu is elusive."
good,"I enjoyed much of my time at Starbucks for the most part, however, the job was very stressful and could be very demanding, the pay was not enough or equal to duties as required."
good,"The people working at Starbucks are my favorite part of the company.  I have learned so much that I can use throughout my career.  Overall, great experience."
good,I enjoyed working at star bucks. getting to use my creativity was fun for me. mixing different coffee mix to create a new taste. customers  enjoyed trying my new flavor
good,"A day a starbucks can get pretty hectic, but it's fun and easy to manage. I've learned how to manage many tasks at once, and not get overwhelmed. The jobs strengthens memory and improves communication skills. Staff is very diversed and friendly. The only issue was the manger, who was rude and micromanaged everyone and everything. The hardest part of the job was closing alone. Rushes would happen a lot and the store needs to be cleaned, stocked and organized before leaving. The best part of the job was making the drinks. It was fun, challenging, and entertaining. Plus the coffee smells great."
good,"My coworkers were like a family to me."
good,"Starbucks is a good job. It can get fairly busy, however it is manageable if you just take each hour at a time and keep working steadily. The management has always been fairly good, the only bad thing is the inconsistency of hours, however that isn't anybody's fault. The work culture is fun because you are bumping elbows with a lot of interesting people that you get to know quite quickly."
good,"I had a lot of great experiences working at Starbucks, felt very supported by the company in general with many options for personal growth and career advancement."
good,"Working at a corporate Starbucks will not provide a living income. It is a great second job and offers some good benefits, but the hourly pay is not good. Management varies depending on location."
good,"Overall I had a good initial experience at Starbucks. Like any other foodservice and customer service job, the customers could make or break the experience. Typically, store level management was very helpful and easy to work with and coworkers made the job enjoyable even if you were swamped. Teamwork is vital and so is adaptability. Don't expect to get a perfectly tailored schedule or whatever days off you want all the time."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work as a college student. The hours are flexible, there are great benefits, and you learn what true team work is in the work place. The hardest part of the job was interacting with difficult customers but, over time you learn that nothing they say to you is personal."
good,"I was hired for a full-time position at Starbucks, to which my manager verbally agreed. Though I received fair hours after being hired, I began receiving less than 30 hours per week. Though you are encouraged to cover shifts for people who would otherwise be unable to attend work and these opportunities come by surprisingly frequently, there is no guarantee that you will have enough hours every week. This, along with demanding work hours and taxing work duties, is not worth the near-minimum wage payment. Coupled with an insufficient number of hours per week, this means you cannot live on this salary. Nearly every employee in my district is given less than 30 hours per week, meaning open shifts are covered quickly. Managers are happy to hear your complaints, but seldom do anything to fix these issues."
good,"Typical day at work was pretty easy. I loved the crew I was working with it made work much more enjoyable. I liked the fast pace feeling of working there, and it was never super stressful"
good,Working here was fun at first but began to become tiresome. I loved it with my other employees but it was a lot of pressure near the end. The hardest part of this job is being able to not get involved in other peoples issues.
good,I love coffee and love the discount and mark-outs. Tips are great. Customers can be very pleasant but some are unpleasant and disagreeable depending on mood. Awesome drinks and uniform is chill.
good,"Starbucks is an overall great job. It teaches you people skills and really brings people out of their shells. You get to work with some awesome people and some questionable people. At my location at least all the managers / shifts were outside hires. Which became extremely uncomfortable to those that have been there for years trying to get those positions. The pay is in my opinion low for the amount of work that you have to do. The discount, insurance and school tuition is nice but the pay could be higher."
good,"If you want to grow personally and professionally, Starbucks is the place to be. It has an amazing workplace culture that is judgement-free, and super supportive."
good,"Great place to refine communication skills, develop fine motor techniques with finesse and provide excellent customer service."
good,This job is very fast paced but it will get you good experience in customer service and food service.  The benefits are not good and your schedule will be very inconsistent but if you are in school or have this as a side gig it is really great.  I made a ton of great friends at every store I worked in and you will never be bored.
good,We lost 5 people in the 4 months that I've been there. It's nearly 20 miles drive for not even a full shift of work. The store is very chaotic and there's a lot of pressure to go move up even if you haven't been there very long.
good,"Very fast paced and need of a lot of  patients, very thick skin and being able to multitask in very different  scenarios . As well of always keeping a smile on your face."
good,"Aprendes mucho sobre la atención al cliente, perseverancia y paciencia."
good,opening shifts are easy but can be very busy in the beginning and evening shifts are calm but a lot of cleaning. Employee and costumer bond is amazing.
good,"I have been employed with Starbucks for almost 7 years. It's something for everyone. Pay is not great. You have the potential to make a lot if you wanna manager your own store or district, but it takes a lot of work to show to higher ups you're prepared for it. It's a great place for people looking to just fill in time and make money. Great flexibility scheduling and time off. Great medical, vision, and dental. College reimbursement, and stocks."
good,"starbucks is a great job and stepping stone, however it is not for everybody. it is very fast paced and keeps you on your feet the whole time, there is not much downtime. I did so enjoy my co workers and the environment they brought but I needed something less stressful for the pay im making."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work, but upper management doesn’t really want you to promote to a higher position. They want ‘yes men’ and ‘yes women’ to make their jobs easier."
good,"Although it can be monotonous, especially when it's slow, Starbucks generally has a good culture with colleague who generally get along. Some managers are stressed out and that carries over to the shift, but some really know how to manage their teams well. It's a good part time job for any age, especially if you need some type of benefits."
good,"This is definitely not a career kind of company to work for. Benefits are great but the pay is less than sub par. Scheduling can be super flexible, so it makes for a good second job or an after school job. You meet really cool people"
good,"This was a fun, fast-paced job that allowed me to meet and work with good people.  It's difficult at times but the discounts and benefits were good.  Management was alright, typical retail middle management."
good,"I started in 2010 when the company was so awesome to work for. Now in the last five years, it has gone severely downhill. They pay is okay but I know ""its just coffee"" it can be stressful. Usually, not enough people working and they expect you to have awesome drive-thru times. However, they keep adding complicated unnecessary drinks that can affect it. Also, any changes to their rewards program usually make a hot mess. "
good,Quite an easy job and a fun environment to work in for students. Early mornings and mandatory weekend availability was not very easy to work with as a college grad  but the benefits are amazing.
good,Fast paced job with a great deal of customer interaction. It is a great job but you must be excellent in the customer service department in order to do well at this job.
good,"The benefits are nice, and if you need insurance, this is the easiest place to work for that. However, the low pay, stressful work day, and Starbucks-obsessed managers won't make it worth it in the long run."
good,"This is my 7th year as a barista a Starbucks. Do not get me wrong, this company invented benefits. The benefits are endless including unlimeted beverages while you work. As long as you have the right partners and managers you have a good time. Im very good at handleing stress and working in fast pace, if you are very relaxed and dont like being in high volume than Starbucks is not the place for you. Me being a coffee addict I thrive at Starbucks. The only low point for me was the fact that moving up in the company takes FOREVER if your manager even thinks you cannot handle it. My other low point, the pay. You start at above minimum wage. But that only goes up about 9-12 cents A YEAR. So i have been at the company for almost 7 years and I make as much as a shift that has been there for 2. Its just odd to me. Overall its a great job with amazing benefits, but the pay is a little iffy if you are trying to just live off this one job."
good,it was cool for a college job. Free coffee for ever basically. Shifts were nice cause you can work early and leave early. Work to life ratio is nice but need to be paid more for serving over price coffee to the rude public.
good,"Good job while you're in school or transitioning to another job. Can take time to make into career depending on education. Great as a second job if your primary job is stressful but you need more income. The culture is fun if you're young and into it, though i can see why people can tend to stay away at times."
good,Wish it provided more hours. Hard work in an 8 hr shift though. Leaves you tired. People are usually good natured and helpful. Lots of customer interaction and variety in work.
good,"At starbucks a typical day at work was extremely fast paced and stressful, yet competitive and fun. I learned how to make all of the drinks as well as how to take orders and receive payments. I also learned better social skills and how to please the customer and make them feel important to the company."
good,A great place to learn how to multitask effectively as well as work at a fast pace. Most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with customers. Management needs improvement but that is circumstantial based on the store.
good,"i love the working environment, i also can sharpen my skill instead of being barista and customers service that’s one for me also can calls as multi tasking task because you can making a coffee while handling customers.that was a good experience"
good,"Starbucks offers a fast paced environment and room for lower management growth and promotion within. Quite often the upper management is outside hires. There are several options for health insurance, medical, dental, and vision which is a big plus."
good,"While this can be an amazing place to work it can also be incredibly stress inducing. The manager and team you work with greatly changes the work environment. A lot is expected of those who work here, including baristas. Starbucks has very high standards for customer service and drink quality but provides very little labor and resources to accomplish these things."
good,As a Sm with SBux the job entailed excessive hours. There are a number of concepts that with fine tuning prior to execution would create an abundance of success. However they are too quick to execute without proper forecasting of potential sales.
good,"It is such a huge company it can be hard to be seen. Your experience will vary greatly depending on your store. Your manager and district manager have all the power. I had years of management experience coming in, and in the food service industry and I was hired to be a barista. I took it because their benefits are  worth it and I was prepared to work my way up. But that took forever because of the way upper management."
good,Starbucks is Fast Pace but it teaches you a balance between patients and accuracy and teamwork. Starbucks is not for somebody who cannot learn quickly but if you learn those drinks you'll be great.
good,"Starbucks being a good place to work varies by retail location. My last location was very enjoyable, fast-paced, competitive, yet kind and it was in a mall of all places. The hardest part of the job is managing customers at the same time as making drinks or a clean work environment. Often times customers want to talk to you as their items are being made or return drinks when made incorrectly, which they expect to be done whilst managing lines of 20 or more food and drink items."
good,"It was a fun, stressful environment and very busy and controlling company, best thing about Starbucks is that you decide your next step in life and they back you on it."
good,I loved work for Starbucks. Policys and procedures change a lot. Weekly changes with recipes and or sales tactics. Regular costumers are great to see. This is a fast paced job and you can burn out so make sure you work with good management.
good,"In order to love working a Starbucks, you really have to be a people person. Hard to make enough to live on your own. So, while the benefits are a plus - insurance, stock, free/low tuition to specific colleges online - if you're looking to make some serious cash, Starbucks isn't the place."
good,Challenging work environment where you are constantly on your feet completing multiple tasks at the highest level of customer service. It is a rewarding experience if you seek an engaged hard work and constant customer evolvement. The company has rigid guidelines and standards that can be very stressful but are rewarded with very affordable benefits and other employee perks/ resources.
good,"nice company to work for just manager made me feel uncomfortable,hours where flexible for myself enjoyed talking to new people,speaking to customers,learning new things"
good,"A typical day involves preparing the cafe for opening. This includes reporting and stocking incoming product, dating and placing products in the correct areas, and preparing for the mid-shift employees to have a successful transition into their shift."
good,"Very stressful at times but a fun atmosphere. Seemed there was a lose of passion but the company itself was great, customer service was held at a higher standard."
good,"At Starbucks Mechanicsburg it was a good work environment, they have safety protocols, the people were nice and collaborative and fun to work with. Benefits are good health,vision,dental also a 401k."
good,"Starbucks is a good place to start out at, however its very hard to advance within the company due to managers and shift supervisors not advancing so its harder to start from the bottom up, however it is doable. "
good,I learned a lot working at Starbucks.  This is a part time job for me while I am attending University full time and during breaks from school and over the summer.
good,"I started at Starbucks when I was 16. I had a lot of fun there and I made some great friends. The issue I had with the pay was that they did not increase wages with the cost of living. By the end, I was making just over minimum wage (or starting wage) after 4 years."
good,I work at a licensed store so I do not receive all the same benefits that a Starbucks barista at a corporate store would receive. So I basically just wear the Starbucks logo and serve there products but I do not get tips or have access to programs to help out college students such as myself at the location I work at.
good,Starbucks is a perfectly fine place to work. They look for and cater to those who want to express their individuality at their workplace. The work can be hard and the customers not very appreciative.
good,"Good environment, awesome employees. Managers are great too! Fun and friendly environment. Everybody treats you like family which makes it easier to go to work"
good,"A great place to work at to meet new people and socialize with coworkers and customers. Endless supply of networking opportunities and overall fun. Management used to focus on the partner connection and Customer experience but within the recent years, it feels as if management is all about results rather than the quality of creating a family environment that it once had."
good,les autres barista était très gentil mais la gérante non.
good,"The job is pretty simple, making drinks and warming up food. The most enjoyable part of work is creating friendships with the unusual customers. The hardest part of the job would just be the standing, after a while you get use to making the drinks so theres nothing to worry about there."
good,"The job at Starbucks is flexible with your time, easy to relocate to another shop, and always required to give the best customer satisfaction. Being a Starbucks employee requires you to be social and positive throughout the day for customers."
good,Management is typically okay but can be unorganized. Training is very minimal and doesn’t really prepare you for the job all that well. Co workers are pleasant
good,"i am always a big fun of start backs quality coffee.when i get the chance to work there i was so excited for,coffee industry is also my passion ...i am always grateful for the opportunity."
good,"Its like any other job. If management is good, work will be good. there is training, and critical thinking. Ive learned how to interact with people. the hardest part was managing people as a shift supervisor."
good,The work was fun and paid well with wonderful benefits. Managers are not given sufficient training and the whole workplace suffers because of it. The people you get to work with are usually incredible.
good,This is the perfect job to have as just a job leading to your career. Use this as a stepping stone. Your going to meet some great people and awesome customers.
good,"Great place to mingle with the customers, great support from co-workers. Enjoy the fast pace on Drive through and enjoy the tips as well. We are encouraged to engage with our customers."
good,"If you're not already at management level, you CAN work your way up from barista to supervisor to manager, but it takes a lot of years and sometimes a lot of politics."
good,"Loved working at starbucks, the environment was great but the management was lacking. Shift supervisors did majority of the duties and only saw the manager once or twice a week even though I was full-time. What keeps people around is the staff, they are great and it's like a little family. The worst thing is that the customers are put before the staff in many situations. Customers know Starbucks caters to them and will do whatever to make them happy so they really take advantage and abuse the employees."
good,"The job itself is easy its the rude customers and manager that makes it suck, but overall its a good job with good pay for the work you do. They also have good benefits."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes caffeinating customers, which is probably my favorite part of the job. Management seems to care very little about work/life balance among partners."
good,"Starbucks was a stepping stone and not a career, the hours were always being cut and we were forced to do the job of 5 people with only 3 people working."
good,"Starbucks is very fast-paced, and places importance on having a sense of urgency. It is a great place to meet new people, from staff to customers. Though there is a routine, every day is different at Starbucks."
good,"First off, the benefits are great. The wages are relatively high, there's a lot of good discounts, health care, free college, etc. Also, it's fun being able to create different drinks and learn how to make new things."
good,"I've  worked for so long with the company, just has changed over the years. Was great when i was a barista, they just expect alot for so much we can do. Managers and District manager dont seem to care if we are over worked or our well being. Mention them about employees who dont do their job or have problems with and wont do anything about it. Wont listen to opinions either."
good,Since I worked there I believe Starbucks has improved. Maternity benefits were not the best at the time but I was given time to breast feed and would have stayed with the company had I not moved.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work, however it lacked in management at times and Could have used an assistant manager. Pay was also very lacking in my opinion."
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and making the moment right, but it is a good first job. The partners are what made me continue working because everyone is friendly. I would recommend just my time is done."
good,"Day to day was very hectic at Starbucks, very inconstant with employees. There was no accountability for any of your actions. To many things fell on the Manager."
good,i had fun while i was there my customers was great i worked the drive thru my co workers was great switched up managers too much the hardest part was losing a good manager
good,"It was a very fast paced work environment.  There was always a line out the door.  Great little business.  However, I felt like it didn’t mesh with my more focused customer service talents.  I really enjoy helping the customer so that they are totally satisfied and make them feel very special.  I can not stress enough how much I love working with all types of people."
good,"The job offered plenty of experience in connecting with customers and building teamwork skills. The amount of memorization of different drinks always kept me on my feet and thinking. The store would fill quickly and if myself or any coworkers fell behind for a moment, it could throw things into chaos. This created for an occasionally stressful and heated work environment, but gave me a more responsible attitude."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks when I first started, it was new and exciting and fast paced and I could see how much the company cared for their partners. In the last 2 years as a shift supervisor, I have seen the company go in a corporate direction that I do not agree with. They claim to have an open mind about everyone equally but I don't agree. The third place is a joke and not safe for partners."
good,Great way to meet people and create a regular guest. It was a great experience getting to know all different ways to create an amazing cup of coffee and frozen beverages
good,"This job is not terrible as far a retail positions are concerned. Benefits are available as long as one maintains around 20 hours per week. A typical day includes: being on your feet 99% of the time, bending, lifting under 20lbs, preparing beverages, and constantly interacting with customers."
good,"A pretty good place to work overall, if high paced environments don’t freak you out. There’s a lot to learn and the standards are rigid. Supportive team, hard to move up in the company. One complaint is the difficulty to be promoted internally."
good,Stressful time limits and lots of cleaning. Typically scheduled early mornings or late evenings. Great management and communication. Fun atmosphere that allows for connection with customers at times.
good,"The longer I worked there, the easier it the work got. Overall, I did feel a bit rushed into the working and felt a bit forced to learn the job on my own. The coworkers were patient for the most part but I felt like if I was fully trained I could feel more confident to perform tasks at the bar, serving the drinks."
good,"During my years at starbucks turnover was very high. Due to NY Metro being one of the hardest terrirories to manage, District Managers along with Regional Directors were being rotated every 6 months or so. Making it difficult to properly allign yourself with a mentor and or a good support team. However, the most enjoyable part of being there was the coffee :)"
good,"The job has progressively gotten more rough with the change in management over her past 1.5 years at this store. The culture in the store has become very negative and draining, with a general lack of time management skills. This has meant that breaks are early, late, or missed, which adds to the stress each shift. Expectations of employees and maintaining consistency within the store have become very relaxed leaving one employee on the floor by themselves too often. Simply put, the job has become more stressful than it should be."
good,"very fast passed job, if you mess up a lot of the older workers really get mad, terrible training i kind had to just figure it out as i worked and got called out a lot for not being properly trained. work place is very clique. The hardest part of the job is when it gets really busy your always on your feed and on get 2 15 min brake and a non payed 30 min brake depending on how long is your shift, but if its too busy sometimes you miss a brake to help. really not enjoying the job."
good,I felt like my store really worked with me and I had a good manager. Everyone was very nice . It would get busy and stressful at times. Over all good.
good,"El trabajo no es difícil, si no hay mucha organización, buscan la sobrecarga del empleado y son bastante tacaños a la hora de ofrecer promociones o facilitar el trabajo de sus empleados."
good,"While Starbucks goes the extra in benefits and providing an inclusive working environment for it's employees, their is a cult like feeling in the air. Though I like a lot of my co-workers I found the upper management to have a contradictive perspective. For those who did not live and breath Starbucks would find themselves on the outside of being excepted amongst the other employees."
good,"I just want to start out by saying that I personally had a great experience at my store. I've worked in customer service and food service before so it was quick for me to pick up. That being said I absolutely do not recommend this as a first time job. Also managers and coworkers are very hit or miss. Some managers just care about the numbers, some have cliques, and some seem to be intent on running a store into the ground and letting their baristas take all the weight. I primarily worked nights and I didn't have too much trouble getting the hours I needed, but if you only want to work mornings there will be more competition. You need to be flexible. If you can find a store that fits your needs with scheduling, mood, and you feel like you can handle the demands of the position, I would recommend it. Depending on where you live, pay is not the best."
good,"Overall, the work environment was awesome. Hours were flexible. The ability to grow knowledge on the product and processes was also great. The pay for Store Manager was inconsistent with the industry. The opportunity for advancement was also limited."
good,"clocking in at 4 am served coffee and food by 4:30, crowded, manager not polite to staff, i learned how drinks are really made behind the counter and holiday tips split only with those who worked that holiday."
good,Everybody was accepting of everybody and everything. Great culture. Still visit and am met with love and great conversation. Hard working crew. Great benefits.
good,"A typical day at work starts with the setup, we want to make sure we can meet all our customers needs cause they are our regulars. On their way to work it feels good to make the morning a little bit easier."
good,it was a fun energy working there and getting to know all the usual customers that come in on a day to day basis and it was exciting getting to try all the different things the menu has to offer
good,Starbucks is well organized and provides opportunities to move up in the company. Starbucks gives employees the opportunity to pick up or give away shifts from other stores.
good,"The workplace atmosphere at Starbucks is generally very positive with generally good amounts of encouragement from management. However, there are often instances in which the system does not provide appropriate support or staffing to handle demands effectively and positively. I greatly enjoyed my time working there, but there were quite a few very stressful moments either due to understaffing during very busy time periods or rigidity in scheduling. The environment does also grow old after some time due to its overly-polished and inauthentic business focuses."
good,Store manager never came to help out during night shifts. What wasn't done was always night shifts fault even though managers would allow morning shift workers to go home early.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is full of excitement. New customers and experiences each and every day. Providing customers with a smile and a cup of coffee can warm their day. Your coworkers help provide Starbucks with the warmth one should provide when serving others. Sometimes the job can prove troublesome when complaints and issues arrive. Treating these problems with a smile and a compassionate ear can make the whole situation much better. Providing great customer service is much of the job, so it should weigh heavy on the barista's shoulders."
good,"Depending on your coworkers it can be a fun environment, but like every other job, you'll have your toxic workers who don't want to be there and makes it complicated for everyone. In reality, most jobs will have their up and downs, but Starbucks does have a few perks that will interest certain individuals."
good,"My time at Starbucks was amazing. I love the busy morning rushes. Being on bar was stressful if you couldn't keep up, but once you learned how to keep up, it was really enjoyable. Starbucks is the best job I've ever had."
good,Typical shift is spent mostly serving customers. Very young atmosphere. The location was next to a high school and so the clients and staff were adolescent age and so there was always a buzz of energy.
good,"Starbucks is not exactly a job for everyone, but once you are in it, everyday is a different learning experience. Not everyday is a walk through the park but with a positive mindset and a strong team, it'll be worth every moment. I truly believe, although as cliche as it sounds, that Starbucks brings people together. It's more than just ""your average coffee shop"". You will make connections with coworkers and even customers whom of which you'd never expect to turn into life long friends and even companions. Most importantly, the mission and values of Starbucks teaches you about yourself. I know that when I finally decide to walk away from this company that I can take all of the lessons I've learned and experiences I've encountered with me into my future and know that they've helped mold me into the person I am today."
good,"f you work at a store worth their salt they will work you to the bone. Especially in a large or high-volume store, there is so much to do, so much to clean. A morning shift person will have the absolute insanity of a morning rush, but an evening person should be expected to handle evening rushes with a limited staff as WELL as get the place spotless in what I believe is not a reasonable time."
good,"- get assigned placement for the day and properly maintain area so store runs smoothly"
good,"If you need something temporary this is a great job! You get paid bi-weekly and get a discount. Hours are very flexible, and management are great, you also get stock which is amazing!"
good,I enjoyed working at starbucks and would go back. I did not get a lot of support for the first month and kept in the loop about what was going on with the position i was filing. It was a great place to work though.
good,"Starbucks can be a great place to work for student but the demands are high and the wages are low. Managers, district managers are constantly asking for a high quality of work but continue to understaff the store."
good,"Working at Starbucks was such a fun experience. The only time things were really hectic was during Frapp Happy Hour and peak time. Other than that, usually the staff become really close and have a true bond."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was my co-workers. The work environment was very diverse and everyone always encouraged one another. There was a set-up to where we could all each slip each other small positive cards and there was never a day in which I didn't receive at least one.
good,if you love a fast pace always on your feet kind of experience in your work space then Starbucks is a great career option for you . A wonderful place to start a career as a partner and work your way up the business latter. The partners are very welcoming at first and are open to new workers on the work space. Partners are very helpful to new partners and patient when explaining tasks. A wonderful first job and college job.
good,"Typically work was fast, stressful and by the book, I worked mornings so I always took on the rush. If management is good the job is easy and by the books- if management is terrible then the job is awful. The same can be said of customers as well though. The job experience will change from store to store. I loved the store I worked at but I have subbed at other Starbucks where the employees and customers were rude and tensions were high. Most enjoyable part of the job is learning about coffee and coffee culture across every country. The worst part of the job is that they have career building exercises and meetings that never actually result in change withing the company. It's almost just a formality to make it seem like the corporation cares about the individuals grievance. It's a college job for me, not a career so for what I needed Starbucks is great, it pays better than most food jobs and gives benefits for 20 hr work weeks."
good,"I honestly loved this job and the people I worked with. It keeps you busy and time goes by fast. The only problem is I only had 16 hours a week, 4 hours shifts at a time. The management was rude but had good days. Room for advancement was difficult if you aren’t in the loop with other workers. The customers and making the drinks were the best part of that job. I learned a lot, I didn’t know there were that many different types of coffee!"
good,Great place to work. You have to be willing to be flexible in hours and able to deal with guests everyday. Drink coffee and connect with partners and the community. The hardest part is leaving for the day.
good,"It was a decent temporary job but with little to no incentive to continue. The best part was the customers."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks involves getting updated for the day."
good,"I feel Starbucks is a great job for self building, For putting yourself out of your comfort zone. You meet great people and a Great team. I’ll highly recommend Starbucks."
good,"Customers keep you on your feet and if you like busy environments you will thrive. I have mixed opinions about management from my experience, I have observed courtesy but also unfairness."
good,"In my opinion, this is more like a part timer job where you just want to earn a little income while studying. However, if you like working in a F&B sector, then you can definitely consider this a long term career and slowly upgrade yourself to a store manager."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for about six months, and I felt the best working there than almost any other job I've held. I was immediately greeted with the most uplifting and supportive team and boss. I was taught with a developed and effective training program and was educated on Starbucks' business model and social standards of tolerance in the workplace."
good,"I have had a lot of food service/customer service based jobs and Starbucks is among one of the betters but it is far from perfect. Depending on your cafe/store it can be fine or it can be a horror show. Advancement is almost impossible these days. Any of the ways to better yourself as a barista have been ""temporarily"" suspended. Being understaffed is the status quo. The benefits only just make up for it."
good,"Starbucks cares more about their employees than other comparable companies. They provide good benefits and a decent workplace environment, making it a good place to stay for a while. "
good,"Of all of the retail/sales jobs I've had in my working life, Starbucks is one of the companies that actually cares about its employees as more than just a ""body filling the role"". I am assured that I will be listened to if I come to a superior with a problem or concern. Should I need changes to scheduling or location, the managers have always been willing to work with me as much as possible. Biggest stressors are extra picky/grouchy customers and disruptive homeless/addicts that come into the store, but that's maybe 20% of the people we interact with and is mostly due to our downtown location."
good,"it was a lot of busy mornings, and weekends. i learned that working together in a group doesn't have to be difficult, i loved my manager, and the girls i worked with"
good,It was nice working for them but don't believe I was paid enough for the job. While they do 6 month raises they really aren't worth that much. It was nice when you can get the morning shifts and can leave by 1:30
good,"The Baristas and shift managers are great people who help you every step of the way. The scheduling on the other hand is not consistent and inconvenient. You have to be available everyday of the week and any hours of the day. They will schedule you every day except one day a week, only for 5 hour shifts.  Due to the 5 hour shifts you only receive a ten minute break once a day."
good,"Es un buen trabajo y con buenas prestaciones, la cultura que maneja la empresa es muy buena si se aplica bien en tienda, eh estado en tres sucursales ya y solo en la última no ha logrado mi gerente aplicar bien la cultura de la empresa, el cambio de Rh no es bueno, tu mismo gerente es la persona encargada de recursos humanos, los turnos son pesados pues hay mucha gente, pero el turno se va rápido, es un trabajo desgastante pero es también uno muy bonito, te consume mucho tu vida social."
good,hire from the outside. little chance to succeed. lkjdfkjdfakjfl dfkljalkdfjlkdajflkdjaflkdjflkdjaf;lkdj;ldjfdjlkdjflkdajlkfdjlkfa  dkljfdj  fljkkdjfl`
good,"It was nice, when i first started they really made me feel like i was needed. I was getting a lot of hours at the time too. Later on down the road my hours started to deplenish from 30 - 20 - 12hrs and because of this a lot of problems occured outside of work which caused a ton of issues."
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work in that you guaranteed work, and are regularly offered the schedule that you want. I believe every quarter you are allowed to change your availability. The stricter you make your schedule the more consistent that schedule will stay.  If you have a reasonable manager you will show up everyday to work knowing what to expect and be given the tools needed to complete your job successfully. It is very corporate, and each position is very outlined as to what you will do. Meaning each position, being register, or on bar and so forth is very lined out and detailed. So if you understand the each task of your position all you have to do is show up and get it done, takes very little thinking."
good,It is great for work-life balance and offers good benefits for schooling. The culture can be a great environment with the right management.  Regular customers are the best!
good,"I was a student working part time only a few days a week so I found the work load not to be too bad. The workplace environment is fast paced, and you are always on your feet."
good,"I worked in what is classified as a ""high volume drive"" store for Starbucks. If you have ever worked in customer service like this you know what to expect. People getting mad, tons of work, not enough employees on the floor etc. But I did enjoy my time at Starbucks. You know what is expected, with clear deliverables and things become habit. The co-workers are fantastic, and I very much enjoyed the beverage crafting."
good,Your happiness in this company really depends on the store manager. I have worked at many different stores and the best stores have the managers that care the most about their partners.
good,I enjoyed most of my time working for Starbucks. Coffee making is truly a craft and I am so thankful for my knowledge in that regard. I worked with a lot of younger people (college kids) who I feel perpetuated drama in the store - that's pretty much my only negative. I enjoyed my regulars and the tips were okay.
good,"Working at starbucks is a great time, it can be fast paced and busy at times but also slow and boring. The hours are not consistent, the wages for baristas are not equivalent to cost of living, and any time off affects how many hours you are given."
good,"It highly depends on what manager you have and how they handle the stresses of the rush, but if the store has a good stable manager with the ability to understand that a line does not mean we are working poorly, but in fact it means we have done such good work that we are drawing in more customers than the storefront was designed to handle."
good,"In my personal experience, it was an okay place to work. Learning all of the drinks can be complicated at first, but you will get the hang of it. The customers can sometimes be very snotty and confusing about their orders, so you have to have tough skin and some patience. Just don't let what they say get to you. The hours are probably the worst thing about Starbucks. They're never consistent, and not enough to make any sort of decent pay. You will be busiest during the holidays, but even then, the pay is just okay at best. You can get tips, but that's usually divided and shared among the employees. Overall, not a bad place to work, but not the best either."
good,"Fast paced, stressful, but rewarding work. Management on the local level could be better, but the company values are always present. Limited growth options on the local level"
good,"it had it's ups and downs, I guess sometimes i got frustrated but i love my coworkers and couldn't have asked for a better team, I personally feel it depends on the manager"
good,I stayed at Starbucks because they were very flexible with work. Some of the things you have to deal with do not seem recognized by the company financially.
good,Serving customers daily. I have learned how to prepare beverages according to the Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) and various types of coffee beans in the world.
good,good job for people working more than 1 job. enjoyed the pound of free coffee every week. the product id good. cleanliness is taken seriously. It is a part of the community wherever it is located.
good,Starbucks es una buena empresa para trabajar muy unida.
good,"Pros- Love the customers and people I work with, decent hours, fast-paced"
good,"This was a good job with great benefits. The work is difficult but the company takes care of its employees. The big issue is that once you reach supervisor level, it's hard to keep moving up."
good,"Not enough to live on without support or roommates but good work experience and has a nice education reimbursement. Great for high schoolers saving up, or college students living at home."
good,Coworkers are fun to work with however management is poor and the store environment isn’t welcoming. Managers don’t do write ups just ignore everything.
good,Depending on the people you work with could be a good experience or bad one. Depending on your location could be easy or fast paced. depending on your location could be easy or fast-paced.  Work goes smoothly when you work together as a team.   Communication and support is  imperative for successful team .
good,"I appreciate all the ways that Starbucks tries to give back to their employees. The tuition reimbursement is such a huge benefit. Part-time employees are eligible for healthcare and other benefits. Plus, who doesn't love a little coffee?"
good,"The workplace is very fast-paced and can be at times stressful, it may vary on the management, however at Starbucks you will learn and develop the ability to multitask each day."
good,É uma empresa com uma boa dinâmica e ambiente. Temos um bom espirito de equipa e o trabalho flui bem. A parte mais agradavel do trabalho é poder conhecer novas pessoas e falar diversas linguas. A pior parte é ter que lidar com a confusão diária e a grande afluencia de pessoas.
good,"Always busy, great relationship with customers. You feel like part of a community, and the work is fun. Lots of available training and teamwork. I miss it often."
good,"very fast pace. i enjoyed working at Starbucks mainly because of the customers. Starbucks is a franchise known to almost everyone. The most enjoyable part of the day is morning time, usually known as rush-hour."
good,"It is a fast paced environment and can be a lot to handle at first, but after settling in is an amazing company, brand and team to work for! I did not intend to leave and would love to work there again. The culture is fun and upbeat, the management is professional yet friendly. I learned so much about coffee and interpersonal relationships."
good,"Working at Starbucks in France was a really nice experience, although the salary isn't really attractive (minimum wage). "
good,the customers were greedy unfortunately. making the drinks was the best because you could challenge yourself with such a small task.  Very uniquely put together.
good,"A good experience, Starbucks is a good employer. I enjoyed working here, the environment was good, the other employees were friendly, and the boss made sure that I was happy in my role."
good,It is overall a good place to work while in school but there is little room for growth and head office positions are few if you wanted to stay with the company outside of the stores.
good,as a part time employee the least amount of hours varied by store.  I wanted to just work a few hours on my off days from my full time job.  I was told i needed to work atleast 20-25 hours to stay employed.
good,I loved working for Starbuck but the down fall for me was the paid and you could go higher then shift supervisor because everyone wanted to be a manager and that part was competitive...
good,"all employees always have a smile, friendly and kind attitude at work. we try to provide the best customer service, every customer must feel like the first."
good,"Starbucks was my first real job, and I gained some great things from working there. It taught me to have a strong work ethic, how to deal with and talk to people, and it forced me out of my shell. These were all things that I felt I really needed to excel at in order to perform well at my job. "
good,"The first couple of years were great, but the culture of the company has lost its way, Its more about the money now than the people. You are encouraged to work harder and harder but more and more they are offering management positions to outside hires."
good,The job was good and had a positive environment to work in. Though often had mediocre leadership due to inexperience and immaturity in and leadership role.
good,Fun place to work. Offers a great opportunity to make money if you're a student or new to the workforce. Easy job with thorough training. Quick way to make money
good,"it's a fun place to work at and always busy so the day goes by quickly. After you move up in rank is when it gets complicated. There's a lot of work to be done in a fast paced environment all while trying to build relationships with customers. There's a lot to do in very little time and sometimes one feels helpless, especially if you're a supervisor working in a high volume store."
good,good people to work with depends on which manager you get in your location to have a successful work experience. very fast pace good hours and benefits pretty flexible with hours decent pay.
good,"Early hours. Great people. Met some wonderful people, both coworkers and customers.  Created wonderful friendships.  Learned a lot about styles of coffee. Would go back if I was able to make better money."
good,I find that the Starbucks’s on the private campuses are much safer and efficiently ran. Bon appetit does a very good job keeping things organized at their store locations.
good,"A typical day at starbucks is extremely busy, due to the fact its one of the ones at the airport.. i have learned a lot of different ways of making coffee drinks. the hardest part of working at starbucks is the fact that you work at the airport so things are not quite like the outside starbucks."
good,It was a very nice company to work for. It was always busy which was good but also bad when we ran out of product sometimes it was hard to have someone step away to make more product during the middle of the day but we made it work. It definitely helped when we prepared the night before.
good,learned a lot and sure help me grow as a person a day at work consist of fast movement and keeping everything restocked and clean management tired their best to keep things smooth
good,"The amount of customers on a given day varies by location, but inevitably there will be a rush that the floor crew has to hustle to complete. It gets stressful trying to get all the drink and food orders out quickly while still trying to clean the dishes piled in the back sink, or while needing to count down the registers, or while trying to get a massive wall of stock put away because no one on the morning shift got around to it."
good,If you need a job that pays a bit above minimum and you can work fast and are a quick learner then this is the place for you. The people the job attracts are typically very cool and a joy to work with.
good,"have been working at Starbucks part-time for a month"
good,I feel as though they worry more about everything else than their employees if they learned to balance it would be a much better work environment. The hardest part of the job is expecting to work the bar and never get the chance
good,"The job was definitely high-stress, especially during peak hours. Although, there were many friendships that were formed between coworkers and it seemed like everyone respected each other. A couple of shift managers were quite strict, but that can be expected. You were able to talk to coworkers and were able to have personal, professional relationships with each other, and overall it was quite friendly. Everyone that is working is an integral part of the success of the company, so it was a good experience on that side of it."
good,"Balancing efficient preparation of food/beverage while taking time to provide good customer service. Maintaining cleanliness throughout the day. Learned how to multitask, especially under pressure, and work as a team. Management and coworkers were good comparatively to other similar type jobs. Hardest part of the job is keeping your cool during rushes, and maintaining positive attitude in the face of nasty customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was actual beverage preparation; learning the recipes and gaining confidence in your abilities, opportunities to be creative."
good,"Can be stressful and fast-paced but if you're hourly, they take care of you.. When you're a manager, it's not good enough to be a good manager, it's about the corporate politics and after 10 years, that's why I left."
good,"high volume, high energy store. great regulars, i love most of them a lot. run out of things more often then i would like, and we are in need of a bigger space with all out options and our volume of output."
good,I was a barista at Starbucks. It could get stressful during rush times and if people called out often no one would be able to replace them so we would be short staffed. But once you learn what you're doing its a pretty easy and enjoyable job.
good,productive and fun workplace depending on the team you are working with overall is well funny and time go fast. every day you meet new people you can have a good relationship with regular customers.
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for many years now, and I've seen it's ups and downs. The company has gone through so many changes in the last few years, some good, some bad."
good,"Servicing industries from providing supply chain and logistics in the high end electronics industry to pumping gas and putting a smile on the faces of others going about their day, I provide professional experience with personality."
good,"The co-workers at Starbucks are always fun. Unfortunately, it is hard to find a good store manager. This also applies to district managers. The sales targets and window times are unrealistic. This job will burn you out quickly. It is easy to love, as long as you do not push yourself very hard."
good,"Starbucks is a good company that tries to care about it's employees.  There's part time benefits, paid part time sick leave, stock options and all sorts of great benefits to work there.  The problems are the pay, which is not really enough to live on, as well as the amount of hours you work.  Depending on your store you will either get fewer than you need, or more than you can handle.  Fewer can be better because Starbucks allows their employees to pick up shifts at other corporate locations, but if you have more than you can handle, good luck finding anyone to cover for you.  They under hire and expect the existing employees to pick up the slack. If they do, then the managers don't have to hire anymore and that's the new status quo."
good,"Accommodating to schedule changes. However, expect you to drop your life outside of work for them and the company. (based on the store I worked in). Not saying that all starbucks are like that as I have only worked for one."
good,Was a good place to work. But very competitive because it was a brand new store so everyone was trying to prove themselves. So they could move up. Great place for the college kids-flexible scheduling
good,"nice people, friendly customers, clean workplace. The job itself is not bad but it is super hectic on a rush and happy hour. A lot of recipe to remember."
good,"I think Starbucks is overall a great company to work for, compared to similar waged jobs, but I think the pay is still just too low. The experience also varies greatly store to store. The first store I was at for a year was fantastic and led me to believe I would work there for a very long time, but the store closest to my home that I transfered to was so terrible I had to quit."
good,"pay could have been better especial for those who didnt use the benefits such as health, dental or vision. the environment was good, but in all hindsight it was temporary"
good,It paid the bills a little bit. Got to experience different types of people and try different types of drinks. Always a pleasure making sure customers are happy and given what they want.
good,A positive and kind attitude is promoted. Making sure you are trained well and understand the system is enforced. everything has a specific way to be done and leaves little room for error.
good,"I really have no review to give in this section, just my votes. I haven't worked for this company in over 5 years. They are an okay company. Work for the benefits only."
good,"Individuals that have strong work ethic will flourish in this career field. The knowledge is endless and the life experience gained will stay with you for life."
good,"If you want a job through Starbucks, go to a corporate store and not one inside another or you won't get regular Starbucks benefits. The management is okay depending, but coworkers are amazing!!"
good,"Starbucks is great with benefits, but the pay is low, the job is very stressful at times, management isn't always the best, coworkers call out a lot, some customers are absolutely crazy with their coffee, some customers are the greatest, and the shifts are what make or break the store."
good,"When you have a good manager, I believe everything looks fun and enjoyable. If the management team is not good enough, it is easy to lose your motivation and your passion."
good,"Working at a licensed store is much different than working for corporate. So it's unfair to review them as the same. Give the corporate stores a chance, I've seen friends really make a career out of the company."
good,"title really says it all, health insurance is there but pricey, definitely not as rewarding as one would think. enjoyed a the beginning but after receiving a transfer I no longer enjoy working at starbucks"
good,"I enjoyed Starbucks and learned a lot. They gave me lots of hours, but unfortunately, management was not accommodating to the employees needs or time they needed off."
good,losing devoted employees because of bad managers. keeping bad managers causes more money and profit loss to a store. The benefits are wonderful. free coffee is a giant plus.
good,"I enjoy working here. I love the customers and the flow of everything. If you have a problem with being social, it's okay because this job really helps you come out of your shell. The job is such an energetic place to work at and the connections and relationships you make with your customers and co-workers is the best. I learned how to network, communicate, how I like my coffee and how to help others figure out how they like their coffee, time management skills, etc. I only had a problem with the new management at my store that put a damper on everything and kind of just screwed up the easy flow of the store and people working there. It became more about numbers and pleasing the upper management and less about the employees happiness."
good,"I love the environment of Starbucks, but the management team is usually lackluster and unable to lead. This is due to the fact that to become a shift lead or manager, it is more weighed on time than it is whether you are actually a strong leader."
good,Great place to work over all.  Great benefits etc. overly stressful at times due to many quick changes made to direction based on overall company guidance.
good,It's in your job description to personally connect with customers. Each customer comes in and you must create a comfortable atmosphere for them. If you aren't a people person I strongly don't suggest this job.
good,"Start the day with pressure, handling customer complains, management is average, good but need to improve, trying to satisfy customers daily, completing daily routine"
good,I enjoyed working at the store i worked at. I was comfortable and my management was very friendly. I was able to learn quickly and grasp each section of training.
good,"The company is fine to work for, however the girls are catty and cliqish.  The management in the specific one I worked at was horrible and rude to me.  It was awful and the manager there shouldn't even manage any business!"
good,This particular Starbucks  was in a busy mall.We had consistent consumers including shoppers and mall employees. They were really good about giving 10 minute and 30 minute breaks. Time went by quickly due to all the multitasking. They typically had very polite customers.
good,"The benefits were awesome, considering the type of job it is. They made it well worth the downsides of the job.  The company really does take care of its employees on a corporate level. I did feel it was lacking on a personal level within the store. Also, Starbucks is a yes company, so the customer almost always got their way & are allowed to push the employees around far too easily. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is easily stressed or overwhelmed.I would have stayed if they had paid me a livable wage."
good,If you like creating things and learning about different kinds of coffee products this is a great job to look into for you. Fast paced and you will enjoy meeting new people and creating work relationships.
good,"Very fast pace"
good,"Difficult to have a work life balance. My goal was to work torwards promoting into HR. However, my District manager said I could go on special assignments in HR once my store was sustainable without me. I knew with the turnover I had and the unskilled Supervisors I had, I wouldn't be able to get my store to be sustainable without me for years. So I chose to leave to another employer where I could promtote into HR quicker."
good,I liked this job because it always worked with my college schedule and I felt supported the entire time I was in school. I liked working fast-paced morning shifts but do understand that Starbucks takes their standards very seriously. I didn't make very much money though.
good,"I found this job to be incredibly satisfying with my coworkers and I felt trained sufficiently. However, with certain coworkers there was much to pick up after and closing assistance with them was difficult."
good,"It can be stressful and face-paced and gets very busy. It takes a good 3+ months of working here before you start to feel like you really know what you're doing. It's a lot to learn. Overall management is terrible. I've worked at several different stores and have only had one good store manager. The hardest part is how busy it gets and how often long term employees get overlooked for promotions. The most enjoyable part is my coworkers. We pretty much all get along very well and are friends outside of work. On top of which you can't beat the benefits. Health/dental/vision insurance, tuition reimbursement, stock options...they offer a lot."
good,"It was physically exhausting work. It a very small space to work in. At the beginning it was very overwhelming behind the counter. It is easy to make new friends, meet new people, and connect with customers."
good,Upon first starting the position you may feel a bit overwhelmed in the incredibly fast paced morning rush but its ok it may get easier with a little practice.
good,i worked at the drive thru starbucks on the 4 am shift. immidieatly we were on our feet all day. we were timed from taking the order to giving the drinks.
good,Falta de sensibilidad y preocupación hacia los empleados
good,"This job is completely dependent on managers. I had the pleasure of working under a manager that was amazing, team player, cleaned with the rest of us, complimented great work and made the job enjoyable. I also served under a manager that hardly ever showed up, never worked on the floor and didn't plan ahead for large events. The expectation & stress of the staff picking up slack that they were paid to handle eventually lead to me to finding other work,."
good,Starbucks is a god company to work for the company is great for college students and retirees.  I would work for Starbucks again under different direct leadership
good,"Stable, fun. i get to meet, greet and work with people from all walks. The constant change in promotions get tiring but it keeps things challenging. A job that feels almost like family."
good,"As an employee of Statbucks, I never felt the company truly cared about me as an employee, i did think that the employees of the store were like family. I have bonds with my former coworkers to this day.  Advancement requires complete devotion to the Starbucks machine, and none of the good benefits were given to anyone who wasn’t willing to donate their life to the bucks."
good,Company full of culture where you enjoy the best coffee there is and appreciate all the perks provided while you deliver great work. Great work space.
good,"A good place to work temporarily, depends on the manager you have. The work is a lot and can get very stressful , It’s Not a good job if you are not able to multitask."
good,Other than management issues Starbucks is a great place to work. It’s a Lil fast paced at times but the pay is good and the benefits are great and the staff is wonderful as well
good,"Good work place overall, fast paced enviorment, you're main way of learning how to make drinks is self taught. They'll train you for one day and throw you on the floor."
good,Overall Starbucks is a good company to work for. Cooperate does take care of employees through healthcare and other benefits that most companies do not provide like tuition assistance and extended family care benefits. It can at time be high stress in the retail environment.  With recent changes to sick policy it makes it more difficult for supervisors to hold baristas accountable for finding coverage for shifts. Which at time can cause high stress due to numerous routine callouts.
good,"Its very stressfull  to work as a daily basis, have to deal with some difficult customers but at the end is all learning on know how to deal with different problems along your shift. Management sometimes can be very disorganized and you have to learn lots of stuff on your shifts."
good,"You go in a make each customers experience unique, make drinks to standard, make sure you're in dress code but no specific uniform is required. The hardest part is dealing with unhappy customers, the best part is the people you work with"
good,"A typical day involves working with customers, store managers and closing cases assigned to me. I call and email customers and stores management teams to identify and resolve complicated customer issues.  I have learned how to write emails that project empathy and have been described as ""eloquent"" and ""high quality"".  I have learned how to de-escalate customers and resolve issues effectively and efficiently,  The management team is phenomenal and being in a management role I am able to aid in creating a fun and successful work environment.  The workplace culture is dynamic and encourages everyone to work as a team.  The hardest part of the job involves technical issues with the systems needed to work efficiently and effectively.  Having technical issues can delay my ability to resolve issues in a timely fashion.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with escalated customers and resolve their issues making them whole again,  I enjoy being responsible for delicate issues and having the authority to make it right."
good,This job is fun and welcoming to everyone involved. Training is thorough. Forces employers to come out of their shells and interact with people all day during work. Not a good job for moving up in the company or acquiring the pay necessary for the cost of living. Hours per week are difficult to maintain.
good,"Starbucks is amazing; as long as your working for a good manager and team. If not it can be no fun."
good,"Good job to have as a student before beginning your career in your chosen field. Very well organized. People that I worked with were lovely and we had great customers too!"
good,"Good job, pays well. However, there are a lot of demands but the perks do help. They do know always schedule according to availability which can cause conflict."
good,I worked at Starbucks off and on for over 14 years. Its a great environment with great people. I went to school and work with flexible hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with customers making it a great experience.
good,"While I have thoroughly enjoyed working for Starbucks as a company, I have been less than thrilled with my current location. I love getting to know my fellow partners and explore the world of coffee. I also have loved working with customers daily and getting to know our regulars. However, the location of this Starbucks has been under-preforming for years and that has been the case since before I began my journey here. I believe there is plenty of room for potential, but until that is met, it is not somewhere I would recommend to work."
good,"Nice place to work, easy commute"
good,"I learned a lot about customer service working at Starbucks, however felt the company was more interested in making money than supporting it's employees no matter how well they portray themselves in the media."
good,"A great job to connect with many different people. This job can be very difficult with school, unless you have an understanding boss. It can be very stressful, but very fun at the same time."
good,I loved working with starbucks. Great company. Met so many great longtime friends and good memories. I learned a lot and was able to advance once i proved my work ethic was there and that I cared for my job and guests. Horrible if you can't work fast paced and keep a smile regardless how you feel on the inside.
good,"For a minimum wage job, starbucks treats it's employees extremely well. They provide many benefits. I was proud to have worked there. Although I never saw it as a career, I felt that it served well for a transition period."
good,Starbucks was a busy depending on what part of the store you are working at. I learned that you may not know who you are talking to so show respect to everyone you come in contact with. That’s one of the only jobs I ever had that I would recommend to someone .
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. mornings are the busiest especially Mondays and Wednesdays, the rush would go for hours. Starbucks has taught me a lot, the best thing I learned is no matter what the case may be always be nice to the customer and make sure you cater to their needs. my manager does the best she can, but Starbucks is a very difficult store to manager and there can be errors sometimes. the working environment is very fun and interactive, everyone gets along and does there job. there have been plenty of times I've had to deal with rude customers, I think the hardest part is keeping your composure and keeping the situation as calm as possible, its a skill I learned the past year working for Starbucks. the most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is connecting with the customers and you and your team members working together to keep the customer satisfied."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Starbucks as a company other than the underlying job of a store manager with never change... Sell more coffee, work harder than yesterday to meet more demanding customer & corporate expectations, faster than you were previously doing it, and with a bigger smile on your face.  Once you have done that, do it better... The benefits are amazing, the culture is great, the growth can be stagnant, and the day is as good as your attitude makes it."
good,"Overall I enjoy this job. "
good,Working at Starbucks full time is a great way to provide  steady income for someone in their 20s and in college. Depending on management however a persons experience can range from horrible to one of the best jobs they will ever have. Look to see who is already working at a store you wish to work at and try to decide if they are the kind of ppl you could be friends with. If they are not you may want to find a different store  because teamwork is key in any position you will have here. If you can not get along and have fun with those you are working with you will not enjoy working here.
good,"I learned at Starbucks that there can be tension between loving the job that you have and the expectations that overheads put towards those employed at that job. I have never encountered a bigger failure to communicate between levels as I have at Starbucks. There is no interaction between the various levels of jobs, and this shows during their rushes. At stores where the entire hierarchy communicates they thrive, but when they fail to do so, they can't maintain the demands of the customers."
good,"I worked around people who were the same as me, mostly students so we would understand each other's struggles.  Having to cover shifts were easy to do because I worked with people around my age and they would understand what I was going through, that was the most enjoyable part it was easy to find a cover. The hardest part was not being able to do your nails."
good,"It was very fast paced but adaptable. It was a very good experience for taking on multiple responsibilities at once so things didn't fall apart. The customers were great for the most part, making drinks was a very relaxing thing for some reason. It's a good job for anyone that can multitask"
good,Very rarely a slow day. Drive thru lines around the building and frustrated costumers and staff. I learned to happily serve a higher-class clientele than i have served in the past. Management seemed to always have meetings or had to be scheduled off the floor. The hardest part of the day was unhappy costumers. My cowers were amazing.
good,"Greets all customers with fast, friendly, personalized service and develops a rapport with customers by learning their names, favourite drinks and food items."
good,"Good work place for learning and consolidating your language, a lot of duties, opportunities to grew in the company. Friendly work environment and average salary"
good,"Enjoyed the work, making drinks was quite fun. Worked under three managers, ranging from capable to poor.  Worked at a Safeway Starbucks, so was actually under Safeway management. Poor benefits there and poor managers and lack of up to date equipment."
good,Hard work but the benefits and coworkers make it worth it. You'll gain great customer service and multitasking skills as well as a do it yourself mentality. I recommend it for part time because full time has a lot of requirements.
good,"It is a good job while you are in post-secondary school. You work-fast, clean a lot. You learn leadership and be able to stay calm in stressful situations."
good,I think it was just the Starbucks I decided to work at that was terrible I do not believe they all are the same. I just happened to get a bad Apple. Overall I would try Starbucks again but a new location.
good,"This is my favorite job I have held, as it could be fast paced and stressful at times, but coworkers and a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day made it worthwhile. Only left the job due to poor compensation ($8.11 an hour after two years employment)"
good,"Being a barista revolves around your team, if you love your team- you will love being a barista. You rely on each-other and become family- it can be extremely rushed and stressful at times and that is when your team shines. You don/t realize how important that is until you have a line around the corner with no end in sight. Love your team, and you will do amazing. Hate them, and you'll be gone before you even learn to pour a cup of coffee."
good,"Great company to work for including numerous benefits, insurance coverages, and uplifting atmosphere. No gaurenteed set hours, and no set schedule each week."
good,"Fast paced and you'll learn a lot. Management could have been better. The pay is minimum which for a living wage in Bay Area, California is nothing. The benefits though are good."
good,"The hardest part of the job is that most of the time we are short staffed and as a drive thru store we are expected to have a great window time. The current shift managers are not so good doing their job, they dont take the job seriously and it affects us as baristas, it affects the store and also the costumers due to our poor costumer service, and the lack of organization."
good,"Working at Starbucks is great for a lot of reasons, but gets less appealing as you move up in the company. From what I experienced, the people I worked with were like a second family but we were asked to do a lot of things that felt out of our job description."
good,"When I first started at Starbucks it was very much a laid back environment (as long as you got your work done) but now it has become more of a strict work environment, stressful-- overworked and underpaid are the right words. At some point I think the shift went from the employees to only trying to satisfy the customers."
good,Buen clima laboral. Es un buen lugar de trabajo.Los partners son buenos.
good,"Making drinks is rewarding, connecting with customers is rewarding."
good,"This was a superb work environment during my time there. I would definitely work for this company again. Though the typical work days are hectic the community that you build with your ""Partners"" is beyond compare. Management varies from person to person but for the most part, it is a great experience. the most challenging part of the job is the speed at which you are required to work to be successful multitasking is a necessity. The most enjoyable part of my experience here with this company was the people I met and watched develop. benefits"
good,"work life balance was difficult. The communication was difficult. I enjoyed spending time with the partners, they made coming to work everyday worth it."
good,"Great place to work, "
good,good job for a student who is finishing up their degree. i worked at a starbucks that was owned for the university and was not a corporate location so many rules were different.
good,"Management is decent, but depends on your exactly store and location. Working environment is small, so must be okay with working closely with others at all times."
good,I worked at the Starbucks inside of Target (which is run by Target Corp. not Starbucks). I was able to meet with the GM for Starbucks a few times and she was very nice and listened to suggestions and concerns and moved quickly to fix or change them.
good,"Starbucks is an amazing job if you are looking to grow over a long amount of time and have wonderful benefits.  People are kind and the corporation is always looking to improve itself. Some days are really hard and it is a lot of standing on your feet, but everyone does their best and tries to keep a good attitude."
good,"Company is too big to pay detail attention to small problems. although work environment was fun and active, it was also very hectic. Stress level can be very high because of the value every customer holds versus employees"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to socialise and enjoy many nice beverages. However they need to stick to the rules the put forth as a company and not  waiver and their commitment to customers, community and  employee"
good,"Overall, this company is fantastic to work for. They offer many benefits and have a lot of flexibility when it comes to scheduling. However, they don't typically offer a set schedule. It's hard to get rid of bad employees because of Starbucks' policies on always giving them the benefit of the doubt."
good,"Were it not for the social climate of my appointed Starbucks location, I doubt I would have enjoyed my time there as much as I did. It's typical wage work, but it helps a great deal to work in the company of people whose company you enjoy."
good,"Not bad company overall, for me however, the management was the deal breaker. I also did not feel like i was getting paid enough for the amount of work done, only because i have compared it to other places."
good,I enjoyed the time that I had the chance to work at Starbucks. I met many people and was able to hone my customer service skills. I think Starbucks is a great place to work.
good,"I loved making frappes and beaing able to mark off food. My coworkers at the time were great, from shift supervisors to fellow baristas. I wouldn't mind working at a Starbucks again, sometimes inwish innever left."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the connections I have made with people, I enjoy conversation and meeting new people. I learned how to manage my time effectively, and I now have great organizational skills! I can deal with individuals in a fast-paced work environment."
good,"District managers are told to be for the partners but are only aout the company. I lived working there.  Environment was wonderful. Learned a lot about coffee, Made different types of drinks. Met different types of people."
good,Starbucks was a good place to work at. Over all i had fun and i enjoyed the customers and the experience of making new drinks and food. How ever i did work at a very busy Starbucks location and it made the day go by very quick but it was also stressing. Another thing we where always understaffed and most workers there where really lazy and it was hard to be productive with out a team. It is a-lot of work and very underpaid but id does offer some great benefits . Over all it was a fun experience knowing that every day it was a different adventure.
good,"Love the environment, the coworkers etc Schedule sucks, like all min wage jobs but what can you really do about that? I find it hard to believe they can't just have a fixed schedule for everyone (copy paste should be easy)"
good,"nice job to have as a teen, fun people, always busy. It gets crazy most of the time, but it can be very upbeat and theres always something new to do and learn, plus they pay for college!!"
good,"Very stressful job when managing the bar area; some of the busier shifts have a bar and barback on two machines+frozen.  Management is very hit or miss depending on where you work - I've had good, great, and horrendous managers.  Work is very rewarding when you get in the groove of it, which is nice.  Besides managerial issues, the only other con is customers (duh..), and hourly employee ""busy-work"" such as: wipe down things that are 100% clean, 30min dishes that should take 5min to burn time, stocking things that are full, etc.  Otherwise, great job!"
good,Its an easy job just a lot to learn and clean. Starbucks offers great benefits. Salary plus tips is ok for part timers and they give you advancement opportunities.
good,"Interacting with customers was great.  If you had to call in because you couldn't work a certain shift, you personally had to call other employees to cover your shift.  If your replacement didn't show up, it would go against YOU.  Plus, if you covered for other employees, especially at last minute, assistant managers were appreciative, but Store Manager didn't really care."
good,Super face paced but everyone is very helpful. They train you well so you know what to expect and work with your strengths. Your are on your feet for a long time
good,"It was fun but when I moved to a new city I had no help with transferring and never found a store so I ended up leaving. However, the co workers made the job fun. It was nice getting 3 free drinks per shift and a free food item."
good,"Focusing on customer interactions, employees will do well if you are altruistic, optimistic, and resilient! I think everyone should work in customer service at the beginning of their career to learn how people should be treated."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for if you want better culture and good benefits. The organization does put an emphasis on training and development which is very important. I'll miss it when I move on. However it can be very political - more than someone with a background in politics enjoys. You wouldn't think so but it's pretty sad.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for a year and a half. I trained a lot of new associates. They were frequently put on more importants gigs than I was -- making the drinks, talking in the drive-thru, etc. After a year and a half, I was still relegated to basic cashier work while all the people I had trained, got more hours. If I tried to join in conversations, they ignored me or pushed me back out of the conversation. Good work, I learned a lot, general managers knew what they were doing, but the coworkers were no fun."
good,"I took this job as a part-time job, while I completed my 4-year degree. I initially thought I knew what I was signing myself up for. The training to become a barista was interesting, rewarding, and sometimes challenging. The management varies depending on the store location. The entire atmosphere of the store is dependent on the store manager."
good,"Overall my experience with Starbucks was really good, I loved working there. Unfortunately when we got a new store manager he was rude and didn't give me the hours I needed so I had to leave the company."
good,"Typically working at Starbucks you're always on the move and always finding some way to keep busy or be productive.  You're constantly on you're feet and talking to people whether it be the customers to take their order, or your coworkers when you ask questions or need help understanding something.  This job really challenges you and there's a lot to learn if you're willing to put in the work."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks through college, but I’ve been there for 4 years and currently make $0.10 more than a starting barista, which I think is unfair due to the fact that I have been told repeatedly that I am a good worker. Otherwise, it’s a really great place to work! I’ve really enjoyed my experience there!"
good,"But it didn't love me back. You could pour your heart and soul into everything you do, but if you don't bend over backwards for the customer, you'll never move forward"
good,"unstable type work to busy schedule with not stability, i dont have nothing else to say , the company was good when I was 18 with not really good projects in life"
good,"The customers can be unreasonable but the environment is fun, working with my coworkers made the job that much more. Management was also reasonable and fair."
good,"A typical day at the store I worked at consisted off closing. It wasn't busy because we had a drive-thru. The management was good. There were a few shift managers that did not belong in that position, ever. The hardest part of the job was working with slow employees who held themselves to any standards. As new employees were hire, I was slowly moving out. This job requires speed all while keeping the quality of the drinks above par. The most enjoyable part was working with a lot a great people I met throughout my time there. They can really make a stressful situation into a good one."
good,It's okay not worth much money in your bank for what you are doing. Not very efficient sometimes so you're just there. Scheduling I've asked my manger all the time for more hours but never does.
good,"I started working here my senior year of high school and didn't stop until I graduated college eight years later. The health insurance is for anyone who works 20 hours a week or more, and it is really good insurance. It can be a lot of fun, if you have a good team and a manager who cares. It is fast passed, and can often be really stressful. Team work is 100% necessary to make the work go smoothly."
good,"I loved working there while I was in school. Super flexible, fun fast paced. The connections you make with your coworkers and customers is awesome. They offer good benefits too. Hardest part was a non-understanding manager or rude customers. Most enjoyable was the connections and development of coffee knowledge."
good,Very fast paced especially if you're working morning and very exhausting with the constant regulations such as QASA. It could be better if management were trained to understand the difficulties of fitting QASA standards within 1 hr of closing.
good,"Great benefits and really fun, creative people to work with."
good,"Starbucks has one of the best company cultures I have ever experienced and truly makes people feel like partners. Training with Starbucks may seem rushed, but it is thorough and if you want to learn, then you have the opportunity to really be a great, informed partner. Due to brand popularity and typically large volume of business at most stores, the work/life balance of managers can be a mixed bag. Many established managers have found a nice balance and can adjust adequately to local and national changes. However, new managers should expect to work overtime and diligently their first couple years to build their team, schedule, and work/life balance. Overall, I had a wonderful experience managing at Starbucks and would highly recommend."
good,learned a lot thanks to my store manager. good guy and taught me a lot about the culture and skills needed to run a store. made good friends and everyone understands the struggles of being under-stafffe.
good,"Working for Starbucks can be very rewarding, but a lot of the company standards are not met by a lot of the stores. Don’t expect them to always listen to your scheduling needs, or to be too sympathetic if you get sick often. The job is extremely high paced depending the store you work at, and things are constantly changing and new things are constantly added. You have to be able to really be flexible and able to learn quickly and work efficiently, beyond even what you think. But my best advice is to just stay calm and do the best you can, because doing your best gets you far here. There are plenty of opportunities to climb the latter if you have a good manager."
good,My time at starbucks was amazing for the most part. All though my manager was not the best everyone I worked with was amazing. I spent so much of my time there even off the clock. Such a good environment.  My co workers and I all got along so well and we still keep in contact!
good,"Starbucks overalls standards and enforcements alone call for a great company it all really depends on the management team to adhere by the mission statement, one neighborhood one person one cup at a time."
good,"It's not a bad first job. I enjoy it and love the people i work with, but it doesn't pay enough. It can also be very stressful on occasions especially during the holidays."
good,When I first started working here it was very organized and a clean environment but when management changed a lot of things were very out of order. it wasn't a hard job but things were very unorganized.
good,"Decent place to work for extra money........ fast paced.... lots of ingredients and combos but once you get it down, it's incredibly autopilot........"
good,The typical day was fast-paced and detail oriented. I learned a lot. Management wasn't all that great. I loved getting to know all the customers and being able to make their day.
good,If u have better knowledge management then Starbucks is potentially a great career job. I loved making drinks and connecting with customers and the store it’s self was a great atmosphere but my manager was arrogant had no knowledge of how to run a store or coworkers
good,"Working at Starbucks defintely has its benefits. However due to my particular location and district, it is a very stressful job both emotionally and physically. My store always seems to be short staffed, which makes calling out sick VERY difficult. We are a high volume store and therefore have high pace morning peaks."
good,The Starbucks I work at is a licensed store. We have a great staff as well as management. Everyone gets along very well and the customers always enjoy chatting with us! I love working there!
good,It is a good place to work. Friendly people. Sometimes it gets boring to do the same everyday. Shifts can get a bit tedious is you have to close one day and open the store the next one.
good,Really fun meeting new people and getting to know customers sadly it i minimum wage however a lot of chances to try new things and learn to love coffee
good,"Very fast past"
good,"The benefits were top notch but my manager was brand new to managing and his stress level showed. The business itself was amazing, free coffee/drinks during shift, health care plans, maternity leave, college assistance, etc. Very good place to work if young and or broke, closing shift typically got dibs over leftover food and pastries!"
good,Provides flexibility and allows people to manage school and other jobs on the side. It is strenuous at certain points of the day but overall it is an enjoyable experience.
good,I left Starbucks after years of working there due to my manager in Alabama trying to make us sell expired food. I reported her but was told to keep quiet by the District Manager.
good,This job was a lot of fun and especially for college kids but it is a lot of hard work and you don't get paid enough to support every bill if you are supporting yourself. A typical day will depend on the shift because if can be really slow but also very overwhelming. I have always like the staff I had worked with though and the dynamic is definitely fun. They teach you a lot.
good,It's a fast paced work environment but you always get help form others when you feel a bit overwhelmed. Everyone is willing to help out if you don't know something. Management and Co-workers are great it like having a extended family. Hardest part of this job is remembering all the drinks but getting the drinks just right and making someones day better is worth it.
good,Best place to be equipped by barista skills and knowledgse about the coffee industry. Trainings were enjoyable and productive. Employees were amazing.
good,Long working days but very collaborative atmosphere with cutting edge benefits for their associates.  Friendly atmosphere where the company is very focused on retaining and keeping their associates happy and feeling fulfilled.
good,"Expect early morning hours, even if you tell them them you can't open. Morning Rushes were tolerable with 3 or more baristas and 1 cashier. Management was great, she always tried to work the schedule for what best worked for the staff, while taking into consideration days asked off. Hardest part of the job is dealing with picky customers, which means attention to detail is a must for this job. Best part of the job is trying new drinks and having Awesome regulars."
good,"Great experience in customer service, a good time to work on people skills and time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my coworkers and the regular customers, they become like family and make the job easy and fun."
good,Starbucks is a great environment to work at. Not that easy handling customers at the airport as some of them may be in a rush etc. My workmates are really friendly and i still can come down by starbucks and have a drink!
good,"management was lack luster and inconsistent with hours but the benefits are well worth the short comings. Overall decent job, ideal college students or retirees."
good,fast paced a lot of factors much different that a regualar retail location. I advanced fast in the company and they had fun activities for the managers to keep you energized
good,A good place to work fast paced meet cool people and fun work environment. Schedules are very flexible and have many people that can teach you the right steps to becoming a better barista
good,Was an amazing place to work with lots of different opportunities. Was good salary pay and everyone was really friendly. The customers were really nice. Rarely had many complaints by customers
good,a good company to work for and if available room for growth. the learning of crafting a personal drink is interesting. the hardest part of the job is getting used to all the drinks an the fast pace of morning shift.
good,"Can be a fun and supportive place to work, depending on the specific store. Turnover rate is really high (You'll see almost an entirely new team at a given store every 6-9 months). It's a good place to develop cashiering, barista, and customer service experience. If you're committed, the supervisor position is not hard to earn. However, you won't grow much past that. I'd honestly say the store manager doesn't do that much more than what the supervisors can. You essentially only have 1 path of promotion: Barista --> Shift Supervisor --> Assistant Store Manager --> Store Manager --> District Manager, etc. So if that's not the thing for you, most people will quit after being promoted to shift supervisor."
good,"Lots of experience service customers, learning names and orders for regulars, and managing store stock and facilities. Changing hours is rough depending on management; if you can get a steady work schedule then it's a great job for someone starting out."
good,"Everyone I   have worked with has been like family to me. I   love the customers and most days loved going to work. After 10 years, its just time for a change."
good,"Really enjoy this job."
good,"My typical day at work was fun, usually. I enjoyed the people I worked with and always looked forward to going into work. I love coffee so that's why I wanted to work there. There were good days and there were bad days. Either it was with management or another co-worker. I didn't typically have any issues with customers from my time being there. I wish I didn't quit because I was making good money but management was poor and rude, and I couldn't work around that everyday."
good,"My time at Starbucks, though it was short, was very fun. They give full, in-depth training about how to become a barista, different types of coffee, and their corporate culture. The corporate culture in the workplace is that the customer is always right (even if they're not though). On the downside, I was not informed during my hiring process that availability cannot be changed within the first 6 months of employment. I did enjoy working there though, just not the 3:45 a.m. shifts."
good,"It is a good place to temporarly work at and helped me grow and get along with people and work on my customer service skills, so overall I will say that I was able to learn things that can benefit me in life"
good,"Starbucks is a company that claims to be very inclusive and caring for their partners. While this is true most of the time there have been moments where I have felt uncomfortable expressing my honest thoughts. There is also , usually, very blatant favouritism which i am not terribly fond of. Outside of management though the job is lovely. It is nice to be able to invest in the customers and have them invest in you."
good,Very fast and busy environment but fun and you learn a lot. The managers were great and very helpful and always willing to work with you. Lots of multitasking and being fast in your feet.
good,"Learned how to manage stress and maintain a work/life balance. Need to work well under pressure. Had a great team, but sometimes was cut throat and catty.  Great health insurance."
good,"Great company to work for, employees are treated fairly and given good pay. Work is fast paced and difficult at times but manageable. There is always work to be done, if there are no customers currently waiting on drinks or food you are cleaning, stocking, organizing and ensuring a clean and welcoming environment for customers."
good,Coworkers don't show up to work a lot and their are just negative vibes around the work place. I just don't feel accepted in the work place. There also needs to be more communication.
good,"For what you are required to do as a lower level barista, the pay is ridiculously low. I was up from 2:30 AM to 12 PM and was being paid minimum wage. In my experience, if you are working ANY sort of graveyard shift, you need to be paid AT LEAST time and a half. Requiring anyone to change their sleep/life pattern to be awake enough to work that early in the morning...pay them more!!!!"
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for if you are willing to put in a lot of years in order to move up. Great benefits and the free food/drinks are a plus.
good,"Definitely a fast-paced environment. I recommend it to anyone who needs just a basic job. It will keep you busy, and you will learn quite a bit about running a coffee shop. Often fun, but often stressful. Good work."
good,"Although the beginning of working at Starbucks is fun, after a while the it started to become stressful and tedious. I worked at a time when there was no manager and only shift supervisors. All the shift supervisors were competing to become the lead manager and were not acting the same."
good,"All in all it was a great place to work. Hours varied. Liked being able to build relationships with customers. Management was iffy, disappeared for a great majority of shift."
good,"if you're looking to make small cash it is okay. You do a lot more then that you're being paid for and if you're unlucky like me, you'll have a manager who barley gives you hours sadly."
good,"Working this corporate store , you cal learn a lot about where, how, who and when it happens about coffees. Is very interesting working Starbucks experience and acknowledges be a coffee masters."
good,wasn't too hard to work or get things done when the management wasn't there. Great client base amazing coworkers who don't mind having to do the hard work when it counts.
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work and you get to know all of your customers. The only bad thing was the management. We were always understaffed and had broken equipment.
good,I was in charge of many things when working at starbucks. It was fun jumping around from different tasks and the up beat atmosphere. Everyone helped eachother and it really felt like a team. I also loved the customers and the products. I took my coffee very seriously and wanted to ensure each guest left happy.
good,"Starbucks on the whole is wonderful, offers much in the way of benefits and opportunities for advancement, but the location I was hired at was a mess."
good,I loved working at Starbucks in California but when I transferred to Colorado I quickly realized that store management is key. It makes yourl love going to work or hate it.
good,"I enjoy starbucks. Great co workers and have learned a TON! Look forward to working there for a long time!!! I 've learning so much stuff working there. Being a Barista takes a lot of skill and i enjoy talking with customers daily, helping them to start their day out."
good,I loved my job and my team but I had a manger not very active in the store which made my job as the assistant very difficult. overall i loved the work but i think in my case i just had a bad experience
good,"An awesome place to work for not just coffee lovers, but for anyone. Being a barista, you will learn a lot of great things. Such as from having great customer service to learning how to make the best drinks."
good,"I loved the job all up until my last few weeks. I had a horrible manager who was a brand new partner at least 8 months in and I had 1 yr and a half on her. She sucked, if I could go back to the job I would. Lasted until my last semester of college."
good,"Typical day: Fast paced work environment. Meeting on average 200+ people throughout the shift. Multi-tasking is a must."
good,"Work days are sometimes overwhelming because staffing is always an issue. I learned a lot about being a barista and making drinks, however management wasn't always around when needed."
good,was a long time ago and don't really recall my time there i was fresh out of high school and just wanted to work and them hiring me worked for me at the time
good,"the company is not a bad company, it was just my personal experience with them. i was promoted but then demoted for a lack of training and then passed up for promotion time in and time out. the pay is garbage for the amount of stress you put up with, and they argue the lack of pay with how awesome your benefits are. i am sorry, but benefits don't put food on my table when i am paying almost 120 dollars a month for my benefits."
good,Empresa boa para jovens iniciarem no mercado de trabalho.
good,Starbucks is a fun entry level job. I enjoyed working directly with people and learning how to multi-task efficiently.  There isn't much room for advancement.
good,"Fun place to work, can get very hectic during busy times, have to be able to adapt at a moment's notice, and be very  good at dealing with diverse customers"
good,"Currently, the role of store manager and your success with it has everything to do with your experience and your training. You're constantly putting out metaphorical fires, and your work/life balance entirely depends on your crew of partners."
good,"Once you are in a supervisor position things get less hectic unless you move to a failing store with a brand new manager.  I think Starbucks in general is a good place to work because through benefits and perks they really try to accommodate to everyone but the job itself is really tough.  Be prepared to move through the chain quickly on your way up or get out, it's too stressful and will eat you up."
good,I loved working there ! I met some awesome people that worked there . We turned into roommates and have loved the company i wouldn't change my experience for anything . It was a great place to learn and grow .
good,"Starbucks Corporation gives you a well rounded experience in customer service. A barista has many jobs and you must learn balance, speed, teamwork but overall you must learn to put customer satisfaction first using the tools at hand ( that includes your following employees). Good Luck"
good,This job would be better if the baristas were paid more. They under go too much stress for the pay they receive. However it is a very fun job if you can look past the pay and there are ways to eventually increase your salary if you intend to stay there for a very long time. I enjoy the atmosphere the most and the ability to make someone smile every time I work.
good,The only reason why I would recommend a job at Starbucks is because they all higher and it's an easy job to acquire. Unfortunately Starbucks doesn't have very much over their managers because it's the manager that run people off well that and people that get angry about coffee
good,"fast pace but not good pay. typical work day was long, stressful but could be fun. I learned how to make drinks in a fast pace, how to interact with all different types of people"
good,"This is a very fast paced environment 95% on the time. If its ever slow its never for long. Learning the drink menu is very hands on and more then likely they have directions close at hand for when you become confused as to what goes with what and how much to put in what. Or there is someone that you can mentor with as well. "
good,"Fantastic company, however there is management that will look to get rid of you if you do not value their rules. However, there is policy for a reason and stay honest and true to starbucks values and you will be fine."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. I enjoyed the fast paced environment. Once I got to the supervisor level things became quite stressful, my manager was falling apart and that came down on the supervisors. I didn't feel like I had the support I needed."
good,"For the most part the Starbucks culture is pleasant, company has great benefits, I just simply didn't need the benefits, I needed better pay. It is hard to be promoted from within despite opposing arguments."
good,"At first I was working closing shift and it was laid back and satisfying.  But due to family issues I had to switch shifts and the morning shift sucked.  The customers were rude and clearly addicted to coffee and the co-workers were high strung and over calloused.   Management was awesome - caring, understanding and represented the company well."
good,"This Can Be A Great First Job With A Good Store And Management, Without One Of Those It Goes South Very Fast, Not For Anxious People. Very Stressful Especially At High Volume Stores"
good,"Fun coworkers. The job gets boring after awhile. Not much room for advancement, given that there are only 4 positions. If you don't want to be a store manager then there isnt anything else for you to do."
good,"Was a great experience to learn and improve on ppl skills and teamwork skills, was a fast pace job especially comause if it’s location which is 34 st New York City"
good,although i wouldn't consider starbucks a career it was a great learning experience. Taught me so much that i can then use in my life down the road. Most enjoyable thing about starbucks is the regular customers you get who remember you and makes you happy every time they come in.
good,As a student this job was a great way to get some extra money and work with the public. The management always worked well with my studying hours and gave me a good balance between working life and university life.
good,"I have never been a big fan of coffee, however I enjoyed working for Starbucks and the staff at my coffee shop I worked at. The management was good until a temporary manager took over.. Starbucks as a company, give you great training on making the drinks and inform you very well about the different coffee and products they sell."
good,Good job to learn from. Teaches you how to work with others and to work in a fast pace kind of environment. Can get stressful the more hours you take on or the higher you move up.
good,this place was fun to work when certain managers were not there. when such people were around everyone was tense and very little went on that was fun.
good,I believe Starbucks shaped a lot of the customer service basics I have today. It taught me a lot about myself and my high work ethic and how hard I work for the guest and consumer. It also taught me a lot about managing in a fast paced environment and the importance of team work and striving for goals.
good,"A typical day was busy, but the people behind the counter usually made it a fun environment.  If you have a good boss, you will love working here!!  I learned a lot about teamwork and time management.  The hardest part about the job was learning to work under pressurized situations while still giving great customer service.  It can be difficult to deal with rude customers, but you have to learn to push through it and not let it ruin your entire day."
good,"I am a people person and from Seattle...so overall, I loved my job as a Starbucks barista!  The actual job of creating handcrafted beverages and being a bright spot in people's day, making genuine connections...was great!! I found out that I thrived on a busy day in the drivethrough window! "
good,"Don't get me wrong, overall starbucks is a great company to work for - great benefits, great perks, and a usually welcoming environment. HOWEVER, management seems to be somewhat of a revolving door, leading to unnecessary increased stress levels and power struggles. There does not seem to be any well-followed standard for management from store to store, which makes working at other stores permanently or even part time more difficult than it needs to be."
good,"Being a Barista is a great 1st job allowing you to make genuine connections with customers and the ability to hone cusomter service skills. While there are set guidelines for management and baristas alike, how strict the standards are maintained vary from store to store. For example, I have worked at many stores, most were great experiences, however there are a few where I felt undervalued and overworked; this boils down to management. While the benefits are great as well as the discounts and free drinks. Unless you aspire to manage your own location one day or move up to a supervisory role  there are not a lot of opportunities to move up WITHIN the company. Tasks include operating the point of sale system, handling money, CLEANING (and lots of it), making drinks, brewing coffee/teas, and simply creating an inviting atmosphere for cusomters. This job is perfect for the average college student looking to make some money while gaining work experience. However, the hours can be odd, the work can be strenuous, and the cusomters can be difficult although you end up making a lot of great acqaintances with most of the regulars. All in all it's a good job that carries more weight than working at most any other service related position/company."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for the Starbucks I worked for was a franchise and run by the queensway group. Seem disorganize and people unsure of what they were doing. Would not work for them again.
good,"A typical day work consists of walking in and understanding that if you close you will have to multitask between cleaning the whole store throughout your shift, as well as managing customers and making drinks. I learned a lot about coffee in my time here as well as how to manage a busy floor while getting my other closing tasks done. Majority of the people who work for starbucks are very down to earth and a great group of people. The environment is very open and friendly and accepting no matter where you come from, what you believe in, or who you love."
good,"There is plenty of room for advancement and it can be a very fun environment to work in.  It depends on your management team, however, we did have a good one, but others moved on and the job became much more difficult and stressful."
good,"night shifts are the best shifts because you can be yourself and interact with costumers. Yet, morning shifts a ridiculous and care more about drive times then actually getting to know your costumers and your community. they expect you to get people out of the drive through in 30 seconds and ever resort to staring at people through the window until they feel uncomfortable if they are not moving at top speed."
good,"I honestly liked working here for the most part, but the hours were killer (wake up at 3:30am) and I hated working so hard, just to see my tiny paychecks."
good,Very fast paced environment that requires a lot of multi tasking ability. Managers are very good at teaching employees how to work as a team under pressure. The most difficult aspect of this job was the turnover rate. From the time I started to the time I finished I had worked at two locations and left working with an entirely different crew (management included) than when I had started. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and become friends with regulars.
good,"Working for Starbucks is great if you don't really have to pay your rent. Hours are constantly changing and there's no such thing as a consistent schedule, which makes it really hard to schedule events in the future. "
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work for a steady work with team work environment. The pace that one work really depends on location of the store. Drive-thru tend to busier than lobby stores. As long as you can learn quick and adapt to your team and environment, you should have a good time."
good,Good company to work for. competitive and life/work sometimes do not exist. Lots of changes and directions aren't always clear. Met great people and built long term relationships.
good,I learned a lot about growing a business having worked as a supervisor for 4 years at starbucks. I learned how to hold myself accountable and others accountable when necessary. The importance of always being open and willing to receive and give feedback so that we are always learning and growing from new experiences.
good,I be different I was very kind of guard when the intensity of training never ended and in the end I had to leave because I'm more relaxed person and calm personality which is not really something that goes well with a place where espresso is the number one seller.
good,"- Allway busy and a friendly, safe place to work"
good,"A very faced paced place to work. You have to have good communication skills, be able to maneuver through out the shift and be afraid to get dirty. Must be vocal."
good,I had the unfortunate pleasure of working here for 5 years. The pros did not outweigh the cons. Management did not stand by their workers for most issues. There is constant pressure coming from regional directors.
good,"a typical day was stressful but not too mentally draining, i spent alot of time getting told i would be able to advance and never fully got the opportunity."
good,"Starbucks used to put a lot of weight on getting to know your customers and making a connection with them. However, now they are understaffing their stores so you have no time to talk to your customers. All they care about now is fast window times so get the customers in the drive thru in and out. They also spends loads of money on unnecessary things like web cams for ordering in the drive thru, and a window that causes you to be unable to even hear your customer. They spend thousands on things that make your job more difficult while paying you a wage that is impossible to live on."
good,"I would recommend working for Starbucks Corporation. However, at this particular location, it is VERY busy most of the day, especially on the weekends, which could be all day. I have learned how to work in a more timely manner, and it has helped me progress and grow in future jobs. The part I enjoyed most about Starbucks is chatting with regulars every morning, as well as learning about new products the company had to offer. My previous manager did resign from my store, last moth (November) which may have been for the best. She was not the worst manager I've experienced, but not the best as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend Starbucks to any prospective applicants."
good,I love working for starbucks. the only issue I really have is that there isn't enough hours and the pay rate should be higher for the amount of work we have to do.
good,On your feet running back and forth between bars and warming . Loved the customers . fun place to work.  long hours somedays especially through Frappachino happy hour.  Lots of manual labor daily in keeping store clean and up to standards
good,"The job requires a lot, and can be stressful. You have to be able to work in a small enviornment with up to ten people at a time, and be ready to handle angry customers."
good,Starbucks is a decent company wit some alright benefits. The job really depends on your partners and your boss otherwise it can be hard to make it through the day especially during extremely busy times.
good,"fun place to work,very flexible if you're a parent or have another job.overall a great experience working for them.did i mention they are very flexible."
good,"Starbucks is a very great company to start with, they offer really great benefits to partners. I find it stops at that though, they do not offer performance based raises, it is such a huge company that it is easy to get lost in the politics of it. Forget what you can do and what you can bring, most of the times it's who you know and who knows who. And I'm talking about this at a retail level."
good,Starbucks was difficult job to acclimate to but once I got the hold of my position I found it easy to climb through the ranks at my store. I would recommend Starbucks for anyone who need a part time job.
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced environment. It can be fun to work there and meet new people, but also very stressful. Honestly I think what makes or breaks a Starbucks job is the team/manager! I had excellent ones."
good,Good company to work with to get some experience about customer service and improve and learn team-working. Had to deal with different type of customers
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks could go from cleaning draining at 4am to fast-paced rush hour with many different tasks at various hours of the day. The upkeep of the property could range from cleaning bathrooms, sweeping the trash in and outside the store and taking out trash with liquid inside the bags. You typically go home when hours are cut and apron really dirty. Great environment if you like quick-pace and customer facing experience."
good,"Its a great place to work if your going to college and can live with making $10 an hour, its very fast work, you gotta multitask well and dont work there if you have high anxiety"
good,"Starbucks has great benefits and great discounts but it really comes down to the stores location as well as the manager. After 6years of being dedicated to the company, my store brought in a new manager. He cut my hours and would not work with the hours that I had asked for, as a new mom at the time, I was really relying on the company to take care of me like I had done for them. Sadly I quit after 6 years, a shift supervisor and almost having a black apron. Very disappointed with that manager, not the company."
good,"The hardest part of the job was handling busy days with lots of rushed customers.The enjoyable part is when you serve happy customers to the best you can. Although there was a few management issues, it was a very fun place to work and I learnt so much from working there."
good,"It was a very fast-paced place to work at. Unfortunately, this meant that if it got very busy and you were on break or lunch, then you'd get called back. Sadly, they also lowered everybody's hours and gave most of them to new people."
good,"Starbuck's is very fast paced but overall enjoyable. One is able to interact with customers and form connections. As a supervisor I lead the shifts, handled money, and trained new baristas. "
good,"Early mornings, cadence cycles, recipe standards, and all the coffee you can drink. This company will give you anything you want from it, so long as you don't mind clocking in at 3:30 in the morning...something I love to do."
good,i used to love Starbucks and now people are stealing from their own store and blaming others and its not the place i want to be anymore. management needs more work
good,"Starbucks is a great temporary job. It is fun and quick paced, the people are wonderful. Most of the managers I've worked under while with the company have been great."
good,"It was a great place to work at as they worked very well with my schedule and the company as a whole has a great model they go by. Learning was fast paced and so was the work, but once you get the hang of it and remember the recipes its a great experience."
good,I'm glad I had the opportunity to get hired by the Starbucks company. Starbucks has showed me how to maximize my customer service skill and how to work in a fast-paced environment.
good,"Hay mucho compañerismo, se valora mucho el trabajo en equipo cosa que es facil porque hay buen ambiente de trabajo. Nos dejan tomar cafe gratis y ademas tenemos descuento por empleado. "
good,Good place to work.. started off as company driven on partner experience.. partner experience would drive positive customer engagement...so many initiatives disrupt the flow and brings down customer connections
good,"I started as a barista and quickly moved up to Shift Supervisor. As a barista, you are only responsible for taking orders, making drinks and cleaning. As a SS, you are responsible for all of that AND being responsible for each partner on the shift and any problems plus all the additional stuff like money, inventory, etc.. The added weight was not worth the money (barely any raise at all really) I loved the fast-paced environment and the whole idea of Starbucks and I learned a lot about coffee and made friendships with customers, but I was constantly stressed out about other partners or this or that. Fun and stressful, if you can handle both for little pay."
good,Starbucks is a fun company and I love it. the down fall you do not get paid enough for everything you deal with. Management says there is room to grow but you could be working hard for 2 years and still not get moved up.
good,"Most days are very fast-paced, you must produce product (drinks and food) every 30 seconds, with assembly-line accuracy for increasingly customized requests. The clientele range from very friendly to outright atrocious, especially when rush hour comes, and the system gets bogged down from orders per minute vs. employee count. "
good,I would recommend people to work here. The environment is fun fast paced and relaxed at time. Customer are awesome every now and then you get that one that test you but you must remain positive and ensure that they receive the best treatment.
good,"It is a nice job for people who have never worked before, they have simple tasks, and if you are simply a barista all you have to do is serve customers on the till and make coffee. If you are passionate about coffee then this is the right place for you. Also, this is a flexible job, you can easily ask for specific days off or holidays. The teams are normally composed by young people, most part-times are students, so this makes the work interesting and if you get along pretty well with everyone you can easily enjoy your time while you are working."
good,"Starbucks a une véritable culture d'entreprise qui est transmis aux employés. "
good,"Good company to work for. They have great compensation and benefits for their employees. They care about the customers and strive to be above expectations at most stores. "
good,"I had no issue working at starbucks, except the manager at my location. She created a culture at our store that was toxic and unprofessional. "
good,"My location required me to work too many hours, but the premise and work-requirements I learned sounded great. My manager didn't have the staff to fulfill them, so it wasn't perfect, though."
good,Job is very fun once you get the hang of it. Very fast paced and you get a very high sense of belonging. Everyone will go out of their way to make you feel welcome and supported.
good,"When I first began working for Starbucks, I absolutely loved it. I loved my co-workers and wanted to perfect my craft and learn more about the world of coffee. However, in the last year or so, I feel the company has more or less abandoned its core values. I am constantly understaffed and being pushed to cut labor while also increasing sales. It has become a constant stressor in my life and a change of pace is incredibly needed."
good,"Starbucks is an enjoyable barista job, with regular custemers that make the job way more better.  Drinks are pretty easy to prepare and staff was nice and informative."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for while you are going to school, but is not great for career advancement. It is a fun place to work if you have a great team to work with."
good,"The partners are really nice, we work together as a team  you'll definitely enjoy you're time at starbucks. The job is not  difficult the only thing is remembering every recipe takes time"
good,"Working at peak times(early morning and afternoons) could be very stressful at times. If you have a good manager they can be very helpful with working around your schedule and they are supposed to (but dont always) give you at least 2 weeks notice of schedules but that depends on the manager."
good,"Bonne expérience chez Starbucks, idéal pour un premier emploi ou un job étudiant."
good,Typical day at work consist of unloading trucks full of raw coffee beans and stacking them on a pallet for the fork lift I learned their are diffent types of coffee beans and the management is good at communicating with you about the job and is willing to answer all your questions the work place and cutler is very good the hardest part of the job is getting use to the burlap bags of the Columbia coffee beans and the most enjoyable part of the job its like your getting paid to work out
good,Loved Starbucks there just wasn't enough advancement. Once you hit a certain title that was pretty much it but still loved it. No real complaints. It was fun.
good,Good to have time with my partner and there all are friendly. all customer like our service. fast friendly and make connection with each other. give me experince about coffee.
good,Manques d'organisation ayant des impactes sur tout le service
good,"The staff is friendly and really prides themselves on excellent customer service. Incredibly fast paced, little room for promotion, minimum compensation."
good,Overall I really enjoyed working there. It was always busy and you met a lot of new people. The only negative was when the company changed managers. They promoted a person who should never have been in management simply because he had worked for the company for a number of years. Promotions should be based on performance and not simply longevity.
good,I enjoyed most of my time at Starbucks.  The fast pace made the days go by.  Advancement can be a bit challenging.  Most stores are not managed the same from location to location.  I left because I was not welcomed at the new location.  But I would go back to Starbucks if I wanted too or if I needed to.
good,"Aside from free coffee during breaks, you meet great people and co-workers. And it is fun to make all those drinks. I have met some celebrities who also have a coffee addiction. I always had a fun time with coworkers and customers."
good,Working at Starbucks was a great experience. I worked with a lot of great people and learned a lot about coffee and other products the company sold. They can be very flexible with hours and there are benefits available to part time associates.
good,i worked at starbucks inside of a target which is very different than working inside a starbucks itself..i believe it would have been better but the manager at target wanted to move me to starbucks because i was fast paced and had great customer service
good,It was a good first job it is just hard to work when everyone is talking about you or talking to y poo u about someone else. In general it is a very cold place.
good,Good company with changing priorities as upper management changes. Hard to understand expectations with different corporate leadership. Love working with customers and excellent staff. Like a family environment
good,"The working environment at Starbucks is often fast paced and can be overwhelming while at other times you may be cleaning and restocking for an hour with no customers. The people Starbucks employs are very out going and often not very mature for their age (20-26 ish). This makes it hard to get promotions and be taken seriously at this job. "
good,"Great company. Poor management. Enjoyed my time there, I learned a lot. There was a lot of unfairness & lack of care. I gave my all & everything I thought could help."
good,"Starbucks even offers a basically free education from ASU online. The benefits are why people stay for 5+ years. The pay is not the best, but they keep us here with free coffee every week, Spotify premium, and all the friends that you make while slinging coffee."
good,"Pretty great as a barista, Job loses appeal as you climb the ladder.Hours are pretty flexible and pay is half decent. Good benefits and perks of the job"
good,"Honestly, I haven't had the best experience at my job location. That is why I am currently looking for a new job. Most of my coworkers are absolutely wonderful, But the management isn't the best. Although that being said, when surrounded by the right kind of team leaders and partners this can be the most wonderful job experience."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. It was a lot to learn in the first few months, but one you learn all that, you go into the swing of things. My least favorite part was the peak times. I am not a big fan of fast paced work, but if you are, then this is the job for you."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for a PART-TIME job ONLY. The pay is not sufficient to live an independent lifestyle as a college student. The benefits of free coffee when working is nice but only goes so far. You will definitely deal with a fair share of rude customers who are sticklers about their coffee, it comes with the territory. Unfortunately, I was lucky enough to have served slightly racist customers but that may just be my luck coming from an Asian background."
good,"Repetitive tasks, but a constant race against time. Extremely fast paced, often very high stress work environment. Sometimes breaks must be sacrificed for the customer experience. Customer always comes first."
good,"As with most customer service jobs, I got two days off a week that were almost never sequential. This is not a 9-5 M-F job! Baristas start at minimum wage, and benefits are offered after six months. There are other perks, such as Spotify premium and ASU online tuition-reduction. I was a detail-oriented barista and I was offered a promotion within six months. My store manager was excellent and job culture was great, but due to the company's high turnover rate, I can't vouch for the current management or culture."
good,"Generally I loved working at Starbucks. I am a very sociable person so the constant social interaction was one of my favorite parts of the job. At Starbucks, as opposed to other drive through establishments, you actually really get to connect with the customers and I really enjoyed being able to make a connection. The only thing that I didn't like at my store was the way that the management was set up."
good,The job requires you to follow directions and be able to recall recipes quickly and consistently. The job taught me to connect with other human beings and it also helped me come out of my shell.
good,"I have been with the company for four years, and I love working at my store because of all the amazing partners I get to work with. Starbucks is great for the fact that they have great benefits such medical benefits, free coffee every week, free drinks during your shifts, and discounts as well. I'm sure every store and manager is different, but they have always given me the hours and work days that I need/want. One of the only negative things about the company is their wages. Their barista wages start at minimum wage and then increase twice a year."
good,I think its a good place to work and ideal for young people. I think  though they need a more definitive uniform so you know you work there. I think that there needs to be more structure in place.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for anyone who is in college and needs good benefits. Managers are great at looking at your availability in terms of when you have to have off, and what your preferred  schedule is."
good,Starbucks is a fast paced and fun place. It can be very stressful. It was fun learning how to make so many different kinds of coffee and drinks.  Teamwork is the number 1 policy at Starbucks.
good,I was a contract worker for Starbucks so I wasn't given job security or benefits. But the office environment was great the people were fun and there was never a lack of work events which were great perks.
good,It's a great entry level job with a lot of opportunities. They have programs for partners who want to go to college as well as many other programs such as for those who go through hardships. Also opportunities for internal promotion.
good,En tant que job d'étudiant c'est une première expérience positive. Je n'avais pas de qualification particulière mais j'ai pu evoluer et être suivie et soutenue dans une ambiance de manière générale agréable.
good,Have to get red cards to stay after seasonal. Depending on the month hours can vary from too much to too little. Not much advancement. You are treated right and listened to.
good,"A typical day at work includes, but is not limited to geeting and serving guests food and drinks; providing customer service to guests, and stocking in between preparing drinks to par per specs."
good,"Being able to laugh on the job and have fun with the fellow partners was such a plus for me.  Working in the customer service environment one definitely needs a sense of humor and the ""where with all"" to have fun and still get work done in a timely manner plus maintain a high level of standard."
good,"Can be a fun place to work provided the correct leadership is in place. Because it is the fast-food leader of coffee, there is not as much time to really interact with your customers and yet the company wants you to make every moment special for each one!"
good,I've worked as a Barista at Starbucks for the past several months and I don't have many complaints about the job at all. I'm fortunate to work at a store that enforces rules and puts the customer experience at the top priority. I have wonderful coworkers who already feel like family and the job culture is great. I've improved upon my ability to multi-task and I am keenly aware of health and safety standards of the food service industry. The hardest part of the job is learning how to pronounce/spell names of patrons.
good,It's an experience! The customers were a joy to be around! Seeing regulars daily you start to memorize what order they have! Staff was somewhat helpful! Some shift managers weren't understanding of other staffs situations regarding family emergencies! No remorse. Would recommend working for the company but NOT at the location I worked at.
good,"A typical day at work was so fun. Each customer was greeted with a smile. I learned how to prepare special beverages and help new comers find the perfect drink. The management was so unorganized but we had experienced staff that some what kept us in order. The workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job was closing because people loved to come in at the very last minute. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy and welcomed while they were in our facility,"
good,"a very fast paced and busy environment. it taught me customer service skills as well as helped me improve my multitasking skills. It was fun getting to know customers, and ensuring they had the best possible Starbucks experience."
good,brew coffee and tea as well as make lattes. making lattes proper brewing methods. the customers were enjoyable and co-workers were awesome. closing one night and opening the next day. making drinks and interacting with the customers.
good,Starbucks employees are always so friendly and they become so close to you. Seeing your everyday customers is the best feeling knowing that half of the reason they come is to see your specific employees.
good,"typically, i spend most of my work day taking orders and making drinks and/or pastries. Some days, i spend a couple of hours in the back of the store making sandwiches and/or parfaits. Since working at Starbucks, i have become more patient and gains quick problem-solving skills. I get along great with everyone of my coworkers. I love making others happy and seeing the joy of a costumers face when i make their drinks ""just right."""
good,"Like i said, it was fine, i worked there for a while, i didn't work enough hours to get any benefits ( that may have been the point) But i've heard they are doing good things with people that are full time."
good,"Great overall experience working as a Target Barista in a Target Superstore. I was unfortunate to receive poor management (represented by Target), but without good leadership, and being the only one scheduled most of the time, I was able to quickly, independently learn how Starbucks functions and adapted to the working environment."
good,"Its fun, fast and exciting to work as a barista.  At times Management would be unprofessional, but overall the job and co-workers made it fun. Benefits are great."
good,"Seldom  staffed to suit needs of guests "
good,"A typical day working at target Starbucks can be very mundane on the week days because usually it is slow. Working here on weekends we'll mostly have a rush all day until around closing time. Working here I've learned to work by myself in fast paced environments. The management could be improved so much more. The hardest part of this job is to work by yourself making drinks, assisting guests, making food, marking cups, dating things as you open them to make sure nothing goes out of date, and also while doing all of that you have to show some interest in the guests for customer service purposes. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you work with. The people here has great communication skills and they love to build personal relationships/friendship, which is a good thing and I love that about the people working here."
good,can be stressful when getting started but it easy when you get the hang of it. there are some snoty customers but you get used to it. free lb of coffee every two weeks.
good,"Starbucks was good place to work everyone was nice to an extent, work wasn't complicated, very easy place to stay if your looking to do so. Hardest part? there wasn't really any just alot of work to do"
good,Nice to learn the corporate life of coffee and pizza.  Take that knowledge and move on to more challenging positions.  Nice growing experience for me to move up.
good,"The benefits that Starbucks offers are ALMOST enough to make up for it being such a hard job. It's hard work every single day, just in that it's so fast-paced and there is much more cleaning than you think of when you apply. My current store has a pretty good mix of people and we find ourselves laughing a lot which is nice, but there are a lot of ""rules"" that are set by Starbucks that sometimes don't make sense and are frustrating to follow. You get free drinks when you work, and one free food item during each shift, plus a really good discount and a free pound of coffee or box of tea every week. There are a lot of good things, but it feels like the job is more frustrating than a part time job should be, most shifts are less than 6 hours per day, so you're still working 5 days a week but still at part-time. Be expected to get phone calls on your days off because someone called in sick, you aren't required to come in, but might be guilt tripped. A lot of people really enjoy their job and meeting with so many different customers."
good,My boss had a bad attitude most of the time but everyone else was great. I enjoyed getting to know the regular customers that came in and learning all about the different drinks we made.
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for, although some adjustments could be made in the store management sector. Customers tend to be friendly depending on the store."
good,"I honestly loved my job at Starbucks, it was great people to work with, and I loved our customers. Sadly we got a new manager and things changed. A typical day at work was good. I learned a lot about patience and how to work in any paced environment. The hardest part was the location I was in was VERY small, so it was difficult to move around with a lot of people working. Also it is for sure a job that tests you in your patience with customers. My favorite part of the job was the baristas I worked along side with!"
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work if you're in high school or college. It can be fun, but management usually isn't the best. Customers are hit or miss."
good,"This job is enjoyable but it is also not flexible. Working at the airport is very hectic especially at Starbucks. I enjoy the environment and managers, but it really busy."
good,有培訓課程，學到很多，亦有很認真的測試。環境十分清潔，守則亦很多，但學習到的終身受用，例如：對客人的態度和與伙伴的溝通。
good,I worked at a campus Starbucks so the rush was much more intense than normal corporate Starbucks but drinks are easy to learn and a pretty fun work environment.
good,Very productive work environment. Can get very busy at random times of the day and can be a bit overwhelming at times but it gets easier to manage the longer you work here. Company treats employees well. Would even consider making a career
good,"Great company to work for and great benefits. Health care, dental, 401k plans, stock options, and free coffee! Sounds like a sweet deal. You can network with the customers and make genuine connections with people from all over."
good,"I loved this job, but the people that work at the location I worked at were terrible not very customer oriented or workplace friendly. The managers were okay though, very lenient with bullying in the workplace though. Overall the 60+ hour work weeks were a bit hard but the money was very good. Starbucks is a nice place to work, very fun and rewarding company."
good,"Great benefits, great culture. Company truly cares about employees. Hardest part is working under a corporate ladder. Most enjoyable is working with team and customers in the stores."
good,There were many things required by a manager of the company.  Staffing was always a concern.  Management often has to cover shifts when staff does not show for work.
good,Working at Starbucks is very hectic yet very rewarding. The pay is great depending on your region and so are the others. The difficulty of the job allows you to gain experience and learn about the food industry. Starbucks take care of their own. If you can work at Starbucks you can work anywhere.
good,Working at Starbucks helps you plan your daily life and it is a fun environment meeting new people from all over the world. Getting people to smile in the early morning hours creates a deep satisfaction as a barista.
good,"if you ever been into a Starbucks, you will always find something different. friendly employees, great coffee and food products. hardest part would be leaving"
good,Good shift flexibility. Poor management. Not great pay. Great benefits. Good opportunity for progress in the work place. Even better opportunity to develop your customer service skills.
good,"When I first started working for Starbucks, I thought it was going to be a walk in the park. How hard could it really be to be a barista? Little did I know that the job would require mental quickness and more smiling than I usually did in a day. At first, the hardest part was learning how to do everything; but, now, the hardest part is keeping customers happy while still maintaining the ""third place"" that Starbucks is known for. At times, we're severely understaffed and it's hard to get the drinks out quickly. That doesn't mean I don't go home with a smile, though. I do everyday because the customers, and especially our regulars, make every hour worth it. My favorite part is when I'm on drive thru and a customer identifies me by voice. It's a nice feeling, knowing that I'm not the only one who knows who I'm talking to. As a team, all of the baristas are extremely close, too. We hang out outside of work and joke around even when we're busy. The drinks and customer experience never suffers. And the store, as a whole, runs like a well-oiled machine. Because of that, time passes quickly and I soon find myself clocking out for the day."
good,"I often enjoy working for Starbucks, but it does have its moments. You are often tested with your patience when it comes to customers.The partners there make the mundane operations a bit easier to get through from time to time."
good,Busy. Great co workers. Still friends with most. Have to move quickly and get the order right the first time the lines are super long. managemant is nice and cares about you as a person outside of work. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,"In my experience, starbucks was a good company to work for. The customers can be a pain in the a** (one told me I was 'ruining her life' and shes 'gonna sue' because we were out of cold brew coffee) If you ever want a day off, good luck!"
good,Kurumsal oluşu en güzel ve mükemmel yani her ay belli gün ve saatinde maaşları yatıyor operasyon anlamında fazla özveri fazla dikkat tamamen misafir çalışan ve mağaza odaklı bir sektör doğaya çalışanına sosyal projelerine önem veren bir sektör fakat bunlar bi kenara can sıkıcı noktaları da var elbet.
good,"I had worked at a drive-thru location and had enjoyed `the fast-paced environment as well as the flexibility in work hours. A definite plus is being able to receive a free lunch and drinks for employee breaks. The downside is that shifts and management don't take in consideration employees strengths and weaknesses and just place employees in one spot for the entire shift, which could sometimes be the entire 8 hours outside of breaks. Overall, I would recommend Starbucks as a place to work."
good,"Typically when I go in to work, it's usually very busy, but my coworkers always make me feel welcome and they're happy to see me. Sometimes the customers can be difficult, but the overall experience is great."
good,Starbucks had a lively environment. People were always on the move and the space was fast-paced. The rushes were a thrill. Working in a licensed store was sometimes a challenge.
good,"Working at Starbucks is amazing because it is fast pace, and the workplace thrives on strong team work. I have developed skills in management and learned how to strongly lead a team and set examples on how to provide the best customer service that they can give. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to build relationships with both the team and the customers. At Starbucks we thrive to make every moment great with each and every customer."
good,I'm in college currently and working for Starbucks has been the perfect job for me. They are really flexible and understanding of my schedule. My other co workers are friendly and it's an all around good environment.
good,"Starbucks is a job that only becomes stressful in bursts. There is also having to deal with hungry and under caffeinated customers that will make many interactions seem hostile. Take these moments with a grain of salt and just focus on your work. Once a rhythm is found and maintained, every day will go by easily."
good,"•	Management level responsibly opening and closing store. "
good,"Company provides fantastic training in all departments which enable to do your job better"
good,"I cannot tell you how many times I have worked side by side with or below a manager who cannot efficiently do their jobs. This makes the environment of the work place feel like havoc and chaos. The benefits are amazing and the stability is great. But there are constant changes and regulations that make it very hard to do your job at times. A manager told me to wait for our designated worker to rely on stocking our bar syrups, cups, etc... I had one drink to make. I needed one thing from the back room to get it. I had to wait five minutes with this customer staring at me to ask and receive the syrup I needed to give this customer their drink. I could not walk the 10 feet into the back hallway with the door open to retrieve what I needed. I had an upset customer and a ridiculous rule to follow causing it."
good,"Lot of drama, it wasn't to bad. It's pretty easy and schedule is done 3 weeks in advance (if your store manager actually does it.) which helps with making plans, but makes it sometime difficult if something pops up and you need to switch shifts."
good,"Starbucks, at times, can be a really great place to work. Unfortunately, there is a lot of verbal abuse from self entitled customers because Starbucks has made it quite clear that the customer is always right, always. I noticed a lot of the customers tend to take advantage, usually at the expense of the barista's peace of mind."
good,"A very high volume work place.  The company has high expectations, and will take care of its employees.  Has always been really flexible with my personal schedule.  The shifts can be rather long and emotionally draining, in some instances upward momentum can be difficult.  It's a great part time job for benefits, or for students.   However the pay alone isn't the best for living off of."
good,"Overall, I can't complain. Starbucks saw me through eleven years of turmoil and life changes. The partners and customers really make the place. Management can be excellent at times, but usually comes and goes."
good,"Great benefits, but you work too hard for too little pay. Management isn't too great, but the work life balance is nice. It is what you make of it, but being a barista isn't a good long term job."
good,"I loved working with the people.  I loved working with the public. The challenge of the job (I had lots to learn from learning the different drinks, running a register, stocking, etc.) was something I also enjoyed"
good,"where to start...... Basically, if you are looking to build a strong work ethic Starbucks is the place for you. This job has its perks and its sucky things like any other. If you are an awesome worker be prepared to slave. I noticed in my 4yr tenure here that there were either those that cared for everything and those that didn't care at all. It can be frustrating and there is a lot to learn at first but over all the people that you work with most times become like family and you develop lasting friendships and once you get the hang of everything you feel on top of the world. of course for the amount you work and the work load of the job, Starbucks should compensate more for the hard working partners. But though it had some of the most difficult night I've worked the benefits out weigh the detriments. Great job and overall very fun."
good,"I enjoyed my time at corporate Starbucks, however, there is a sense that they are a company with a culture of being inclusive and sensitive to opinions (aka. touchy feely), but at the end of the day it's a for profit corporation, just like any where else...so it tends to be very passive aggressive at times."
good,"In the beginning, it was a smooth transmission, working with others and enjoying the customers. The management also sucked here. It took too long to express customer and employee concerns to them, let alone implementing any changes to help. the most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers. they were always awesome and it was always good vibes. Hardest part was not getting your voice heard on things you knew could improve the store, but the manager had no initiative of wanting to put it into place."
good,"Target is a good company but they sometimes go too far to assist the guest even if the guest was wrong in a situation, they do NOT have flexible schedules"
good,"This is a fun job, but pay does not balance life. Tips are available but not consistent. Hours are steady during seasonal months, but are not consistent. This job would be ideal for a college student, someone who just needed a second job, or someone who still lives at home with their parents."
good,I have worked with Starbucks all together 11years. Over all the company is great and have good benefits but they as a overall company have began to loose a real connection with the partners and the public.
good,"This was a job that I thoroughly enjoyed. This job really helped me develop my customer service skills, and made me realize how much I love working with customers. Building that one on one relationship is key in this business. The business is fast paced and keep you on your toes. The first manager I had seemed supportive, but then I had managers that would rather promote new hirees rather than promote within."
good,"the company itself is amazing, but my coworkers often did not care to show up to work. we were overworked because no one showed up/would call in sick last minute."
good,"Never a dull moment! I enjoyed every bit of my 10 years! Great customer service job to start out with, the people you work with make it worth it."
good,Good managers tend to not stick around. Hardest part is getting up early to deal with drama between coworkers and customers.
good,"I made drinks and assisted with daily tasks and special projects. I learned customer service and how important it is to make the moment right. I think our management could do better about their roles. It is a good place to work however it is not a great place to work, it was a medium stress environment but things were getting more stressful. My hardest part of the job is dealing with management and dealing with new hires. The most enjoyable part of my job there is that they have great customers."
good,"I have a very extreme hate love relationship with Starbucks. This is one of the most intense jobs I have had. You have to be prepared to deal with a lot of nasty people but there are also amazing friendships you can have."
good,"A typical day of work would go; Come in around, 5:45 am to 6:30 am, wash my hands and get ready for the countless number of beverages that needed to be made. Create casual conversations with almost anyone that wanted that early morning humor from yours truly.I would hear some complaints about this person or that person not being attentive enough or about having a beverage created poorly, but easily fixable. I Learned how to diffuse heated situations. The coffee culture was definitely something that I did not expect. I had to get used to a certain lifestyle that i never even knew existed. Management was probably the best I've ever encountered. The manager was very accommodating as far as getting the fluctuation of hours around all the employees. Hardest part is knowing that you're unable to go anywhere. The most enjoyable part was the connections you're able to create with your co-workers as well as with the people that come and get coffee."
good,The job requires a lot of fast paced teamwork and organization skills. It helped me become the valuable worker i am today and has given me the confidence in my ability to tackle any obstacle when taking on a new job.
good,"Varied on a daily basis."
good,"My typical day started at 4:30am. The start was easy since the customer was regulars, and over time it was a faster way to start the day. I liked being in first and out first. I learned a lot about coffee, and how presenting a certain item makes it desirable. I was very fond of my boss, but she was a little too tight on how things were run with the newer people, and let the older partners get away with more. Hardest part of the day would actually come and go. It was when you felt pressured to always be perfect and always be Starbucks oriented. It was hard to not always be thinking of the job even when you weren't working. I enjoyed working with the people and customers, and loved the work place. I however, did not like getting payed minumum wage for 4:30am, doing heavy lifting (patio furniture), putting away orders and doing tips. It was a lot of work with no real pay off."
good,Good about flexible scheduling. Good part time insurance. Great stock options. Deal well with leave of absences. Enjoyed having good benefits. My managers always dealt well with me.
good,"Very fast paced during the rush, it is stressful but overtime it becomes usual. There are times when things slow down. Great environment, regular customers are nice."
good,"Условия хорошие, многовато обязанностей, жестковатое руководство, достойная зп"
good,Properly placed orders has keyed in and keep 100% customer service. i learned how to keep up in a upbeat and high  speed pace and to always be patient while making drinks or keeping workplace cleaned. Management was not always organized and never at work. They switched up managers every other month.
good,The job was faced paced. Co-workers were nice and cooperative allowing all to learn from one another. It was a great learning experience because different  types of costumers would arrive to this location thus allowing one to learn how to assist and serve different types of customers.
good,"I worked at the Starbucks at YYC Airport in Calgary, the manager of the business at the time was absolutely amazing.  He was very kind, caring and understanding... Supervisors and trainers were all kind and eager to help you succeed.  I became comfortable and happy to work with my colleagues as well, due to them also being so kind and helpful.  HR was not helpful, sent my T4 to the wrong address and was not cooperative or even responsive.  Wage was average minimum, but hours were flexible and could be negotiated due to such amazing management.  Quick paced and good job regardless where you are in your life."
good,"I like Starbucks but the management sucks. I like the overall work experience you get.  It's a perfect job to have if your just learning and or if your going to school. You get a free pound of coffee everyweek. You get part-time benefits of our work at the least 520 hours each quarter, which is about 20 hours a week. The benefits are decent not amazing."
good,"I loved my store in Colorado, when i transferred to Illinois, the culture and environment took a huge decline from how I am used to. Colorado stores are the best, i am sorry i left there."
good,"Was hired with assurance that I was going to be receiving full time hours. As the weeks went on, my hours started to decrease. Great part time job. It is a good job for high school students to make some extra cash."
good,"A fast paced work environment means you will likely leave your shift tired. The customers are ruthless and have a McDonald's-esque opinion in regards to speed. This coupled with the actual time that goes into a single beverage and the fact that you will likely have a line of 10-12 drinks on top of that, creates a rather hostile partner-to-customer experience. Although my co-workers are fantastic, corporate emphasizes on labor cuts that only hurt the store as a whole. Under staffing is common, because your store manager will be getting constantly berated by corporate if they have too many labor hours in the week. Inhuman, machine-like speed is valued over your humanity and well-being."
good,"Working with the supervisors and coworkers has made this job even more enjoyable. You get to meet new people and engage with customers! Aramark itself is not my favorite company to work with because of the small raises, minimum wage, and sometimes the Aramark representative is not understanding with the work conditions and stress."
good,"For the most part, i like working at starbucks, the friendly regulars make it worth it for the most part. There is definitely an attitude among the people who come into our stores that makes them think that we're not actually human which is what makes things difficult. It takes a certain kind of tenacity to stick around as long as some of my coworkers have, and you can see how this job has changed their world view. Be prepared to hit the ground running if you work here."
good,"It's fun and you meet a lot of cool, friendly people everyday. I worked for the company for a total of ten years while going to school and worked part-time while doing other jobs."
good,"people say ""omg you work at starbucks? must be great!"" but the truth is half of my job is washing dishes. ive had skin problems due to the soap we use"
good,"uma excelente empreza para se trabalhar."
good,"Trabajar en Starbucks es muy grato, pero algunas veces los supervisores no hacen mucho trabajo, lo bueno es el Ambiente y las  amistades que haces."
good,Easy to learn and fast paced environment. The shifts tend to be very flexible and all of the other partners are a lot of fun to work with and are easy to get along with
good,"Low work/life balance can be tough."
good,I must say its the easiest job ever.  The only bad part would probably be the customers they can be very rude.  Management is okay but can really do better.  If you know how to work well on a team then this is the job for you but if not then please reconsider your option.  Also don't get offended when a partner corrects you on something you're doing wrong its only to help you in the long run.
good,welcome to a day at starbucks....... hi welcome to starbucks how can I help you that was the very first thing ive learned there it was really nice I liked it ive already worked at a coffee shop so I kind of knew of everything went on and how to do most of the things besides the blended drinks was a little hard for me to remember it took me about 2 in a half weeks to learn that but besides that it was east ive had experience already at coffee shops
good,"Generally an enjoyable job, most coworkers and customers friendly. Good experience for working in a fast paced environment, but high turnover rate and frequent callouts often leaves us understaffed. Management of employees and store needs major improvement: often running out of stock, broken things in store often put off and take a long time to get fixed."
good,"Working as a barista has been great in improving my multitasking and people skills. The hours are flexible and there are benefits for as low as 20 hours a week. Personally, my managers have been great. Overall though, district management and above always seem out of touch. Everything is focused more on cutting hours and the bottom line rather than trying to keep customers coming back by having the correct kind of staffing necessary for an efficient store."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks, consists of serving customers, making drinks, and cleaning. In each work day I learn something new, whether ispt is how to improve a drink, or learning new ingredients that are in the drinks. "
good,"This is a very good company to work with the atmosphere is lovely, and you will find many new things to learn each and  every day you will also have fun while working ."
good,"I like the company and the staff and the managers are very kind, it's fun to work with them, they treat the employees very kindly. It's also a very nice work place.Please to work with them."
good,"Lo que hacía en un día típico de trabajo era, llegaba, ponía mis cosas en el locker, leía las actividades que iba a desarrollar ese día, ya que podíamos estar en caja o solo en la preparación de bebidas, sin embargo si había mucha gente, apoyaba a mis compañeros en el área de bebidas, contaba el dinero que había en la caja, platicaba un poco con nuestros clientes, ya que me gustaba tener contacto con el cliente, le hacía alguna recomendación de nuestros productos, realizaba mis actividades de limpieza, después de hacer mis actividades, tomaba mi hora de descanso para comer y estudiar, regresaba de mi descanso, seguía apoyando a mis compañeros y seguían realizando ventas, al finalizar el día hacía el cierre de mi caja, contaba el dinero, supervisando que todo cuadrara y depositaba el dinero en una caja fuerte que teníamos, al final del día limpiábamos profundamente toda la maquinaria utilizada."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent place to work, with tons to learn. One of the hardest things about working at Starbucks is building a repeatable routine, but once you build the muscle memory and learn to do things in sequence, it's a lot of fun. "
good,A typical day is pretty hetic and sometimes difficult to work with your coworkers. The management team can be very indirect. I have learned how to work under emese stress and many bodies in your way.
good,"If you are fine with staying at the manager level and not advancing to District manager or higher...then Starbucks is a good place.  Benefits are great, pay is below average.  Upper management is clueless, which is because District Managers are almost all outside hires with no experience behind the bar.  Also, it seems that unless you are female, it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to become a Store Manager.  I really felt I had grounds to file a discrimination suit, but since I'm a white male, it would have been useless.  Partners are great for Starbucks, but when you get to the District Managers, it is just a joke."
good,Working at Starbucks was a fun and exciting experience you meet many people and get to share your knowledge of coffee with them.
good,"at astarbucks i Maintains the highest level of standards for all products preparation including proper grinding of coffee beans and top quality espresso shots; as well as educating customers on company’s coffee products. "
good,"Great atmosphere to work. "
good,Gets Busy around holidays. Great benefits but bad pay. And really petty customers......they complain about everything and anything they could. Just to get their way.
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits. The customers are very sweet and associates are creative.. Work and life balance was okay. Management staff are okay. Associates engagement great, great customer focus"
good,"Worked well with me in school, worked toward advancement. Recently cutting hours but has many benefits. I have a lot of control over my schedule and management runs mostly on the individual store basis. Must be able to spend a long time on your feet and work quickly. Customers are, in general, nice and always anticipating engagement."
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for. Part-time work for full-time benefits. The company gives raises every 6 months. Fun, exciting place to work. Great co-workers and amazing regular customers make the day good every day. Challenging co-workers in sales and or speedy service makes for an interesting day. I absolutely loved the job, but I wanted to advance in an amazing career. Starbucks is an amazing company to work for while attending school."
good,Working at Starbucks is fun and they have excellent working relationship with partners. You will learn many things and be well trained.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you are looking for a part time position with decent benefits. opportunities for growth felt stunted.
good,At my home store you never know what to expect.  Every day can be completely different than the last.  You must be ready to run and adapt at all times.
good,"Job itself is not difficult or tiring. However, most of the staff don't show any interest in improving and learning new things. Manager of the store does not show enough authority, thus people just do what they want whenever they want. This is really disturbing normal shift running and overall service. "
good,"Working for Starbucks was an interesting experience. The employees are wonderful, and the culture is great, but the hours were sporadic and random every week, and advancement past supervisory positions are extremely limited."
good,"the environment can be great, from the coworkers to your everyday customers. You learn so much about versatility , that if you were to leave you would feel like you could do anything."
good,"Active and constant movie. "
good,"Each day at Starbucks is filled with the routine daily procedures that must be done every day. Open/close the store, prep product, cleaning, delegating tasks and breaks, caring for the customer. However, with all of the similarities from day to day, each day is full of unique challenges. Higher or lower volume of customers, a larger or smaller staff working at one time, high volumes of transactions at different times of the day, extremely talkative customers to extremely unhappy customers. New challenges everyday at every moment. I have learned to plan and anticipate to the best of my ability based on the trends I have learned from previous days and weeks, yet be able to change that plan in a moment when a challenge comes up suddenly. Dealing with issues such as partners calling out or unexpected large orders can be difficult and frustrating at times, but I have learned not to stress over the situation as it only makes it harder, and calmly move forward as quickly as possible. "
good,"Well if you are really all about the coffee then this job is right for you. Though I admit I haven't gone inside a Starbucks since I stopped working for them. As it was I was let go during the mass company down sizing. Honestly I didn't care as I was about to quit as the companies policies and ethics changed. In the end it wasn't the same company I started with and as I understand it, its now labeled as not a great work environment these days. However, I learned a lot about coffee, food safety, ordering, time management, leadership, and how to train others. Oddly enough not from my managers."
good,"As a lower level employee, or Partner, in the company's lingo, it's a great place to work. As a person develops and is promoted it has the potential to consume his/her life, and it it somewhat frowned upon if the job is not life's central focus. "
good,"If you like working in a team environment and meeting new people in a fast-paced workplace, this job is great. A willingness to learn, adapt, and make people's days happier will bring you far within the company. However, the ever changing menu, policies, and management will deter any personal development that is not in line with brand."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to be when transitioning, you get great benefits and opportunities for school even just working part time.  They pay is minimal and trying to advance into management is not very easy or clearly spelled out.  They seem to prefer hiring managers from outside than promoting from within which causes the experience to change a lot depending on where you are."
good,"A lot of hard work for not much pay, but it can be a fun job. It has its ups and downs. difficult to manage home life. "
good,"Empresa boa, te dar oportunidade de crescimento, o único ruim era o salário que era baixo, e você não tem um lugar fixo dentro da empresa"
good,"A typical day at work is extremely fast-paced and hectic, requiring a lot of memorization, flexibility without compromise, and the ability to make split-second decisions with future outcomes in mind."
good,It was a good job to have if you liked what you where doing. But the managment sucks and they eed direction. I learned alot from being there. And by alot i mean I know what not to do.
good,"If You like working in customer service, its one of the best. Flexible schedules for school, and perfect part time opportunities."
good,"My store manager was great, I had good opportunity to advance, but the farther you advance within the company the more it consumes your life. I was promoted to Asst. Store Manager and demoted myself eventually back down to Barista."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits and opportunities for growth within the company. Not great with offering breaks throughout the shift.
good,A typical day at work includes a lot of work and various tasks. The job does not have opportunities to make people develop themselves.
good,"I love working for Starbucks... but I would enjoy it more if I were able to have a regular schedule and able to maintain a healthy work-life-school balance. As a shift supervisor, there are less opportunities for a regular and predictable schedule than there are for baristas."
good,"Coming in to work is like coming in to work with you're second family.  You're co-workers become like family and you build great connections with customers as well on a daily basis.  I have learn alot about business management and how important it is to be a solid leader who partners can rely on.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be knowing you made a great impact on someone's day. Hardest part would have to be keeping up with the many drink recipes but, after a while you do eventually get the hang of it."
good,"Starbucks was the first job I ever got. Working at Starbucks taught me a lot about customer service, and customer relations, at that time since I was just starting out those skills truly helped mold me in the direction I was aiming at. Management was helpful, and employees were happy. What else can you ask for?"
good,I deeply enjoyed my co-workers at this company as well as management. Oftentimes working fast Paced as well as multi tasking would some days be overwhelming but totally worth coming to work. I learned here that even though everyone is different we are all practically the same in different ways. I love being in a team environment but I enjoyed nothing more than when it was time for me to prepare another monthly event. Most events were kid friendly and i worked hard on planning to see so many smiles on the childrens face. This company gave me alot of tools and room for growth.
good,"A day within this role depends on the store you are placed in. Unfortunately, most district managers do not understand the complexities of higher volume stores and therefore attempt to support them the same as lower volume stores. This leads to store manager frustration and burning out. Many days are rewarding as you grow and develop your team. The newer bonus structure makes it increasingly difficult to achieve over LY sales based on environmental factors which are no longer taken into consideration when setting targets (ie. road construction, tourism decline, hours of ops changes...). The peer groups are usually a tight knit and collaborative group, often helping one another in times of need. The hardest part of the job is how grey all the policies can be at times with both employees and partners. They're often just viewed as guidelines such as return policies and we're told to ""just say yes"" when doing so can potentially open us up to problem situations (ie. stolen merchandise). The best part of the job has been growing and developing others."
good,I learned so much from my time at Starbucks. I advanced and succeeded in ways I couldn't imagine. It was a big part of my life for the last few years. I loved all the people. The work can be intense and repetitive at times. The culture has changed over the past few years and I feel that some stores are straying away from the core values.
good,"My time spent with Starbucks was a great time filled with a diverse work space and colorful personalities. I've gained great knowledge about customer support as well as knowledge about people and how they think, as i spent my time with the company. there is plenty to learn from this specific job experience and none was too hard to grasp or handle  I enjoyed my time and believe the experience and information I've gained will stay with me."
good,Fun place to work. Great benefits. Flexible schedule. Can be very stressful at times. Benefits for part time employees. Great for college students.
good,"I had a lot of responsabilities, I was a Supervisor, but actually I did a manager job in the last 4 months of employment. I achieved manager experience and I've learned how to deliver a great customer service. Last store where I've worked was small and a lot of time I was alone, but my team was respectful and nice. The hardest part was on weekend time when I did double-shifts. The  most enjoyable part was when I did events, like aroma labs to promote the seasonal coffees."
good,"Good company to work for, can be a little overwhelming sometimes. Requires a certain kind of person to work there. The benefits are great and it's easy to move up in the company"
good,"Co-workers will make or break this job for you. If you have a good group of people to work with, you'll love it. My experience was marred by bad management, which lead me to leave the job. The corporate culture encourages management to treat everyone like children. The language they endorse is cringe-worthy. Work structure is rigid, with no room to interpret rules (this depends on your manager). Depending on your manager's philosophy on overtime, you may or may not have time to run breaks for everyone in a timely manner without severely crippling operations. I skipped many of my mandated 15-minute breaks just to allow my co-workers to take theirs."
good,"The job environment is great, the pay is okay. The real problem lies in the lack of advancement, wide range in schedule, and management."
good,"Wonderful place to work, extremely fun work environment, and the workers are a close knit group, and it's like one big happy family.  I really did love working there so much."
good,Management is awful. I've been at the job longer than the waiting period and still have not received my benefits package.
good,"Prepare or serve hot or cold beverages, such as coffee, espresso drinks, blended coffees, or teas.Clean or sanitize work areas, utensils, or equipment.Clean service or seating areas.Check temperatures of freezers, refrigerators, or heating equipment to ensure proper functioning."
good,This is a job that takes the right kind of person who has great customer service skills and able to multi-task. It requires flexibility and a positive work ethic.
good,Although i only worked there for four months I rather enjoyed my time there my co-workers were very supportive and helpful for me the only problem i had was my manager at the time wasn't really fir for the manager position more or less because she just didn't know what she was doing.
good,"My co-wokers and management were great, always interacted well and got along. I learned a lot about coffee and general customer interaction while working there. The hardest part was keeping up with the demand, being located just outside of a large university, the store front would be under pressure constantly to keep up with the volume of customers."
good,"A typical day is making drinks, serving and warming pastries. Making fresh coffee. Seeping and moping floors, cleaning dishes and espresso machines and lobby area"
good,"It was a fun job, I would certainly go back. There were some mixed messages down the communication train from head office. I believe this is due to head office workers not knowing about how things work on the floor day to day."
good,"Could always have someone to rely on,enjoyed interacting with all the guests in the store and seeing all of the regulars everyday. The team was more then just co-workers it was more of a family. The hardest part of the job would be how busy it was with not enough hours to schedule to have more employees to work."
good,"Even though my co-workers were amazing and we have great times together, the management is the worst. The company can be great and you get good benefits, but it is not worth all the stress this job brings."
good,"I started working for Starbucks when it was in it's hay day. The store that I worked at, had a line of people of people out side of the store every morning. We were bsuy! This was when the beverages were a craft and he had a REAL La Marzocca espresso machine. These were true had crafted beverages."
good,a fun place to work depending on the management customers are usually friendly and easy to get along with many different opportunities if your social and willing to put yourself out there.
good,Une enseigne jeune et dynamique quand on reste dans l'esprit Starbucks.
good,"The store is a fun place to be. The staff had a friendly, family like atmosphere and ran like a machine. Working alongside a group of people that close is great fun."
good,"Fun and educational..... I've learned a lot about coffee and beverages that use coffee."
good,"great place to work at as far as gaining some customer service and communication skills. Allows an individual to be a coffee expert. Excellent tips depending on the particular location. The faster the store, the better the tips."
good,"The best part about this job is the diversity of people you get the experience to work with, and the customer relationships that are formed through the years."
good,a typical day at work would be focusing on making drinks extremely fast. Going easily through more then 30 customers every half hour. not only that but the hardest part of my job was knowing we were understaff needing more barista. the most enjoyable was having amazing co-workers and some amazing customers always come to put a smile in my day.
good,"Starbucks taught me the value of each interaction we have with others, and how important it is to create long lasting connections. The best part was making someone's day a bit better, with great communication about expectations and meeting them. Too, working with coworkers that were often new offered a chance to help others learn - it's an entirely different type of communication. Helping train new baristas taught me that sustained and constant communication about expectations builds trust. The most difficult part of the job was daily and weekly scheduling. It can be difficult to build a routine."
good,Working for Starbucks is great for students and anyone who needs a flexible schedule. Upper management seems to care about development of partners. Each store has a different feel when working there. You get to meet lots of awesome people which is the thing I like the most.
good,I have fun working here on a day to day basis. I get on well with all the staff/customers. My only problem is the lack of progression. i have worked there almost 4 years and have not progressed at all.
good,iş yerinde bir günüm insan ilişkileri ve kahve yapmakla geçiyor çünkü CV belirtiğim gibi kahve bazlı bir şirkette halen çalışmaktayım . İş yerimin bana öğrettiği çok şey oldu ama en önemlisi takım ruhu ve insan ilişkileri . eglence olarakta  zaten işimi eğlenerek yapıyorum
good,"Working for starbucks was a great experience. i was fortunate to have very helpful co-workers and nice and helpful shift managers. starbucks in it self was a great company to work for only con is if they have lay anyone if you were recently hired your the 1st to go, as well as have a social life is a bit hard working there especially if its full time."
good,The coworkers were always welcoming. the best part of the job was we were able to take home one drink with us. here i learned how to conduct myself with impatient customers and also how to make a great cappuccino. a typical day here involved making drinks and breakfast.
good,"We got alot of regulars so after a couple visits you start to prepare their beverages before they even get to the counter. management wasnt very organized, co-workers play around alot, hardest part is remembering how to read and mark the cups, the best part is being able to create different beverages while recommending your favorites."
good,"Starbucks has many good perks like Health Benefits and coffee. However, I feel that we are trained in ""world class"" mentality but are expected to perform like a fast food restaurant. Most customers are impossible to deal with and make this job far more stressful that it needs to be. Training has gone down hill in the past four years and Starbucks is no longer what it used to be, so call it what it is; Fast food."
good,"I worked in a drive thru with lobby store. That means customers came in on two ends, and since it was a high trafficked area the store was often busy. The store I worked at had a few shift supervisors who was very good at understanding what the partners needed to be able to get through rushes and when those rushes would take place. A few were good at placing people in appropriate positions to ensure a successful rush. However, management also selected certain partners to be shift supervisors who were not suited to being supervisors. This further stressed the baristas out. From my first day to my last the store was understaffed, granted it got better over time with a change in management, but it remained stressful, this meant when we happened to get supervisors who didn't know what they were doing it was much worse. You'd think that this couldn't happen, even under a good manager, but it did."
good,"During my time at Starbucks, I've learned a lot about being patient with others, including customers and other partners. It has been fun learning all the specifics of creating all the different drinks, and everything there is to learn about coffee. My partners have been great to me, but some higher up individuals have shown a consistent pattern of unprofessionalism and immaturity when dealing with those who are ""below"" them (for example, discussing individual issues in front of other partners and customers, making unprofessionally rude remarks towards employees)."
good,I liked working there the people were great to work for. The lack of pay was hard to make a living off of. The managers were great people and good to get along with. Customers were great to work with they were cheerful and made me smile everyday. Though the job was demanding it was a good job.
good,"Was a great place to work. There was nothing that I would change. Overall, the mission of the facility was always enforced."
good,"Based in a residential area, the high majority of our customers are regular visitors, so has helped create a community spirit, with us regularly undertaking promotions with local charity and business events."
good,"I loved the fast paced environment; there was always something to do.  At every job, there can always be something to complain about but it's a pays the bills too so overlooking things to complain about is an ease."
good,"A typical day in the life of Starbucks, it starts with a welcoming smile from all the partners who are on the floor. When you clock in, it is game time or as one of my co-workers say, its ""Prime Time"" Some people like competition on the floor and since I am at a drive thru Starbucks, I try to compete with how fast I can get drinks out properly with the same amazing quality each time. The hardest part is probably the stress when someone gets burnt out during a rush and you have to pick up the slack, however the most enjoyable part is that you dont feel like you are working for so long, time passes by really quick and you are surrounded by amazing people."
good,"A typical days work at Starbucks consisted of running the cash register, taking care of customers in a timely manner and preparing coffee drinks to standard. The hardest part of the job was learning the flow of operation. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know and greet the customers, and working with co-workers."
good,"I've learned a number of things at Starbucks. For example, inventory management and how to talk to customers. Customer service was a key part of working, especially since it was on the turnpike it was busy majority of the day. I think that the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that do not speak any English at all, it made taking orders difficult and frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with, i got along with everyone and tried to make the work day as enjoyable as possible, I'm a people person so it was easy to get along with everyone."
good,"Like working in any retail job, working at Starbucks requires customer service and people skills. Generally, I enjoyed working at Starbucks, because I like many of my coworkers. Honestly, if you have a thick enough skin to deal with some customers and minor scheduling issues, this job might be the right fit. If you pull your weight, you most likely will not have a problem with your coworkers or shift supervisors. For the most part, the job is laid back, but any morning rushes or afternoon rushes can be stressful if you can't adapt an work in a fast paced environment."
good,"Lots of customers"
good,"Starbucks is great company to work for for. I unfortunately was not able to take advantage of all the benefits the company offered because the amount of hours I worked per week was prohibitive to their health insurance plan. "
good,The company itself is great. Free meal free drinks while working. 30% off merchandise. Free tuition to ASU online. But you're management is a make or break on the job.
good,"A typical day at work would entail clocking on, interacting with a variety of customers, and practicing/exercising teamwork with fellow Starbucks Partners. I learned, at this job, that, while I believe being disrespectful and impolite is downright distasteful, it is also a completely abhorred manner of dealing with people. The Management, in and of itself, is excellent. I speak mainly of the current manager of the Lakeside Starbucks, who is excellent in his treatment of employees, has an incredible patience for unpleasant customers, and works hard to make everyone's experience at his store excellent. However, some of the shift leads are very distasteful, rude, and verbally offensive. My co-workers tend to be nice, fun people, all sharing an ethically egoist mentality, caring for their good name alone. Being that I refuse to take part of this attitude, blame usually winds up on those of us who refuse to take part in buck-passing. However, I have work at a variety of different locations (covering shifts and what-not), and I have clearly seen that this mentality is not exclusive to my store. The hardest part of my job is cooperating with co-workers and shift leads who seek to put down one person to appear greater than they are, as this is a major characteristic among the majority of barista's I have worked with. The most enjoyable part of my job is making the customer happy and making drinks, as those two were my main reasons for desiring employment at the fine establishment in the first place."
good,its an okay place to work. flexible hours. easy job for college students. good atmosphere. good benefits if you work the amount of hours every week. you stay busy if the volume of customers are there
good,"Não tenho muito o que falar da Starbucks na parte da gerência, comunicação, ambiente de trabalho tudo ok, agora da parte administrativa rh tive vários problemas por isso não tenho boas recomendações."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of many things, working in drive-thru, front register, making drinks, sweeping, mopping, cleaning bathrooms, etc. "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is up beat majority of the time. My co-workers made it enjoyable.I learned that people are crazy for coffee in the morning.My co-workers were great to work except during morning rushes. Management was great, great team of leaders.The hardest part of the job was learning the drinks measurements.The music playing was the best part of the job."
good,"Starbucks in Target was a great place to work. I was there when it first opened, so I go to set it up, but I was also there when it closed, so I got to take it down as well. For the 2 years I worked there, I learned a lot and grew a lot. I was a great experience, and if it hadn't shut down, I would still be there."
good,it was a bit confusing because we were employed by Meijer but represented Starbucks. We followed both rules and it was a bit tough and confusing. Otherwise it was a fun place with lots of opportunities. I learned a lot and enjoyed my work.
good,"They treat their people well. Employees can create their own opportunities for growth up to the Store Manager level.  "
good,"My location was clean, organized and consistent."
good,"Starbucks provides a fast paced customer service oriented job place. The goal on any given day is to use the rote procedures to serve as many customers as possible with the optimum customer treatment. In practice it ends up being endlessly repetitive, somewhat stressful, and ultimately a little lacking in rewards. There are great benefits though, such as free healthcare and eventual stocks and PTO. For the most part other baristas have a good, positive attitude and are a blast to work with; management is welcoming overall, but somewhat stiff to change and entrenched."
good,"A typical day at work consists of cleaning and maintaining the appearance of the store, selling certain coffees, taking orders, processing payments, and assisting other partners with stocking the store. The management and coworkers were friendly and always made customers their priority. The hardest part of the job is getting things done during a rush. Its hard to step away to stock or clean when you have a long line of people and they always come first. I enjoyed the customers and I enjoyed serving them. I went to work happy every day."
good,"Very busy place to work, time goes by really fast."
good,"worked in one of the downtown Boston locations - they were going through changes - different managers, turnover which impacted the job"
good,"A great place to work at whether you are young or old. Great benefits, but the management tends to be a bit unorganized so you always have to go to them an check up on your schedule or any promos, etc. Very fast pace at times. This is a multitasking job."
good,"All and all it was a good place to work. Im not going to lie there were times i hated it. But i would quickly composed myself and keep on working. My coworkers were great and everyone seemed to get along great. Some of the customers were great, and some weren't but that happens in all customer service jobs."
good,"Starbucks had a nice, fast paced environment. It was full of great people, both the customer base as well as the other associates. "
good,This company provides lots of benefits for the staff and they are very interested in training apprentices up to become management level.
good,Fun place to work with great benefits. The people you work with can be some of the greatest you ever will although the customers can be annoying most times.
good,"working the drive thru taking orders, completing those orders, food prep, drink prep and money tendering.,Dealing with lots of different personalities, customers and co-workers.I have learned more about myself and how I handle pressure.  We have fun at work joking around but the customers always comes first. the hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace. The best part are the people I work with."
good,"very open work space and fun people to work with on a daily basis, relaxed culture, open minded people,"
good,"A typical day includes deep cleaning in the morning, keeping the cafe and bar area spotless. Serving customers, making coffee. "
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for.  I've been with the company for about a year and a half and have been able to advance fairly quickly, though room for advancement is limited in the area from this point out."
good,Starbucks was a fantastic job to have while completing school and starting a family. The shift work made it easy to schedule around other obligations.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes inventory counts, time management of all partners, and several customer interactions. It's a very fast paced environment. I learned several things from health code regulations, inventory management, and partner training. I supervised and insured the safety of co-workers and customers. The hardest part of this job was reinforcing quality standards and correcting action. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with diverse people and the joy I felt when a customer left my store happy because of the service they received."
good,"I was hired on the ""fast track"" to management because I had experience with management at Walmart and also Human Resource experience. "
good,"A typical day at work includes many personal interactions with customers throughout the day while preparing beverages and food items. You learn about many different types of coffees that come from all over the world. The best parts about working with Starbucks are the management and coworkers you're surrounded with while on duty; they're always very cooperative and cordial, which makes a day a work much more satisfying."
good,"Fun place, good benefits, free tickets. Serving food, Checking people out, Making sure the park is clean. Excellent customer service."
good,Starbucks has good benefits but poor compensation.  It is a fun place to work but at times can be stressful.  Your success is determined by your team.  Starbucks also has a strong belief on life balance.  As a manager you work 40 hours a week which is a great perk so you can make time for your family.
good,"I learned about motivated and training my team. Sometimes you worked 14 hours days 7 days a week nonstop due to call outs  Company overall has great benefits but definitely needs to work on life balance,."
good,It was great working as a shift supervisor. The team is what made the difference. I felt like we were part of the same team and with the same goals. It can be tough at times but the human interactions is what makes it all better.
good,"Some of the shifts started really early, but they also ended early. The job was nice until they implemented something called ""Playbook."" The shifts went from 6-8 hours down to 4 hours. This would've been fine if the pay was better, but it wasn't. So, it made driving to work seem pointless."
good,"The best part about this job is talking to the customers and making their day better. My co-workers are awesome, and we all work hard while still being able to have some fun. The hardest part about this job is keeping up the rigorous pace."
good,As the manager I try to make sure that my team is comfortable at work. We are making Drinks for the Guest and making a special connection with them by making your drinks. Being able to make the drinks and have that interaction with the guests everyday.
good,I work in a kiosk in a mall. Very busy will teach you how to utilize your time better also improving your customer service skills.
good,Everyday is busy and high energy. I learned about coffee and different brewing regions in depth.
good,"Fast pace, interaction with the public."
good,"I worked for Starbucks since 2010 and in that time I trained over 30 employees from entry level to management. I had been a supervisor there for almost three years in what was considered one of the busiest stores in the state of NY (excluding NYC). Starbucks caters to a wide array of applicants but mostly sees college students. It can be a great place to work when you have the right team, but when your team isn't up to par, it can be one of the most stressful jobs in the industry. I have had 3 store managers from the beginning of my employment until I left in 2014. There are always pros and cons to every job, when working here be ready for a fast paced work environment."
good,"I invested 2 years into the company but slowly started to grow unhappy working there. "
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a wonderful place to work. The salary and benefits package is good. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with your regular customers."
good,"Great company to work for, and spent many years with the company."
good,"Serving customers and keeping the store up to standards. I learned a lot about customer service and management of the store. With a high turnover, learning to adjust to different co-workers knowledge and managers different styles. As a supervisor I learned how to mediate upset customers and coworkers on a regular basis. I met so many wonderful customers and workers over my years there."
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, no hubo oportunidad de crecer en la empresa por cuestiones excentas al trabajo elaborado alli."
good,"Starbucks Coffee Co. provides great benefits for its employees. Work can sometimes be very overwhelming but it gives you the work experience you need if you ever pursue a different career. The most enjoyable part of this is that one can expand their network through day to day interactions with hundreds of people. Overall, it is a great company to work for."
good,"Customer service and talk to many new people"
good,"Great place to work if you need a part time job and also need health insurance, or are just starting out in the work force.  Word of warning though, depending on your location it could be difficult to get the 20hrs required for insurance unless you're willing to work at other locations."
good,"I over all loved working for this company but over time was not enough income to support my family, they should consider paying enough to live off of."
good,"Paid pretty well, benefits were good, schedule was reasonably flexible, fast-paced. Can be fun, depending on coworkers and store management."
good,"I have been with the company for a few years now. I have had the privilege of working up through the ranks to become a supervisor. It is a great job but, it is also a draining job. The hours are long and incredibly inconsistent. The managers are hit or miss. The upside is, the coworkers that you get are wonderful. They are like another family to you."
good,They business is great and it helps a number of different parties in a number of different stakeholders.
good,Starbucks is a great organizaiton however with limited CPG career progression available. I have learned to look across retail and CPG within a single organization.
good,"Great coworkers, nice customers, free drinks. Interesting atmosphere with regard to management."
good,"I enjoy working here because I seem to not only have a connection with my co-workers easily, but also the customers. Many regulars come in and it's as if we are more than just customer and server. The people make you enjoy and forget that you are actually working. I also love the fact that we get to create unusual beverages and explore more than just a cup of coffee."
good,Starbucks is a great company that consistently rewards performance and provides ample training and development.  The benefits were top notch but pay left a lot to be desired.  Freedom to schedule yourself and others but upper management picked on certain employees anytime a target was not met.
good,"As most jobs, it is usually understaffed.  The amount of work expected is very high versus the amount of time, labor, and compensation provided for doing so.  The team is great and very flexible, but usually very worn out from working so hard."
good,multitask and long work day but have fun with my co-workers because I am easy going and understanding that people I work with have different background. I respect everybody opinions and very open for feedback that it helps me to improve myself and my work.
good,"Love meeting all different kinds of individuals, it is a fast paced atmosphere that lets you be creative with your skills and cares about the customer"
good,"very fast pace environment, A very detailed training guidline for new barista. Approachable management team that encourages new ideas."
good,"constantly busy"
good,"A typical day consist of cleaning, making drinks and using a cash register that is a little slow."
good,I have learned to be very productive and successful. Coming in this company my time management was very bad but working here now has me focus and on time always for work. My manager is a wonderful person to work until. One of of my hardest issue working here was time and maintenance. The most enjoyable thing about my job is my customers i just love them. Customer made me in to another person and i love it.
good,"I worked here for a year, and made some of the best connections with people. I enjoyed the customers, and at times the work (though it could be hectic). "
good,"When things are going well this is a great place to work.  You are constantly being challenged and grown.  "
good,"operate filler machine, certified on 5 dfiferent machines as well as in other departments,new management staff have a little growing pains,some co workers have been with company since site was built.there really is nothing hard about the job that is what makes it enjoyable."
good,"Productive environment, good hours, and a great place to see new faces"
good,Company is out business and does not exist anymore. It was alright while it lasted. It basically came down to who you knew that would help you progress in the company not so much on your potential or accomplishments.
good,"A typical day at work in Starbucks for me will begin at 5:00 am to set up opening procedures for the store by making fresh coffee, ensuring closing procedures were done correctly & setting up cash registers for daily transactions. Also, making sure daily duty roster is filled in according to company standards and by completing inventory management . By 6:00 am the store is open for the public, I make sure all partners all deployed correctly to ensure we deliver a fast, clean, friendly environment for all customers making sure every food and beverage is made accurately to standards. I would say the hardest part of my job would be difficult customers and coworkers who are not following procedures to standards, but the most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with customers, coworkers and a wide range of people I meet on a daily basis due to the fact that I am in a very popular business and tourist area of New York City."
good,"I started my time as a barista in 2006, at a time when the company still felt fresh and vibrant, at least to me.  What I loved about the company back at the start was the feeling that one could actually contribute to the company's direction, be it products, policies, or just overall success.  There was a certain cachet to wearing the green apron back then, or at least it seemed so."
good,"Working at a Starbucks is great, depending on the store. My store is not a drive through so its not as hectic but I would compare it to more of a small cafe.  The partners (baristas) know most of the regulars and always try to strike up a conversation.  The hardest part of the job is knowing how to deal with difficult customers in a way that it does not harm the companies image and make them still take a good experience away from coming in to our store.  The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is the co-workers because you get to know their lives and you see them for a big chunk of your time."
good,It was a cool place to work but it was just too much to get a 3rd degree burn every other day!!
good,"Fun some of the time, but sometimes under staffed so we get rushed and a lot get nothing done"
good,"Take customers orders, work drive through, open and close store"
good,"Although I am only on a project base assignment, it was a lot of learning in a retail giant. Thanks for my colleagues that made the work environment awesome!"
good,"Working at Starbucks provided the opportunity to serve the public.  All of us at the store I worked at took great pride in learning the names of all of our regular customers and what preferred drink they would order.  Numerous times customers would ask me if I was the manager of the store; I felt this acknowledged my display of positive energy that I brought to work.  The hardest part of the job was my working with others who were much younger than myself and perceived me as a ""threat"" to their opportunity to advancement within the company.  Although this could create challenging situations overall I enjoyed my fellow workers and the TEAM experience that we shared."
good,There is no typical day at work. I have learned time management as well as stress management. I always have great co-workers. The hardest part is standing on your feet all day long . The most important part of the job is the teamwork and the connections that I make.
good,"les différentes années passées à STARBUCKS COFFEE FRANCE"
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. They offer great health and dental benefits. I love serving customers and building relationships/friendships with my coworkers. I enjoy serving the regulars who come into my store everyday! The fast pace environment encourages you to get the job done! My manager is very well rounded and only wants the best for her employees. I'm always willing to help her out and put in the extra work if necessary. It can get stressful but the love for the job makes it all worth it! The hardest part about working there is definitely keeping up with the safety standards during our peak times. The mornings are very chaotic and we have to use our time wisely in order to maintain a safe and clean work environment. But the most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build. You build relationships not only with customers but with your employees and the contractors who work alongside us. I thoroughly enjoy this job.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was making drink creations that would bring smiles to the customers faces. I worked the morning shift which was 5:30am to 10:30am. The customers were all regulars at that time so I really got to learn how they love their drinks and who they are. My co-workers were always a blast, as well. We always knew how to make each other smile and make the work day go a little quicker."
good,"I was hired in high school, and worked throughout my college studies. I had 5 different managers and all but one of them worked hard to work around my school schedule. I started as a barista and was promoted to shift manger. I learned a great deal about coffee, cash handling, team management, store security, cleanliness, and of course customer service. Over all, I had a great experience with the Starbucks Company."
good,"-handcraft a large number of drinks, cash handling and treat every customer as a friend. "
good,"Working for Starbucks was a great experience. It was hard work and the hours at times were grueling but i learned how to manage a store. I learned how to be responsible for money, time management and how to delegate tasks. The work environment was great. All staff got along and would go out after shifts. We became a family after a while. "
good,"Each day I would either open or close the store (keyholder). Get co-workers set up with their duties. Manage inventory and store machinery. I learned to be a better leader and time management. My manager was pretty cool. Same with the co-workers. Hardest part of the job had to be managing the staff. You get so busy doing your duties and running the rest of the store, you may forget to spread the duties. The best part would be the pay."
good,"Typical day includes providing exemplary customer service while keeping up with health and safety standards. Through my employment with Starbucks, I have learned a plethora of knowledge about customer interactions, managerial experience, payroll/scheduling, and product ordering. Co-workers are hit or miss, as some are unreliable to show up on time (or even at all), while others are very hard working and customer oriented."
good,"Making drinks to customer sastifaction, cleaning, customer service, meeting uniform/dress code requirements, punctuality"
good,"Friendly customers,great managers, fast pace environment,always steady"
good,"Working at Starbucks like any job has their pros and cons but overall can serve as a great learning experience and with great attitude you can work your way up. Its fun being a barista but you have to like to be up at the crack of dawn, deal with regular customers who expect exceptional service. Oh and working as a team, its something you have to learn to do. Overall, not a bad place to work the pay is good as long as you are working the right amount of hours. Tips also come in but working at a big store wont score you much. I do believe with the work done pay should be a little more. Also Free drinks, free mark outs each week is a huge plus."
good,"This job really is a job where you make it to be what fits you. There is, like with a lot of companies, a lot of politics to be seen and dealt with but it's a very upbeat company, a very fun and understanding company and gives you a great feel for what retail work is all about."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work in terms of always being busy, consistently having a challenge to tackle, and great hours for a student. Unfortunately, I worked for Starbucks during the time the business was struggling and many stores were shut down."
good,Day to day job was clearing tables and preparing beverages. Simple yet tiring at times.
good,"A typical day at work would start by preparing for the day whether it was preparing orders, answering phones, food rep, and miscellaneous sidework. "
good,"Collaborated with fellow partners in resolving invoice issues and answering invoice payment inquiries. Learned quickly SOR, Oracle and enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment when each issue was resolved."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks!! It was and always will be my favorite job. it has great benefits and the pay is pretty decent. there is plenty of room for growth with this company, However, if have a not so great manager, chances are your DM is WORSE and that's why I left the company."
good,I loved working for Starbucks. I loved my customers and co-workers to thee max!!! The hardest job was leaving for another job as Starbucks couldn't accommodate my hours and pay.
good,"A typical work day, would be taking orders from cars, taking orders"
good,At Starbucks I worked with an excellent team that had pride in the speed of our product as well as the great customer relationships developed.
good,It is a very fast pace environment work. I have learned a lot through my Starbucks journey. I have a team of 10 barista partners under me and they all are very co-operative and obeying.
good,"Concocted a variety of drinks, performed financial transactions, and provided exceptional customer service."
good,"I was hired as an opener, so of course I normally work mornings, and mornings are probably the busiest time of the morning. During my first 5-6 months of working there, I was positioned as a cashier, not getting much time to make drinks, though I was hired as a ""barista"". My manager is an external hire, so they never experienced being a barista and worked their way up. They are not the best at their job, although is seems like they are trying somewhat hard. Though, there are a few partners who were able to support me my first half-year at Starbucks, and I appreciate their coaching and support. The most difficult part of this job is our whole crew not being able to be trusted by the store manager. But I still enjoying making customers' days in the morning."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is trying new drinks and then selling them to the customers and getting that first hand experience!
good,"My days started quite early with time to set the store up before the morning rush. This was a fast-paced environment, serving customers from start to finish in about five minutes or less. I enjoyed meeting and chatting with customers, many of whom were regulars on a daily basis. and getting to build a relationship with our customer base. I learned a great deal about time-management and the ability to create a friendly and welcoming environment for customers while still maintaining the need to multi-task and complete tasks in an efficient and timely matter. The hours were a bit difficult, needing to be there at 5 a.m., but the day moved quickly and there was a strong sense of team effort."
good,"Open the store then service customers.."
good,"Easy shifts, good coworkers, taught a skill that I will remember forever"
good,"From sun up to sun down rushes come and go, but the employees are great and customers are just as great.  You can start your day at 4:30 in the morning and set up and start making the coffee or you can close and break everything down and get everything clean for the next day. Absolutely love being a barista and getting make new beverages.  Sometimes you will have to help with inventory or do sales marketing and team coffee tasting."
good,Nice place to work.flexible timing. great working co-workers.
good,"at that work I had the best time of my life,i learned  a lot I started as junior till I became in managerial position,i learned how to deal with people and colleagues,how to work in front and back office,sometimes the work was hard for me because I was new in management but was very funny work."
good,"Starbucks was a great job to get me through college, and that is exactly what I used it for. Starbucks was fast paced, and gave me the experience with people I needed. I enjoy coffee, so Starbucks was a fun atmosphere to work in."
good,"Starbucks is overall a great company to work for. While employed there I found that it is difficult to advance and many people who had been there for years had not been given an opportunity to be promoted. The benefits are great though as far as medical dental and eye care, and the the discount and markouts are great as well. "
good,"Great job to have while in school."
good,Teamwork is imperitive.  Enjoy engaging with the community.  
good,"Had a 10+ years career with Starbucks I found very satisfying. The last two years was a different story, several changes in managers and directors only the end with the dept. being outsourced"
good,"A typical day at work was mentally trying and also immediately rewarding . The training was efficient , quick , and to the point . There were many steps in the creation process that provoked an "" after work "" concern which can help with work performance."
good,Fun team atmosphere with great flexibility for personal needs.
good,"was a very laborious job but was a steady job, found it though a local temp agency in carson city nv,"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for. But it is demanding. You'll have extremely early mornings, rude customers, and long days on your feet. But it is stable and provides benefits."
good,"Fast past sales environment with challenging goals, but fantastic bonuses."
good,"the regulars are amazing, the hours can be rough....but hey, you get coffee right?"
good,Upon clocking in you go right into getting a register and providing a legendary experience for our guests. You find yourself surrounded by amazing people. The hardest part of the job is the fact that people are sometimes not always nice. The most enjoyable part was creating friendships with guests and you get to drink awesome coffee.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They are pretty stingy with promotions and consistently expect top performance without much giving back. However, the overall experience is fun. You learn alot about product, selling and customer experience. The pay isn't very high and you have to kind of fight for hours. They have their own code as far as the way business goes, but there isn't much accountability as far as the management goes. You are also on your feet alot which may be difficult and because your hours are all over the place, it tends to wear on you. If you can handle the busy go go go, this is a great job."
good,I most enjoy meeting and greeting customers.
good,"Great company with great values for customer service. Low pay and low appreciation from upper management. Company is good about ""spitting"" on those who have been around for a long time and rather hire from outside the company than promote innerly."
good,"A typical day consisted of a few typical busy periods due to the morning rush and lunch time rush. I learned how to multi task, to keep calm and focused in busy fast paced environments. All of my coworkers were continually positive and enjoyable to work with. All employes saw the work environment as a team collaboration. The manager continually failed to meet store supply needs. This lead to the employees not having necessary supplies in which to make a customers desired beverage, and upset quite a bit of customers, which lead to harsh outbursts directed at the employee."
good,The leaders of the company are brilliant but the middle management is clueless. The district I worked in hardly ever promoted within. The whole company policy of promoting baristas to shift supervisors to management to corporate NEVER happened. All managers were hired from outside the company and the district managers never worked a day on the floor as a barista.
good,Starbucks is definitely a good company to work for besides the potential of advancement considering the hire up positions will never be vacant. Managers tend to have a line of people waiting for positions (including new hires and rehires) so starbucks is a difficult company to move around in.
good,Perfect for students who are looking for a job. Flexible hours and you can pick up hours at different stores. Tips are also great.
good,"I got trained how to work & clean the register, oven, espresso machines. I am certified to train new employees. I enjoyed meeting new people. I have worked with some very diverse individuals."
good,Over the last few years Starbucks has been great comany to work for.
good,I love working for Starbucks. You meet a lot of great people. However the work is not very challenging.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Starbucks and learned a lot working here. I worked a lot, too. It would be incredibly hard to do now that I have a child. I love the culture, values, and I happened to have great, supportive managers. I had a great team and great customers."
good,I would take the orders for drive thru and make the drinks and handel the money. Loved it but left for school
good,"This Starbucks location has to be the busiest one in San Diego. I learned how to work fast, worked with great people and the hours were pretty flexible. And I love coffee!"
good,"I like starbucks and they have awsome benefits, though i work at a store where the store manager is like a regular employee and doesnt take on the responsibility that she should. the stores turn over rate has sky rocketed since she took over. after years of the same people i am now the only one left at this store. everyone else is new and our csi score is down to the 70's when it was always in the 90's"
good,"Overall, the two years I worked with the Starbucks Corporation as a barista in one of their stores were good years. The environment is very welcoming and the company makes an effort to be all inclusive and treat employees respectfully. For example, even part time employees are able to buy stock in the company, therefore it's customary for Starbucks to refer to its employees as ""partners"" and not ""employee"" or ""co-worker."" The customers are also very much into the ""third place"" concept -- being that this is not a customer's job or their home, but that other place they go to unwind and relax. So, dealing with customers a majority of the time is a pleasure. Benefits package is generous and the compensation is very much so as well. You get holiday pay, bonus if you're scheduled more than 7 days in a row, paid vacation days and even weekly tips in addition to your hourly wage (which starts off above min. wage). In need to pick up a shift or two, you can call any other store in the area and offer your services if there's a shift available. You plan on moving, if there's a Starbucks in your new locale, you can request a transfer to it or one closer to it. The only downside is over the last couple of years, Starbucks has been closing stories and cutting budgets. More tasks, less hours to do them in with fewer ""partners"" on staff. Towards the end of my time with the company, my hours went from five days, 28-32 hours per week down to a mere 3 days 16-18 hours per week. Eventually, I was cut... and the store closed about a year later."
good,I loved the fast pace environment and interacting with the customers and getting to a personal level with them by remembering their name and drinks.
good,"This is a really great job. The only problems I've ever had have been due to terrible management. I've often encountered managers who were not meant to manage in the food service industry, thus creating a lack of organization and communication. Whenever I've worked at a store with good management and good communication, it's been a pleasure to work there!"
good,Usually a weekday morning can be tough for the customers so we try our best to make a personal experience along with the beverage.
good,"The job itself was easy; drink memorization, cleaning, and cashier. Were all very easy tasks. The team was always spot on and great to work with, new management however was not as stellar. And the abuse we took from customers just was not worth the pay."
good,"It is a good place to work, I have learned how to make all the drinks we sell, I help the new hires with learning some of the tricks that make us good baristas and I like to try and have fun there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the regulars who are absolute sweethearts, they love it when they can walk in and we have their drinks either already being made or at least in the line to be made."
good,"Starbucks is still a good company to work for, but they have lost their focus on what got them started as a company, people. Moving up is very difficult, and goals often arbitrarily change. The benefits make it more worthwhile, with stock options, health insurance, a 401k plan, and many other perks."
good,"Fun and fast paced work environment. This company is definitely concerned with community affairs and giving back. Great place for students to work, one of the only companies I know of who offers full benefits to part time employees."
good,Starbucks takes care of employees. Loved meeting the people I work with. Management doesn't always help employees as they should when short staffed. Overall decent company to work for
good,"Great health care, as well as decent pay. You get paid vacation time and sick time off... Starbucks also build great work ethics so even when you leave the job you can use the tools you’ve learned moving forward"
good,This is a very basic work experience. It is what you make of it. Either it can just be a coffee shop job or it can be so much more. Opportunity can be found in the most basic of actions through out the day; it all boils down to mindset.
good,"During my year and a half with the company, I've work for two locations.  The first was challenging because the management was constantly changing and the culture within the store was competitive and singular making the overall experience more difficult."
good,"Working there was great, the people are great. customers were an amazing experience. Management just wasn't about their employees. When it came to school they were always so flexible though."
good,"very helpful in terms of benefits, starbucks is a very supporting and inclusive community, however I don't love how corporate they function. It can be hard to be personable with relationships and establish a comfort within the job."
good,"À l'américaine. Très bonne boîte, mais laisse très peu de place à une vie de famille."
good,It was a good place to work at the time. I loved getting all the free drinks and the people were nice. If your co-workers are good then work is good. It's up to you to make it a nice place to work.
good,Worked at a very busy Starbucks well-comish liked the pace liked the staff. The management was definitely bias if they didn't prefer you. Got great shifts just butted heads with the manager but got along great with the ASM while she was gone for about 3 months.
good,This was a fun work place for a first job. I enjoy learning how to work fast pace in a overwhelming environment. Kemah boardwalk is a very busy place and you have to know how to work efficiently.
good,"A typical day was being on the floor where needed, helping each other. However if one person could not keep up then the whole process was slowed making work more difficult. I learned how to be a flexible worker and how to manage my time and materials."
good,"The workplace culture at Starbucks is very welcoming and diverse; however, there are many times I feel that I lack purpose. I do pretty much everything at the job that people refuse to do or tasks that aren't consistently done as they should be regulated by standards. I do not feel as though I could advance any more in my job but there is little to no opportunity to do so in my district, and I feel the monotonous drag start to come on. I love the food we provide and how the job allows for each individual to succeed in their own manner with their handcrafted beverages."
good,"A typical day at work at Starbucks was amazing, I feel like everyone I worked with was a friend and coming to work was really fun for me. The workload itself was insane at times, but the environment and what I was doing made it worth it."
good,"Overall I enjoyed being part of the team. They have a good supportive team culture. "
good,The culture was great when it came to majority of the customers and the other baristas. My work schedule was flexible. I loved talking to everyone and building a connection.
good,"Worked hare for a few years and it was a good job for a college student. Not really a good enough job if you have a lot of bills and a family, but for a single person it was a good job."
good,"Really just depends on the management, but it seemed like our manager valued customers more than employees and pushed that we get customers through the drive through as quick as possible to the point where it was not a good experience for either customer or employee. Otherwise, you get valuable customer service skills, great benefits, making drinks is fun, and usually good coworkers."
good,"Starbucks has taught me many new and intriguing skill sets. I know a lot about drinks and especially learning how to cope with people. Working at Starbucks you have to have great customer connection and support. I’ve learned to have patience and satisfy every customer in any way I can. A happy customer can lead to many rewarding things, especially starting with self growth. I’ve learned in Starbucks and will continue to learn and strive."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks. Once I had been trained it was easy to integrate myself into the work environment. My colleagues were always friendly and helpful, and I wasn't afraid to ask for direction when I needed it."
good,working at starbucks is very fun but yet productive. It shows you great time management skills as well as amazing communication skills. There were always days where it felt like the company was treating its employees like garbage. There was many days where we would be understaffed and the district and store manager would just say oh well.
good,Starbucks is a good company when giving a chance to advance within the company. They are also flexible with scheduling. They treat their customers with the upmost respect and continue to uphold their reputation.
good,I was with the company for 4 years. I enjoyed my customers and work environment. However I had to move on in order to support me and my son. I miss my co workers and customers very much
good,A typical day at work is very busy and fast paced. Can often get stressful but a key skill that everyone develops is working under pressure and under stress. The environment is very fun and feels like a home to most employees. Great benefits as well
good,starbucks is very flexible for students looking for a part time job while in school. Good environment and a great place to make friends that you work with!
good,"Highly recommend for students especially. Flexible hours, easy standardized work,  helpful coworkers and usually good management. Definitely not a bad place to work."
good,"This was a fast paced, high stress environment, but it was also one of the best jobs I've ever had. Customers can be finicky about their coffee, but as long as you remember that you're just serving coffee, it's really not a terrible place."
good,"Who would have known that there would have been so much product knowledge to learn with just 1 cup of coffee, but a lot more goes into that cup. You  learn the different brews of coffee and pairings that best bring out the flavors. If you are an early bird and like the morning rush with regulars who are always excited to see you, this is the environment for you."
good,"Loved being a barista. Just my coworkers wasn’t comforting. I worked twice as hard but If i did anything to upset a manager, my hours were cut. Connecting with customers were the best part"
good,"Its a fun environment and I can easily re energize from the endless coffee supply, but customers are so impatient and hardly ever tip us. What I hate is that we don't get credit tips. No one carries cash with them so we hardly get anything at the end of the week. I'd be a lot happier if I made more money. People don't realize how exhausting it can be to work all day and then not be able to support yourself at home."
good,"When I first started working at Starbucks, all the other employees welcomed me and did not have a problem with me asking questions and teaching me how to be as efficient as possible."
good,"I was employed at a Target Starbucks so technically I was a Target employee. It was a great environment and the training process was difficult due to complexity of products but all in all I loved it. Unfortunately, I had to suddenly leave due to a medical emergency but I would definitely go back"
good,Starbucks is a busy place. You have to have ambition and a want to be there. Its not for everyone but if you work hard then you'll succeed there. There are a lot of rules but easy rules.
good,This job can be difficult but most of the time it’s fun to be there. My coworkers are really fun to be around and the customers are nice for the most part.
good,This company is a great place to work and it’s specially for people who loves Starbucks . It’s also great place to receive full time and they provide Great benefits
good,Upper manager doesnt create the same culture as you would in your own store. You are expected to make everyone feel good and confident in their role yet you don't get that in return
good,"Overall, a solid place to work if you are looking for a supporting income. Systems and processes are in place that provide good structure. Management is typically overworked. Surely staff experiences vary store-to-store, but generally a really fun work environment."
good,I've learned how to work well under pressure in a very fast paced setting. All of my coworkers and I get along great and we began hanging out outside of work. We get to know our regular customers and have fun working together even when there is chaos in the cafe.
good,I liked the environment of working at Starbucks because it was good and easy work that was fun and light-hearted. It was always good to connect with customers and get to know the regulars and talk with different people.
good,"Starbucks is one of the best jobs i've had, not only do you build relationships with employees; you make good friends with your customers. Very fast paced but worth it."
good,"Pay is not good."
good,Its a really nice company to work for a first part time job its reallly fast paced but overall very welcoming and interesting partners you learn to be more polite and work as a team
good,At time it feels like there is a lot of work but the coworkers and the customers that come in make the work place fun. Seeing regular customers come in and talking to them is enjoyable it feels more like you are getting paid to just engage in conversation with people. It never really is about the food or drinks you are serving there it is all about making connections with the people who come in and making them feel welcomed.
good,"If you want to find many like-minded, young, career driven coworkers then give it a go. Once you have passed the three month mark is when the fun begins. People will see your competency and want to hang out outside of the store. "
good,"Unfortunately, Starbucks just doesn’t pay the most in the world which is why I’m seeking furthering my employment else where. I enjoy the customer emphasis but most times it seems too stressful for the compensation"
good,Great for part time or college students. Love my job but wish I could make more. If you gave a good store with wonderful employees then the work will be great. Def a job for extroverts
good,"While Starbucks can seem notorious it isn't all too different from most jobs. If you keep your head centered, you can accomplish a lot while making peoples' mornings. However like any other workplace, ego is a BIG part of the culture and about 1/4 of the experience is catering to people (customers and usually management). I saw people moving up who usually learned how to keep their mouth shut and press on forward through tough days and strange hour cutting. There is never a shortage of things to do, so if you like the keep on your feet and move around (like me) this can be a good face paced job. While making drinks for hours and hours can seem overwhelming, the culture is supportive and there is a pride one can take while crafting beverages. I've worked at many coffee shops (independent and corporate) and Starbucks was the highest in overall quality and cleanliness standards. This job will press some of your buttons, but if you are up for a coffee flavored challenge, this job can lead to some nice opportunity."
good,"What you see as a customer of Starbucks, is about what you get as an employee.  Fast paced work environment makes the days go quickly, but rude customers are standard."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks, the staff were very friendly and organised and the overall role was enjoyable."
good,Not much I have to say about starbucks. I like working . and the fact i have a job. Its can be a fun environment and also stressful. But manageable. Thanks
good,This place would be great because of the benefits the offer except that they are ok with everyone and anyone going into their stores and disrupting the paying customer experience. They are too welcoming to everyone including people who hang out to only use the bathrooms. They know most incidents happen at night bu cut payroll at night risking employee safety to protect the morning rushes. I am sure their corporate office allows vagrants walking in to use their restrooms (that's sarcasm).
good,"A really good job as a barista, however as you move up you see a lot more stress. There is a lot of expectations placed on shift supervisors and managers. This stems from a lack on understanding from the people in corporate who have never worked a customer service job and don't understand what the reality of the regulations they put in place entail and the repercussions on the customers and employees."
good,"Coworkers were great but overall experience was very overwhelming and not great. Making drinks was fun and I enjoyed the workplace when we were not understaffed. Good perks(free Spotify premium, free drinks during shifts, 30% off while not working, free lb coffee beans a week)."
good,"- Engaging, interacting, and building relationships with customers."
good,"I worked at starbucks for a year in Carmel and I loved it. However, we constantly had an issue with managers leaving and having new ones brought in. But, it was fun and exciting to constantly be making drinks and serving the community."
good,A fun team of partners to work with! Starbucks is fast-paced and great for accommodating students in university. They also have great benefits and opportunity for growth within the company.
good,"Good place to work and grow."
good,"Absolutely great company. One bad manager is not the whole company but aside from that it's a fantastic place to work!   "
good,Dynamic atmosphere with lots of coffee! Lots of fun and fast paced. Great flexibility of shifts. Fantastic discounts and perks on merchandise. Great place to work.
good,"People here is nice but after work is tiring"
good,"It's a really great first job as it teaches you all of the basic work skills (urgency, teamwork, communication, cash handling, customer service). I would recommend it to anyone that is in high school/college. "
good,I work for a licensed store so I'm sure about the corporate benefits and such. I love making the customers happy and am extremely good at it! Thanks Starbucks for making it fun.
good,"Nice environment depending on location. Enjoyed being able to help customers with their individual needs. Hardest part was morning rush, summers during ""Frappy Hour"" and when you make a drink wrong some people don't react in the nicest way possible."
good,Must be able to remember recipes to all drinks. Coworkers most likely become like family. Customers come very often getting the same thing so it's easy to complete tasks/orders quickly.
good,"It has been some time since I worked for Starbucks, but I wanted to leave all my past employers reviews to help people when job searching. I enjoyed this job when I was 16 years old. As I got older and more experienced I did realize I was doing a lot for little pay, but at least it was super fun. We got really good discounts and a lot of free drinks and food items. Management was always changing, but I was young so it didn't really matter to me."
good,"Throughout my experience at Starbucks, I appreciated everyone I worked with because they made the environment so comforting and very welcoming. The first year and a half I made so many friends and had a deep rooted love for all that Starbucks stood for and loved my time there. Although, as time passed, things were not being communicated well and people would have mixed feelings about each other and the job became a toxic workplace."
good,"Eye loved working there and still miss it occasionally! The work is fast paced and, usually, your coworkers are pretty kind and knowledgeable! It’s great for someone who needs flexibility and likes to pick up shifts for others."
good,"Working at Starbucks helped me build on my character and it gave me different views on people, also helped me to understand and handle different situations"
good,"Overall the experience there was amazing. Great co-workers, understanding with class schedule. The only complaint I had was that I wish we had more business and I was able to do my job more often than I did."
good,"Typically, a work day at Starbucks is a quick, fast paced flow requiring  constant work and responsibilities to deliver a personal customer experience to each person that comes in for a coffee. Keeping track of sales inventory, daily goals, and records keeping in a log book as well as delegating tasks between employees and running breaks when able to without disrupting the workflow. "
good,It was nice job to have while I was younger. Wonderful work atmosphere very friendly staff. All you have to do is keep a strong mind and everything else will fall into place
good,"it was enjoyable to work there however my store had a lot of personality issues as well as managerial issues, which is what lead me to leaving the company. However, overall it was a good place to come to wok and it was always enjoyable."
good,"J’ai aimé travailler avec eux , une bonne expérience"
good,"While working at Starbucks I was able to develop a lot of skills that will be applicable to jobs in the future. The team members have to (and do) cooperate to ensure that we can deliver our best customer service to our customers. This is required at all times regardless of certain scenarios we are put in whether we are understaffed or exceptionally busy. In my experience, my store manager exhibited a number of traits that would be helpful in many jobs i.e. being supportive, keeping up employee moral and practicing open communication so everyone's voice is heard. I believe the most difficult part of this job is your ability to multitask and stay focused while producing excellent & accurate customer service. With that being said, the most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with your team members and customers. Although it sounds cliche, relationships like this in the work place really is what kept me coming to work motivated and smiling. The atmosphere from Starbucks is unlike any other job I have had!"
good,最主要的工作是幫助店內運作順暢，控制貨量和人手。帶領同事進行日常運作 主動去幫助有需要的客人解決問題
good,"Working for the company is great, a lot of perks and the job it's self is fantastic. However one bad gear can bring the entire store to a grinding halt. There is no such thing as ""Full Time"", Only Full Time Availability and can be cut down considerably at any moment. "
good,"There is always a lot to learn. I really do love the ability to make connections with customers and coworkers alike. "
good,SO stressful but it’s fun sometimes. Customers are rude but it’s whatever. So much to do and gets super busy after 4PM and in the mornings. Everyone always gets stressed out
good,"Good first time job, but cannot see a career working for starbucks. Decent training, good benefits, good coworkers, management can be iffy depending on your store location."
good,Working at Starbucks was one of the best jobs I had since graduation. It was fun to understand the process of becoming a barista and helping customers.
good,"It was tough memorizing all of the recipes for both espresso drinks and the cold bar. There are lots of moving pieces to this job and it's extremely fast paced. Be ready to learn a lot, be challenged a lot, and work tough hours. The morning shifts were very early in the morning."
good,"Great environment day to day, loved engaging with my team and customers.  Stressful work environment with minimal partners to support the business at times.  Can easily be overwhelming with how your supposed to manage the store and the demand for performance and labor reduction year to year."
good,"I was pleased as a Batista for the better part of two years. I however,  did not enjoy the quantity of store managers nor the way certain aspects were overlooked."
good,"Each store is different but SBUX has been pushing through new changes. My current manager is a hypocrite and she doesn't know to deal with certain situations at all. "
good,"Starbucks is always busy, esp the one I work at. When I first started management was terrible, but my co-workers were cool and reliable. Our customers weren't always the nicest people either. But the perks and pay aren't bad."
good,"The people are great, the customers sometimes great, and the work is challenging and constantly changing. It demands a lot of multitasking abilities, you start off slow and build up speed overtime if you don't quit due to the rough shifts during peak."
good,"Some of the nicest and hardworking individuals of my career.  Employer really make you feel valued and always giving back to employees/partners.  Sorely lacking in mentorship and career-pathing and development for some work stream employees,"
good,"I had a store manager that did not want the best for her shift managers. She constantly made us uncomfortable, chose favorites, and failed to show up. The team was wonderful, however. Diverse and lovely, I miss them all the time. You will work hard, but you have the chance to show up and make a difference every day. I would like to see corporate to start working as hard as their everyday retail employees. I don't think they understand how difficult it is to open a store at 3:30 am."
good,"Starbucks offers really good benefits, including tuition benefits to Arizona State University. It's one of the reasons I started applying for locations in my area. If you're a morning person, or someone who likes high pressure, fast paced environments like myself then the morning shift is perfect for you. If you don't like to get up until after noon and you like things more relaxed then the night shift is a better fit. You can start out as a barista and work your way up to management if you have ambition. I just wish there were more hours or higher pay. It's really hard to pay my bills."
good,"The best part of working for Starbucks was getting to know the regular customers, building and maintaining those relationships really made me feel like I was apart of a community. This made my overall experience at Starbucks very enjoyable and rewarding. I learned how to multitask and sequence drinks which was a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was using my own personal judgement to base if a customer was not following our third home rule and what to do in those situations. I learned how to go at those problems in a unbiased way and how to take action while representing the company."
good,"Le travail chez Starbucks est très intense et varié."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. What really made it for me was the fun group of people and the relaxed atmosphere. The only complaint I had about the work environment was my manager. A typical day at work was fast-paced and relaxed at the same time. I learned a lot about time management, punctuality, and how to work as a team. The culture was so chill and all of my fellow baristas were really cool people. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the different drinks and dealing with my manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely my awesome coworkers and the overall atmosphere of the store."
good,"starbucks was a good company to work for but the management was very poor which resulted in me leaving. Apart from this, i enjoyed my time at starbucks."
good,"fun place to work, but not enough pay for the state of California. cannot live off of the salary in this state had to educate myself to advance my career and make a good living"
good,"We had a new manager that didn't really know what he was doing, but he tried and was very nice. I would have kept working there but had to move. It was a fun, sometimes stressful, fast paced place."
good,"Working as a  Barista, you learn a great deal for example increasing your team work skills. This is a fast pace environment where team work is definitely required."
good,"I’ve been a barista for almost two years (two stores) There’s only one manager per store which means they’re really tough and love to micromanage. Starbucks has a set of standards that make the job go smoothly,  and ease communication and problem solving. It’s easy to advance to shift supervisor if you work hard enough and there’s free coffee!."
good,"Work schedule is quite flexible while workplace varies between each store.  I've worked at three different store locations and most partners are quite inviting and sociable.  Work as usual is sometimes stressful depending on the time you work and the customers you come across, but other than that it's typical of a Starbucks store."
good,"It is a happy place to work, but it is not a good place for job advancement. People don't move around too much, meaning everyone are quite knowledgeable about the company and their job . Department heads changes every few years, making it hard to adjust to leadership direction and expectations. Can be confusing some times. Learnt a lot about design for business instead of only from aesthetic's point of view, which helps me to think about design from other perspectives. People are nice and friendly."
good,"Uma otima oportunidade para crescimento medio prazo, com uma cultura de inclusão muiyo interessante, mas esta se estruturando para atender a demanda de expansão."
good,"I was on the opening team and a typical day for me was always busy since we were located right by a freeway. I learned how to multitask, how to manage time and how to prioritize important tasks that needed to be done before you were off. Management was always accessible. Work culture was great. Hardest part of the job is you have to be quick and have a great memory to make sure customer experiences are the best. Best part of the job was building relationships with repeat customers and coffee!"
good,"excellent perks with average pay, works best as a part time gig with school or a second job. Requires constant walking on feet and repeated bending. Pays for college at ASU."
good,"Very busy at times. Lots of multitasking. If you have a good team, you will feel supported and everyone helps each other out. Opportunities for development are available."
good,"Was fast paced, always a fast shift, never really had a bad day there. Management was for a licensed location, where training and staffing were not as solid as a corporate location, but otherwise had a good Barista experience"
good,"When I worked at Starbucks I spent most of my time working in the food court of a busy mall. It was a tight space, fast paced, and left little room for error. I found it stimulating but not difficult, and had enough foot traffic that I never got bored at work."
good,"I very much enjoyed this job role. I learnt a great deal of skills, including customer service, time management and teamwork. I would recommend others to work there."
good,"Low pay, fun atmosphere, constantly on your feet."
good,"Working for Starbucks gave me a lot of mixed emotions. The work is very easy after about a week due to all the new information you have to take in. It's taught me very much about how to work quickly and effectively. Iv'e also met some amazing people as both my co-workers and customers who I've gotten close to and nothing really beats getting free coffee multiple times a day!The hardest part about this job is most definitely the management. There is a serious lack of personal responsibility and the well being of the baristas seems to be something forgotten. I've seen it in every store in my district where things are neglected and the SM's don't see it because of how little time they actually spend in the stores. It's very hard for them to help us if they're not around and, in my experience, they don't seem to be interested in changing it."
good,I had little to no life balance at this job. My boss was really hard on me and viewed many of my actions as things to overcome. The people were fantastic and the customers were even better.
good,"Stores should be paid based on volume. I was in the busiest store in the state and got paid the same as a barista in a slow store. If I make 150 latte's in a day I should be paid more than someone only making 30 in a day. Do more, get more."
good,The structure is very fast paced and you have to keep up with everyone's pace and find a good rhythm of taking orders and making drinks. Its important to stay focused on multiple tasks at a time.
good,"A great work environment and opportunity to work on a team. You learn and gain communication and interpersonal skills. Depending on your location, work days may always be busy and high-intensity while others may be slower and provide you the opportunity to focus on the culture of the job."
good,"Although the rush hours can be stressful, depending on the store, the activities can be rotated and that lets you relax a little bit. As long as there is good communication, there shouldn't be a problem. It is just a matter of constant training and meeting expectations."
good,"Great work-life balance in schedules and time off, and great coffee available everywhere in the building. Community focused and community service is stressed for teams to give back."
good,"I love atmosphere there and people. I was learning a lot. Starbuck has a diffrent coulture where people are the most important. The company care about you and your needs, you can develop yoyurself."
good,Indeed suddenly required this even though I just need to apply to stuff so I have to fil lit up with 150 characters at least- anyways it's just a standard do what needed with good staff/people.
good,"Not much room for advancement unless you tick the perfect boxes. Lots of promises, not a lot of follow through. "
good,Each day was fun and productive. I love the communication with the customers. The management could have been better but I feel like it’s been getting better from an outside view
good,"It's actually a pretty decent job. Pay is good, benefits are pretty ok, customers can make your life a living nightmare if you're not careful. However, my team was solid and we had each other's back through thick and thin"
good,They never mind whether you have an experience of Barista. So you’ll be taught how to work at there gently and used it soon. The salary is good enough and holidays are more than 20 days available.
good,Starbucks works well with students. So if that is your reason for working with them it’s a benefit. Otherwise pretty minimum pay and sometimes it can get clique-y with sups depending on where you work.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for part timers as they are very flexible with school schedules. Its very important to know that work places care about their employees education and place that as a priority
good,"Fast pace and stressful during peak times. After the most busiest times, work environment was relaxed and fun. Made some real friendships with consumers and coworkers"
good,"I had a lot of fun working here. Even though considered my co-workers friends, we were hard efficient workers. Manager was flexible and knew how to run a business."
good,"Day at work: "
good,"I would give starbucks a  4/5 stars because of how well I was treated there as well as the training I had. Overall good experience customers were very nice and came almost everyday if they were regulars, the staff around me knew what they were doing also which made things very easy when it became busy."
good,i learned how to work in a competitive restaurant and amazing people skills while making coffee. i enjoyed being around different kinds of people and understanding the preferences of different people.
good,"Working at Starbucks was amazing but the reason for me leaving was because we had got a new store manager and I felt like we were underpaid. Minimum wage to deal with people yelling and getting mad over their drinks, people coming in aggravated and with a bad attitude. Also the new store manager was terrible. Whenever the old manager got a promotion the store just plummeted when the new manager started working. When I say everyone stopped working there. I mean everyone!"
good,"Starbucks is a very fast-paced job. At first, it's very overwhelming but becomes very rewarding once one has a grip on what they are doing. Coworkers are very friendly and supportive. Managers and shift leads are very understanding of one's needings and supporting the baristas. Starbucks has a very family vibe to their coworkers, hence why Starbucks employees are called ""partners""."
good,They strive to create a welcoming atmosphere for both its customers and employees. High turnover. Opportunity to get involved with volunteer work and district coffee events.
good,"Difficult to move up with company. Good company to work for. Great benefits and employees."
good,"Starbucks, you learn to communicate be with customers on a different level, its wholesome and has amazing benefits. Everyday is different and a new experience, you are able to rely on others for help and a new lesson every time your stuck. "
good,"Starbucks is fun place to work. The job challenges you to work quickly in a team work environment."
good,"Great company, multiple benefits, strengthen people skills, gives the ability to be creative through latte art and display of merchandise. Management can be supportive, dependable on the person's character."
good,"Overall you get some great perks, benefits and good pay. Your experience will totally depend on the store you run and your district manager. DM's fill a relatively useless role in most respects, just following up and enforcement really. Trouble is most DM's have never run a store, only received 8 weeks of in-store training and often have to work for extremely difficult regional directors. Of course this isn't in every case, but there is a very big external management hiring problem."
good,"great work environment fast paced, built relationships with customers."
good,Its a great company to work with. There are a lot of opportunities that you need to ask about. You will learn a lot about different task skills and learn how to be a team player.
good,"You will learn how to develop skills in costumer service, sales, cleaning, organization, time management and how to work under pressure. "
good,"I did enjoy working at Starbucks, the culture was great and the job was fun. Working along side the people I did helped to to form friendships and working relationships that I will hold onto for some time."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for over a decade and I've seen the company change drastically. The more ""make the moment right"" attitude is instilled, the more entitled customers become. My love and passion for coffee and connection has depleted so much because of how some customers have treated me and other partners. Overall, working for Starbucks is great. It's full of learning opportunities and growth."
good,"Starbucks is a workplace with competitive benefits ,such as matching up to six percent towards your 401k, 'Bean Stock', approximately ten shares given to partners at time of hiring that vest and are able to reap those benefits after two continuous years of employment. If applicable, Starbucks offers health insurance, tuition compensation at Arizona State University Online, and free beverages throughout your shift--discounts on drink-ware is also given to Starbucks Partners. Starbucks if a fast-paced environment with plenty to learn about: beverage quality, properly preparing beverages efficiently, cleaning regulations, the propagation of relating to customers and relying on your team as a whole to get the job accomplished thoroughly, through continued education on-the-job, always with dignity and respect for yourself and for your fellow partners. Starbucks cultivates competent workers with communicative skills as well as efficient beverage crafting that you will hardly find anywhere else, solely due to the volume that Starbucks demands. Starbucks compensates with a competitive starting wage around $9/hour, but unfortunately you cannot omit certain privileges/benefits for a higher hourly wage. Baristas and Shift Supervisors are required to work together to make the Starbucks experience run as smoothly as possible for everyone involved. The Starbucks culture is to create inspirational moments, innovate solutions, and off-the-cuff decision making--one cup, one interaction, one neighborhood at a time."
good,"It was alright working at Starbucks at first, but seeing how things are behind the scenes and the management I had just wasn’t appropriate for me. The way things were prepared and washed, and the way some baristas made their drinks and food just weren’t up to customers standards and I didn’t want to be apart of it."
good,If I could have worked out my school schedule I wouldn't have likely left . Very fulfilling work that helped improve my public speaking and problem resolution.
good,You need to be able to keep up when things get busy. You will be placed in every position on the work floor and need to be able to do each role with speed and efficiency.
good,starbucks is a fun working and learning environment. you learn good problem solving skills and how to work under pressure and stress. i worked with friends and it made the work more fun and relaxed
good,The hours at Starbucks were not entirely ideal considering if you are in college or not. The work environment was super fast paced but it was an overall great work environment. Very attentive
good,"Depending on the location, mine was very busy throughout the day, so it keeps you on your toes. I recommend Starbucks as a highschool or stepping stone job since you can make good connections with your customers."
good,this company does a great job teaching employees great customer service and skills needed to be successful in future endeavors. they treat their employees well and offer full benefits for part time employees.
good,Nice job to have during college. The customers really do appreciate you and the services you provide them. Some customers even open up to the baristas and there is a life long connection.
good,"Starbucks Canada was a good job to have while attending University. It had good benefits, a pretty good working environment, and very flexible hours. It could get very tiring but for other University students, I would highly recommend."
good,"definitely would recommend to work at Starbucks."
good,"A typical day at work involves making drinks in a fast-paced environment, taking orders, handling payment, keeping the store safe and clean, stocking fridges, cups, lids, etc. ,greeting customers and helping them on drink selections and making a connection to all the customers who come in the store. I personally enjoyed most of my managers and co-workers.  The job has great benefits and decent pay."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you love meeting new people. In the festive seasons it often gets very busy but it’s great fun learning all the new drinks. Would recommend working there.
good,"Fun work environment, we all worked well as a team and knew each customer personally.  Extremely cleans and organized work place with the understood goal to maintain it."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, management needs a little work but it was an enjoyable job.Starbucks has a great work community that makes you feel proud to be apart of."
good,Plenty of opportunities to connect with customers and produce good service. You get to meet a lot of new and old faces through the drive-thru and the cafeteria.
good,If definitely suggest it as a job for someone needing part time. Full time was a bit chaotic. I learned lots of skills for other work in the same field.
good,It's easy just a lot of memorizing and a quick pace. There is always constant cleaning to be according to food safety. But it is generally a stress free environment
good,"Starbucks employees are usually pretty nice. Customers, however, are not and the stress gets to everyone who works there. Starbucks has better benefits and pay than many, but like with all food service jobs it's best to keep your head down and not work too many hours if you can help it."
good,"The job itself is fast paced. If you can handle the speed and the multitasking needed for this job then you can have ALOT of fun with it. the employees are fun to work with and the customers are good for the most part. of course you have your amazing customers and then you have those who you know will always find something wrong with anything. the worst part about this job is the unnecessary drama that comes with it. the job itself is great, but sometimes the management or staff you have working with you make it a complete nightmare to walk in."
good,I had a great manager to work for at my Starbucks location. I believe that made it so much more enjoyable to work at. Great job to work part time if you're going to school full time.
good,"Great benefits and flexibility to relocate. As a manager, it can be really challenging to have a work life balance. Workplace culture is positive which makes this company to be  one the ones to work for."
good,"I personally did not enjoy it as much since I only worked at a kiosk, but regardless it taught me a lot about multitasking. It was still a fun environment and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
good,"Fun to work there, yet the direction of the company is turning it to the ""big corporation"" is pretends not to be. More customer focused less partner orientated.  It's always been great to work there and the benefits are good and the same as they always have had. But now as the company attempts to be more than just a company, more pressure and expectations are placed on partners without additional compensation. The phrase ""We only hire Olympians"" is thrown around a lot, but even if we perform to that standard, we aren't treated accordingly."
good,"I was making decent money and was going to advance, I have nothing bad to say about corporate. The culture is great, they tout work life balance and most of the time it is true. You are often thrown into projects you may not have any experience in, this is a great way to gain new skills and explore new team building opportunities."
good,"Overall, it's a fun job. At Starbucks, you'll have to interact with a whole range of customers.... some of the most fantastic people ever, and the worst of humanity IMAGINABLE, and everything in between. I mean, I've seen such racist & homophobic people... you would not believe it. But then also awesome people. You deal with the public... so don't be surprised when you have to call the cops because a homeless person is screaming in your lobby and throwing coffee everywhere, lol. The thing you run into the most is impatient customers, and that's not too bad, they can just be jerks. "
good,"I enjoyed the interactions with the customers. Ad a morning supervisor, being able to impact customer's mornings were amongst my favorite aspects of this job."
good,The first Starbucks I worked at was a poor experience for me due to poor management and a culture of superiority from older partners. I felt threatened and unwanted so then I transferred to Starbucks on Twin Peaks and Pomerado where I was met with exceptional management and a community of kindness form my coworkers. I also finally had the chance to grow when I transferred.
good,"Starbucks is an excellent job to have for the experience alone. It can be an intense place to work but it is easily the best of any fast food style job. It is also highly dependent on your team because it is 100% a team effort to make the day smooth. If your team is inexperienced, if there is a lot of interpersonal drama, or if the location is in a high volume location, it can dramatically impact the job experience. If the team works well together and communicates well, it's a fun job and can provide a lot of customer service and problem solving skills."
good,"I worked there for about 4 years, the tips after great but it can be super hectic and complicated and the holidays are the worst! Sometimes I wouldn't leave the place until 2 am cleaning!"
good,"It is definitely a difficult job dealing with many different customers and various drinks but, it was a positive overall work experience. A typical day at work was often hectic but, I learned positive communication skills and cash management."
good,"Very nice place to work, though the workload is worth about 5x as much as you're paid. I left because of an incident with another coworker. Enjoyed it very much."
good,While working at Starbucks I have made many friendships and have seen people go as well. My overall experience as a Starbucks employee I would have to say taught me many things. I became more outgoing and people grew to like me because of how hard I work. Starbucks is a really good company to work for and I recommend it to anyone that is even remotely thinking about working here.
good,Working at Starbucks really showed me that you can work and make money at the same time while having fun and leaning new things. You meet new people everyday and practice your coffee making skills whenever you want.
good,Good company! Has some growing to do as well! Better than most fast food and retail jobs. Opportunities to grow If you put in the work! I started from a barista and worked my way up. Your leadership team will play a big part in your Starbucks experience. They will either make you fall in love with the job or completely run you away! Overall good people and good job! Not for everyone. If you can’t smile and hold a conversation...not for you!
good,"There is a lot of room for promotion. If you work throughout several different stores, show up on time, and don't call out often there is a high chance of being promoted from within. There are several managers that moved up from the barista position, in addition to outside hires."
good,"This company has some really amazing benefits and gives you the ability to impact people through coffee.  I joined the business because the store managers offer a lot of support to each and every member of their team and active teach you to grow and succeed.  But, at least in my district, that support didn't translate to the role above that.  The growth structure is steep and narrow which doesn't offer tremendous room for growth.  The in-store work experience can be difficult but fully rewarding. "
good,"Starbucks is too fast paced and busy for way too little pay. Great first job...teaches grit and how to keep up. Wide mix of people, as young as 17 to working with people in their 40’s."
good,"I enjoyed most of all meeting customers often enough that they are recurring, and being able to know their drink off the top of my head. There were moments of relative downtime where I could really socialize and speak and know the customers, as well as put a smile on their face when they clearly had an upsetting day. There are strict rules to follow, but they make sense and does not seem superfluous."
good,"If I didn't work with the people I worked with, I would have quit sooner. We, he night crew, were an elite group of people. My manager was not the best sadly, but other than that I highly recommend it."
good,"Loved it. But when promised a promotion to ASM, i got screwed over 3 times. They slack in promoting and the pay is whack. Always do more work than what you get paid to do."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful part-time job for teens and adolescents who are either in high school or are leaving. They pay at competitive rates and have great compensation plans for post-high school education. However, there are better jobs out there for those looking for full-time work, and the in-store franchises (e.g. Safeway) are more shoddily ran due to a less held up standard."
good,"I have ADHD, so it makes it difficult to remember all the drinks PLUS the tasks that I needed to have stored in my head. I decided to try it again at frys but it had the same outcome. I had a hard time trying to keep up with everything."
good,I strongly believe that Starbucks is a great company to work for with great values and respect for their employees. Management really does make or break the experience though. Managers were constantly changing & the communication between higher up and the baristas was lacking. A Starbucks with the right manager is a great job opportunity!
good,"It was overall a pretty good job, was too difficult other than an occasional ""bad"" customer, management sucked when u started but the new manager at the store I worked is amazing, they worked with my schedule, they were very helpful when I first started even with all the random questions I threw at them. Tips they are great depending in where you work."
good,"It was a lot to handle, I was in high school when I got this job and it was difficult to get a schedule that could work around school, homework, and extracurriculars. Any days off had to be requested a MONTH in advance, which is difficult for a constantly shifting schedule like mine, especially for the spring season, which is about a month in length total. They scheduled three weeks out, which seems a bit excessive but is somewhat helpful for finding someone to cover a shift, which happened a fair amount because of my schedule. The problem is, however, that nobody ever wanted to cover shifts because they all request to be scheduled for whenever they’re available. Therefore, nobody is ever available to cover shifts or it’s their only day off. They knew what they were getting into when they hired a 16 year old, but they failed to comply with my busy schedule. Overall the actual working wasn’t bad, but good luck with the scheduling."
good,"Its amazing to be able to meet people with such different interests, along with their drink and food choices. Everyone is so different, and its beautiful to see them gather in a comfortable environment."
good,"Coworkers are your family and you will grow close to them, but the work is stressful, face passed and the customers will always be the worst. They asked for three ice cubes in their coffee, not four and if there are four you are personally responsible for ruining their month."
good,"Wonderful work culture, some of the most interesting people I’ve ever met have been a barista. The wages are not liveable for an adult. Good first job however. Good benefits and stock options including sick time and paid time off after awhile. The hourly rate is ridiculously low even for shift leads. Great college plan though. So good benefits/ bad hourly rate."
good,"Working at Starbucks allowed me a deeper insight on many things that are easy to take for granted on the surface. As a barista, I learned how amazing it felt to connect with customers and create friendly banter with them as I created their drink. Just the knowledge that someone's day could brighten by seeing me is wonderful, and it is something I hold dear to me even after I have left Starbucks. While there were times when I felt overwhelmed by a rush or inefficient coworkers, I was still able to power through an ensure that customers receive only the best. If it was ever slightly off, I would be happy to remake the drink for them. They paid with their money, so it only makes sense that they receive what they order. Admittedly, the hardest part of the job was the customers who only wanted free drinks or to cause trouble. However, I have discovered that as long as I keep a calm and agreeable mentality, we are able to come to an understanding."
good,"Very fast paced, and very nice working environment. Gets very busy and communication between co workers can sometimes be lacked. Discounts and breaks where oftenly fair."
good,The management wasn't amazing but the coworkers were wonderful and the job itself is very good! The company gives you many benefits but they aren't very environmentally conscious
good,"Being a Barista at Starbucks in an incredibly enriching experience. The working conditions and management are all great. The work that you're asked to perform is rough and almost always stressful. However, that is to be expected. The wage is hard to live on but the benefits are comparable. The wage is low for the work and care expected. Other than that, great job."
good,"Starbucks benefits are amazing! I got paid time off (6 weeks) for having my baby, free coffee every week, tips, stock investment, etc. if you’re looking for something financially sustainable and something you can easily move up in, this probably isn’t the place for you as I have yet to be a supervisor after offering to step up in an open position and busting butt."
good,You have to be able to work in high pressure situation. The benefits are good but it’s a lot out of your paychecks. you get paid bi-weekly and can have drama in the work place.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for a year and I genuinely did like it. The only reason I left is because of management issues, but I definitely would've stayed otherwise. I would say the hardest part of the job would be getting drinks out fast if its busy. Everyone thinks making drinks is hard but I promise every drink is basically the same! If you're looking for a chill job I wouldn't recommend starbucks though, you're not allowed to just stand around, and you always have to be doing something."
good,The benefits are worth your time. The job itself is demanding and the company has made choices recently to make it even harder. That's a shame because Starbucks had a stellar relationship with employees.
good,"Starbucks can be an energetic and fast paced work environment that can help grow great applicable workplace skills such as time management, multitasking, active listening, interpersonal skills, and customer service. However where it is truly lacking is the compensation and opportunity for advancement. Thus it is a great option for those that are looking for temporary employment while in school."
good,"I learned a ton of fantastic management and coaching skills in my position at Starbucks. Unfortunately, the ceiling for promotion is very low and the company will keep you at a low pay rate as long as they can."
good,"Starbucks is what it is. While there is a career to be found with high paying corporate positions, the entry level standard Barista to Management positions are pretty simple, easy to understand and typically pretty easy to work a second schedule around."
good,Working here is fine for a part time job. You get to have coffee while you work and usually a bit of fun if your coworkers are team-players. The pay is not great but for a part time job it is better than nothing!
good,Working at Starbucks can be fun as everyone you directly work with is usually friendly and it is possible to carry out tasks at the same time as bonding with fellow colleagues but it is clear the upper management does not care about those working on floor level as complicated drinks are constantly coming out and being heavily promoted which are time consuming and can end up resulting in a poor quality drink/dissatisfied customer. They also are happy to throw away loads of food yet to save money they choose to cut labour budget instead of tackling the wastage problem. This results in us often being understaffed and stressed whilst on shift. They also do not give nationwide discount which is pretty ridiculous for such a huge corporation.
good,"Who knows whats going on now but there are too many changes in management. Makes it hard to have a workflow.  "
good,"If I had been paid enough to pay bills and live on, I never would have left. It is such a rewarding job. I have so many friends and contacts and I still love going in as a customer and former partner."
good,"It is a fine company but the stigma of working at ""Starbucks"" can be annoying. It can be disruptive to work when customers come in just for a photoshoot. It can be annoying when managers do not protect their staff from customer abuse. That is solely due to this idea Starbucks has created of ""Baristas being your friends."" We are not, we are nice and civil because we are in the business of customer service but all too many times was I witness to customers downright degrading and disrespecting my coworkers just because a name was misspelled, or some other trivial illegitimate reason.  You need a thick skin to work with this company. If you get upset by strangers screaming in your face, then this is not the environment for you."
good,"Customers can be dumb, when aren't they. Managers don't care about every barista equally. Lots of fun once you get the hang of how everything works. C+"
good,İyi bir firmaydı ve ben eğitimden dolayı ayrılmak zorunda kaldım
good,"I truly love working at the store I'm at, the people are great, the customers are great.  It's like going to work but not really going to work.  Yes, keeping up the pace and making the drinks correctly as complicated as they are can be challenging, it gives me a little rush honestly.  We have a lot of fun when we're not slammed with mobiles and cafe orders.  My biggest complaint, if anything, would be the district management.  They make decisions not thinking about they affect the store or the partners.  My store alone has gone through 5 store managers in the last few years simply because the district manager wanted to move them.  We've lost some customers due to the different managers and the way they do things or lack of consistent management in the store.  Also, the district managers show up at the store and do nothing to get to know the partners that are keeping the store running.  They don't even bother to say hello most of the time, that really bothers me, yet they knit pick what's wrong with your store or what's missing a date dot, etc, I don't think that lives up to the ""third place"" and ""everyone is welcome"" attitude they expect us to have."
good,"Awesome job with great benefits for part time employees. Over 10 years, I had amazing and horrid bosses. The store culture is 100% dependent on your store manager"
good,"Although I love the job and people I work with, the opportunity to advance takes forever and your pay is not great. You get some great perks but more money an hour would be more beneficial."
good,"Great place to work, learn a lot about coffee. Loved the environment and markouts that were weekly.  Employee discount was great because I was a student!"
good,Down side pay. Amount required to do in the short period you are there a day wages are inadequate. No overtime because you qualify for benefits if you average 20 hours a week. You can get more time from other Starbucks but keep up with your hours. The managers get fussed at if their Baristas go over 40 hours a week.  All in all though it’s a lot of fun. Be ready to be on your feet and moving the WHOLE time you are there
good,"Any day can be different, but it is typically a supportive and positive environment. I've become better at multitasking, and have especially improved on person-to-person interaction."
good,Working at Starbucks is both relaxing but can also be stressful. Depending on the time of the day factors how busy the store will get. Typically the store is busiest first thing in the morning and during rush hour. Working at Starbucks has its perks such as discounts as well as a option to go to school online.
good,"If you are working and in school as a college student, this is great for you. You’ll be able to work and make some money  every two weeks, I would just say make sure you are ready to learn all the drinks and if you have time, study them and have people that are patient to help you learn how to make them. It can be incredibly complicated learning all of the drinks at first but it will get better you just have to keep trying and practicing. Always ask for help too."
good,"Very friendly and understanding environment to work in. My boss was very easy to work with on scheduling, and took time to care about her employees outside of work."
good,"Can't say too many bad things about this place. Management and organization was an issue at my store.  No accountability to the GM. However all the shift supervisors, ands partners , I'll never forget!"
good,Starbucks helped hone my supervisory skills by offering extensive training and many coaching opportunities.  The flexible part time positions with benefits make it great for someone pursuing other projects/careers.
good,"I loved the regular customers that I would see everyday. We grew to start looking forward to seeing each other ! The customers do you keep you on your toes , but they also kept me loving my job."
good,"This is an extremely difficult job, you have to dedicate yourself to doing the best you can do every day. There is no amount of slacking off here as you should and will be constantly tasked with a job that you have been trained on, but will ultimately test you. Customers may yell at you for something that is or is not your fault, and you will be trained on how to handle any disruptive behavior, but it still takes a tough mind to take the amount of physical and mental stress that this job comes with. In all though, you will gain loads of benefits, great work experience, and it will help you grow as well. As long as you keep a generally positive attitude, the store culture and you will benefit from a strong sense of team."
good,"It is a great company to work for, but I left due to issues at my store. I wasn't trained properly and I was treated poorly. I would think I would also get better pay due to me working in the Disney district but I was not."
good,"A small place to work, so you know all of your coworkers and fast-paced, which will keep you on your toes and makes you learn fast. Always a day to day interaction with people and can be good and bad, though some of it can depend on you and how you present yourself."
good,Being a barista is great. Being a shift isn't worth the added stress and my store managers were both unhappy people. It's hard to work here for so little money when it looks like you'll grow into disliking the job so much.
good,"I have been familiar with the Starbucks message for a majority of my life, and I love everything they stand for. This company truly cares about its' employees and wants to make sure everyone is getting the best possible experience."
good,Starbucks is a great company. They also have awesome products and competition. My experience with management with Starbucks was a little shaky at times but manageable. Starbucks offers great benefits such as dental and medical. They also have options for their members to take advantage of free school online.
good,"There's never a dull, boring moment. If you're not slammed with frapp loving middle-schoolers, there's counters to be wiped down, syrup bottles to be scrubbed and always dishes to be done. The hardest part of the job is when there's a huge line and you're the only one working and are on the closing shift - you're doing everything in your power to make sure the opener is ready for their shift while you're making sure you keep yourself prepared for what's next in yours."
good,"Starbucks culture is very light and easy going, each partner is pushed to be a better version of their self. Partners are compensated well through salary, bonuses and other benefits plus each partner gets a minimum of 2 days off weekly. Starbucks, specifically in the north of manila is a good place to work in just avoid issues or people trying to look for issues even if they are part of the higher management team."
good,"it was good experience but  minimum wage still low, benefit wasn't bad "
good,stressful work environment. the only part i enjoyed was the people i worked  with. customers were friendly and easy to please. management was easy to talk to
good,"During my time at Starbucks, I Worked at three different locations, and let me tell you they all had its up and downs. Some managers were more lenient than others, other's had a military approach. The one thing that they had in common was the need to increase sales while maintaining a low drive-thru time, as well as pleasing the customers no matter how obnoxious they were. I can understand why customers always comes first from a business perspective, however, a happy employee is an even happier work environment. However, in all three location I had the privilege in working with amazing - awesome- talented people! I had some really good laughs, and if I had to do it again I would. I learned that with some patience and with good people you can get through any stressful situation."
good,We Open the store and put out the pastries make the coffee and get a rundown of what to Focus on that day. Mostly it was a simple job only gettting difficult when very busy. I enjoyed making the coffee and talking with the guests the most. Clean up was very easy and having the rules laid out well helped me learn whats correct to do in a food establishment.
good,"A typical day was busy, but overall a good time. I learned good time management and organization skills. The hardest part was dealing with unreasonable customers, the best part was the coworkers."
good,The experience of working for a corporation such as Starbucks was interesting. You had a large corp. controlling the image of the brand but they were slightly detached from the stores themselves. They made changes that didn't make sense to the ground employees. All-in-all it was a good experience that taught a lot of social and life skills.
good,"Depending on your location, a day at Starbucks can be fun and relaxing while you make new customers and friends - or it can be trying to survive the fires of Mordor as customers are yelling and throwing drinks at you."
good,The training is the only thing I could complain about. This might not be true anymore but I was just put in front of the machine and left to figure it out on my own. Management was easy to go to for help or scheduling.
good,"Overall, I absolutely loved working at Starbucks. Making and creating things are a passion of mine and I one day plan to open a cafe of my own. Through Starbucks I learned the value of team work, friendship, and craftsmanship. The only negative thing I have to say about starnmbucks involves the management. Their politics are that of corporate, as all know, but I noticed more and more as time went by that I worked there, that their politics are a bit tyrannical and almost imprisoning. And they waste a TON of food. How much waste is thrown out on a daily basis is awful."
good,I worked at a very fast paced location and I very much enjoyed my job but sometimes customers and the manager would make it a very negative place to work. A great atmosphere and an excellent place to learn customer service and how to keep people happy. Not an easy job to have but worth it.
good,"Starbucks is a relatively easy job for anyone looking to get into the work force.  They offer very flexible scheduling and the management is very understanding.  It's definitely not a job that most will carry throughout their lives, but it's wonderful for college students or even adults looking for working experience.  Because Starbucks is ever-growing, there is certainly a chance to move up into management."
good,"Starbucks has been a great place for me to work. There are several different positions in the store to work and we all flex to fill them as needed. You can work point of service (front register), bar, drive through (occasionally we'll have two on drive through if we're very busy), and customer support (stocking, cleaning, making backups of inclusions and syrups, etc). It's super fast paced during peak hours, for my store that's around 9am-2pm. This is when we have a massive rush of customers and around 6-7 people on the floor to run all positions of the store. Then the night shift, 5pm-close (10:30-12:30 depending on the schedules), is fairly evenly paced staffing four and dropping to two (one barista, one shift) by the last thirty minutes of the night. The main responsibility they have is a lot of cleaning tasks to get the store ready for peak the next day."
good,I only works at one location for a short time but during that short time everyone was friendly and helpful during my training process. I wish I was able to transfer to another location but the management from both locations weren't very helpful.
good,They offer help with school and you can relocate anywhere there is a Starbucks.  You get paid bi weekly but get tips on the off weeks so that’s great .
good,While starbucks has it's fun days. You also have to deal with rude customers who think they know more and managers who can be flaky. Your coworkers will be family however! I've never had a closer group of friends :)
good,"Work and job satisfaction depended on the hard work delivered by the baristas every day. The stronger the teamwork, the easier the job responsibilities were for everyone at the store."
good,"I loved working for the Bux when I first started I moved to 3 different locations, every store is different, managers do not care, they are there for bonuses and salary, this job is made for high school/ college looking to make extra money although I worked with who been here for 10+ years. there are perks such as tips, tuition reimbursement, weekly coffee markouts, discounts on food and beverages when you aren't working"
good,A typical day at the Starbucks location that I work at is very busy because it is in between a high school and university. I loved my coworkers and manager and learned skills so that I can balance work and school together.
good,The best part of the job is the connections that you make with the regular customers. Some even become genuine friends who will step up and help during tough times.
good,Everybody was nice there. They were reasonable with vacation and sick time. If u got hurt they got on it right away with their first aid team. If u did get hurt they allowed u reasonable time off. On the holidays they gave u free lunches. It's is causal dress but they do require you to wear steel toed shoes and jeans mostly. You will also be wearing bump capes and safety glasses and safety vests to protect u.
good,Not a bad place to work. Just wasn't for me. They treated me very well as a veteran. The place i worked was very busy. Offered a free pound of coffee every week.
good,"Working at Starbucks, I met a lot of great people. The people I've worked with were the type I could really relate to, and see myself having real connections with. "
good,"Working at starbucks it's fun. They require great levels of customer service. There just isnt much place to grow. You go in, make drinks, have fun, youre out."
good,"Everyone here really cares about their job. They care about the coffee and they care about the customers. You are empowered to make every moment right for the customer without worrying too much about repercussions. They are fairly flexible with schedules. Can be extremely busy, and the higher ups care way too much about numbers, rather than customer connctins- they are pulling away from their original beliefs. "
good,Starbucks was a good company to work for.  Though I had mixed experiences in different areas of the country.  For the most part there is room for advancement and the company tries to live its values.
good,"This was my first job while in high school and it was fun. The environment was nice and relaxed during my night shifts. The pay was low, but what can you really expect without a degree? I imagined if I had been more committed and went full time and even moved up to a shift supervisor, the pay and benefits for school would have made it a little more worth it.  Management was alright- nothing to complain about- just the minimum to make everyone content. The most annoying part is having to give away free drinks to rude, lying customers. This makes our cost of drinks to cost of labor ratio go up which means we had to cut hours. This meant 2 baristas were doing the work for 3 baristas. It wasn't THAT bad. It was just a job nonetheless though."
good,"Coworkers are usually upbeat and the customers will get to know you and come to love you. Hard to make a decent living but that's to be expected as an entry level retail position, unless you're planning on going into management. Great place to work if you're a teen or college student trying to make some spending money."
good,la gente es chevere por lo mismo que son todos casi de la misma edad
good,"A list of wonderful customers you'll meet working here!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks as a temporary job, but it wasn't something I could live off of. I worked there throughout high school and it was a fun environment for someone that age. Would recommend."
good,Starbucks introduced coffee culture to the United States. The high quality product combined with the friendly atmosphere is key to the success of the company. This is enhanced by the premier service provided by its employees.
good,I first worked at a licensed Starbucks in a Target so the switch was easy. There is more work and more customers. The basics are the same. An important part is building customer connection.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and learned how to prepare a drink within one minute. It is a very fast-paced job and you will be on your feet for the whole day.
good,Management at my store wasn't the best but they job over all was great. highly recommend for someone in school who wants to make a little extra cash in their spare time.
good,"Great overall experience if you're used to keeping busy at work. Be weary of management and corporate, as there are often unfair protections in place for undeserving managers."
good,Fast and keeps you on your toes. Must be willing to work with other and work under pressure and high stress situations. I would recommend  for someone who enjoys collaborating with others and doesn't like to sit.
good,"Starbucks is frequently a busy place and can get stressful. Especially if something goes wrong the customers can be some of the worst people to deal with, however the pay is good and my coworkers were very kind."
good,Starbucks was a temp job for me while i job searched. A ton of people have been a barista and several interviews I had the barista talk with higher ups who had done a stint. It paid the bills. It was fast paced but overall a chill environment. Just have a bit of passion and patience and you will do well.
good,"Good job with great benefits, but also a near-constant high stress environment. Not the best place for slow learners, lazy people, or people without the ability to multitask."
good,"While I love the mission of Starbucks, there’s a wonderful culture of acceptance of people from all walks of life, my individual store has been suffering under new management. This is certain not the case with all stores though and I’d gladly recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Flexible schedule. Low pay for simple work but can become demanding when the store is busy. Lots of drink combinations to memorize. Atmosphere depends on manager at the location, some are more relaxed than others. Tea/Coffee markouts were the best part because food is expensive and u healthy even with discount."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a good experience, it helped me strengthen my ability to work independently and as a group and has also given me the opportunity to meet new people and learn more, The customers were pleasant and I've built bonds with many of them which was probably the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of the job was probably that with certain job roles I'd have to rely heavily on others because it is very difficult to run the store, during busy hours, if everyone isn't doing their part."
good,"I love Starbucks as a company but all circumstances play a role in your experience when working here. amazing perks. your store location is very important in the aspect of who you will be working with behind the bar and who your customer demographic will be. experience is not a huge concern, you being able to thrive and learn in an extremely fast-paced environment is more important."
good,Internal advancement a mess but the job itself was fun . People who wanted to be there made it a great experience. Benefits are decent. Pay is decent.
good,"Starbucks is a company with great values, great coffee, and good people but can often be tainted by the fast paced work and high turn over rate. Benefits are fantastic with a full benefit package including 401k and stock benefits at 20 hours a week."
good,Good place to work at. Good and fun environment. Fast pace work area. Must like to work with team members. Have good customer services skills to work here.
good,I had gained experience with fast moving airport environment. I was flexible and adaptable with a willingness to learn new skills and take ownership of activities.
good,"If you/re a barista at Starbucks, it is easier to get through your day, When you become a shift supervisor, you get burdened dealing with the multiple call offs every week, under staffing, inability to get time off without an argument and general chaos that comes along with the daily routine. Things could be more organized, but in general the company does at least try to care about its partners, they just fall short sometimes."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work in a food service/retail environment. The job gives great benefits for even part-time work, and is very collaborative and interesting from day-to-day. While every retail or food service setting has its share of difficult customers, it is nothing that can't be managed by teamwork and effective policy."
good,"Starbucks paved my path for work ethic straight out of highschool, it teaches you how to work fast and efficient also how to deal with rude people. It is in no means made to be a career imo but it is amazing if you are juggling school/work aka very flexible. Everyone was so nice at every store i ever worked at. I do often miss working at starbucks but it is not worth going back to and putting up with some customers and managers."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced environment with a heavy focus on consumer satisfaction. There are always people that you come in to contact with that are unhappy in that moment, but you do you best to make it right. If you can't and they continue to be upset you can give them corporate information and continue with your job. By and large, the people you come into contact with are amazing. You have regulars that come in nearly every day and you start to bond with them and it's can be a home-y experience. But, that is the Starbucks goal- to create a third place environment in which people come in and know others and have conversations and relate to people that may have started with coffee, but continues to grow."
good,"Most days will have their stressful and their laid back moments. I learned to maximize my efficiency when it come to multi-tasking. Corporate can make puzzling decisions at times which can lead to frustration. Workplace culture fantastic, most customers and partners are great to interact with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is constantly working as a team with your partners."
good,"Starbucks training was extremely arduous and very challenging. It very quickly weeds out those who are not suitable or cut out for the job. If you survive their training, you can learn to perform well at any job that is remotely similar."
good,"I loved my time at Starbucks, the friendships I made, and the customers I served but for such a huge company the pay is awful. I wasn’t able to live off what I was making so I went to a different job."
good,"From My personal Experience i cant say its a bad job. I can say that its fast pace at times, any time you have free is used to maintain the store. But honestly the time went by well enough. never too slow. The biggest issue i had was since it was a Starbucks through Kroger. It was not technically a Starbucks owned company. So no Starbucks benefits. But the Co workers where nice. Definitely a good job for someone going to college."
good,I worked as a Barista for a little over a year at two different locations. The only reason I quit was because I needed the time for school. Overall my experience was above average and my favorite food oriented workplace that I have worked so far. Overall I'd give it a try. The workers Starbucks attracts I found are very different than your typical fast food place and have all been very nice people.
good,"A typical day depends on what shift you get, you most likely make drinks, deal with customers and clean. You get trained very well in the first weeks as to how to make a ""Starbucks"" drink"
good,I love the flexibility and ability to receive benefits with only working 20 hrs a week. I love that we all stand behind each other and help each other out when needed.
good,"I liked the independence I got while at Starbucks and no one was looking behind my scheduled. I was allowed to work from home a couple of times a week, which you don't usually get."
good,Working there was fun but it really depends on corporate or franchised locations. Franchises dont pay as well and do not seem to care about you much in all honesty
good,"Working for starbucks is mostly fun and enjoyable with a wide range of staff to work with. However, somtimes sufficent management can be lacking. There is also lack of progression."
good,"If you end up in the right store, it can be a lot of fun. There is job advancement opportunities but most that work here are also in school. The hours can be a pain."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work temporarily but you see too many people get comfortable with very little growth potential in the company. Starbucks is not a career.
good,Great place to work and make new friends! pretty laid back environment expect when it's busy. But that's expected right! ………………………………………………………………………...
good,"Working at Starbucks really brought me out of my shell, I loved working there. It's an amazing feeling to connect with customers and provide the best service I can offer. The most enjoyable part of working there was definitely my coworkers and friendly regular customers."
good,My Starbucks experience was brief but it was amazing and provided me with a lot of knowledge and experience in the work force. It’s just that Starbucks corporate has encouraged their customers to become unreasonable and very very hostile and rude. The customer is of course always correct but it comes at the cost of the mental health of us overworked baristas. They don’t hire enough shift supervisors or baristas to effectively cover shifts especially at busy locations so almost everyone is always overworked
good,"We opened at 4:30 am and closed at 11:00 pm. It was very fast-paced, especially in the mornings and afternoon around lunch time. My coworkers were pretty chill. Management was fickle most of the time, especially the GM. Would work for this company again, but at a different location."
good,"good company definitely a physically demanding job. benefits are awesome 401k partner match, tuition reimbursement, health dental and vision parters 20+hours,stock,paid sick time, vacation hours 30% discounts free food and drink market every shift"
good,"Great place to work with great benefits for what boils down to a fast food job. Lots of stores means lots of opportunity to move around an area or pick up extra hours. Decent discounts on merchandise etc. Did not appreciate the interpersonal drama that comes with working in a small space with a small group of people. Great working with customers, especially the regulars."
good,"As an employee at Starbucks you must be extremely speedy at all times. Customers never stop coming therefore, be prepared to get along with your team and be on your feet."
good,Starbucks as a company is smart and very driven on making improvements all the time to procedures or offerings to make the overall experience better. I feel that I might have had more growth at a different location from where I was but overall fun job.
good,Starbucks was a great work experience! Co-Workers made the job better. However Managment could use some work on. My manager would make the work environment so chaotic and much more stressful then necessary!
good,Good basic coffee training. Go with a mom and pop type coffee shop if you want to learn to make gourmet coffee as the Starbucks espresso machines are automatic.
good,Can be fun and enjoyable with learning more about the coffee and such. Really busy work environment. Feel like you should get paid a little more. Love the free lunches
good,"The Starbucks location I worked at was a fast-passed environment. Also most of the employee were part time people with second jobs, so that meant that there never seemed quit enough people available to work. At the same time, even if they were available, to cut costs people were allowed to go home early a lot or else the scheduling was so bare boned that it caused strain for those of us that did show up. But management were super nice, the coffee is good, and its fun to work in a Cafe environment. "
good,"It is an overall good job. There is no advancement in your career, and the benefits are good, but I would rather have been paid more by the hour than get free coffee every week."
good,"My overall review for Starbucks is great. I worked in one of the busiest locations in my town, but I still managed to have a wonderful time while working. Almost all my co-workers had really funny, lovely personalities which i looked forward to being around on a daily basis. I made some amazing friends while working there. Working in one of the busiest locations was a struggle at times, but with how good of a team everyone worked together as we always managed to pull through. Despite that, it taught me some good work skills that have helped since, like, multitasking being the biggest one. The perks that were offered through working there were amazing. Free drink while working, plus a good discount you can use during your shifts or on your days off as well. The weekly mark-out of free coffee and tea was always one of my favorites! I did have some problems when it would come to management at the time of me working there, which was the only thing that kind of made it hard to want to go in at times. My overall review based off my personal experience for working at Starbucks would be a 9/10 and I would definitely go back to the company again in the future."
good,we work twelve-hour shifts operate the pelletizer drive a forklift we go around to the machine operator lines stocking and restocking the shelves  load and unload trailers drive to yard jockey to move the trailers around the yard scanning product with the RF scanner
good,"Starbucks is a decent enough company that definitely tries to be the third place for it's customers. In my experience, they're not trying hard enough to make it a third place for it's employees. They want ""Happy Partners Who Love Starbucks"" but the management doesn't listen to or simply dismisses it's partners. The work life balance can be frustrating as well when you're a student and have a manager that is so focused on their own life that they just don't care about yours."
good,"We were constantly busy, but it made time go by fast, and when we had special days like Frappuccino happy hour, these days would be hectic but also fun."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks,  the people I meant in the Palisades location impacted my day everyday there.Although it was far, I was more than happy to make their day as much as they made mine. Despite the circumstances when I started there I would gladly work there again because I enjoy creating that welcoming environment for the customer."
good,"Had a lot of tasks to do constantly, very busy with very demanding customers but good benefits and lots of free drinks. Hardest part was all the hard labor and deep cleaning and long hours. But good hardworking people and shifts fly by. Lots of memorization"
good,Most of the Starbucks I worked at were busy so it makes the day go by fast. Over the years I found that management expected a lot more from you without compensating the workload.
good,"Working at Starbucks can be fast paced in the morning with the focus on speed and efficiency. Customers can be rude so it can be stressful. At night, baristas mostly clean."
good,"Working in a cafe or drive through store is great as a temporary plan to reach something more, weather it's taking advantage of the online college program, or gaining leadership skills by becoming a supervisor or store manager. It is not likely you will move to a corporate position from a brick and mortar position."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful job for a person who is going to school, has children, or has a second job. Scheduling is very accommodating. The benefits from Starbucks are phenomenal (health insurance, dental, 401k, stock, tips, free coffee) but the job is very stressful at times. Starbucks believes in creating a ""third place"" for customers and the atmosphere is fantastic. The only downside for myself was that the wages are close to state minimum  but they offer part time benefits."
good,I would say I love working for Starbucks because I have a small passion in the art of coffee. But the way Starbucks puts more of it's own company in itself instead of its employees I'm not sure if it's worth it if your looking to be in a career with them.
good,"The interviewing process was a fairly simple process. The manager of the store asked me simple questions ranging from customer service, to beverage making skills. Overall the interview process was super simple and relaxing."
good,This company provides the best management infrastructure training you can gain in industry. The company values its employees and preaches a work/life balance.
good,Great place to work just didnt like management and I enjoyed the environment of helping people while being myself. I definitely would recommend this company to work at
good,"I worked as a barista. The job isn't bad, but it definitely does not pay enough for the work that you do. I would have stayed if the pay was higher. The manager was amazing, and my coworkers were great."
good,"Relajarse un poco con las auditorias, ayudar con las herramientas a los gerentes y supervisores y siempre escucharlos, por qué ellos están en operación y saben que necesita la tienda para cumplir sus objetivos"
good,Hard work. Commitment required. Learn fast work faster. Fun environment. Team oriented. Customer service is key! Amazing manager! No time for life unless you work less but that means less money.
good,I worked for them for 3years. It was fun while it lasted. I was able to learn a lot from the company and the people as a whole. The try to make it more entertaining by having friendly competitions.
good,"Starbucks as a company is overall good to work for. They maintain attention to workers' interests and aim to generate an inclusive and rewarding environment as possible. The perks with the job are above standard. If you are someone seeking flexibility with your schedule, then this is the place to look. "
good,"i appreciate working for the company, they have teached me a lot. i learned how to work in a face paced environment in a really short amount of time, and it’s a lot of fun!"
good,"Open and Close procedures, including Safe counts, till set ups and Point of Sales station assignments."
good,"I loved the idea of the job when I started, turns out its HIGHLY stressful. Management at my location was cold and rude. Hardest part of the job to me was creating a safe place for customers when I felt awful and unappreciated by management."
good,"At times, it may feel stressful, the environment at Starbucks is really fun. The culture at Starbucks really makes people feel good. Its all about teamwork and learning through experiences together."
good,"Starbucks in itself can be a great place to work, but a majority of that ends up depending on the management and other baristas working there. It does have a lot of good benefits though."
good,"Working at Starbucks, the mornings are very fast-paced. You need to be comfortable working in what can be a sometimes stressful environment, be able to multitask WELL, and be customer-service oriented. As a barista it is likely you will only be part-time, unless you volunteer to work in other cafes or move up into a shift lead position."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Starbucks.  The customers are the most enhoyable part of the job, but can also quickly ruin your day. The work itself is easy enough, its just non-stop. At least from a drive-thru store experience. The store atmosphere can be wonderful and create some strong life long friendships, yet also proves too close at times. The turnover rate is so rapid, your best friends can be gone the next week. Take advantage of the perks! The pay isn't sustainable unfortunately, but can really be a  great side gig!"
good,It's great place to work as a temporary job or if your in school because they do their best to work around your schedule. It is a fast paced environment and you need be able to perform under pressure and have great customer service skills. Its a great pace for benefits and discounts and have the option to move up in positions.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. However, it was incredibly hard to make any type of advances especially after taking away programs designed to further your education in the business."
good,"A very steady fast paced occupation, good to keep busy on your feet however it could become overwhelming. Wonderful customer connections and a real bond can be made with partners on the upside."
good,"Awesome place to work in, provided you have the right store manager and team, or else it can be a serious pain because sometimes the expectations can be unreasonable given the rate of pay etc."
good,"It is a very quick pece job where if you are not making cofffee you better be restocking to be hit by another large wave of customers."
good,"Over all, Starbucks is your home to build yourself back up and love who you are. The customers can be terrible but they can also be your best friend. Love you customers and your Starbucks partners the same, and you can’t go wrong!"
good,"While making coffee seemed to be challenging at first, it became easier as time went on. The best part about making drinks however was getting to know the customers behind the drink whether they were first timers or habitual coffee drinkers."
good,"The great part of the job was how happy most people are: arriving for coffee.  You are making a BIG impact on their mood - and it shows with all the smiles...which I needed at the time, as I weathered a divorce.  It was healing for me to force a smile onto my lips and listen to the mundane details of other's lives."
good,Starbucks is a good job for anyone that enjoys working  in a fast-paced environment and with many different people. Be strict with managers about your availability because often they'll add more hours out of no where (at least my boss did.)
good,Starbucks was a ok job. It was a fast paced company you would be moving constantly for hours the perks is you get one free food item a day and all the free drinks you want.
good,Great job for students but the benefits are not conducive to having a family or as you get older. Depending on what location you are at will depend on the environment. Very stressful at times.
good,It was flexible with having another job or going to school. As long as you work hard and do not cause drama you will get decent hours and usually get the hours that you want to work.
good,I worked at two separate Starbucks locations and while I always enjoyed the people I worked with once I transferred I was under new poorer management.
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work for making drinks and meeting new people. Under the right manager the store holds to a proper standard of cleanliness. There are downsides; there is high staff turnover and the Starbucks where I worked tended to hire teenagers who were difficult to train and work with because it was their first job.
good,"Clique-ish atmosphere. More concerned with constantly hiring and training outside hires, than nurturing the current team members."
good,"Extremely busy location, which made time fly by very quickly. Management was the best I've ever experienced until there was a switch. Post-switch in management, workplace became stressful, nit-picky and unnecessarily biased. After leaving, a less qualified, newer employee got the position I was aiming for based on, again, bias."
good,"The job itself was a very good job, I truly enjoyed working at Starbucks. Poor management was my only problem. I have worked at two Starbucks so far, and I've enjoyed both greatly, simply poor management."
good,"Fast paced, sales driven environment with lots of opportunity for growth. As with any retail management position, work-life balance can be hard to maintain."
good,"The job itself is fun and fast going, but there is no guarantee that you will have a good store manager, which is very important for overall organization. The pay is fairly good and they offer great benefits for college students as well. If you can't handle difficult people, you will have a rough day every day."
good,"Always work to be done, and very fast paced. Easy to make workplace relationships, which makes communication easier. Management could have been more willing to listen to supervisors, and employees more often."
good,When I worked there had the opportunity to work at multiple locations. Management styles were quite different. Was hard to see consistency between stores with how standards were followed.
good,"Starbucks was my first ever food service job, and it taught me a lot! It has bettered me as a person in so many ways. I've learned to be more confident, engage with customers more, and enjoy my coworkers and lift them up."
good,"If you are looking to get a degree, don't want to pay for spotify, or avidly drink about a pound of coffee a week, this is the place for you! However, I had worked for the company for three years where my only pay increases were changes in the minimum wage, so as a 3 year barista I make the same pay as a new hire. And the hiring managers from outside has to stop. I am currently training a useless manager on month three, but one would have to come to work drunk to be fired from starbucks. Not even an employee faking multiple STROKES and heart attacks was enough to get rid of employees, at the expense of coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed the benefits of working at Starbucks, and they have some of the best benefits you can get from any company. The biggest issue is that getting sustainable reliable full time hours is near impossible. Your schedule is different every week, you do not have stable reliable times for when you should actually be there to work. Customers can occasionally be demanding and rude, but that can come with any food service experience. The other side of it is that they are very flexible with your schedule. You can edit and request to modify your schedule to your needs and they are willing to provide you with a minimum amount of hours to get benefits from working there."
good,"The job keeps you busy. There is always something to do. At times, it can be stressful and quick-packed. But, overall, it is a good job to have and a good place to work at."
good,"Work hard, and embody the mission statement, it's a great place. Avoid the drama -- like any workplace -- and you'll have a good time. It takes multi-tasking skills to be successful. I frequently have to make drinks as I take DT orders. It is expected to make two drinks at once. After a while, it's all muscle memory. It is hard work, and you need to be good with customers."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you're at the right location! The managers can either be really nice or mentally insane. I love that once you get trained, you can work at any location. They also have a great college program if you work at least 20 hours per week. The dress code is pretty easy to follow. The training at my specific store was pretty awful, but I got the hang of things eventually. At my store, we get unlimited free drinks while we work and one free food item per shift. I loved all of my coworkers. Nobody really had an issue. They were all my age, anywhere from 18-22. The hardest part of the job is learning what are in drinks and how to make drinks. There is a LOT of information regarding that. The most enjoyable part of the job is either the customers or your fellow employees. The workplace is very small at every Starbucks I have had the opportunity to work for. There is not a lot of space to move around."
good,"I spent most of my time working the drive-thru by myself, for a minimum of 5 hours at a time. I wish that I had gotten more opportunities to experience other parts of the store more often, however, I did when I asked specifically to work in another part of the store. The job itself was very stressful, and it became hard to find coping methods. I loved my customers and my coworkers, they were the best part of the job for me."
good,"Management d'une équipe de 6 personnes"
good,"A lot of teamwork is required of a barista. Without the help of others, the job is lackluster/impossible. Shift leads were not the issue, store manager position showed disinterest in the standard protocol which led to new baristas not being trained appropriately."
good,Starbucks is a good temporary job. The best part about the job is the unlimited free drinks on the days you work. The worst part is the rude customers.
good,"Great workplace, great culture in Starbucks! embracing diversity. the most enjoyable experience of my job...is not what i achieve or reward i received. simply is what others you inspire them to do."
good,I was an opener for the store. I would come in around 415am and set up the pastry case until opening. We would have a morning rush at about 7am to 9am.
good,"Starbucks has lots of benefits, the only thing is that some stores are managed a lot better than others. With a good manger it is a good job, and with a poor manager it can be tough to work for the company."
good,It's an awesome work place if you are in between jobs or go to school. They are very flexible with hours and provide many opportunities for baristas to join and help the community.
good,"I enjoyed working there, but I didn't handle stress well. That made it difficult as a long term job. Highly recommend to people who are ladder climbers, and those who work well and happily under pressure. Do not recommend to those who prefer calmer environments. Fun for sure as a short term job."
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for almost 12 years now and I have seen it shift so many times. It has a great vision and corporate has these ""great ideas"" that make for a really amazing work environment. They fail in the aspect that they continue to cut our labor and don't offer a livable wage despite the benefits we receive."
good,"Great company with one of the best cultures in the industry. Your ability to advance is based on your direct supervisor.  If they are not engaged and active within the company, its hard to get noticed by upper management, regardless of your projects or success.  I would recommend transferring if your leader isn't challenging you or advocating for your development.  "
good,"Depending on your store, location, and managerial staff, you may struggle a lot to keep up with demand. However, if you dont mind having a little bit of a busy time to get through the day faster, the benefits package is more than well worth it."
good,"Good company to work for, you usually start early in a morning getting your shift sorted."
good,"Good Job. Great Benefits. I think Starbucks is getting so big that their Mission Statement is getting lost due to the Baristas having to make such labor intensive beverages, not to mention Oh So Many Promotions. Baristas are losing the time to connect with the customers. So much waste."
good,Starbucks is wonderful if you are a student or an adult who needs a part time job. Part time people get full benefits. Advancement is possible but cumbersome.
good,"Needs set standards, just confusing standards but also the customer is always right policy. The pay for supervisors is awful, and they don't have enough authority"
good,"I love, love, love working here because I love all of the customer interaction. There is opportunity to grow within the company as well.The only issue is that the hours are not guaranteed and they really don't take seniority into consideration at all when it comes to scheduling and pay rate. As someone who has been with the company almost three times as long as some of the other current employees, I am getting some of the lowest hours out of everyone in the store. I am available over 30 hours per week and some weeks I am not even getting scheduled the hours I need to keep my insurance. Other than that I love working here and the team atmosphere in the stores."
good,The typical day at Starbucks is fairly easy. Keep your station clean at all times and be quick to make handout drinks. Also always keep a great connection with your customers. The shift leaders never knew the current measurements of the ingredients and were poorly trained. Never a great source for help when needed during the shift. Manager was never available and was never the best at making the schedules. Overall working there offered great benefits but were never any chances to move up and shift leaders were never knowledgeable.
good,Work is fun and fluid as long as you have a good solid team for that shift. The benefits are great with competitively priced premiums. My specific manager is flexible with the scheduling.
good,"Work at Starbucks can be stressful at times, but there is a lot of rewarding work here. Starbucks understands that the job can be stressful in some ways and they provide great benefits. The advancement opportunities depend a lot on the people above you."
good,"There are huge gaps between what the partners are expected to deal with and what they are paid.  If I could change anything, it would be more pay for starting baristas and more flexibility for management to be supportive of things other than meeting company set metrics."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for a year and a half. They hired me to train to be an Assistant Manager but then after 3 weeks of working someone else was hired for that position over me. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall a decent experience, although can be a very difficult job in busy locations."
good,"It’s a good company to work for. Their comprehensive compensation package is the best for those in low skilled labor jobs. The only downfall of that is the pay tends to be on the lower side of the market, which can at times be difficult for those in low skilled labor jobs."
good,Was a fun environment to work in but not the best place to work if you wanted to progress within the company. The shift patterns could be okay but early starts are more often given to managers so be prepared to do more closing shifts
good,"There's a lot easier jobs out there that will pay a lot more but baristas tend to appreciate the work that they do more. The hours are inconsistent and too reliant on Teamwork, when an associate calls out it's horrible."
good,"Fun job, Amazing benefits, Great values and missions, not carried out at all locations by all the managers, but with a company THIS big it’s hard to catch all the bad eggs. Overall if you find the right store it’s worth it for the compensation. Others are run with the attitude and intensity of fast food restaurants."
good,"In the short time I worked at Starbucks it learned to multitask on many things. Management was too lenient but everyone there was very mature, so the team kept on top of their own tasks. At my location it was different than the rest of the Starbucks I would go and cover for."
good,"Starbucks is a great place for those looking to get a first job. The company does try to slash labor hours as much as possible, and because of that it feels hectic sometimes. It's easy to promote to shift Superviser, but rather difficult to promote to manager. The job is very fast paced, but will teach you efficiency."
good,"Overall my experience with Starbucks was a good one. The benefits were good and as long as you received at least 20 hours a week you could apply for benefits. "
good,"Very fast-paced work environment.  Benefits are great such as 30% all food/drinks or any other products/merchandise.  Free pound of coffee beans or Keurig cups every week.   You accumulate more paid time off the longer you work there.  "
good,"If you have a crew you like, it can be a lot of fun. You must work hard and with a team. Discounts on coffee and food are great. Would recommend for entry-level job seekers, or people looking to get into the service industry."
good,Over the 7 years I worked for Starbucks I had 5 managers. While they were all great people they didn't seem to be able to ever get the store to function sufficiently. However all of my coworkers were great hardworking people and made the hectic situations bareable.
good,"it takes a long time to figure out what you're doing, but once you do it becomes fun. make sure you're okay with working under pressure because its very fast paced"
good,"The hours can be flexible. It is a fast paced environment with a lot to get done. Supervisors are responsible for running breaks, deploying partners, cash and inventory management and normal day to day operations. There is a lot of dealing with customers. A lot of the customers are like family. There is a lot to remember but you get used to it."
good,"I would have loved to continue working at Starbucks. However, they do not value job competency as much as they should. Those who advance are usually those who do not speak up for honest change."
good,"I love the smelll of coffee. The environment. the customers. Everything is wonderful, I enjoy the sanitization process and I love making beverages to customer perfection."
good,"this was one of my favorite jobs. It was very fun and a teamwork environment. It was fast paced and kept me busy. The wage was just minimum, which wasn't enough for me which is why I left."
good,"The job was fast-paced but fun. Chatting with regular customers was often an enjoyable part of the job. Sometimes the cleaning jobs at the end of the day took too long, which meant longer hours, but management were understanding."
good,I enjoy the hours and the atmosphere. The pay isn’t the greatest but it’s decent. I’m happy I have been a part of Starbucks and I hope to work for them in the future
good,"Fun place to work and meet new people coming in for coffee or other drinks. It was tough learning the drinks, but managed to learn them quickly to move from cashier to barista."
good,"Fun place to work with the right people. Learn a lot about coffee and remembering all the drinks was hard at the beginning, but finally got the hang of it."
good,Great place to work but the problem is salery I want more then 5000 that's why I want to switch this company everything is great in this company I like to work
good,it was one of the most good job i had the only down side is that manager have favouritism. working during the holidays especially christmas and new year time was no beneficial same wages (7ph)and you have to make your own travel to work.
good,"I was stabbed in the back by my manager and a shift supervisor. They falsely accused me of doing something I would never in a million years do. So as I'm sure working at different locations is beyond awesome, my experience was sub par at best."
good,"Not my favorite job, but definitely not the worst. very stressful workload, felt overwhelmed at times. would've preferred to learn bar first and stay there for a few months to get it down better rather than every so often."
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for almost two years and the job has had its ups and downs like any other. But, aside from all that I cannot speak highly enough of the employees and management. I've had a great time thus far and would recommend the job to anyone!"
good,"Great place to work if you like a fast-paced job; there is always something to be done. Can get overwhelming at times though, and customers can be very demanding."
good,You get up super early and make hundreds of drinks by hand. Great training for future bar tending. Management hit or miss depending on location. You get a free pound of coffee every weeks which is awesome.
good,"Working for corporate stores was wonderful, but franchised locations do not care about you and pay horribly, even if you have experience. I will always go back to corporate locations but I wont work for a franchise ever again."
good,"This job involved hustle, no downtime. Learned lots about coffee. There were many phenomenal managers, unfortunately mine lacked skill in training, motivation and constructive communication. Loved the culture and customer connections."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for four years. Three years of that was as a barista, one as a supervisor. The company itself is amazing. They care about their partners (employees) and it was never just about how your store numbers were doing, it was about how the people within it were thriving. The management within my specific store and district were the issue. The hire store managers and district managers as outside hires who have no idea of Starbucks culture or how to do anything past a computer screen. It's disappointing."
good,i had a lot of fun working at starbucks especially memorizing all of the different drinks. It was a little stressful in the mornings ( when it’s the most busiest ) i wish it paid more where i live to be a barista.
good,"A pretty challenging job, fast paced, and high stress. The job can be fun if you have the right people, but a lot of the time there is a lot of incompetency."
good,For a job while in high school or college is fine. It not too many hours and the job itself isn't that difficult. The pay is fine for what it is. It would take a lot of effort and financial planning to turn this into a career.
good,Good part time job; I love it mostly I’m just moving and need more money. I wish there was more room to move up in the company. Would recommend for benefits
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced and upbeat working environment, that requires concentration, patience, delegation and time management. It is a fun and energetic place to work. There is excellent job security and wonderful benefits."
good,"Great company, poor management. Don’t like the hours nor do I like how overworked and under appreciated we are. I don’t like that we have to let customers run all over us and say thanks."
good,"Starbucks was a good fit for a college student and has opportunities, but district management often does not pay close enough attention to the store managers. From store to store there is an entirely different feel, and it almost always has something to do with the manager. Failing managers were given too many second chances, and talented supervisors were overlooked for mediocre managers because they had certain personalities, despite lacking in skills like budget management and employee development. "
good,"I liked the fact that most people that came in shopping was pretty nice unlike other places I’ve worked. If you’re trying to build up with them, there isn’t much opportunity of growth"
good,Working at Starbucks was like a dream. You don't really care that you aren't making too much money or getting benefits for the first year. The only issue I personally had was I was promised a promotion for months and even had the an interview for the position that went great! But last minute my manager transferred over a different shift and that shift gave me nothing but problems which led me to quit.
good,"As with every job there are always favorites; and in my case I was in a store I didn't necessarily fit in because of being seen as a newbie/outsider. Get past that and it's a pretty good deal if you can manage to work enough hours. I was constantly given less than 20 hours a week which is why I left, but you only need to work an average of 20 hours a week to qualify for the benefits unlike at other places where it's 40. Great opportunity there. Some very nasty entitled clientele sometimes but that's also balanced by friendly regulars you pseudo bond with. Starts comparatively a good bit above minimum wage, so if you aren't really qualified to do much definitely seek out employment there, but otherwise the pay is still laughable to attempt to live off of."
good,"Starbucks in whole is a decent company but the stores individually are not across the board. Every state, every store you go to, is completely different, and not in a good or bad way. I find the training to be subpar as standards are being dropped as the company continues to grow and raise their prices on everything and change how drinks are made along with. I wouldn't work for the company again personally, but they do offer decent benefits to employees. Management is sub par, partners are far from few extraordinary unless you go to a couple that I personally can recommend for extraordinary service/employees. If Starbucks had a standard, it has certainly not been followed for quite some time and maybe they should send some people out and secret shop every single one. You'd be amazed how many times I  have ordered one drink at one location, actually, several locations, and had it made wrong 9/10 times. Why Starbucks? You give recipe cards... how hard is it?"
good,Starbucks was a laid-back job that I loved. I would make drinks for customers while cleaning around the store. The management was split into different levels and we always had new people coming into management. I would recommend Starbucks to anyone looking for a first job.
good,"In a typical day at work you would be handed off by the current shift supervisor before you took over. You do a floor check of everything that is or is not done yet . Start sending people on their breaks while you get the store back in order and run breaks. Then you would take care of your pull to thaw to have more pastry items available for the customers. You then would continue implementing your closing play as you run final breaks. Depending on the night you also would have to take care of an order that comes in that could range between small and huge as well as a count you might have that night of sections of your inventory. I learned a lot about coffee during my time at Starbucks along with learning how to be a leader and time manage well enough to get everything done in time before you fully close down. Management depending on the store your at can be amazing they can really take it upon themselves to let the store and their employees down. I've had amazing management that has made me love coming t work and "
good,"In my years at the company, I have worked in multiple organizations. Each has very different motivations and politics. The opportunity to learn many different things is the biggest bonus of being at this company."
good,"great for a first job, not the job for people with busy schedules though its vert hard to not make starbucks your life they really expect a lot from you as a worker"
good,I did not have any complaints with working at Starbucks. I did however feel stressed at times when it would get very busy and only one person was assigned to hot bar and cold bar. I feel that they could of benefited from two people on each.
good,Need to pay more to compensate cost of living. Need to work with baristas school schedule a little bit more. It would be great if they reprimanded customers who are really rude. Instead of giving them free stuff so they’ll be happy. When that customer comes back they’ll still be really rude.
good,its an amazing challenging job with so many benefits and rewards.  work hard for what you want. There is this passion for coffee that can override all.
good,i love my job i work in 3 stores the workers a fun hard workers and friendly. the management are knowledgeable and dedicated. we are like a family is  one of the best working experience i ever had with a company.
good,"Was a good college job, not many benefits. I loved the knowledge i learned about the products. My location was on a college campus so of course the environment was fast paced and constantly busy."
good,"Fun to work but very fast paced and demanding , struggle to balance work and home. A lot do progression opportunities and plenty of on the job training"
good,"Working at Starbucks has it’s positive and negative moments. It has taught me a lot about customer service, as well as time management, however I don’t feel like my hours are fair and the management at my store is poor."
good,"Good place to start working, there is lots to learn and are greatly encouraged to succeed. The work atmosphere is very much based off team work and you learn how to communicate with others to get the job done. Management is flexible with hours and is willing to work with you as best they can."
good,"Just like any other big company, there was always conflict between the floor staff and management. But the managers that were there when I was really cared and that is more important than us agreeing on policies and SOP. My coworkers were great! The union positions are wonderful to have and the pay is good. In most positions you have to put in the time as on-call before you can get a permanent position. I never trusted the EDR food."
good,"Loved the people and job, however, they could not work with me and my school schedule all the time which caused issues in my schoolwork. Management was very helpful with any issues while on the job."
good,"my typical day is, I'd start around 4 or 5 pm and i learned so much but i never worked with my manager only supervisors, my work environment was a bit off it seemed like a lot of them didn't want to be there and i didn't really fit in but i did gain only few friends from this job. There was not that many difficult parts of the job it was super simple, possibly getting all the complex orders right. The most enjoyable was the customers and me getting to serve them, I loved the customer service part f it."
good,"Starbucks as a company offers incredible benefits to their employees. I was able to receive a BA degree at no cost with their SCAP program. The daily job is not easy and is fast paced. Customers of course could be difficult and even rude, but that's just the nature of the industry. The employees I supervised could be unreliable and there were plenty of time that we were understaffed and overworked. There was little to no positive reinforcement at my particular store which was frustrating, but the benefits outweighed the negative aspects. Their insurance is affordable and effective as well which is a huge reason most of the employees chose to work there. I learned very valuable communication skills and problem solving skills during my time there. The free drinks and food make the day more bearable. Overall, I didn't enjoy being a barista, but it was absolutely worth it for the education and college degree that I earned."
good,Enjoyed the benefits and some managers not all. Some are too focused on making the numbers than about their baristas and that’s what ruined it for me. Also I started working with all the wrong people because my manager was hiring the wrong people
good,"The people (partners) that I have crossed paths over the course of my 14 year career here is what keeps me here first.  Secondly, I was able to utilize the skills and competencies I have learned over the years and transfer to different departments to continue to learn, develop and add value to an organization."
good,"Working at Starbucks and interacting with the customers is great. They have wonderful incentives, benefits, and usually good customers. The only down part of the job (any job) Is cattiness and an unwelcoming work environment."
good,The company mission and values started out being excellent but as the company has grown this has not been the case!  They have hired from the outside many Leaders  that do not follow the mission and values of the company.
good,"Starbucks was the first real job I ever had. Their ASU partnership has been an amazing benefit not only for me, but for others who thought they could never achieve a higher education. The pay is fine, management is fine most of the time, and they do offer many opportunities for growth (although it can take more work for someone to promote internally.) Starbucks is dedicated to people, the community, customers, and their partners. There will be good and bad things at every store, and I am the first to admit that there have been days when work has been both physically and emotionally draining. But in the long run, I enjoy what I do and would recommend it as a place to work."
good,It was a great company and allowed for flexible hours while I wwas going to school.  Management changed a lot.  I had 9 different managers in my 5 years with the company.  They would train them and move them along to bigger stores.  It was hard to establish a baseline and it would get old when we got a new manager and they wanted to change everything all over again.
good,"If you're going to work in foodservice, you could do worse than Starbucks. It was my experience, at least at the three stores where I worked, that hours were plentiful and flexible, benefits were good, and pay was better than average. It's a stressful job at times, but I always felt prepared. Training modules and workflow procedures are thoughtfully designed on a corporate level with input from the in-store workers who actually use them. This means that not only do standard operating procedures generally make sense, they're the same store to store, meaning it's pretty easy to relocate when you need to. I found management, for the most part, to be competent, engaged, and focused on growing their employees. All in all, if you need a side gig or an entry-level job, it's not a bad idea to start out as a barista at Starbucks--and if you have the knack for it and want to move up, you probably can."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are a team-player and work with others who are the same way. It's very fast paced and challenging at times, so communication is key."
good,"If you have a good manager: Starbucks is great. "
good,This job was good because I was in high school still and they worked around my schedule. I liked working here but I didn't plan on being there for a long period of time.
good,Fast paced and goal oriented. Employee focused as well as customer focused. great benefits and ability to develop in higher roles. Support from Higher management could be a little more intense at times.
good,"You will have to work hard and it can be very stressful. However, if you have a good team working with you it will be a breeze and you will have a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. I would not recommend staying here for a long time, it can be very difficult to advance your career especially if you wanted to be corporate. Starbucks rarely hires within their retail employees."
good,"It's not a bad job. I like the community. Most costumers are usually very kind. I never worked at Starbucks in the past. I only knew I was going to be working here for a few months so I don't mind all the stress it causes. If you have the option to work at a cafe Starbucks versus a Starbucks with a drive-thru, I highly recommend choosing the Starbucks without the drive-thru."
good,Can be a fun place to work but is a very fast paced work environment. Benefits are great if utilized and the tuition reimbursement is amazing! Worth working here if planning on going to school.
good,"Working at Starbucks comes with so many benefits! (ASU education, medical/dental, 401k, opportunity for investments in stocks, and of course free drinks!) ."
good,"Starbucks is a fun fast-paced place to work. You need to have a sense of urgency and be a team player. If that fits your personality it can be a rewarding environment, though not for the faint of heart-customer base is very diverse!"
good,"It took me three months to feel independent on the bar and six months for me to become an independent Barista. The menu is extensive and often customized, but it basically comes down to following directions. Teamwork and communication is key for a good shift. It helped me learn how to become a quick witted person, deal with customer relations, learn to work with a team of people, and so on."
good,great place to start if you have no work experience. its swell to work in a fast pace enviroment. never a dull moment. you will never find the caliber of customers that there is at starbuckcs
good,"On the one hand, the starting pay at Starbucks is a lot higher than many other retail/hourly positions in the area. Right before coming to Starbucks, I briefly worked at a Kroger where I made 8.85/hr. That being said, I've done the math and even working at Starbucks 40 hours a week for $9/hr is still not enough to comfortably live in the area. I know for a fact that Starbucks makes enough money as a corporation to pay its employees a living wage, but it does not."
good,"Awesome!! People were great,very patient. And loved the usuals ( they people that come in very regularly). Was mostly always busy. Just sucked we couldn't keep our tips :("
good,"A typical day would usually consist of restocking, cleaning, and making sure everything was in order. The cafe was located in a university, therefore, our ""rush hours"" varied from day and occasions. Some nights were extremely busy and sometimes certain products would run out."
good,"depending on where you work, you might get screwed with a lazy manger or a very unskilled, unprofessional manager. I worked at three different locations in 4 years. 2 of those I had fantastic management who wanted to help you advance your career. One store I went through three managers in 4 months. all were hired from outside of Starbucks and it caused a huge dissatisfaction across the entire store. My advice to some of the district managers? HIRE FROM WITHIN."
good,"This was by far my favorite job. I loved my entire team and my customers. But once our store manager left, everyone starting leaving and we got a new store manager who was awful and a bully. The store was filled with all new employees and it just wasn't the same anymore. The current store manager would yell, bully, insult and talk to me like I was dog in front of guests and other employees."
good,Starbucks is a great company. They offer so much benefits and really care about their staff members. I was with the company for 2 years and I loved it until I transferred upstate to another store and the manage their was horrible.
good,"I used to love working there, but towards the end I went through some personal problems and a lot of my coworkers were just horrible about it and making fun of me. I had some racist coworkers and customers."
good,Would usually come in for closing and would have to make drinks. I would also have to start get rid of items going bad at the end of the night and prep products for the opener in the morning. I enjoyed learning how to make all of the different drinks.
good,"A typical day at work is usually fast-paced and demanding, but when working with a good team of coworkers, engaging with customers and making drinks while also maintaining a clean workspace is very doable."
good,Starbucks is a fun and vibrant workplace which is perfect for a student. There is a constant supply of customers so there is never a dull moment when on the job.
good,"The team was great, management wasnt too professional. lack of hours. The good was you were able to pick up shifts at other locations to make up tp 40 hrs a week."
good,"La mia valutazione generale in merito alla mia esperienza lavorativa presso Starbucks è sicuramente positiva perché mi ha permesso di entrare in contatto con una realtà del tutto diversa dalla mia sotto ogni punto di vista, intendo non soltanto professionale, ma anche personale in quanto, ho avuto la possibilità di lavorare a stretto contatto con persone di diversa nazionalità e cultura, con storie lavorative e personali diverse."
good,"i worked for starbucks for two years and enjoyed my time there. There was limited opportunities to get promotions though. There was a lot of rude customers, but the staff made it bearable."
good,"Starbucks is a decent part time job but not ideal for advancement. They provided good benefits and full tuition reimbursement, which was great. However, customer service isn't ideal for everyone."
good,"Not what it used to be. Still a fun, great place to work. Great coffee, great environment. Great first job or part time job. Pay could be better. Gotta love coffee."
good,Starbucks can be fast paced and tiring but its all worth it when you work with people who have the same values as you. My biggest problem was the work/life balance because they ask a lot of you
good,Starbucks was a fantastic job for a 19 year old living in New York other than the fact that I till couldn't support myself on the hourly I made. Good opportunity for young people to learn how to be a professional.
good,"Working at Starbucks was at times incredibly fun and rewarding while also being a complete nightmare. The regular customers were usually pretty great while some could be very nasty. I was given the hours I requested which made it easier to balance my personal life. However, we were constantly understaffed and many other employees didn't take the job seriously and refused to show up on time so we couldn't go home until they got there. For some reason my manager refused to fire them and hire replacements. Also whenever we called in sick or had an emergency we were made to feel guilty like we had done something wrong."
good,"Paid biweekly, tips every Tuesday."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work don't get me wrong, HOWEVER, the starting pay is 9.15 an hour in South Florida and if you are lucky enough to advance to a shift supervisor (it takes some people years to advance), you may be able to make $12.50. "
good,"Stressful as heck. "
good,Very relaxed environment but too demanding of students or people with other responsibilities sometimes. Good for people who have open availability at all times but not for students or others with second jobs.
good,When i got to work i would log in wash hands greet my coworkers then read my position for the day. I learned quickly that you help out where ever you can or you will get in trouble.I really enjoyed the customers. We always had satisfied people even if there was a problem
good,Starbucks is the first job for a lot of people. It was my first full time job and an enjoyable place to enter the work force. They helped me learn structure and time management as well as giving me a love for people.
good,"I started at Starbucks because I love coffee and I needed a new job. I learned a lot about their company, their coffee, and myself. I don't know if I would ever work at Starbucks again, as I feel they're straying away from what their core company was when they first opened. Too many fancy frappuccinos and not enough hand-crafted coffee. My heart is with coffee, not sweet drinks. "
good,Starbuck's offers tuition reimbursement which is something more and more companies are offering. Definitely take advantage of this benefit. It is accelerated and makes showing up for work everyday worth its weight in gold.
good,"From day one, you slowly learn all of the usual customer names, and build relationships with not only coworkers, but with the customers as well. It's a fun job, plus the coffee is great!"
good,"the people i work with are the best, i enjoy all of them; they make me feel at home and no question is a bad question. everyone is willing to help when needed and always willing to provide the teaching and training skills needed to succeed within the company"
good,"Great Place to work but salary is not great at all. Great training program and the shift goes by quick due to high volume of customers. "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Some stores are managed better than others. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to travel around and work at multiple stores and experience the different management styles and how they affected the staff. In retrospect, my time with the company served me well for where I currently am in my professional career."
good,"I have mixed emotions about Kroger Starbucks. I love a lot of my coworkers and the work environment of Kroger, but they are not always understanding with availability, and the pay is quite sad. Management refuses to hire another worker with better availability (even though most of the baristas are students). I would enjoy my job more if I was paid better for my hard work. Other than these problems, it is a great place to work, and I would highly recommend it as a first job. Everybody is very friendly and welcoming."
good,"Didn't have a store manager, so a long term shift supervisor took over, stressful management, but other than that fun place to work. Coworkers were great. Benefits were nice."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the customers I encounter on a daily basis. The customer interaction is what makes me enjoy my job.
good,"It can be stressful and is often times not worth the pay. The benefits are great if you meet the minimum hours required to receive them, which can be hard to do sometimes if corporate wants the managers to cut labor hours. The customers can be terrible but some can also be very very kind. They easily make it worth going into work."
good,Starbucks managers are very lazy. Well most of them in the district I was in. They don’t set there workers up for success and then complain when things aren’t looking up to standard.
good,working at Starbucks i learned a lot about every partner and management. at the location i was at a lot of it was favoritism. that was one of the reasons why i left besides the hours.
good,"Working for Starbucks, a company with a mission like a heart of gold, lays the groundwork for cultivating awareness in how we affect the public coming into our stores.  We want to begin the day by ensuring our shop is welcoming, clean, and brewing fresh coffee.  We learn how to work together as a team.  One team, one purpose. Management does their best,  The hardest part is letting the negative customers roll off of you and not set you up to transfer negative energy to later customers. IT's amazing to create special moments in people's day though. Through coffee and connection."
good,"Depends on what location you work, managers could care more about volume than cleanliness. Can't speak too much about it, everyone is different!!!!!!!"
good,"This job was a good experience overall. It was fun when working with coworkers who knew what they were doing, but management always cared more about quantity over quality when it came to staffing. Despite never having enough people available at any time, employees were expected to make a personal connection with every customer we came into contact with, and also get their orders out quickly and accurately. "
good,"At the end of the day its a business to make profit and that's what counts. It can be great if you have a well oiled team, if it is new and your team is new and green then its a lot of hard work."
good,A typical work day was fast paced and outgoing. The management was easy going and there was little conflict among staff. They ensured that the employees had the training and knowledge needed to make coffee and ensure the customer was satisfied.
good,Honestly I have no problem with my job but financially it doesn’t fit all the needs I have right now. The people are great and the environment is beautiful.
good,apply for this job if you really like coffee. You can grab 1lb of coffee bean for free which is nice. Drink at least 3 drinks per shifts. Get 30 % discount on any food/merchandise from the store.
good,"This was a great company to work for and they offered great benefits to those who worked enough to afford them, but I found that they did not compensate enough to the long term employees for them to survive in this city."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a very beneficial experience. I got to help many customers try new things, and widen there knowledge of coffee. The atmosphere was great, everyone I worked with was complimenting each other and the management pushed that. I loved making coffee, trying new coffee, and recommending coffee to friends and family. Overall the job was good."
good,Starbucks was a fun and immersive work environment.  Always on the go and always had a good time.  All the partners are more of a family than we were coworkers.  The only downside was the store managers they started to hire.
good,Loved my job.  I would love to return to a Starbucks location at any time in the near future period and be a barista or supervisor again. I am relocating to another state and area and I think I could bring my knowledge to the new territory
good,"The environment was pleasant, and all coworkers and almost all guests were great. However, like in all service businesses, there many guests that would make working less desirable. Nonetheless, the company has great benefits. It's a good side gig to have."
good,"A special service job experience. I have met and known many great coworker from different countries, it was really lovely to work with them and learn the culture from them. However, it is still quite difficult to get the promotion opportunities in Starbucks. Moreover, the salary cannot completely afford to live in London."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a collaborative effort. The partners on the team really dictate how good of an experience you have. For me my day was dictated by the partners with which I worked, ranging from effortless and fun to stressful and not enjoyable. As with most service industry jobs, working with customers can easily be the most difficult part of the job."
good,"While working at Starbucks, it has improved my multi-tasking skills, kept me sane at stressful and/or high paced situations. Another skills such as improving my customer service skills. Starbucks has gotten me ready for my future than any other job I've had."
good,Starbucks is a fun environment to work in. You become a family with all your customers and coworkers. Unfortunately near the end of my time there upper management became more worried about pushing more people in and out for times than sticking with their original plan of making starbucks a third place in peoples life's. They cut hours given to stores but made the expectations even higher and harder to achieve with only 2-3 people on the floor.
good,Being a supervisor allowed me to work and coach amazing coworkers in a fun environment. Very fast paced work. Hardest part was the young people not showing up.
good,It’s a perfect place to work if you love coffee and creating art! Be ready for the busy spells and working under pressure though! Great staff and fun to work with!
good,I would recommend it over any other concept in the Travel Plaza location I work at. I am the manager of Starbucks in the Travel Plaza with Hms Host Inc.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Starbucks, I left due to having to move further away from my job and it became harder to go there everyday, I would definitely love to work there again as I still remember recipes and procedures."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company, the mission and values are everything. "
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks would be making coffee and other caffeine drinks and interacting with multiple customers.  I learned how to be more courteous to people and that with the right amount of effort, people would open up and be cordial.  The hardest part of the job was unloading the order by yourself when others tended to ignore the job and didn't participate.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to experiment with making drinks and craft items."
good,Great company to work for but not in midtown Manhattan horrible District Managers and Regional director manager no diversities  and rude and vindictive you will be praised until something bad happened and you are on the bad list
good,"typical day at Starbucks, is never the same day twice. Need to be fast on your feet and fast with the problem solves. "
good,"The job and people are great, until they get an out of house hire. After that happens the partner experience degrades, and toxic relationships begin to form. moment my boss realized I was leaving she tossed me aside and didnt treat me human,"
good,Estuve 2 años trabajando en esta cafetería y a la par estudiaba. Los horarios eran flexibles lo cual me permitió trabajar sin descuidar la escuela.
good,"I have loved working for Starbucks, but I have struggled with my upper management so much. The company provides so many great benefits, and the coffee culture is wonderful, but my experience was stunted by upper management who didn't make me feel valued."
good,"Working at Starbucks has a lot of pros such as Healthcare benefits, ASU degree online opportunity, overall culture of happy and supportive people, flexible hours, discounts, 401K and stock options, etc."
good,"The experience with Starbucks was very fun in the beginning. I had and awesome team and a great manager. I later, was transferred to another store down the block to get trained as a supervisor there. Achieved my promotion within 6 months. At the time it was very neighborhood friendly. We knew all our regulars and everyone loved our store. I made sure that most my customers left happy and satisfied."
good,"good people to work for and with, but the pay is extremely low. Not many hours are promised. Can pick up hours from other stores and able to use benefits at every store."
good,"Starbucks m'a beaucoup apporté, "
good,"I really love starbucks as a job in general let alone the off work experience. I love the different faces an personalities of the costumers, the foreign experiences that randomly occur are magnificent. Starbucks was a job i never seen myself getting rid of any time soon, i do wish there was a better way to choose what type of person they decide to hire as manager in a sense one who maintains a great sense of direction an knows how to maintain a controlled state of mind when in stress. Starbucks corporation overall gives there workers a chance at a beautiful experiance."
good,"Your main goal in Starbucks is the World Class Service attitude, you will be tasked with understanding how to use all of the equipment and how to clean it. Once you have that understood you will than begin to learn the recipes for the drinks and other food sources they provide to your customers. The workplace culture is very friendly and most of the time you will get along with those you work with. A-lot of the employees there are younger and are in school so its a great place to work if you need your work schedule to support your school schedule. The best part of the job for me was the encouragement to be creative in making the drinks."
good,"The benefits and ideas that Starbucks provide and promote with their partners are all things that I support. It is all very poorly executed though. Management is often lacking and disorganized, and many partners do not care for their job, or they are quite hypocritical in action. There are a few partners in both stores that I've worked in that thrive on bullying and they turn what is supposed to be a welcoming work environment into a high school drama competition. I started working with Starbucks to live out the principles they promote, but there are too many partners living against them and corrupting the company and environment. I love the customers. I love the relationships I form with them and most of the partners I work with. It's hard to enjoy that on the days I work with those few partners (both are shift supervisors, so they have a larger impact on environmental energy.)"
good,I've learned a lot about customer service as well as how a business works. Trainers are very well prepared and you will always have any questions answered. Manager always available and coworkers are great to get along with.
good,"Starbucks was my first job. Though I very much enjoyed the environment and people, it was extremely exhausting, overwhelming, and confusing. My personal training only lasted for a few hours over the span of about five days. As a Starbucks team member, one is required to do far too much for the amount of money they pay. However, I couldn't have asked for a better manager and coworkers. Overall, as scary as it was at times, I enjoyed it."
good,Offers amazing benefits with a flexible schedule. Raise .50c after six months and rarely offers raises after that if it extends .10c. Very demanding physical and mental attention to detail during peak hours. If the manager is great so will your job experience.
good,"A good place to work if management is good, which was applicable at the location I worked. "
good,"I recommend Starbucks to everyone, but it just wasn't in my cards, unfortunately. It has a very friendly environment and  great health benefits. I likes working with the people, but it was undoubtfully stressful pace and unrealistic expectations."
good,"the store i worked at lacked management and by that i mean those managers did not know a thing about running a store, never really cared about the baristas. the hardest part of the job would be the never ending line with a short staff which is usually all the time, but the most enjoyable part was making the drinks and making conversation with customers meeting new people every day."
good,"This is a good company overall but at times the work can be stressful and tiring because usual operations seem like that of being short one person. The benefits are great, and management can definitely make or break the experience."
good,"Typical day starts by meeting with the previous shift supervisor. Duties are easy to complete but may become relatively difficult if short staffed and busy.  Working with customers was very fun and the most enjoyable part of the job, but staying focused on keeping all areas clean is a must."
good,"Starbucks is a hodgepodge of your local flavor with modern amenities. When you walk in the door, your visit will feel familiar but you can always expect something to be new as you are greeted by a friendly staff with expectations to perform. Whether you like it or not, it will leave a lasting impression."
good,"Long hours, a lot of under-staffing. Its great when you have a caring manager but it sucks when you dont. Getting promoted is not easy and the level of pay compared to the commitment and responsibilities you have on your day to day are not worth it"
good,"I really love the fact that this company is flexible with the schedule which makes it the perfect job for college students. It is physically demanding at times and yes you need to have a lot of patience, sometimes the customers can be very nasty or particular.  You learn a lot about regulations and what it means to give the starbucks experience to customers."
good,"I never truly felt appreciated when I worked there. It was mostly just a number on the floor like most of the people. Management was poor, and quite a few other employees felt that... which is why there was so much gossip, which included the manager being a part of it. Overall, co-workers weren't awful, made some good friends in the long run, but I'm glad I am no longer there."
good,"Good work vibes very relaxed. I had friendly manager and supervisor. They didnt put their work off to the newbies, they were very helpful. I enjoyed working there."
good,"At Starbucks I have further developed my strong work ethic, by successfully progressing through my barista training and working according to company standards."
good,"Working at Starbucks has taught me a lot about teamwork, patients, and leadership. I've made many lasting relationships and pleasant memories working at Starbucks. However, Starbucks lower-level management leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"I was a returning barista, so my training was basically catching up on the new stuff for the past 10 years and learning how the store operated. They really try to keep baristas at what most places consider part time, but you get full time benefits at Starbucks for being over 20 hours a week. "
good,"Starbucks is a great pitstop/temporary job. As a career, the company leaves a lot to be desired in terms of benefits for long term employees. I have been a supervisor for 4 years, and make about $.40 more than the base rate of pay for supervisors, which is more than a little insulting for a company that prides itself on how well it takes care of its employees."
good,"It was a fun fast paced job but the management and chance of advancement were lacking."
good,"I’ve learn new thing about vast and diverse coffee world. Coffee beans came from selected region from Asia to South America. There is four factor to determine the quality of coffee. Aroma, Acidity, Body, and Flavour. Starbucks Coffee used three type of Espresso machine in Malaysia. That is Mastrena, Verismo, and La Marzocco. I’ve used to make coffee by using the Mastrena machine. I’m feel glad and thankful to the Store Manager who help me a lot and giving me good advice and guidance."
good,Starbucks does not excel at much unless compared to other retailers.  The pay is targeted at the 50 percentile so it is intended to be not overly competitive.
good,"I opened which was at 4:30am and so my days felt long and it was not a good match for me. I worked this job in high school in the mornings before I went to school, so once I was out of high school it just didn't feel like the right fit anymore."
good,Typical coffee shop job. A great team environment makes the job worth it. Easy to find additional hours if you want to work more. I had a lot of fun working here while going to college.
good,"I worked in the drive-thru a good part of my time with Starbucks, I began to have regulars daily and I enjoyed building friendships with them. The job in itself is stressful and if you don't have a strong team things can get out of order really fast. Overall I enjoyed my coworkers and the job."
good,"Pay is really low but easy to switch shifts and transfer if moving. Fast paced and high expectations but the training is not adequate. LOts of turnover, so many new people who don't know what they are doing."
good,Starbucks is a job that requires commitment and interest in the craft. It is fun and educating. You meet people from everywhere and experience great career moments.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks, the quick paced environment and the discount perks were great. There was often many hours available. I would happily work there again. I would hope for a much more consistent schedule though."
good,"I feel in love with the culture that is Starbucks; the coffee, people and conversations. After getting in a solid routine work felt more like a second home."
good,"Fun job overall, making drinks are easy. After a while you just get burnt out. Making drinks is fun, taking orders is a nightmare sometimes. I always looked forward to the holiday drinks."
good,"Family like environment, very understanding management team, great benefits, not so great bi weekly pay, not so great training modules, management playing favorites"
good,Starbucks is a great job the customers are friendly and they offer great benefits. They also offer free college for all partners as well as stocks to invest in the company
good,"I really enjoyed my time at starbucks, but it often suffered from poor management or a lack of man hours. Expect to be understaffed when you are working, as often times you will be. As pay rates increase, generally hours available would decrease. They have great flexibility, and good opportunity for promotion as well as transfer if you move. But you never quite feel like you consistently have the amount of people you need on the floor, or you have an over abundance of people."
good,Working for Starbucks looks fun and it is but it is anything but easy. You have to be able to work in a fast pace environment and learn quick. Make quick decisions on your feet. Have an up beat and fun demeanor. Each store has its own personality and some people fit in better with a specific store than others.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. I enjoy working there and I appreciate the standards that were set in place by the Starbucks company. The standards allow barista trainers to be consistent when training new hires.
good,I like working for this company. However this really depends on the managers. I was hired by a great manager and he was amazing. Then he got promoted and a new manager came. This manager was a nightmare. It was so bad that half the store transfer out into different stores. This is when I things went from bad to worse. The manager at this new store just quit one day so we didn't have a manager for months. Then finaly we got a new one and she was amazing until she wasn't. I loved this job when There was good management.
good,"We take pride in the products we create, and what the company represents and stands up for, supporting its employees with a strong culture of compassion and community is ever-present.   "
good,In 2013 I entered my Starbucks career as a barista this job I've been trying to get for almost half a decade. When I finally achieve that I got promoted within 6 months to shift  supervisor. unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances I had to transfer back home from Cleveland to Youngstown. I was promised a panel for assistant manager for three years of my Starbucks career and never got a chance to. But instead I ended up training three of their store managers but never got a chance to be a store manager myself.
good,"我認為是個可以學習銷售與學習和客戶交流的工作內容,不僅可以學習到專業的咖啡知識及咖啡製作,也可以學習和認識到銷售面的執行方式."
good,Company will take care of its employees. The benefits are good along with given stocks and discounts. Always willing to train and develop its employees if wanted to stay in company.
good,"Left company due to poor management, not company itself."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. Very fun and very great benefits, but depending on your location and store type, you can experience super busy days and a lot of possible stress."
good,"The drinks and recipes are ridiculous to have to remember, but this job definitely cares about how you feel while at work. The benefits are amazing: free coffee at work, free coffee take home, free food items, health, vision, dental, and stock benefits!"
good,"All my experiences working for starbucks have been great. Ive never had a bad day at work. I do wish that I had more time to build within the brand, however with a primary job its difficult."
good,"Fast paced work, everyone was cool to talk with. Team work was pretty ok. Pay sucked as I was never allowed to work full time unless I was a shift manager. Otherwise hourly pay was pretty fair at the time for me, about $8 an hour. Requesting off was in as long as you did it 3 weeks in advanced, which was changed from the usual 2 weeks in advanced. I always argued with my manager. She was super bubbly and I just wasnt that person. Even though i worked hard, went above and beyond, the manager was just meh. Never around, always on vacation, and hardly on the floor when it was more than busy enough to request for help."
good,Not a bad place to work. Pay was low and room for advancement was limited. I liked the job and would have stayed much longer if the pay was better. I'd recommend it most to students or people looking for a second job.
good,Starbucks is a great company filled with great people and the skills I learned there will help me along in life.. However it is not a company to invest in long term. They do not promote within and the pay is too low to live off off. The wage doesn't change and the amount of work does not constitute the pay. I was understaffed many times in order to save money and favoritism was a big deal. Go for the experience but don't stay too long.
good,"It's a good place to gain experience if you are a student and looking for part-time work. It's very fast paced.  If it's slow, you can go home early.   like the environment."
good,buen ambiente laboral pero en mi tiempo en el trabajo no estoy muy seguro si hacían test psicológicos ya que entraron trabajadores agresivos con los clientes y con los mismos trabajadores
good,"Nice environment but I would have liked to have seen a more diverse hiring quotient.  Mostly young kids going to college and not a steady feel of your neighborhood ""bar""."
good,"Many benefits and flexibility to the job, however the hours were long and stressful with unfair compensation. It was a great experience in my early 20's but I would not want to work for them again."
good,"The pay is marginal. But culture is good, management is lenient and honestly I wish they would be a little more up front with their expectations. However, I had a good experience aside from personal issues that caused me to leave and would recommend it as a relaxed job with a lowish pay if someone is desperate."
good,"I work at one of the busiest Starbucks in the nation. The day is chaotic and often has many set backs that affects the work environment and those who work there. The management is excellent and the manager is the best by far. However, the support from the higher ups needed to get things accomplished and to improve the work environment is slow at best.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the angry customers who are traveling. The most enjoyable part of the job is having fun with your coworkers. Many times your coworkers are what get you through the day. Otherwise, most Starbucks are very easy to work at. And the benefits are excellent."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Starbucks. Its fast-pace environment , which l loved. Team-work is key when it comes to working as a barista. And there is room for advancement in the business."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast paced place to work for a first time job. I started working at Starbucks when I was in college and started out full time. Throughout the years I really bonded with the other partners I worked with and still keep in touch 11 years later."
good,"making drinks is fun, and customers arent so bad, but management was generally lacking. no calling in, no sick days. no healthcare unless you work 25 hours a week."
good,"Each store as its own personality from the people that work there. Fast paced, high stress. early early mornings. dealing with crabby people at times as well as craby co workers"
good,"working at Starbucks can be a lot under pressure, how outcome to a fun day with the working environment and the productivity of Starbucks partners.The most things I gained while working there was building relationships and connections with customers and work."
good,"Working in a high volume travel store, the atmosphere was usually pretty hectic. That being said, I don't really have anything negative to say about the company. As for positive aspects; great benefits, perks, and opportunities!"
good,"Quick paced environment ."
good,It was my first job. The names and codes of the orders were overwhelming to me. And I had a hard time balancing work and school. But the job also taught me a lot. I was exposed to a different environment where I learned new skills.
good,A stressful job with no clear advancement opportunities.  Great benefits and great people.  Inconsistent and demanding work schedules. Sometimes feels like you aren't given the time to actually do all of the work you're responsible for.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you're starting out or going to school. I was promoted to supervisor in about a year, but after working for 8 years, I have hit the glass ceiling. Roles for ASM are very limited and it's very competitive."
good,"Got a free Starbucks drink before and after work and got one on your break. Also got a free pound of coffe every month. Fellow workers were great and got a lot of work done, could be very busy but always did our best to get things going smoothly. Managers helped and were great people to work with also."
good,"A fun minimum wage job that doesnt require a lot of effort. Can get slammed during rushes, but it’s a team effort and they help you get through every step of the day."
good,Starbucks was decent. However the micromanaging made the company uncomfortable. Managers were taught multiple skills that we were not able to utilize to our full capacity.
good,"Working at Starbucks as a supervisor can be a rollercoaster ride. You have your good and the bad, but overall it's great while in school; the perfect side job."
good,Very fun environment. Went into depth with training. Great customers. Split tips. Great group of people to work with. I had this job in high school and had a family issue that I didn't think they understood.
good,Ok to work for. Management was not great though. Would not work around my school schedule and was not good at keeping me under my hours that I was supposed to get as a minor.
good,"My fellow employees at Starbucks became my family. We were all supportive of each other's career goals and ambitions, The staff really made each other feel great, not only about my job security but, me as a person"
good,"Licenced stores were awful to work at, while corporate ones were much better. Anything regarding the corporate stores was great- management, benefits, etc."
good,It was fun working there just needed more money to survive. I was trying to move out my parents home so I needed a more stable job to be able to provide for myself.
good,"Starbucks taught me a lot about time management and provided me with the resources needed to advance in the company. Management was always open-door and allowed me to voice my opinions, whether or not they were taken into consideration. "
good,"Starbucks was overall a good experience but there was a great deal of turnover from the District Manager down to Partners. The company have great benefits but when put against the stress of the job and in my case the commute, changing locations is a difficult procedure in this area, I find myself more healthy both in body and mind since separating from the company."
good,"-Can be very quick paced and very busy."
good,I like my coworkers and our customers that come in but I personally began to dislike the work that I had to do. Our new manager isn't the best either.
good,I liked working here. Relaxed environment most of the time. Expect for the morning naturally. But a great peolpe. Fun to make new drinks and connect with customers you see pretty much every day
good,"Si vous êtes initialement motivé(e), Starbucks offre de rapides évolutions de carrière avec des formations en management intéressantes. "
good,"Fine workplace when trained correctly, have to have a lot of patience when dealing with customer. If you work there at a young age, you have to be prepared to deal with older people misjudging your abilities."
good,"Nice environment for a student job. Cool discount, good atmosphere. I will recommend this job for student, give you a good first experience in working under pressure when it's crowded, team management skills...."
good,"Preparing employee schedules, ordering store inventory and establishing daily operations among the team; counting and reporting inventory numbers, organizing company documentations for direct supervisor, keeping up with documentations of product orders and invoices; scheduling department head meetings; communicating with customers to ensure a productive and delightful experience and , sales transactions"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of bonding with my coworkers and making drinks. We'd laugh and learn new things about each other. It was an open place, where we could enjoy ourselves as we worked. It was stressful, when we got busy, but it was an interesting experience."
good,"This is a demanding job, that requires multitasking at the highest level.  If you have a good manager and partners, it can be a fun place to work.  "
good,An early shift could mean starting at 5:00am and hearing the coffee beans being ground into what turns into a cup of morning delight is what makes me wake up.  The smell of fresh brewed coffee alongside the easy morning atmosphere that slowly buzzes to life helps me see that I can really shape an interaction I have with every individual I encounter.
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks. I gave Comp/ Benefits 3 stars because while the benefits are great, compensation is minimal. Same with job security/advancement. To advance is difficult beyond shift supervisor."
good,"I LOVED working at Starbucks. Unfortunately, the store manager and the general manager at my store were definitely not the best. Because of this, we were often under-staffed and therefore beyond stressed out. If it weren't for the poor management, I would have not left."
good,you get free coffee and most times you work with great people. pretty okay pay and great benefits. not terrible hours either. you also get free food too.
good,"Work at starbucks was always new, from day to day. Work relationships soon become outside friendships, which is welcoming. The best part of the job is having fun with regular customers. The worst part is the expectations put on us when staffing was an issue."
good,Starbucks was a fun and cool pace to work to out east in long island but once you transfer to the city its a cutthroat corporate monster. if you can handle the beast youll love it.
good,"The team I worked with were all really lovely. Like one giant family, we always got good customer service, generous hours. Management were great, firm but fair and gave rewards when our store was doing well."
good,"A super fun & typically busy place to work. Met tons of awesome people and it's very convenient that you can work at any Starbucks. Management is honestly different at every location so it's hard to say how that is, but most of my experiences were good. Personally, I love making drinks & interacting with the customers. You need to be prepared to be fast paced though & deal with different demands."
good,"Working here was fun, but stressful during peak hours. High turnover. New manager was not great. Most regular customers were wonderful. It was hard for me to wake up at 4 am to open but it was great being done with work for the day at 1 pm. I also love the free pound of coffee every week."
good,"Working for Starbucks is overall a very positive experience.  The quality of experience depends largely on your direct manager.  I have worked in well run stores and the opposite.  Starbucks provides amazing benefits and is an extremely easy company to work for.  They are great for providing a flexible schedule and balancing work + life.  The culture is inclusive.  The pace is very fast and the job is not always glamorous.  You have to be willing to clean.  Most stores have developed a closeness between the partners and makes for a positive work environment.  "
good,"I have enjoyed the almost 3 years that I have worked at Starbucks. Initially it can be challenging to learn everything, but once you have it down, it is easy. My coworkers are great and its a fun atmosphere to work in."
good,"It was ok for a college job, but you might have a rough time trying to make the jump from barista to management, they seem to prefer outside hires. I personally watched highly qualified and respected workers get passed over, only to have inexperienced managers get brought in, flail around learning the business, and burn out/get fired. Then I got to watch it happen again."
good,"Benefits don't show up in spendable dollars in a paycheck. It's wrong to offer so many benefits and undercut peoples pay. Let them opt in to certain benefits if they want. And if you pay people more they might be more inclined to stay, instead of the high turn over rate you get."
good,"This is a great job to have while pursuing an education.  As a career, too much favoritism culture prevents the promotion of deserving partners over the manager's favorite barista."
good,You can really grow some transferrable skills and meet some good friends.  Great job as a barista.  Not really set up for a manager to succeed long term.
good,Really enjoyed my time at Starbucks worked with a really good time of people management where great and learnt a lot about the company and products in my time there. discounted food and free coffee was a bonus.
good,"Starbucks was an enriching experience although not for me. A faced past work environment was fine, yet I took a while to adapt to the speed. Very fun."
good,"Your experience will really depend on your store, your coworkers and management. My store was organized and for the most part my supervisors were great."
good,Being apart of such a highly active community allows me to interact with a plethora of customers and co-workers akin. The work culture is better than most jobs I have worked at and the workers feel a deep connection to their roles and the needs of customers. Overall a good environment.
good,Starbucks is a company that has alot of pros but many cons and it's not for everybody. Good while it lasted but you come to a point where you're done.
good,"Working as a barista was a great job. I loved making drinks and talking to costumers. However, if you step up to be a shift supervisor the pay only went up by one dollar from your minimum wage barista pay and you had 3 times as much responsibility. I highly recommend working as a barista as a part time job."
good,"All team members ( baristas ) come with different backgrounds, which together we become an AMAZING TEAM. Benefits are awesome, 401k is awesome, management is awesome."
good,Overall good company with decent benefits.  Fun atmosphere.  Good place to see if you can be quick and efficient with tasks and to learn customer service.
good,"Once you arrived, you would be assigned a role for a portion of your shift. Depending on the time of day, it was incredibly busy and the workload was demanding. Most of the people I worked with were wonderful. Starbucks offers to pay for your BS/BA degree through ASU if you work at least 20 hours. Overall, it was a positive experience."
good,"poor management over all, but a great team and strong bond between one barista to another.fast paced and often challenging. good benefits and great pay"
good,I highly enjoy working at Starbucks. There's so much more to it than just coffee. You have hand on experience creating drinks and it's a very cool skill to acquire. Becoming the first face some people see in the morning and getting to know them like family through a drive-thru window is honestly enlightening.
good,"A typical day will either be fast paced during the mornings or lunch hours. Any other time such as the evening, will not be as busy. Management was more focused on time than training new baristas to make drinks. The hardest part was getting used to early schedules and keeping up with drive thru orders and pretty much being independent when staff was short. The most enjoyable is who you meet and work with and recurring customers."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are fortunate enough to have good management. It is a great entry level job, especially for students, as it is very flexible. Days are filled with a lot to do, and a lot of customers to serve. Managing the people was my favorite aspect of the job, but as a manager, work-life balance was a challenge. The company tends to hire outside of the company rather than internally, in a lot of cases, which can be a deterrent for a lot of people. Overall, the company takes good care of the employees."
good,"Working at Starbucks like most other restaurant is a very fast paced work environment and requires the ability to multi task. The most enjoyable part of working there were the people I got to work with, they made it fun to be there."
good,"There are many positions assigned to you throughout the day such as customer service, the point of sale, bar, and so on. "
good,i loved my location in louisville kentucky i had to relocate to san diego and the store i was transferring to didnt work. the management at that store was poor and i was treated as i couldnt do anything but the register.
good,"I love to working here and i got an amazing experiences while im working here, such as brewing methode, the coffee history and the way how you service the customer with excellent skills"
good,Impossible to advance to DM position as an inside manager. Most DMs hired outside company. stay in the manager position for 2-3 months then rapid advancement into DM position.
good,"I worked at a small busy Starbucks up north and I enjoyed the regulars that came in. Taking orders through drive through and the front was my favorite, hearing how creative people got with the menu. Most difficult was the really bad rushes during frappe happy hour or the afternoons during the summer."
good,"Starbucks is a great company with great benefits, if they're benefits you would make use of. The compensation likely varies by city and area, but I found it to be overall underwhelming for the amount of time and often constant workflow required on the job. "
good,"A good starter job but unless you want to work in management or corporate eventually, not good for a long term job. Each location is different and has its own customer environment so its hard to compare."
good,A typical day at work is dynamic. You have to be ready to think on your feet and be flexible enough to face changes/challenges in the moment.  The hardest part of the job is being short staffed while trying to give the highest customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the personal interaction with customers.
good,"Great part time job for students or someone just needing a side hustle, but if I worked there full time I'd go crazy. All the people are  super nice and they've loosened up the dress code which is great."
good,Fun place to work great people but very stressful during peak hours with made it worse when customers were getting agitated with waiting for their order.
good,"Working at starbucks isnt as relaxed as it seems, yes it can be fun, it also can be extremely stressful and fast paces so stay quick on your feet. Its pretty easy to get a job there considering there's no experience necessary. From my experience, i really enjoyed my manager, i really enjoyed my job and i didnt mind the fast pace because i like to be kept busy, i just had to leave because i relocated. The pay is decent, its above minimum wage, and we also make tips weekly that are split between workers based on their hours worked for that week. Cool thing though, you get unlimited free drinks while youre working and a free foos item every shift, any other time you can always count on a friendly 30% off everything else."
good,"This was my first ever job in the real world and boy - was it an awakening. Not to make it sound as if it was a bad job, because it was decent overall. You have to be a good multi-tasker and put up with different personalities! This was a good first job experience because it informed me on my work ethic and the reality of customer service."
good,"If there is a problem with something in the store or one of the employees, you’re supposed to call Partner Contact Center but nothing ever gets done. They are supposed to call you back or let you know something and they move on and erase it like you never called."
good,Management does not do a good job training. Benefits are very nice. Partners are awesome and it is more like a family. More focused on drive-thru times then customer connection.
good,"Honestly really loved my time at Starbucks.  I'm an avid coffee drinker and it allowed me to fund my caffeine habit.  As a student it was a great gig that allowed me to work and go to class.  I was able to work a slightly less than part time schedule while I was in classes that I increased to full-time over the summer.  It was a pretty fast paced environment in the branch I was in (Boston, hospital district) and our customers were about as annoying as the internet memes say, although we did benefit from having really nice, well tipping doctors and health professionals in the area."
good,Ust yonetim de kendi adamlarini yukselten kisiler var.Adaletsizlik var.
good,"arrive at work, find shift lead or manager. find where they would like for me to start my shift (which 9 out 10) , usually they would want me on registers. I would do that until given another task."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are a student or for a first job. A typical day at work includes hand-crafting beverages, greeting customers, and store upkeep. You learn about many different cultural backgrounds and ideas. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the many changes promotions and training. The most enjoyable part is the customer connection."
good,"The worst and most complained about issue was staffing. Throughout my ten years with the company, short staffing was always a problem. Baristas we’re constantly worn out from over-working and being stretch thin. And because of this, most baristas felt like they were underpaid for what was being asked of them."
good,"I worked at Starbucks mainly for an income to survive while I made my way through college. Can be fast paced, but a chance to work on communication skills with random people."
good,"People focused company, collaborative culture. Need to advocate for your own job growth and recognition. Lots of opportunities to serve charitable causes."
good,"Working opening shifts has its pros and cons."
good,"A great company for benefits, free coffee, good culture and team.  They do not pay a living wage. I would have been with them for even longer if I could have paid my rent."
good,"I love my partners, my regulars and my store. What makes this job hard is the lack of support or impatient customers. I love Starbucks culture and benefits toward my education."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make drinks and experiment with them, connecting with the customers and learning about them makes the job more enjoyable too."
good,"Great managers, but the workplace was hard to adapt to. Small work spaces and limited equipment meant only one drink was able to be made at a time, therefore rush hour was a stressful time."
good,"For the most part, my coworkers and I worked as a team. Even though our management sucked, we were able to pick up the slack.  Communication was the most important part of our jobs. We were always busy because we were inside target and we were the only Starbucks inside the mall"
good,"it's so interesting to see the partners make drinks and serve it to customers so i would love to gain experience and i decided to work here. I've learned a lot of things other than just making drinks. We also connect with the customers, asking how's their day and introduce them to our latest promotion drinks or food. Not all of our customers are friendly as I've encountered some rude customers that are very demanding and how i actually approached them is by talking nicely and listen to their needs as well. Customers are not always right because as a worker we do have feelings and our rights too. We are well known for our customer service as we do have feedback's and from there we can satisfy their needs and wants. I've learnt about how important is it to maintain cleanliness in the store and as well as serving the right way, so far it is a good environment to work in."
good,It's an alright place. Depends on the store really. whats good for me at one store is bad at another. Easch place has its own feel. Just find the one right for you
good,"It was a great company to work for however, the store I was with was run very poorly and because of that, I left. My co-workers were amazing and the company benefits are unheard of."
good,"Although this wasnt my first job it taught me how to work. I had to clean take orders and remember how to make drinks in a fast pace environment. Co workers make it difficult to switch shifts or want to cover you, you get write ups even if you call in sick."
good,"Had an amazing time while it lasted but the lack of hours and pay wasn't enough for the work i was doing. everyone was great to work with, learned new skills and acknowledgment."
good,"A typical day at work can either be really great or really stressful, depending on scheduling."
good,"A typical day at work included rotating between Starbucks' several employee stations in a fast-paced, team-oriented setting. However, most of the team leads and employees are fairly young and fun to work with. However, the job is fast-paced and stressful as it is a constant frantic shuffle to fill out customers orders, both in store and through the college food app. If you are a college student then it is the perfect part-time job!"
good,"The job is ideal for part-time/ temporary staff members, however, the chance for progression is minimal which limits how far you can progress in the company. "
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work, it has amazing benefits for its partners. The only downside is that it is a fast-paced environment, it can get competitive, and the work-life balance is a little off."
good,Management got switched up and it's been a hard adjustment but things are getting better and it's pretty fun to work there. Except for the occasional grumpy person
good,"great company to work for, but your direct manager or coworkers could ruin the work experience. the work hours are extremely abnormal and can disrupt any sleep schedule. the customers can be either thankful or condescending."
good,"I loved my time at starbucks, occasional shifts were difficult, E.g 6am starts, but I loved the whole environment spending my day speaking to  interesting people. "
good,"High-stress, fast paced work environment. Overall low wages but the company compensates by offering great benefits.  Work place culture is completely dependent on which store you work at."
good,"I loved Starbucks as a whole - as a company. My first manager was amazing, however, my second one wasn't the greatest. It was hard because my first manager made the team feel like a second family but ultimately the second manager tore us all apart."
good,I worked up from a barista to a store manager.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Starbucks.  I found room for growth and received multiple salary increases while there.  This is the perfect job if you're going to school as well or just out of college.
good,"Benefits are reasonable, hours are flexible, and you get Insurance and such. Good job, great for a kid in school, and also easy to relocate to new markets."
good,"Although the benefits that made starbucks worth it are on decline. Management gets brainwashed,sucked into corporate regulations, without realizing that expectation change seasonally, and none of it really matters as much as they think it does. They use fear as a motivational tactic to decrease waste and increase sales."
good,"Good stepping stone position for college students. Labor cuts occur yearly, and it's very hard to advance. I enjoyed working with my customers and some of my coworkers."
good,"El ambiente laboral es bastante bueno, la compañía de los partners hace todo más fácil de llevar."
good,It was a good place to wor at but I think t is not for me. It’s great for a collage student.  If I was younger and the pay and benefits were better I would  work there.
good,"While every work place has employees that are not all likely to get along, and some are more favorable than others, the management there has explicit favoritism to the ones they enjoy conversing with while you do their work. If you are not in their circle of friends, you will have no room for movement and will not get any kind of empathy for anything, while the others fear no consequences."
good,"Starbucks is a phenomenal company, the best benefits you'll find. The culture is like no where else, just amazing. The work itself can be stressful, but that is true for any job; but at Starbucks, everything else that comes with it makes the stressful morning rush worth it. Stop thinking about Starbucks, and just apply, go talk to some people that works there, ask questions, you won't be disappointed."
good,"The environment is very friendly and a fun place to work. You must be able to work well with a team and provide excellent customer service, even when difficult situations may arise."
good,"The work that Starbucks environments demand from employees is very high. Starbucks employees should be paid much more for the work that they do. Despite that, it is a great place for those wanting to know more about coffee in general. I love working at Starbucks as a part-time job. But definitely not something I'd consider for long-term."
good,"Great workplace for someone who is looking for stability and likes the challenge of a constantly shifting environment.  The work isn't hard per se, but can be stressful as you balance business needs versus work/life balance of the team and yourself.  Always focused on making the moment right for customers.  Your customers can become your family if you let them. "
good,"definitely a fun work place. most days were busy, but, that was to be expected at the busiest store in your district."
good,"Managing a Starbucks is a very rewarding career, but the demands of being responsible for 120+ operating hours a week in addition to the demand on your focus being skewed very early in the morning makes it difficult to create an effective work life balance, though not impossible. The company is very supportive and the people who work there are generally great."
good,"Working in Starbucks was fun because you're dealing with different type of people every day and you have had a chance to showcase not only your barista skills but also your interpersonal skills. There is a continuous learning process in Starbucks and that was a good thing. We call our co-workers as ""Partners"" because we are all partner for a greater success. The people were nice and enthusiastic about their work and they seemed to have fun on it. The hardest part of the job was that the shifting schedule every week and the graveyard schedule. However, the most enjoyable part of being a barista was that you were able to maximize your skills and capabilities and you feel valued by your co-workers as this one of the major star skills of Starbucks which is to enhance the self-esteem of one another."
good,"It was a great place to work in terms of it working around my school schedule (I was a college student). I loved being able to have full health benefits and only need to work 20 hours per week to receive those. I do feel like the company got too big and started to lose sight of the ""little"" employees. I still will say my 5.5 years with them was positive and I enjoyed my time working there."
good,Working here was stressful if you weren't able to move quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing each customer's happy face when receiving their coffee.
good,"My Starbucks experience has overall been very positive. It took a while to get used to the fast paced environment, but after getting comfortable with making the drinks and daily tasks, the job had a nice rhythm to it. Depending on the location, it can get VERY busy and very stressful throughout the day, but most of the parters I've worked with were hard working and we worked well as a team. The health benefits and discounts are nice, but the hourly wage is still very low compared to the cost of living and I've seen many baristas leave because of the pay. It's a great job for people looking for part-time work, but if you're looking for lots of hours it can often be a struggle to make more than 40 a week (again, it all depends on your location and manager). Most days are very repetitive and can be physically demanding so some folks can get burnt out after a while, but as a whole it has been a great place to work and the company is heading in a good direction."
good,"Fun Job - Coworkers were too uptight, dress code rules are ridiculous. No piercings, no tattoos, all black, short sleeves, had to buy own shoes, ""natural"" coloured hair only"
good,"This is a great place to work if you enjoy people and have a positive /enthusiastic personality. However, if that doesn't describe you, it won't be worth the stress, effort and low pay. Definitely a job I'd love to retire to."
good,"Experiences vary by store and geographical location."
good,I think Starbucks is a good company and has lots of good ideas. Good benefits and flexible schedule for those that need it. Sometimes hard to get the hours for part time people.
good,I enjoyed working with the company and the benefits it provided. If it weren't for poor store management I might still be there. The work environment was fun and the ability to transfer across districts is a great opportunity that companies don't always allow.
good,"Has ups and downs like any workplace. Some people really enjoy their job and work hard others are nonchalant and don't put in as much effort. "
good,"A typical day of work for the majority portion of my job was to make beverages, but mainly stay on cash. "
good,"Teavana was one big family. The culture was built around the mindset of play hard, work hard. The hours were nuts, but when you enjoy your job, it didn't matter. Teavana offered tons of advancement opportunities for those that worked hard and put in the effort."
good,"I worked at Starbucks off and on for roughly 7 years, in 10 different stores in 3 states.  Some stores were fantastic with a healthy and vibrant culture, managers who cared about the well being of their employees and solid leadership qualities.  However, not all managers did well in these areas."
good,It was a great learning experience definitely helped in landing bigger jobs. Hours and pay was fair. Co workers were great but management could be better.
good,Work at Starbucks can be tough.  But knowing I'm able to have insurance at the end of the day while still pursuing my career in broadcasting is a major plus.
good,Learning the bases was the hardest part but then it becomes second nature with a great atmosphere and positive staff. You got to interact with customers with the hands on learning with a lot of the drinks being made in all unique ways.
good,"It's been a great experience, they allowed me to work while pregnant. I created a strong bond with my co-workers being pregnant. Most of my co-workers were very talented and artistic. I don't know why, but we looove to sing while we are working haha. "
good,"This job is great for college students or young workers looking for a part-time position. You will work hard, and typically your store will have a variety of sales goals. I really enjoyed the regular customers, however constantly changing standards made it difficult to know proper procedure for some things. Management also was difficult at times, as the store manager was not always aware or in tune with items that needed addressed. Overall, not a bad job, but not a permanent job either."
good,"Starbucks is a friendly but difficult environment.  A lot is expected of you, for not much pay. Not worth it. Weekends mandatory.  My manger was amazing, but worked most of us 6 days a week, leaving no room for ourselves or our personal lives."
good,"it was really nice to work in such company in Canada but unfortunately couldn't continue because didn't have a required work visa, may if i have it i will continues working"
good,"A place to be quick on your feet, work with your hands, gain a fun skill, make some good money, enter into an amazing community. Amazing benefits for part time workers and fair compensation."
good,I worked in a target starbucks. Normal day consisted of working alone until the next person came in to give you your break. for some reason they never gave more than 4 hour shifts each day so a normal week would be about 20ish hours unless your availability was fully open. Can get very frustrating working alone because no one else in the store was certified to be behind the counter with you so whatever happened you had to deal with on your own. Manager was pretty cool and very nice. Most enjoyable part was when you'd finally have backup arrive and just someone else to talk to.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed the time I spent working for Starbucks. It was an interactive experience, and serving customers always kept me on my toes. I learned a lot of valuable information while I was employed there and I would definitely consider working for the company again."
good,"It's not an easy job to learn, but it is one you will love. When you learn the craft, you understand why so many partners stay with the company for so many years. I think most people look at this job and think it will be a breeze- how hard can it be? Well, there's actually A LOT to learn- from standards, to recipes, to proper techniques, etc. You never stop learning, and always have to keep up-to-date on products, recipe changes, and promotions. You also have to have a very thick skin to deal with irate customers, people who abuse the ""customer is always right"" ideal, and people who just don't respect you. The craft itself is an incredible thing to learn, and it's something to take pride in. Having the support of your partners and being involved in the work culture is incredible, as well. I've met many outstanding people working here, and they make each day behind the line worth it."
good,"It was a great experience working there, it just was not for me. That job was good but the hours was not working for me. I just needed more hours, that's pretty much it."
good,"I have worked with many partners who have become family.  This is a great customer focused company.  "
good,"Working for the Starbucks corporation has definitely made a huge impact in my life. It is a joy to work for a company that genuinely upholds their standards of creating and inspiring moments in each persons day. Because of the standards we uphold, we have the opportunity of making several connections with a very broad group of people. Having the ability to be an impact in someone’s life each day through customer service, has truly been amazing and I’m honored to be working for such a life changing company!"
good,A typical day was anywhere from 5 to 9 hours. It was a very fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job is the pace and demands of the job. The flexibility of the job and the benefits was definitely a plus. Co workers and the management can definitely make or break your experience.
good,I didn't like working for Starbucks at first but after the first 3 months I loved it. It definitely takes some getting used to if you aren't experienced in multitasking and it takes time to get the other employees to warm up to new workers. The company is set on routines so once you have the routine down it gets easier. The management was okay but could have been better.
good,"I think your Starbucks experience all depends on your management, your team, and the location of your store. I worked in a very high grossing drive-thru/cafe store for two years. It was constantly busy and consistently under-staffed due to the turn-over rate. About half of the people hired were 16 year olds that just wanted to work at Starbucks. They didn't understand how stressful and physically demanding the job is. Or the amount of memorization you need. Most long-term employees are probably 20+, there were also a lot of older women in my district that had been there for years. Make sure you get a job at one of the stores with an older employee base, as it will be much easier. In addition, management was HORRIBLE. I got into a car accident and called my store manager to say I was in the hospital and would not be able to come in for at least a week due to bruising my ribs. She told me I had to come in and If I didn't that I needed to find coverage for all of my shifts. After that I was ready to leave. Several employees had written to the DM (District Manager) and HR about her. Nothing was done despite her constantly ignoring scheduling requests and treating employees poorly."
good,Fast paced so the day goes by. Friendly work environment and get to meet a lot of people. Sometimes the occasional celebrity even comes in certain locations! Peaks are usually very busy but the baristas always hold up to it.
good,"I am a supervisor so i am always ensuring that quality is up held, the store is clean and customer service is at par."
good,"A princípio a empresa me ajudou muito em questão de conhecimento sobre como lidar com pessoas, pessoas de diversas formas e culturas. "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks can mean various things. Things like having a very busy day, a slow day, complicated customers, and even disagreeing customers. Which all means that it takes someone who is patient, detail-oriented, and organized in order to successfully succeed at this job."
good,Loved my environment . The people I worked with are great and it was enjoyable learning experience. I would recommend this job to other people who were looking to just start out
good,"Starbucks, as a company, is a great place to work, for both beginners and pros. Pay rates aren't the best, but they offer amazing health benefits at part-time (20+ hours), plus 401k and stock options. Scheduling depends on the store manager - some are accommodating, some aren't. Work environment is highly dependent upon the team at the store - I've had some amazing teams, but I've also had some lack-luster teams. It's definitely a fast-paced environment where you need to be ready to work hard and fast, but it is rewarding."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced working environment that provides excellent results in speed and efficiency. The management is there to train those to become great baristas in both cashier and bartending roles. As one of the leading companies there are always new things to learn within the company, however depending on management, lacks equal recognition between the morning and closing teams. There will be many rushes throughout the day and will call for multiple partners for help and communication needs. The position requires great patience and customer service, in order to grow and help peoples needs. Overall a good place to work for those who love a fast paced working experience and interacting with a diversity of people."
good,"starbucks is a fantastic company to work for, they have great benefits and treat their employees rather well. however most of the issues face at this location and those near by are caused by the lack of leadership in the store manger."
good,"Starbucks taught me so much. I learned many life skills, people skills, social skills, professional skills, etc. It was lively, fun, and I loved the environment. The atmosphere and the vibe was always relaxing and being a barista is something that I wil always be happy I did."
good,"Provided quality coffee and beverages in accordance with drink formulas and training skills. "
good,"My experience with Starbucks is quite memorable. Not only did I learn about mixing coffee but also learned a great deal about myself. Ive learned that hardworks or physical labor is not enough to succeed. It's also about understanding your peers, Management team and the customers. They usually give me the opening shift so I experience the early morning grind. It could be fun but it could also be stressful. But Positive outlook in life makes a lot of difference. I love that I have direct interaction with different kinds of people everyday. It's fun!"
good,Working at Starbucks was a very positive and a good learning experience for me. On a day-to-day basis we would create different drinks upon request and do food prep. Managers were easy to work and get along with.
good,"fun making drinks.. getting to know customers.. trying new drinks,, friendly competitions.. i had poor management.. lots of petty arguments.. started to become burden"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. I was a closer so we could play our own music which make cleaning not so boring. We also got free drinks and free food so that was a nice perk. However, in the time I worked at my particular location we went through three managers and at one point didn't have one. So I wish we would have had more stability and more structure within the location, but it was a great job none the less. The benefits are definitely are huge thing."
good,"Working there was a dream due to interactions with consumers and making those connections. As far as management, it was as organized and very one sided from my experience."
good,"It was a good temporary job, especially for a college student. They were flexible with my schedule so that I would be free to go to my classes and still have enough hours so that I was able to make enough to sustain myself."
good,"It was a fun place to work, I was a Starbucks Barista in Harris Teeter. I had a lot of fun with getting to know customers and creating new drinks. Little bit of drama between other employees but other than that is was fun."
good,"Working at Starbucks had its ups and downs throughout my time there. The best part was being able to talk to the customers while helping them out with any questions they had about coffee or our food products. However, The inconsistent hours made it only a okay place to work."
good,"Great benefits. as a 10yr partner, I get coffee for life! Your team becomes a family in a surprising shot period of time. They have couching. to allow you to succeed in the area that you are responsible for."
good,"Fun, fast paced job. Company prefers benefits they can publicize over more pay and better hours. Store manager can make or break the job. Most of the job is cleaning the store, so if you don't like cleaning, not the job for you. You have to heavily rely on coworkers throughout your shift, and one lazy person can make your day rough. Customers can be rude but some are great. The company's predictive model for business is flawed and we often feel understaffed. Open 365 days a year, and only a few days are time and a half."
good,"Good compensation and benefits. It is a detail oriented and fast paced environment, not for everybody  but is enjoyable for those who like the fast pace. Highly customer centered and encourages building relationships between partners and customers."
good,"I worked at a busy store, so there would be times where you had to know how to work efficiently under pressure. My partners would be there to support me always, which was the most enjoyable part of working here. Management is tough but they are very considerate when it comes to giving hours and scheduling."
good,"quick-paced environment that keeps you on your toes. numerous individuals that come in and out of the store, employee must be pleasant and willing to help customers."
good,great place to work if you enjoy working with others and serving the public. overall the staff were friendly and easy to get along with. have fun with a *
good,"Working at Starbucks is great if you want something fun and if you like to meet a lot of people. Although, the management is changed frequently, maybe too much (4 managers in 3 years). If you are someone who can handle changing your routine and ways to work frequently, then don't hesitate to apply there"
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. The customers are so friendly and it's fun to learn the ""regulars"" that come in. It allows you to create friendships with people. It's a very fast paced job that requires you to be on your feet the whole time."
good,"Good for a job in between jobs or a second job for extra money but not more than that.There's little room for growth, and stores can quickly become toxic environments to work in."
good,"Its a wonderful part time job while someone is in school or just needs some extra money but it isn't something that a person should stick with for years and years. It has its benefits but also its drawbacks. depending on the location will also depend how many hours are available for work. It is great to work at a mall location in the holiday season but afterwards in the slow season, one would be lucky to get as many as 16 hours a week."
good,"it is a very fast paced coffee shop. stressful due to customer demands. However, i didn't mind it at all because i enjoy the stress and to make customers happy after they wait for their drinks."
good,"A typical day consists of maintaining store cleanliness throughout, but it's mostly about interacting with customers and being able to make connections with people. Our co-workers (partners) are always willing to learn and we have a really good relationship with each other in which we are always ready to help one another out. "
good,"I worked here for only six months. I loved my coworkers very much, they were all amazing. If i remember correctly my shifts where around 6-7 hours a day, but not many through out the week. I think my hours by the end of the week equalled to be only 15-16 a week. The worst thing about this job was the customers. some of them were very kind to me, but others where horrible. Making the drinks can be hard to remember the order in the beginning and when your being yelled at, and told you should have never been hired makes it even harder to remember"
good,"Loved my coworkers, the environment, and even my superiors. Some policies from the higher ups didn't really work in every store as expected with any major company. Starbucks does take care of it's employees really well."
good,"I work in a fast-paced cafe in Seattle. There is always a new product being released, a new recipe being created, and the menus are everchanging. Every barista works every position on the floor. You are required to memorize lots of things, make drinks and prepare food very quickly, and interact with customers on a deep and often personal level. Most baristas grow very close with their regulars and coworkers. You may also be doing back of house work (stocking, managing tips, etc)."
good,Good morning and I have to go on a trip to the university university of California university of Virginia and the state department of health insurance plans.
good,"It’s common for people to change their minds, especially at Starbucks,  about flavor, choice of milk, whether they want it hot or iced, or maybe they just now realized that the 'grande' they ordered is not in fact large. Others come in everyday at the same time and instead of ordering, fill you in on their crazy night, how their kids are doing or their dairy-sensitive new boss. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks "
good,"As a Starbucks barista, I would start off my day by getting all bakeries, coffee machines and dishwashers ready for the day. After everything is ready,,welcoming customers, taking their food and drink orders, making drinks and cleaning the cafe area were my main duties."
good,"Sometimes customers make it hard to appreciate your job. It can be hard to make customers happy when you don't feel support from your managers. Overall, it has it's good days."
good,"Starbucks is a fabulous company to work for. the benefits are unbeatable. It's not just the medical and Dental coverage you receive, but all the extra perks of the company like 401 k 6% matching, and your bean stock investments. The free drinks while working is a plus and the free coffee item every week is also a plus, but beyond those perks there is more room for improvement on the daily operations."
good,覚えることは多いですが、一度覚えてしまうとすごく簡単です。ネイティヴスピーカーと働くことができるので、英語力を高める環境としてもよかったです。
good,"Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone who’s getting into work as it would be a great first job. As for some one who’s looking to advance I’d say look somewhere else because it is very competitive. Those who move up are usually relocated and not payed well for the responsibilities given."
good,A typical day at work consists of taking orders from customers and making drinks to their satisfaction. I learned a lot about coffee and what goes really well with that certain type of beverage. The management was very rigid and at times seemed like it was ran very tough. The hardest part of the job was working drive-thru since there are a lot of components to that aspect of the job. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was interacting and getting to know the customers.
good,"A typical day at work consists of lots of interaction with the public, beverage production, cleaning tasks, and working closely with team members to accomplish tasks"
good,"Really great first job, fun to learn all the drink combinations while learning to be every customers therapist. "
good,"It's a great job but unfortunately, it doesn't pay well.  You're on your feet all day and have to become a pro at multitasking. It is a great place to learn how to be effective at management while simultaneously building connections with people. Plus who doesn't love free coffee?"
good,Unfortunately compensation was not ideal. Shift supervisors have more responsibility than baristas but only make about 1 dollar more per hour. However the atmosphere created by everyone that works there is familial and comforting yet fast paced. It was hard to leave.
good,Starbucks is a very customer demanding job as anyone can know. They want their drink exactly how they like it. Perfect. Every time. Which I would too but it’s so busy that it gets very stressful.
good,"Great job if you are looking for amazing benefits/insurance. High Paced, Gotta stay alert at all times, Lots of Memorization but will come within time."
good,"i must say this was one of my favorite places to work, the atmosphere was always good. The partners you work with will be great 80 percent of the time."
good,starbucks can be alot of fun but it can also take alot of your personal life time if you're trying to move up the rankings at a good pace. the hours can truly take a toll on you but there is alot to learn from the company.
good,"Uma empresa que busca desenvolver seus funcionários, com bom ambiente de trabalho e com grande potencial"
good,"Working at Starbucks for four plus years had it’s highs and lows. The people you work with is great but the customers can be hard to deal with. Morning are the busiest time. The hours can be rough.  For example, Starbucks opens at 5:30am so we have to be there at 5am. The managment can vary. I’ve had really good managers and very poor managers. They communicate with you or they don’t. They work around your life or they don’t. Managers at Starbucks are a hit or miss but I think that’s most jobs. The hardest part working there is probably the random hours your can work. I can work 5am to 1pm or 7:30am to 4PM. Also your hours might not be consistent with what you want. Cleaning up everything and balancing helping customers is the hardest part of the job. There is so much to do in so little time and also try to help customers while doing so is difficult. You have to be organized and good at multitasking. I really enjoy the partners that work there. They have been the one of the biggest reasons I like working there and why I’ve worked there for so long."
good,"Depends on how busy the location is, it can be stressful and understaffed, or it can be slow at times. There's always something to do. If you're good at what you do then they'll treat you like a mule."
good,A great company at the headquarters level. District managers can make or break your store's morale. All the barista's I have worked with were very motivated. I had trouble being able to transfer to another store when I needed to. I did see many others leave because of this inflexibility.
good,"Working at Starbuck's is a great experience to have due to the fast paced work and the extensive training. The hardest thing is learning the routine of things in the first couple of weeks; however, once you start to get the hang of the flow of the job, you begin to work a lot quicker and all of the stress you feel in the beginning goes away."
good,I have worked here for nearly 2 years now and honestly it's been incredible. I got to meet some amazing people and learn things that i will never forget. The management is excellent and the staff are all lovely.
good,I love the company however my stores location makes it hard for anyone to advance. i've worked there for almost five years and within that time i've had six store managers.
good,I have worked with this company for many years and have slowly moved up and highly recommend to a younger group. Starbucks has great benefits and pay.
good,"Starbucks is good for a temporary job, not a career. Starbucks has good benefits but probably isn’t worth the cost of stress. Pros about Starbucks is teamwork."
good,It was a good job at the time that supplemented my income and provided healthcare. Easy enough job to make coffee but it gets very busy and rushed by less than considerate clientele.
good,"Not a bad job. Fast paced environment. Lots of cleaning required, so if you do not like to clean, would not recommend as a job. Great customers, but sometimes you do have your bad ones. Not a job for someone who is not willing to talk to customers or who does not move fast"
good,"- can be stressful during peak hours"
good,I worked in a Starbucks that was inside of a Safeway grocery store.  being that it was in a Safeway we were not allowed to receive tips from customers.  This was the only negative part of the job.
good,"The atmosphere at Starbucks is awesome. You must be a team player to work there. My managers were fairly approachable but one of them liked to play favorites and I have found that to be true from other employees at other Starbucks stores. Time usually went by fast because I was working full force from the moment I stepped into the door until my shift ended, with only a short lunch break. It was a quick paced and high stress environment during peak hours. This was only manageable with a strong team. The pay and benefits were fair. The benefits and affiliate programs were great including a free spotify account, stock options, healthcare options, 401k options, and education reimbursement through Arizona State University online. Overall I would say that my experience at Starbucks was good and I would work there again if the opportunity arose."
good,"Uma empresa que tem uma grande visão de mercado, não mede esforços para alcançar uma fatia maior da área onde atua."
good,It was a very challenging and exciting position with supervisor roles you get to engage with customers and workers while always being a very positive environment.
good,I loved working there though they worked me outside my availability all the time. My manager was not all that great either would rarely come on the floor when it got super busy and would always under staff us. Other than that Starbucks is a good company to work for and great benefits.
good,"Great company to work for. Just wish they paid their employees what they are worth.  We put up with a lot to be paid pennies on the dollar. Even with recent wages, it is still below most fast food companies."
good,"The first Starbucks I worked at had excellent management, and was a low pressure environment. I was able to establish deep connections with many regular customers, which may perhaps have been my greatest skill at the job. I enjoyed working there as a part time job while I was studying at Temple, but once I hit a family emergency, I was forced to move to Bend, where they promptly transferred me to another store so that I could move without having to be entirely jobless. I intended only to stay with Starbucks, until the end of the holiday season, which has brought me to my new job hunt. The second was extremely strict and poorly managed. I was rarely given the time to establish connections with customers, and was often corrected or even scolded for having conversation with customers that was longer than 2-3 minutes. I was told to steam milk and serve drinks only with my left hand for sake of saving time, despite being right handed and less capable with my left. I was also promised greater than 30 hours each week until further notice, which was rarely granted to me."
good,"Overall it was a good job, fast paced environment but I enjoy that kind of work so it was fine. The discounts and perks that employees receive definitely make it a job worth applying for."
good,"Fun, in the right store and if the manager cares it’s a good place to work. "
good,"I very much enjoyed working for Starbucks. Seeing new and familiar faces every day, and memorizing regular customers drinks was one of the few fun things I experienced working there. Working for a comany that cares about its employees and customers equally is truly an enjoyable feeling."
good,"busy"
good,"Starbucks as a company provides excellent benefits for its employees at every level. Company guidelines, if followed, also provide for a decent work/life balance (i.e. rules providing x amount of time between shifts, clearly outlined materials to pursue improvement/promotion). "
good,"While I love the fast-paced, customer driven environment it is easy to become jaded after a while. Starbucks can't quite make up its mind if it wants to be fast food or small town coffee shop. Therefore, standards and procedures are constantly ping-ponging and employees (partners) are constantly confused about what their main objective should be."
good,"Not every barista likes working at Starbucks. I just happen to like my store and my customers. I worked with a great team before, but now there are people that do not carry the same caliber of work ethic as my former co-workers. This job is not for the weary. It's fast-paced, there's room to learn, but customers can tend to look down at you (food-service silliness.) You can really learn a lot about people and good business practices."
good,"starbucks is a great company who cares about its employees , a list of benefits for full and part time workers. they pay for school and etc. "
good,"Starbucks is a great company when you take advantage of all of the benefits that they offer. It is fast paced and direction changes quickly.  They are very responsive, almost too responsive!"
good,"Amazing benefits, bad pay. The company works with a pretty flexible schedule to work with your personal schedule. Benefits are great. who wouldnt love free coffee everyday?"
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced environment. To succeed one needs to have fast problem solving skills, be very friendly, and be able to adapt when necessary."
good,"For most of the time, the busiest hours are in the mornings and calm down afternoon. Co-workers are friendly and customers love to connect. Drinks are always on the house for employees."
good,"I used to like working here. In the beginning it was exciting but then it got boring and received more and more requirements, some of them wouldn't make sense for me but of course you'd have to respect and fulfil them. "
good,"some stuff sucks just like every workplace, but as a business its the best ive worked for so far. theres going to b goods and bads in every work place, the pros greatly outweigh the cons here."
good,"Starbucks is a great job as long as you like your fellow employees and the management. The job is very fast paced and can be stressful, and it is also very repetitive. I would recommend this job to people in college or high school, but not as a lifelong career."
good,"typical part time job, learned how to be a good server and learned how to make different beverages. meeting new people, and learning how to work under pressure."
good,"Very busy and energetic work environment which is generally positive and enjoyable. There are issues with minimal time for management to work on non coverage required projects such as store development, staff mentoring, budgeting and forecasting / business growth."
good,"Very fast pace when busy, employees are fun and positive to work with. Managers are helpful when needed. You need to Work well with others for this job."
good,"Working at starbucks has been amazing. I love my co workers and the customers who come in are very friendly. The hardest part of the job for me has been learning to make all the drinks very quickly. The management overall is very good. I'm in the process of trying to promote to shift supervisor, so it's cool that there's room for advancement within the company."
good,This is a great company to work for for benefits but the pay is not great. I am looking else where because of the lack of advancement opportunities and minimal knowledge of employee struggles form the upper management.
good,At Starbucks at time it could be fun but as well sometimes it would get really busy and the line could go out the door. although it made it good because the day definitely would go really fast. paid time off was more based on how many hours you worked so you could use the hours you earn for vacation or if you didn't mind you could get a day off even if it wasn't payed or you could switch your work days with another employee that would like to help you. This job was physically exhausting but it wasn't so bad. Management was at time unfair but overall they weren't bad and if extra hours where needed they would try to help you out the best they could.
good,J'ai bien aimé travailler chez Starbucks même si parfois j'avais l'impression que mon patron profitait de ma gentillesse pour que je fasse les heures que personne ne voulait faire.
good,"culture of the company is positive and valuable leadership training is given. Most enjoyable part of the day is simply being in stores with the teams and sharing passion for coffee with customers."
good,"Great place to work at times but it really depends on the people you're working with. Some stores have a positive, team-building and oriented vibe, others highly lack it.  When it gets busy, often times managers will be the first to freak out instead of carrying themselves as a calm, adult leader. It's just coffee. 11.50 + tips is good money compared to other retail jobs. Don't work at a drive thru unless you can handle a really fast pace."
good,Work at Starbucks is fast paced but fun if you have the right team. As a supervisor the company is expected to become your passion and in turn your life. The work life balance can be quite stressful as you will be expected to come up with solutions to issues even when you are not at work.
good,"For those of you who love to drink coffee, this is the place for you (if you have a demanding college schedule that is)."
good,Exciting place to work. Great Company. I enjoyed moving up in the company. I enjoyed the face paced work environment. Taught me a lot about customer service.
good,"Starbucks has allowed me to have a flexible schedule while maintaining a full time work week. There are many benefits to working at Starbucks including help with with college tuition and stock options. It is a friendly, fast paced environment that helped me prepare for my future career."
good,"pay suck but skills learnt from the job is valuable in life, overall a good entry level position. manager always try hard to fit your schedule request."
good,great environment to work in for a first time job. you learn how to cooperate with your co workers and to handle customers. this is a great place to start off your career. you can go to school and work part time here
good,"Starbucks was an unbelievable experience for me. English isn't my first language and I always had so much encouragement from my colleagues. I learned a lot, and I'll always be thankful for the time I worked there. Management was friendly and open to talk, the relationship with colleagues and clients was always good and fun."
good,"Starbucks is what appears to be if you pay attention, work here can be stressful during long rushes and promotions but staff generally love what they do and love people.  Supervisors had to put together a tight daily schedule that would provide good service while ensuring employees got required breaks, the daily inventory was taken and orders were placed, the daily bank deposit was made, the right amount of prep work was done for the next day and the cleaning tasks were finished."
good,"When I started with Starbucks 3+ years ago everything was great I fell in love with everything and was promoted to a supervisor. During my time in my new role with the company, I found out how bureaucratic and cryptic upper management people are often bullied until they leave the company with someone doesn't like them. I also find that the company is willing to set aside core values with money comes into play. If profit or any extra work on their part comes into play; good luck.   "
good,Starbucks has been a great job to have while going to school.  The schedule is extremely flexible to work around class and organization commitments.  There are always hours to pick up on weeks that you need a little more cash.  The working environment is fun and supportive.
good,This was my first job in high school and I really enjoyed it. I just used this as a part time job and it was great work experience. I Loved the people I worked with and being a barista.
good,"Overall great place to work. Fast-paced, fun culture, great employees. They offer a wonderful benefits package and tuition reimbursement. The only downside is low hourly pay."
good,"A really wonderful environment to work in. If the management hadn't changed I would not have thought about leaving. Wonderful, sweet customers and staff though."
good,"When you work during peak hours, it is very high paced and you'll probably be ringing 20-60 guests per half hour. Also, during downtime you are cleaning the store. Things you clean are drains, dishes, sweeping and mopping the floors."
good,Great place to work but advancement was tough. It was who you knew not what you know or how hard you work. So i hate to seek other forms of employment due to being stuck in same position
good,"Management is hit or miss. Most employees are very enjoyable to work with. Depending on the location, customers can be a bit difficult, but that is to be expected in the service industry. Good benefits, free coffee, overall a good job."
good,the job is like a family. once you get the drinks down its not very difficult but it is very fast paced. Everyone supports each other but its also easy for people to get frustrated when someone is slacking off in their role.
good,"Honestly, your experience is going to vary from store to store, sadly. My first two SMs were great. My last one needed improvement."
good,If you can handle the fast paced environment and can make sure you bring quality of service it's really not a difficult job. Once you get the flow of things it becomes simple. Management for me wasn't amazing and kind of took away the luster of working for a good company.
good,"Depending on the store you worked at determined your experience. I worked at great stores where the manager understood you had a life outside of Starbucks; and i worked at a store where Starbucks came before everything. Some stores are high-volume where you won't believe its been 8+ hours and some stores can be low-volume where time drags. Either way they'll make sure to keep you busy. Management can be a little stressful with hours being cut for personal reasons, empty promises to move up, and a lot of gossip but that's any workplace. Starbucks is starting to hire outside managers that know less than the baristas which can put unnecessary stress on the workers. You'll feel overworked and underpaid but if you love learning about coffee and making customer connections in your community you'll love working here. Meeting great people both as customers and co-workers made the decision to leave Starbucks."
good,Starbucks was a great company to work with depending on who is in management. If you need a part time job with good benefits. Then I would choose them
good,Its a great company to work for especially if its your first job. But don't expect to get paid well. You'll be paid minimum wage and you won't make much more no matter how long you work there.
good,Overall Starbucks is a great place to work if you can handle working fast constantly. They do a great job of hiring the right personality types to provide excellent customer service. This also makes for a fun work environment because most coworkers get along great and become friends outside of work .
good,I believethat Starbucks is a fantastic place to work but over my ten years I have realized the changes that have been put in place to stay competitive. It has added more work but hasn't offered more labor which can become stressful under poor management. I have found it hard to progress with the company as it has constant changes for management which makes recognition a hard task. Great place to work other than the politics.b
good,"Regular customers and coworkers make the job fun and easier to do. Though the environment is fast-paced and demanding, so it can easily get stressful."
good,"With Starbucks being one of the dominating coffee chains in the country you can expect to always be busy. If you are not helping customers, you're prepping. If you're not prepping you're cleaning. And sometimes you're prepping and cleaning in between helping customers. It can be a little intimidating for a noobie but once you get the routine down you're good."
good,Le programme ou les journées de travail sont excellent avec une bonne ambiance et aussi une bonne entraide concernant les taches les plus difficile à exécuter.Le plus intriguant dans ce travail c'est surtout la pression continuelle qui s'étend à tout échelon de l'entreprise.
good,"-meet a lot of new people"
good,"This is a great job for a college student there is no doubt. It offers a good balance between work, life and school. It can be a long day and exhausting if you opt for long shift and you do not get any benefits, unlike a corporate location."
good,"Workplace culture is good."
good,"Working as a barista can be challenging and the atmosphere at Starbucks is very quick-paced. For those reasons, managers and lead baristas need to be very good at their jobs to help lead the staff successfully. I have had some very good and very bad managers and for the most part, that is what can make or break the job and the service."
good,I would say that Starbucks is a good first job. Starbucks always made the time to schedule me according to my availability and had a very organized way of management.
good,Depending on what time you come in is what your part in the store you play for your time. so i would come in at 330. to close the store witch entailed me finishing the cleaning that someone started for me . which only left me with taking out trash and staying till the end and cleaning after we close the doors so everything was better than good in the morning for people in the morning.
good,très bonne entreprise avec une bonne cohésion de groupe .
good,The training that was provided was very helpful and very thorough. I learned a lot and experienced a patient and understanding staff. It was a fun challenge to get efficient at working the bar and making drinks quickly and correctly.
good,A standard day to day shift is a great place to work with good partners on shift that make everyday enjoyable. The management are generally very helpful and supportive.
good,"Free Coffee"
good,"Fun place to work at, definitely a job worth having if you want something that'll be fast paced and have you talking to multiple different faces on a daily basis."
good,working here means you need to be able to keep up with the rushes of people that come and go while providing excellent service in stressful situations. some days will be slow and steady and then others will be very hectic. sometimes you're understaffed so you have to compensate for the missing help you don't have which can put a strain on you.
good,"Overall its a easy job to follow, just like any other. The best part about working here is the support you get from both management and fellow employees."
good,"This is a great first job for anyone that likes fast pace work with a little down time. Though there isn't a lot of room for advancing up, it makes up for it with the fun you have with people you work with."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks on the Louisiana State University at Alexandria. It wasn't a job through Starbucks, it was through the school and Compass Group. I started as a barista and advanced to a supervisor position."
good,"Its has its cons, but overall a great place to work! Starbucks has been through a lot of change but kept me interested. Fun, fast paced human interactions!"
good,"its Starbucks.. its exactly what you expect, you are forced to be chipper when all you want to do it curl up in a ball and die."
good,"Typical Day is like Cheers, family environment with the team and customers.  Fast paced and fun."
good,"I loved working at starbucks, good way to kick start my barista career. But, after working there for almost 3 years, I realized that this specific coffee shop wasn't for me. I want a more authentic feel, the time to make the most detailed latte art. More quaint and unique. Workplace culture in starbucks is very tense, fast, and pressured."
good,This is not the kind of place you can slack off at. Everyone here is expected to be doing two or three things at once and quickly. It is fun when you have a good team. You will learn a lot that you can carry forward to any other job you'll ever have.
good,"Often busy , great  staff, management wasn't that great . The most enjoyable part was making drinks cutomers love and that made me happy to provide them with a good drink . The hardest pasrt was dealing with the management."
good,Starbucks is a great company they even offer a free bachelors degree but that is not whats wrong with the company just another tycoon that abuses their size to under pay the employees scalp hours when they go thru remolding just a general lack of care for the employee.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for students and young individuals. I learned a lot about food preparation and storage. I was able to gain experience in customer service and I developed a lot of communication skills. For most part I would work behind bar and on register catering to customers' orders and preparing orders. I really enjoyed working with a team and meeting new people. It was almost like a family. However, I felt that management at our location was very unorganized. Scheduling was a big issue at my particular store as we never seemed to have coordinated shifts."
good,"Management changed frequently, some were good some not so good."
good,"Great environment, awesome co-workers. Unfortunately, we had a manager that brought down morale, but overall, the employees enjoyed their time working there. Made a lot of friends!"
good,"Starbucks offers outstanding benefits for even part-time employees. 401K, medical, dental, & vision insurance, discounts, and stock benefits. We also earn weekly tips that vary from store to store. In stores where I have worked, the tip rate fluctuates from $1.10-$2.00 per hour each week. The work environment is fast-paced and sometimes stressful, but it is overall fairly positive. Management in recent years has not been the best. Some managers are not often present in stores, and supervisors are left to manage responsibilities that should be left for the store manager. Corporate has also taken a lot of control over all aspects of the job within the past two years, which detracts from the individualized, unique customer experience that defined the Starbucks brand in the past."
good,"A fast paced and fun work place. Builds social skills, and gives a lot of cash handling experience. Teaches you how to work as a member of team and how to multi task. Helps build a strong  and healthy relationship with your co-workers."
good,Starbucks at UCO is a friendly environment to work in. The work strategy to have a five employees on the floor made it more efficient to be able to give quality service to each and every customer.
good,"I love Starbucks, the culture is great and employees are very friendly. I'm a shift supervisor and i'm required to do a lot of management tasks but I only get paid $11/hr and the baristas make $9/hr. The benefits are amazing but if you take advantage of healthcare benefits it takes out a lot from your check leaving you with hardly any money left over. I think the baristas should be making $11/hr and Shift Supervisors $15/hr. For the amount of work we all do and responsibility we have the pay is not enough to live off of."
good,Been there for 3 years now. Has it's up and downs but all in all its a great job. Deal with a wide array of people customers and partners alike. I've also made some of my best friendships here.
good,"Happy working there with different races"
good,This company is wonderful and it does value its partners. The atmosphere is welcoming but dealing with the public can be difficult at times. I enjoy working with my team and that is important within a company. A typical work day depends on the traffic of the store but if you come in with a great attitude you can make any hard day work out for the good. I enjoy handcrafting the beverages and making connections with the customers.
good,"I learnt a lot from this job, I gained customer service and people skills, and learnt a lot about coffee and coffee culture. My benefits were good and i had a good work/life balance."
good,"Pretty good starting job, pays really well with good benefits. First shift starts at 3:30 a.m. and closing depends upon the last flight. If there is a delay, you are stuck there too. Management is a bit chaotic and not usually very organized. Everyone there is pretty great to work with, HMS Host as a whole has some great employees. Starbucks side occasionally has drama."
good,"Different position throughout the shifts, which means it never get boring. Generally fun place to work, have lots of things that needs to get done. Can be pretty stressful at times when it gets busy, but people are generally nice, nothing too extreme."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. It provides benefits and stock option plans. One free food item per shift and 30% discount. They reimburse you for a bachelors degree through ASU.
good,"decent company to work for. i get the hours i want, pretty much when i want them. its fairly easy, people are a little extra at times but overall nice calm atmosphere"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work; the company actually really cares about its partners. some stores are are more stressful than others depending on the location. the hardest part about the job is ""peak"" which s the busiest time of the day however other than that its a great place."
good,"Had a lot of fun working here, very fast paced joe. Always something to do( taking orders, cashiering, cleaning, restocking, keeping up with production freshness."
good,I enjoyed my years at Starbucks. The experience offered much for new opportunity and growth. It was however sometimes difficult to maintain a balanced team with part time coworkers.
good,Many managers loved that I once worked at Starbucks. It incorporates sales in a fast paced environment which is great. Benefits were pretty good and it certainly is a great place to gain experience. Workload can be pretty stressful at times.
good,"The only real issue I had with the job was work/life balance. The environment was otherwise supportive, information could always be found if needed, employees were friendly and the benefits were great in comparison to similar jobs at other companies."
good,I very much enjoyed working for Starbucks. I was sad to leave when I had to move provinces. I was frustrated when my manager neglected to file the paperwork for my transfer properly and more frustrated when corporate told me to move back to the province to get my job back.
good,I have met many different kinds of customers while working here this passed year. I have learned how to handle each problem calm and collectively. I have also grown into an amazing team player by working here. The job is fun but does not pay enough considering how hard I work for my store and team.
good,"Busy but fun workplace with good teamwork. Starbucks does a good job training their employees and keeping team enthusiasm up. Management cares how you feel about your job satisfaction and there's good communication within the store. "
good,"The place could often get chaotic, and it was hard to call out for family emergencies, but the benefits were good. Advancement opportunities were good, but very unforgiving if you made any mistake."
good,"You are constantly on your feet, but it makes the day go by so fast. Unless you hate retail/ food, you will love it. Benefits are sadly lacking. This was a franchise owned by target."
good,"Loved my coworkers and the job over all. The customers can be very rude and entitled (more so than I've seen any where else in my decade in the food service industry) and I'm sure the fact that the company's motto is ""just say yes!"" Doesn't help much with that. Rushes can be and usually are extremely stressful, but once you get the hang of everything the job gets pretty easy. Pay as a barista isn't worth some of the things you have to deal with, and the pay as a shift supervisor is definitely not worth it. The ""partner"" perks are pretty awesome though."
good,"Working at Starbucks was an amazing experience. Everyone was very friendly, welcoming and helpful. There was always a positive vibe. The manager was really nice and professional."
good,A fast-paced job so catching on quick is a must. Management isn't the best but it keeps the environment steady. Coworkers are the best part of the job
good,"I've been at starbucks for almost 3 years and I've enjoyed it in the past. I like the people I work with and the regulars I've got to know over the years. The jobs is doable but does get stressful at times, therefore employees need to be able to work in a fast-paced environment. The issues are that most locations don't offer full-time work to baristas which has resulted in a signficant drop in morale in the past year."
good,"I have been with the company for four years. I recently relocated to a new state and realized that the only thing that really kept me here all this time were my coworkers and my manager. Now that I've moved to a new state with new coworkers/management, I've realized that the corporate overhead and overall job is not that wonderful. But the benefits, the benefits are great. Stock, 401k, dental/vision/health insurance, free coffee and discounts on all the product. I don't know, nothing against Starbucks but this job just isn't for me anymore!!"
good,"Starbucks takes pride in working around your schedule but there is a crisis in giving enough hours to partners who need them, while the community of baristas is extremely supportive, there is a serious lacking of care from management."
good,"Workplace is good. Coworkers are amazing, made some friends with customers but the manager at the time was very unreliable.The day starts by making sure the tables and chairs are in place, coffee are available and everything is set before we open the doors. Usually customers will only get hot coffee in the morning but as the day progresses, different customers frpom walks of life come to get different kinds of beverages. I learned alot of things working at Starbucks including multi tasking, being able to hold your own against unruly customers, genuinely caring if customers drinks are what they ordered and making new friends."
good,"The job was easy, the pay was adequate but the job itself was unreliable.I worked there for ten months and was laid off three times. Every time I was laid off it was at the end of that days shift."
good,Starbucks was my first job ever. I absolutely loved it. It was a great atmosphere to work in. You met great people everyday. The coworkers was amazing.
good,"I adore the company; however, if the statement a manager can make or break your experience, I have shattered into a million pieces. The company itself takes care of its employees with stocks and a 401k, not to mention health insurance that is out of this world. The downside is that if you want to get good raises you will be constantly stuck at a minimum bar because the companies wages are slowly being raised, but because of that everyone who started five, ten years ago will be making the same amount as someone who starts tomorrow, it's disheartening."
good,"Baristas take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications. Baristas also must often clean coffee machines,, restaurant areas."
good,Working with customers was fun and I really enjoyed making and crafting drinks for everyone. The best part was recommending new drinks and customizing drinks to the tastes of my clients.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks and I was there to open at 3:30 in the morning.  My opening team was great and it was normally the same people everyday that I worked with.  There was usually a different shift supervisor and I work well with all of my leaders.  Everyday I would come in and get everything ready for the day and also the afternoon crew.  We were responsible for having items prepped for the afternoon team to make things easier since those were the busiest times.  I always had a good time making drinks, interacting with customers and making my team have fun as well.  We are just making coffee but its up to the barista to make each experience with the customer special and I felt this was the most important part of my job.  Without a happy customer we have nothing.  Customer service is my number one priority and I take that motto everywhere I go."
good,"This has been a decent part-time job. My manager has been flexible as far as my hours go. Do not be fooled. You will work and you will learn. Starbucks is about procedure and its customers. You will get to know your customers over time, not just what they drink but as people. There is a lot of cleaning involved. You have to keep a clean store. If you're not taking care of customers, you will clean."
good,"The best part about this job is the opportunity to affect people's daily lives. I've gotten to know dozens of great people through this job who I never would have met otherwise. It can be tricky to move up in the company because of your availability. For the most part, every manager I've worked for has been helpful and encouraging of personal development. This job requires a good memory, a strong ability to multitask, willingness to participate in sales goals for each individual store, cleaning often, and excellent customer service."
good,"Its an amazing company to work for, tons of benefits. It is hard to work up in this company. You will deal with a wide variety of customers and see how they interact. You have to have patience and be able to stand up for yourself and not take what some customers say personal."
good,I worked at Starbucks while I was in college and it's a great way to get benefits for part time work. There's always something to do and you'll be on your feet the whole day.
good,"Drive-Thru was difficult to master, drink engineering while someone is ordering in your ear then typing it up while slapping a sticker on the cup can be a bit of a juggle but thats how they operate. Asking all the right questions while someone is asking you questions at the bar to help you is difficult when your starting out its a very sink or swim system. Getting tips and free drinks was a nice perk."
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. Putting a smile on the customer's face was my favorite part of my job. However, the manager was sexist and played favorites very clearly. I think this company needs to be harsher with whom they choose to be managers."
good,"They was very patient with me, I learned how to make a lot of drinks, learned how to close the store at the end of the day. Also made a lot of connections while working there meeting different type of people."
good,"a typical day is very fast paced, i have learned how to brew coffee, make lattes, macchiatos, frapuccinos, etc. management is typical; exactly what you would expect in fast food."
good,Great environment to work in. Super fast paced and you have to keep up with customer demands. Need to know how to deal with angry customers. Management is okay.
good,It is a good place to work while in school with decent benefits. Corporate can be disconnected from the needs of the partners and make the work day difficult.
good,The whole team was focused on the corporate goals which made the fast-pace easier. A tight-knit team friendship made the stressful morning rushes a joy to bear at times. The management was lax but very results focused.
good,this was another fun job. the early morning sucked but the other employees where great to work with. the customers where hit or miss. there were some that would even throw their card or money at me.
good,"Exactly what it seems like. Fast, repetitive, fun, selling legal addictive stimulants to the public with lots of sugar and whipped cream. I always enjoyed working in coffee shops, you can make someone's day with something so simple."
good,"Have had great managers and terrible ones.  Current manager is great.  Great benefits for this type of work.  Very stressful and fast-paced -- a lot is expected of you, and corporate adds more tasks every month.  Exhausting."
good,", môi trường làm việc thân thiện!!! Nhưng phần lớn thời gian đều dành cho công việc !!!"
good,I started working as Barista in December 2015 and was promoted to assistant manager March 2017. I love everyone I work with so much and enjoy my job but management can be a little difficult sometimes and i am doing alot of work for the wadge i am being paid
good,"fun place to work. "
good,"I loved working with most of my coworkers. However the place I worked at did not have the friendliest of coworkers. When I tried to apply again after leaving for a period of time, they said they would schedule me for training shifts but they never called me back."
good,"Experience can vary widely depending on location, as I have experienced working at a couple of different stores. Being able to prioritize and multi-task is a must, and schedules change very frequently. Drive-thru locations are usually very high-volume and shifts tend to be stressful during peak hours. "
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work at. The environment was fast paced and the benefits were beneficial. However, sometimes the hours were sporadic and few."
good,"Most days were eventful with a line around the courtyard and a row of drinks waiting to be made. Coworkers and Management could be hit or miss depending on the individuals, however I found my personal experience greatly improved once I was transferred over to another location on campus where I personally got along effortlessly with my team. The atmosphere is usually relaxed, although always productive as baristas were usually cleaning or brewing something. The hardest part was always the ""frappy hour"" special that occurred around finals; half-price drinks turned the already sizable line into a winding snake of waiting customers. At the end of the day though, I enjoyed the company I kept while working at Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks provides decent pay, good opportunities for advancement, and good benefits. However once you advance past the starting positions work/life balance can go out the window if you're not careful."
good,"I have worked at starbucks for 2 years and i love it! But the only downside is that the Management SUCKS. There is still a Shift who works here that has threatened others, has cussed others coworkers out, and is always in a bad mood. Many coworkers have called on said person and nothing has happened. If you wanna work here go ahead, and dont get me wrong i love it here. But thats the only downside. Benefits are great! Full Maternity leave is paid. Its wonderful!"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks! Although my manager at the time wasn't the best, I really enjoyed working with the other partners in my store. It can be stressful at times because its a very fast- paced environment and at times we would run out of certain products which didn't sit well with some customers but that's what you have to expect working in customer service/ food industry. Other than that Starbucks as a company really do try to care for their partners! Also very easy to advance in the company depending on your work ethic."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced and exciting place to work. it can be stressful at times, especially running the espresso bar during the morning rush. when I first started the schedules changed every week and you didn't know when you were going to work until a few days before the following week. but then that changed and they started announcing the shifts for up to four weeks in advance so you could plan your days accordingly."
good,"- Excellent work environment"
good,Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for. I'm having a bad experience with a manager who chooses not to show up most of the time and who doesn't do much in the ways of managing. If I had a good manager the experience would be much better because the job itself is great.
good,"I enjoy the connection to customers when working, however, when busy the environment changes to a fast-pace and stressful one. Being in a hurry can cause mistakes to happen and co-workers to get negative attitudes. Overall, most days went well, I enjoyed learning to make drinks and enjoyed serving customers to the best of my ability."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a great experience the atmosphere and coworkers were all great to work with. "
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for overall. They offer great benefits as well as compensation for their managers. The only true con to Starbucks is the work life balance aspect and the lack of support for their managers. Starbucks has been known to do all they can for their hourly partners such as shift supervisors and baristas when it comes to their schedules as well as their incentives to continue working with them. However when it come to its managers it seems as though they are a bit left behind. Those cons aside Starbucks is truly a great company to work for.
good,"Great job fast paced, I enjoyed the benefits. At times I felt overworked and under utilized. 401k and stock options were a life saver. Watch out for under trained Managers and District Managers recently heard DMs are trying to get rid of long time employees which is ridiculous, your loyalty gets you nowhere, especially is a DM has an opinion on senior staff."
good,"Starbucks has many ups and downs. For a part time food service position though it's better than the rest. Good amount of useful benefits, and takeaways."
good,"Some employees are caddy. If you need to a day off and your scheduled you must find someone to cover your shift. If you do and they don't show up it's still on you. You will get phone calls on your days off asking you to come and cover someone's shift however, the same courtesy will not be extended to you should you need a day off."
good,"Starbucks in my experiences was a wonderful learning experience. The greatest lesson that I have learned is the power of patience and understanding when dealing with customers. On a day to day basis, I was tasked with undertaking bitter customers to make each one of them satisfied once again. This task was difficult at times, but as my tenure went on, it became second nature. I also learned the ideas of compromise when dealing with management, and to know when to stand up or sit down for a cause. The hardest part of the job, like all is the ability to please everybody. With many policies in place for each company, the workers must find a balances to please their boss as well as the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was making life long connections and bonds with colleagues as well as customers."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for. The hours are very flexible and can accommodate  someone who is in school. Tuition assistance is offered as well as insurance. The job itself is fun and light heated. I would recommend for college and high school students alike.
good,"The customer basis can vary from the area that you live in, which can effect the type of drinks that you will make a majority of the time. The environment is safe and comfortable, and most people that you will work with are great. You will make some forever friends from the coworkers as well as the regulars. Other places just make coffee, but with Starbucks, they make it a much different experience by creating a ""Third Place""."
good,"I've been working at Starbucks for nearly 7 years as a barista and shift supervisor. You're on your feet all the time, it's a very fast-paced environment (depending on your area). Unless you limit your work hours/availability, your schedule is completely unpredictable. You can open one day, close the next day, and it makes it difficult to regulate your day or keep a routine. Management is overall very structured, but it's still dependent on each individual store manager and how they approach corporate policy and the individual needs for your own store."
good,"Great benifits, all around great company. Customers are great, the environment is great, great benifits. Now if only they could fix the management problem, some managers and shift leads play favorites which is defiantly a con."
good,"My boss, coworkers,&  regulars made the job. Without them it would be been hard work. They pay is hardly worth it though. Unless you find good people."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fun, and upbeat. Ive learned how to maximize my space, clean work environment habits, making healthy relationships with co workers. The hardest part of working in a high volume store is managing speed and quality. These are very important, because you need to be fast yet maintain the quality of all bar drinks. I enjoy making relationships with repeat customers and co workers. Some who have become long term friends."
good,"This job taught me things about coffee that I didn't know. I had never had coffee until u came here."
good,"Being barista in Starbucks is very life changing, i enjoy every beat when i started until I totally decided to go. Almost 5 years is not a joke. But They teach me a lot of things especially dealing with different types of people attitude. The only reason that i decided to go is that i cannot save enough money for my future and i want growth with different company. :)"
good,The place I worked at was high profile so the call for excellence was higher at our place.  We were often understaffed and that made the job very difficult sometimes.
good,"I would have loved to continue my career with the company; however, a new DM began, and my development was put on the back burner, so I had to move on."
good,Loved working at Starbucks. So many opportunities to learn and grow. Great support system. Upper management sometimes lacked. Retail is the hardest part of Starbucks. As a global company they are so amazing. It's hard not to love being a part of a different kind of company.
good,"Starbucks creates a culture of acceptance and sustainability, but labor distribution is a massive flaw. In stores that are slow, this may not always be an issue. However, in the store that I work for, customer volume versus the amount of partners on the floor is constantly unbalanced. We are expected to meet certain drive-thru times during our busiest hours, but we're severely understaffed to the point that customers and partners alike suffer. Our store's ratings are negatively affected and our morale is crushed in those moments. We often experience a second rush around 1 or 2 PM and are more often than not have three or four (if we're lucky) partners on the floor to run drive-thru, hot and cold bar, and front register. Overall, I would not recommend working for a high volume Starbucks location such as the one I work for if you're looking for an experience in team-building and time-management. Even the most effective time-keeping person cannot keep up with the ferociously fast demand of high volume stores. I sincerely enjoy working for Starbucks, but certainly won't consider working to make it a career."
good,"I have fun every day when I come into work, My team member are the most trusted guys i ever had the opportunity to work with. Work is on a productive high"
good,"Nice place to work, enjoy the group of people I work with. Fast paced but enjoyable. Shifts usually aren't long but very easy to pick up more hours. Lots of opportunities to move up if interested."
good,"- able to cope with heavy work load"
good,Starbucks is good company to work for .. Excellent benefits.. Friendly and inviting atmosphere.. Very productive treats their customers as if they were family
good,"Who doesn't love Starbucks? Starbucks can be overwhelming for an employee that has not been able to receive experience in a fast paced work place. Although the work pace is fast, Starbucks can also be a very exciting and fun place to work."
good,The work day i very taxing job on your emotional capacity you must always be on top of your game and it is necessary to have a longer fuse and not have a short temper.
good,"-Very stressful environment, mostly because of customers in the particular area I worked in"
good,"High volume stores are constantly busy and can be stressful"
good,"Culture is great but some management are bad."
good,I've enjoyed my seven years at Starbucks and realize that in order to advance my career development I need to work externally. I've been very fortunate to have been exposed in woroking with all the brands of the enterprise.
good,"The Company has values and there are lot of things to learn. "
good,"While it's nice that their starting pay isn't minimum wage, it's still way below what you deserve working here. We actually hand craft every beverage, it's not like everything squirts out of a machine like dunkin donuts or mcdonalds and I think people forget that. Besides that point, the wage still isn't livable. But it is nice that they don't start at minimum wage. There is a huge learning curve at the beginning getting the hang of all the drinks and recipes. But before you know it you could do it with your eyes closed. The dress code is relaxed and the atmosphere tries to be chill. However its still food service so its not easy. You get some crazy people and some crazy rushes. They have health care, 401k, and you get a free premium spotify account."
good,"Solid culture, smart people all motivated to do great work. Room for growth and open to new ideas and big thinking."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, plenty of room to advance and further education. Workday was easy and new faces are enjoyable. The management in my particular store was BS however, there are plenty of other stores with great management and wonderful staff. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the homeless folks who would flock in from the shelter next door."
good,"although a good paying company, the upper management tends to be slow to provide employees with the tools they need for their jobs. the benefits are good and with a good work ethic, minimal complaining (if you do complain, also have a solution), and knowledge of the area, you can be trusted to be chosen for extra jobs and tasks. not everyone works the same pace so you could end up being asked to stop your task to assist others. if you put your head down and work, you could earn a good paycheck. there is overtime but if you know the pattern of the business, you can adjust your family schedule accordingly"
good,"The company is flexible but if you are ever thrown off balance at home, it is difficult to get support from upper management to help you work through it."
good,"The company overall is changing drastically, some things for the better but most things not so much. When I finally left I was pretty annoyed at the direction it had taken. No more holiday bonuses, labor being cut yet higher standards. With the huge purchases of teavana, evolution and la Boulange the company was having an amazing year not only in stocks but other revenue as well yet they not once passed over some of the yielding stocks the partners that helped them get there."
good,This is probably one of the funnest jobs that I have ever had. I do however wish the opportunity for advancement was more readily available. The people I work with are also amazing and make the job as awesome as it is.
good,"This job will draw you in. You'll love your co-workers, and for the first few days/weeks, you'll enjoy going to work. A day will come, either during the winter BOGO or summer ""Frappy Hour,"" when you want to give up and quit, but you don't. You'll stay a few more months and work through the counterpart of the first hard season you worked, and compare the two. You'll decide soon before the harder of the two returns, whether or not this is the job for you."
good,"A typical day at work for me was for the most part not really work. My partners were some of my good friends. I learned a lot about customer service working for Starbucks. The management is what out weighed all the good with bad. The management in my store wasn't the best, which is why i decided to seek another job."
good,Free coffee and making amazing friends along the way makes for a very enjoyable working environment. There are various labour issues and in my store some scheduling issues but despite these things its a wonderful job!
good,"-Great work place when your team and manager are friendly"
good,"Good company overall, but the financial compensation and erratic time schedule makes having a family difficult. It's a great first job, not long term."
good,Fun workplace and tight knit team. The only work so far whereby I saw employees coming to work with the smile. All of that proves that the managing and the relationship amongst colleagues is very nice.
good,I've learned about different types of coffee and how it is made. Nice co-baristas. Small salary and long hours of work. Has a strict management. Great workplace culture.
good,"Fun and easy first time job, work with people everyday/ people person job. Fast paced environment. Getting to know Starbucks regulars is a plus side to the job."
good,Working at Starbucks was extremely enjoyable. Everyone in the workplace had an upbeat attitude and the surroundings were very positive. Management came down a little harsh when necessary but overall it was great.
good,"The job wasn't terrible, but it was difficult to get the amount of hours necessary. I was promised full time and rarely got more than 16 hours a week."
good,"flexible schedules with students"
good,This job is just as it would sound; hectic and fun. It is really about about the people that are in your team. The customers are what make this place run. We do all that goes on for the customer.
good,"Les horaires étaient assez atypique 8h/23h, et les journées se ressemblaient trop"
good,"A lot of of good benefits if you're willing to take advantage of them. Health insurance, bean stock, tuition reimbursement all for a minimum of 20 hours/week. But the pay is terrible and morale is low."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. While it can get overwhelming with how many orders you receive (from in the store AND mobile ordering), if you have a well trained staff and solid management, it could be very easy to stay for 10+ years. Advancement is generally easy and is based on work ethic."
good,"Teavana deals with bulk tea sales, sourcing their teas from some of the best gardens and growers in the world. They offer nearly 100 different tea blends, some of the most rare teas to your every day teas. It is an amazing experience learning about these teas and what type of herbs, spices, fruit, etc. goes into each batch. It's not all sleepy time and earl grey!"
good,Fun environment. Very enjoyable. Flexible hours. Opportunity for overtime. Relaxed atmosphere. Opportunity to work at various locations. You can either work many hours or few.
good,"Excellent customer service"
good,"This was a very fun place to work with flexible hours for people who are very busy.  I worked here while in college and they worked very well around my schedule.  Without becoming a manager, I could not afford to work there after graduation."
good,Starbucks is a face pace work environment. Customer service and food quality and safety go hand in hand. Flexible hours and shifts and room to advance within the company.
good,Its a great company to work for....fast paced so shifts go by quickly with a great opportunity to get to know not only co workers but also frequent customers.
good,"i enjoy the environment very much, lots of people to meet. management helps a lot when it comes to a difficult customer, my fellow baristas are very welcoming"
good,"This job has provided me with extensive customer service experience as well as experience dealing with co-workers I have not gotten along with and also co-workers who will be life long friends. The job was extremely stressful at times, being a busy environment but that is part of what made time fly by."
good,"Great company if your starting to develop customer service skills, but not as a lifetime workplace. They have great benefits like health insurance and stock benefits for employees. Since it was one of my first jobs in retailing, it did help me to develop my customer service skills."
good,"Gives a lot of opportunity, however, your experience is mainly based on who your manager is.  My first store was great - great manager and great team.  After that the managers went up and down.  Never had an awful manager, but if your manager's mood swings, so does your experience.  Good benefits if you work 20 hrs or more/wk."
good,"I loved my job here. The work pace made days fly by with enjoyable people, both working and being patrons. The benefits exceeded good health insurance, as it included weekly product gifts."
good,We were always very busy which I loved. Loved all of my co-workers. Was not impressed with managemnt. Would love to still be working there because I was very proficent at my job. But the stressful work enviroment sometimes was very frusterating.But i loved being able to provide customers with great and tasty drinks.
good,"The job is great! I simply wish I was compensated ENOUGH for the time and energy I invest into my job. Advancement opportunities are available, but the pay still doesn't directly reflect the commitment."
good,"My experience has fluctuated, but as a company, Starbucks represents great customer service standards, and serves up quality product to its customers."
good,"It was a good experience by all means. the manager was nice, and so we're the other baristas. They have a good work culture and they take care of their employees."
good,Day-to-day work is very demanding. Peak hours of the day get extremely busy. Have to be patient at all times with customers. Remembering the big menu is a challenge but gets easier the more you work. high energy needed.
good,"great job - proud of it "
good,A typical day has predictable busy and slow times that allow you to build rapport with customers. Management styles are inconsistent and lead to dramatically different shifts. Co-workers vary from professional to childish. I've learned a great sense of global communication and how valuable having standards in performance can be. This job has given me an understanding of coffee that inspired further knowledge and advancement in my skills. The best part is getting through a shift knowing that you have helped everyone else succeed through diligence and speed while maintaining a positive customer experience.
good,"It's was a great experience working at Starbucks. I gained cafe/barista skills, and culinary experience. I don't really have any complaints. The employees take there job serious and they don't mind to lend a helping hand."
good,a typical day at Starbucks is fast-paced. I learned more accurate ways of listening and reacting to customers needs with great customer service. I have also learned that management is not always out for your best interest as an employee and that I have to be more pro-active and stand up for the things I want. Co-workers are the people that I work with to ensure that the store is run efficiently. The hardest part of the job is to take a breath and de-stress. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing about how I made someone's Starbucks experience one of the best moments of their day.
good,"there's a lot of work to do but its really fun to interact with people and make drinks that change with the seasons. "
good,"Starbucks HQ ranks as the best place I ever worked. The workplace is luxuriantly appointed and the coffee culture is extreme and free for the taking. People have entirely positive, can-do attitudes, and the level of stress appeared low to me. However, be prepared to tolerate the grossest inefficiency of operations ~ things get done almost 100 percent via sitting in meetings discussing and developing the solutions collaboratively. At least 1/2 of every day is meetings, and for management, 100 percent is typical. Still, a great bunch of positively oriented people out to make the world better. I liked it, and I would work there again."
good,"I have enjoyed working there. It can get very stressful at times. Requires a lot of patience with people, especially costumers. I have barista experience so it was easy to pick up on."
good,"Work at a fast pace environment, helping customers and keeping store presentable for the public. The job is not hard, it gets really busy and so we have to keep up with the drinks or else customers start to get impatient. We're always working hard."
good,"My work at Starbucks left me pretty anxious each session. I was instantly thrown into a fast paced environment, with only a few days of training under my belt. Often times, there didn't seem to be enough people scheduled onto a shift, especially when I was first hired and still needed assistance in knowing where things went and how to do things properly. However, the co-workers were amazingly nice. They were helpful, efficient and made both the customers and their co-workers feel welcome. While the manager herself didn't seem very well organized, the company overall went above and beyond to make me feel like they were glad to have me on board as a member of Starbucks."
good,"A normal shift i'd come in, hop on bar if i could, but cashier if necessary. I really liked making the drinks and talking to the people as I made them their drinks because you could really see how just a little nice conversation with a friendly barista can really boost someones mood. The hardest part was the really super picky customers cause there drinks had to be just right and they were usually regulars."
good,"I have loved working at both Starbucks locations that I was employed at, yet both management styles were very frustrating to work under. Neither had the level of organization a major chain store should have in my personal opinion. In both locations, we were constantly under-stocked regardless of the current demand; employees and customers suffered in both stores due to the unorganized management."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for: Plenty of hours for those who want them and flexible around school schedules. Surprisingly high rollover of staff (including management) but steady improvement in store expectations and performance.
good,"This job was a great experience to learn a different skill such as food handling, however it was not enough pay. Co-workers of mine were also college students so we related to one another and were willing to help with scheduling which as a huge plus."
good,Loved my team.  It was hard to get help from other stores at times.  Work/life balance was non existent.  Other managers would only help if the district manager made them.
good,I love the capability to know new people and provide the guest with what they need. It trains the individual well and tries to promote and comfortable working environment.
good,"Working in Starbucks for more than 2 years, I could say that I gained managerial skills and interpersonal skiils.The most enjoyable part of the job its when you see that customers are happy and enjoing beeing in our store."
good,"Es un trabajo compañero, tienen mucho horarios flexibles depende a tus necesidades."
good,definitely better with the right coworkers around you to help bring this place some fun. some managers can be cool others not so much. good place to work though.
good,It is very vibrant and up beat. Slightly demanding. Management is understanding and hard working. Co workers create a great environment to get things done.
good,Knowing the regulars with the names and drinks down pack in the memory bank. I work in a more financial district with professionals who are just in and out in and happy with a speedy service and a smile. Customers are what makes me happy to come to work.
good,"Tem ótimos benefícios e liberdade para trabalhar. Empresa dinâmica e de excelentes aprendizados, como cursos para aprimorar as habilidades."
good,"This company always has a very diverse and cultured employees, for a larger corporation is seems to have a lot of small business type people running it. And as a large corporation it can proved benefits that otherwise would be not available."
good,"Dia normal de trabalho, aprendi erviço de barista."
good,Great place to start building experience! Flexible shifts to take on while still going to school. Rush hours are crazy but you'll get the hang of it.
good,Great place to work in they really care for their partners. If you love to be on the move the  i highly recommend it.Very creative atmosphere and very cultural.
good,"The customers are out of control sometimes, but overall Starbucks is a great place to work while you're going to school. My particular location was filled with uptight people (both customers and employees)."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Starbucks, and the friendships I made. They have good employee  incentives/programs that are worth looking into."
good,"This is a very fast paced place to work. you are on your feet for most of the day. you meet a lot of cool people. hardest part of the job was dealing with the demands of the customers, unrealistic as they sometimes were. most enjoyable part of the job was actually meeting so many people who valued the product you were able to produce for them. The culture of the job is very personable. Very customer service driven, but authentic."
good,"A typical day at starbucks is pretty hectic, but it keeps you on your toes. You learn how to work well with a team and customer service skills."
good,A typical day at work would consist of performing tasks around the store and communicating with customers while making sure they receive the best service.  I learned a lot about talking to people and getting to know the regular customers to improve their experience.  Management and co-workers definitely made my starbucks partnership a great experience.
good,"This job is not for the lazy, sensitive, or the unfriendly. Because it is a service job, expect to be asked to do many many things that were not in the official training. The customers will be wonderful and awful at times, and expect to answer the same questions fifty times a day. For all that my manager was excellent and I would still be there had they not decided to add many things to the menu of which I am allergic."
good,I loved working for Starbucks.The perks were great and the pay was decent. The management was terribly unorganized and inconsistent from store to store. Communication was over flooded and was difficult to decipher what was a necessary action and what was not.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, quick and interactive. You learn how to communicate with other people from different background and ethnicities and working with other people. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is the fast paced environment."
good,"All partners are fun to be around, makes the job a much better place to work. Hardest part of the day is dealing with angry unsatisfied customers and getting through  the rest of the shift after the rush, which usually happen between 7 and 11 AM."
good,"While I will always cherish the years I have spent working with Starbucks, it is time to move onto something more challenging and fulfilling."
good,The management did a great job. I was really impressed with how flexible they were with my schedule. I loved getting to know the regular customers. This was a great place to work.
good,"Typically I wake up at 2:30 in the morning to get to work on time to open the store at 3:30. I work any number of jobs; but I usually end up working on the bar making lattes with the more experienced employees. "
good,"I loved meeting the people that work here and visit us for food and drinks. Management was usually fair, and there are always times when food and coffee tasting is enjoyed. I enjoy working here."
good,Love having the benefits and serving people their coffee hot cold iced blended. Just making others smile and have a wonderful day makes me want to work more
good,overall a good place to work. Not a lot of room for advancement. a lot of ongoing spontaneous changes. Unexperienced management but great pay and great day to day work environment.
good,"The Starbucks within a Harris Teeter tends to be overlooked. There needs to be a better system to where the Starbucks Leads are given the support they need. The leads are managers without authority. "
good,Good experience work staff and different customers coming in on a daily basis. Listening to different musical artists from various parts of the world over the speakers at work was a pleasant added bonus.
good,Learned a lot about myself and how to strive for customer service excellence. The hard part of this job is how they constantly expect more from you but offer very little compensation for the growing amount of work that piles up
good,I worked inside the café. there was plenty of work to do. the place is really popular among college students to study there so its almost always pretty busy. the pay is not much but the workers there are very nice.
good,The Management at meijers was reasonable to a point. I went on a medical for 10 days and they wanted me back at day 8 and if i didnt come in i would of gotten written up. spoke to another manager who fixed the situation for me
good,"The best part of this job is the benefits. They are pretty amazing. With that, however, comes the fact that I am paid next to nothing for the amount of work I do. If it was a cushy desk job, I'd be paid a lot more for the sheer volume of work I do."
good,"The company isn't bad, yet its the customers that are the hardest aspect of the job.  Recently, the company has cut back on labor, which greatly effects our morale.  We work harder with less people.  Also, my store's air conditioning unit has been down, making us work in 100 degree heat. We have been begging the company to fix it but they are frugal and won't budge."
good,"A typical day at work is a fun day. "
good,"The day can go by fairly quickly depending on the customer flow in a day to day basis.  Can become a high stress environment on the variable of staffing and flow of customers.  "
good,Grew with the company.  Had the opportunity to learn many new things and meet a lot of great people. Senior Management changes can mix things up quite a bit.  In store environment and collaboration between peers is excellent.
good,The coworkers are great and the job is great. Everyone is respectful and caring towards each other. Can get a bit hectic at times.
good,"Generally you stand on your feet a lot. "
good,"Starbucks is a well established company, with a routine for everything. Job experience varies by location. A high volume store can be hectic. Labor hours are hard to come by, and staffing can be an issue."
good,"make drinks, take people's orders , take people's money, clean restock the front of the store,make drinks in the back brew tea , coffee ice coffee, inventory, help customers, clean the tables mop sweep."
good,I don't feel comfortable doing a review about my current job online because i'm not sure exactly who's viewing it.
good,"Starbucks is a fun filled job with friendly and caring co-workers that continually have helped me grow as a person and as a business associate. I have been blessed with very friendly co-workers and good managers that have made my first job experience truly enjoyable. I am ready, however, to move onto a full time job where I can grow and work in an office environment where I would like to expand my horizons."
good,"Generally, the best part of working at Starbucks is free drinks, working with fun people and the insurance option. You also get free food during your shift. The pay is very minimal, for how much work one has to put in. There is usually not enough people working during peak times, so each person has to do several people's jobs."
good,"this is a good job with fun employees and loving environment, and it can be come stressful. it feels great team but there is a lot of management problems. I am just looking for somewhere to grow within a company"
good,i have learned business model and management skills. good coworkers. The hardest part of job is managing partners under my control when it is busy
good,It is store dependent. Some stores are amazing. Some have a lapse in management and scheduling. It can cause rifts between the manager and the store.
good,"When I first began working there, I was nervous. But I was welcomed onto the team quickly and the partners were very welcoming. The store manager is really kind and is someone you can talk to about pretty much anything."
good,"Hard work is rewarded, and balancing orders and drink making while doing daily required tasks like inventory management and cleaning makes this job very fast paced and sometimes difficult, but if you work hard and use your time effectively, you can get so much done in a day the time will fly by!"
good,I learned so much from working for this company. I think this company is great and would definitely want to transfer to another Starbucks. The hardest part about the job is waking up at the crack of dawn but once you get to work it gets better. I also love getting to know the customers.
good,"Fun workplace."
good,I loved working here. I enjoyed learning how to make all the drinks. I have never worked at a more positive place. The holidays were a little rough but other then that everything was always fun and professional.
good,"The job was straightforward, only challenge was dealing with large volumes of customers. The people you work with are usually friendly and helpful, just like you would experience as a customer."
good,"Made drinks and took orders, provided excellent customer service, basic cleaning tasks, trained new hires, did small inventories. in short a basic part time job at a good company."
good,"a typical work day for me is all about helping other or putting a smile on another persons face.i have learned patients, and how to be understanding of others.i learned how to manage my time better. management/coworker are excellent.we all work together to make the work day very productive.the most enjoyable part of my day is to put a smile on customer faces.the hardest part is dealing with rude people but i have learned that if there having a bad day just smile and be nice maybe that will help there day a little more"
good,"Very up beat work environment. Very fast paced and precision based. Management is fine, but certain things don't happen that should be done."
good,"This job gives you the chance to develop your customer service skills, your ability to work under pressure and to learn new things."
good,"Good at first but not room to expand."
good,"Flexible hours and availability. Friendly environment and trustworthy management. Co-workers are friendly and reliable, days can be busy with morning rushes and tasks that need to be accomplished."
good,Very flexible and they truly care for their employees. You have to know how to manage your time and you better be organized!
good,"The time goes by fast,the employees and customers were great, the salary was great, and it was a fun and challenging place to work at."
good,"A great place to work if you require health care benefits for your family. Steady job and good job security. Being in kind of remote location, advancement was limited."
good,The line typically stayed out the door from the time I clocked in to the time I clocked out due to being located directly outside of a college which was exhausting but still a fun job with fun employees.  Starbucks definitely provided me with the team environment I was looking for because coordination was key to keeping the line under control.  The only problem I ran into at the job was management due to a lack of managerial acknowledgment of my status as a full-time student.  The only reason I left the company was due to being unable to fulfill the amount of hours I was receiving while in classes Monday-Friday (working in between class gaps).  I am completely open to returning to the company in the future due to the customers and employees typically being very delightful to work with.
good,There is little to no room for advancement out of the retail stores.  The job is great for flexibility in your schedule and creating a work/life balance.
good,"When working at starbucks a smile was always the best way to start a shift, positive attitudes from all employees. While on the clock everyone had an assigned duty and we worked as a team to assure we all gave our 101% effort. I very much enjoyed my time as a partner and would definitely return to the team."
good,Every day we get to see our regular and walk - in customers enjoying a cup of coffee with a professional and bespoke conversation with them.
good,Shifts were all over the place.  Not great doing a close/open.  Learned more about coffee than I ever knew before.  Hardest part of the day was sometimes never getting a lunch because it was so busy.  Loved the people I worked with.
good,"It's a good job to deal with different people each day with a good working environment. While some days can be more stressful than others, it's always great when you have a good team. As this is my first supervisor role, I felt that I learnt a lot about my type of mange rial skills and what I'm good at and what I can improve on. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people each day and the majority of the co-workers were great."
good,"When I first starting working at my store, it was amazing. We were all a family there, and we all loved working there."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced work environment with constantly changing demands. The people we work with are one of the primary reasons that this is one of the best companies to work for. They are supportive, encouraging, engaging and innovative thinking. With the ever changing demands of the role, it's the ""teamwork"" mindset that continuously proves that this is a great company to work for."
good,A great place to work if you are going to school or want to work at a second job. Almost always a fun environment and every shift has a nice balance.
good,"The work is super rewarding, must be very self sufficient often alone and running the stand as one, upper management and leads ignore the cafe for the most part which is both good and bad, team members are sometimes difficult/unsupportive "
good,"productiv and fun place, nice envoirment, good work mates, i love what i do, i'm good what i do and i'm rewarded for that"
good,"Everyone you work with is great, and a lot of your customers are too. "
good,"On a typical day at work you can find me on bar making drinks or in the drive thru. Being the busiest store in the district we have drinks to make or food to gather. It can look crazy from a outsiders stand point, seeing everyone running around, it can look like mass chaos, but the truth is we are such a great team that we all know what to do and how to not bump into each other. In that business you have to have a good team or everything is going to fall apart."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"This job is awesome for someone wanting part time work or a college student. Benefits are offered to part time employees, but the pay is low, and there is a lot of physical labor. Overall I appreciate the company and all they do. It is difficult to get a full time position, and the schedule is not consistent."
good,"I Loved Working for Starbucks!"
good,"I enjoyed my job there as it was engaging and interesting with new experiences every day. I was put into stressful customer service situations with no supervision and gained positive results from these encounters. A typical day was 8-9 hours, fairly busy, with small amounts of time for fun with co-workers. The most difficult situations were customer complaints but righting them was the most enjoyable."
good,"L'ambiance de travail est super bonne, la gérante est très productive et nous donne une belle motivation! L'équipe est choisi en fonction de son caractère donc très dynamique et plaisant!"
good,"It is a constant flow of moving, carrying, bending, walking, and standing throughout every shift. One must be able to multitask as many assignments as possible with as much detail as possible. Time management and teamwork is key to completing duties thoroughly while fulfilling every customer's needs."
good,"Great starting job. No room for advancement however past shift supervisor. Overall was a good job, and taught me valuable skills that I still use to this day."
good,Being my first job I learned a lot about coffee and how to be a barista. I was happy in the way that I was treated. I met some great co workers that helped me learn to make coffee. The hardest part of the job was only at the beginning when I was new and had like 10 coffees to make in like 30 seconds ahaha but it was fun and I got the hang of it.
good,i enjoyed working at Starbucks coffee. it was a new experience for me and the crew members was awesome to work with. the hardest part would be remembering how to make the drinks. there was so many different drinks and different ways to make them but after a while you start to remember how the drinks are made.
good,"A typical day at this Starbucks location was full of different opportunities everyday. This location serviced over 700 customers a day, which left little time for learning or any mix-ups. Learning fast is a must, and I was able to do that almost immediately. I was lucky to have very intelligent and also compassionate co-workers to train me to help me through the short learning period. I was in turn able to pass those skills onto those that I trained as well. This job gave me the opportunity to not only become better at interacting with the customer, but also better at working with a team, which was essential in everyday success.I considered myself very accomplished in both of these aspects before working at this job, but I found myself feeling that I still advanced in them afterwards. This was a wonderful experience for me, and I look forward to furthering these skills even more with your company."
good,The job takes place in a qualty environment and if you can handle the pace the benefits make it worthwhile. The wages are meager but the experience is worthwhile.
good,Het was altijd een drukte van belang maar we zorgde er samen voor dat iedereen met een glimlach weg liep en alles weer was aangevuld voor het volgende team. Ik heb enorm genoten van het werk.
good,"Exciting, fast paced work environment."
good,Starbucks is a super fast paced environment. Plenty of customer service skills are a requirement. Purpose is to create the best possible experience for the customer. Creating that experience is completely accomplishable as long as the barista has patience and their proper training.
good,"Love the Starbucks spirit. They work with emotional people, for emotional customers. They come for a drink, and stay for the experience, that's the purpose. My colleagues are very active people, always ready to work and to have fun."
good,Working for starbucks is fun and very busy especially over the holidays. Starbucks is an incredible first time job. A typical day at work is organized and busy. I learned that patience is needed in every day task and can take you very very far in life. Management is awesome and they know how to handle things when stuff gets to tough. Most of my co workers are very hard working and friendly. I am so glad to have met them and to work with them. The hardest part of my job is when the customers get mad for absolutely no reason or take their anger out on you even though you have done nothing wrong. The most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with the cusomters. I learn so much from my regulars about life and love and work and how to save your money. I also enjoy when they bring their families into the store to meet us and you feel like you already know them becuase they have already told you so much about them.
good,"I really enjoyed working at that store, it was very busy but I had an amazing team next to me."
good,Fun workplace with supportive management. My co-workers are like family. Stressful and very fast paced. I work in the 2nd busiest store in the UK therefore non-stop busy so very tiring.
good,Awesome time working there. Miss it all the time. the only draw back is the pay is low. Great for a second job. One of the few big companies that seem to care about there people.
good,Start for my career in UK. Good experince and friendly stuff. Learned how to provide the best customer service and got communicative skills.
good,"Barista, cashier, and very fast pace environment. Preparing and making coffee drinks and food. Handling money and balancing register at the end of shift. Providing the best customer service."
good,The company as a whole is great.  The communication for a large company is fabulous.  There is never a dull moment!  I do see a trend in the management styles of Starbucks that my not be for the better in the long run.
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed my time at Starbucks, Germany. I had a good report with the daily customers and with my co-workers. There were times I did not agree with the way management handled certain situations, but we were able to come to terms with it and build a good working atmosphere."
good,"Energetic environment"
good,"I learned a lot with Starbucks. I learned how to multi-task, provide excellent customer service, and get to know our regulars on a personal level. My Co-workers were hard workers, and each had their own unique persona. it was a very good experience!"
good,"Great customers, fun place to work. Always busy. Steady tips. Love learning new drinks for different seasons of the year. Great environment."
good,Overall an enjoyable company to work for.  The hours can be difficult to manage for those who require very specific time frames.  Great job for students and/or part-time employees.
good,"Though I have not worked for starbucks for a very long time, it has been a major step up from the previous job that I had. They treat their employees with respect and do not hold them to an outrageous standard. The opportunity for advancement is not very high but the management is very nice and will train you on everything you need to know to get ahead in the company."
good,"the company is great takes care of its partners (employee's), you're team makes it a great place to work or stressful. management is good for the most part. Most enjoyable part, is working with partners that are great team members and outgoing people. one of the perks is meeting and connecting with new people, you never know who will walk through those doors. The most hardest part is mastering the art of customer service, or maybe even dealing with difficult coworkers."
good,I was able to interact with customers and co workers like I would family. I was always received feedback when asked for it.
good,"Every day, I would come to work and be excited to see what regulars would show up that day. I loved getting to know new people and finding out their interests. My favorite part of my job, was that I knew I was great at it, and that the people I made drinks for truly enjoyed what I made for them. The hardest part of the job was working alone when it was busy, I was able to handle it but we were quite understaffed, so I often ended up doing more work than required."
good,a typical work day was fun and productive. I loved the other partners and learned how to be a great barista and connect with customers.
good,"The pay is not the greatest, but they offer amazing benefits.  The atmosphere is one of a kind. The customers are a daily delight as well."
good,When I came there I knew nothing of coffee or the food industry. So believe me when I say that Starbucks and its team members had a limitless end of patience considering how labor intensive it was. There was some management problems with that particular store. There was many scheduling conflicts. I like the people I worked with the most. I learned a lot there but it was very labor demanding.
good,Love the environment and the people I work with. Management needs more training. Lack of communication between upper management affects everyone.It can be stressful at times but overall great place.
good,Fun environment for the most part. management was understanding and easy to talk too. play book on the other hand kinda sucks
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is always busy, there is always something to do. One thing I've learned here at Starbucks is leadership I never thought that so many people turn to me for their answers. The management here is okay I feel like there are some things that they can do to change but nobody is willing to do anything about it. I love my co-workers everyone is hardworking and easygoing makes work pleasurable. I believe the hardest part of my job is dealing with the extremely diffult guests with a calm cool attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job is my regulars when they allow me to make them whatever, thats the best. I also enjoy when they tell me that I make their drink the best, warms my heart."
good,Good part-time work if you are a student or have another job. The management and training were unorganized but the job itself was fun. The best part was the repeat and regular customers us staff got to know well.
good,"I gained many skills during my time at Starbucks. My role required me to communicate effectively and efficiently with customers throughout each shift. I was required to use selling techniques to upsell particular products. During one shift I was able to achieve the highest number of sales of a product which enabled the store to exceed the target set by Head Office."
good,"the atmosphere is comfortable, the temperature inside the store is mild. there are a few rush hours but other than that is really quiet and time goes by really slow."
good,"They were once a great cutting edge company, leading the coffee business. But over the course of working there, it became more and more about how much money starbucks could squeeze out of their customers pockets. Selling frozen sandwhichs and advertising them as freshly made deli products seemed like a sham. The coffee drinks were slowly shifting towards high calorie ice-cream like frappicinos. While the coffee was progressively getting worse. "
good,going into this job know what you want to do and if you want to move up otherwise you will get stuck. If you want a career be willing to learn
good,"As an employee of one of the more popular companies internationally, you are held to a high standard. However, your experience as a partner can be entirely dependent on your personality and your store's location. As a partner in a mall of high volume, one can have mixed feelings about their job. There are days where your mood is totally uplifted by great customers who are new to the neighborhood and are just looking for a good cup of joe. Then, there are days where you'd encounter the bad apple of the bunch. It is indeed a team effort, and having a good team is definitely one of the pros of being a partner. It is enjoyable to put your own twist on drinks and put a smile on someone's face."
good,"Very good place to work for, fast paced upbeat enviroment, management cares about employees. A lot of training which is great"
good,"Working at Starbucks was a very good experience for myself. I learned that I can actually multitask which to me was a huge accomplishment. I had a decent time with he employees, I feel most were not as friendly as I was. The hardest part of this job was making sure to always make perfect drinks, most employees waited months to start barista and only did cashier but me? I took the challenge and did both! I love making people happy and communicating with customers and employees. I had a great experience overall."
good,"An interesting and educational experience if you love coffee 100%, the way in which starbucks view the customer experience is the customer is king and have 100s of ways to customize your coffee   "
good,"It was great job experience. I was hired at 16 and continued to work there til I was 20. It was an amazing company to work for and taught me customer service, how to work with a sense of urgency, and give our customers the up-most experience at our stores."
good,It was a great place to work while in school. They worked with my schooling very well. I liked the job while i was there. Only bad thing is they do a slow processes of promoting up employees
good,"Demonstrated excellence in service and hospitality utilizing invaluable interpersonal communication skills"
good,Starbucks/Target is a really great place to work. The environment is fast fun and friendly. The pay is great but benefits are lacking.
good,"A typical day at work  was fun, helping out the kids and make sure they stay safe. I learned that there is no fun like being a kid fun and kids need good people to look up to so they will stay out of trouble."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks usually generally consists of taking orders, making beverages & food, making sure food contact surfaces are clean, and keeping the back of the store and the lobby clean (dishes, tables, floors, condiment bar, etc.). I learned a lot about customer service and how to best serve each customer based on their individual needs. I also learned a lot about how important ultimate sanitation and cleanliness is when running a successful and in-demand business. I grew very close with my coworkers and managers; they were always there to help me and support me if I ever needed something. I am thankful that I had the opportunity to work with people as understanding as they are. The hardest part of my job would most likely be how fast paced and overwhelming it can be at times. Although I love thinking on my feet and getting things done quickly, it becomes a bit tiring doing so over and over again. I love making my customers and my coworkers happy. It brings me great joy when I see that I have succeeded in bringing someone a small amount of happiness to their day, even if it is just a small conversation or a beverage I took the time and extra care to make."
good,Very good place to work in entry level position.They have great training and a very good atmosphere to work in. And that's why its a good job for students.
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for here in Seattle. I worked at the corporate office for many years and for the most part I loved it.
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work and is ideal if you are still in school. However, the pay isn't all that good for the amount of stress level and work you do. Especially if you are a shift supervisor."
good,"Great place to work. Highly collaborative. For someone to enjoy working at SSC, he/ she must be a cultural fit. The how matters a lot more than the What. The company is about how the deliverables and goals were achieved over the what."
good,"Overall, working in Starbucks is fun. However, they have sooo many different audits happening all the time that completely exhaust you as a shift supervisor. The most annoying is QASA which is sometimes ridiculous."
good,I was able to interact with customers on a one-on-one basis. I was able to experiment with drinks. I had a flexible work schedule. The management was very down to earth.
good,"Working at Starbucks is often hectic. From the start of my shift at 5:00 am until I finish, I am constantly running around staying busy making drinks or prep work for the rest of the day."
good,Awesome place to meet new and friendly people! As my first job ever this company has taught me the basic fundamentals I need to further myself inside and outside of workplace!
good,"Though my time at Starbucks was a brief eight-months, I did enjoy it at times. I enjoy cooking, so making elaborate hot and cold drinks was similar. Co-workers were mostly younger than me and it made me feel uncomfortable."
good,"nice place for work, it helps to improve presentation skills, management is not good as per company reputation, and and it also differ from level to level and person to person. co works are good they works like a family but again it depend upon person to person. Hard part is about staffing and as per coffee shop their daily task is like a restaurant but staffing not much that, so it effect others work quality."
good,"I got to meet a lot of people and stayed pretty busy. I learned you have to take one thing at a time at this job. It could get pretty hectic. The people were great and we had a lot of fun. It didn't pay very well, but was perfect for school."
good,hi from beginning when I came to Dubai I am working with Alshaya starbucks coffee as a barista.i have learned lot from starbucks most important I have learned about the custormer service.starbucks is well known for its customer service.i have learned that customer comes first.give your best service and make customer feel to come back again in our store.
good,"I love working for Starbucks. It is a fun, fast-paced environment to which I succeed. I have been able to work with great teams and have had a few great managers. The benefits are pretty good and I enjoy being able to get free coffee when I work. The hardest part of the job for me is more knowing that I have this job, although maintaining Masters Degree education, in order to pay off student debt. Overall, Starbucks has been a great company to work for and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a fun, fast job that has great benefits along the way."
good,"Don't remember much of it. Even if I did, the job and culture/management could of changed a lot since i worked there. Sorry."
good,"Starbucks as a company is an amazing place to work. Customers are usually nice and each day is never the same as the last. Its challenging and there is always something going on, so the job never gets boring."
good,"I have been a partner for 7 years. I love the company but the management does not work with you so you can advance. I worked at several different locations at it was always the same. They promised they would help you advance and they never did. They hire in managers and I have personally trained one myself because they know nothing about the company instead of promoting within. "
good,"Im happy to say that while working with starbucks, ive never felt more like i was in a family. my coworkers were there for me whenever i needed. we could speak about anything with one another without the thought of judgement upon one another. i personally felt incredibly comfortable."
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits, flexible working hours for baristas. Preaches work life balance but that mostly applies to baristas."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. It was high paced and exciting. I worked at two different stores during my time at Starbucks. The manager from the first one was phenomenal, whereas the second one had some struggles."
good,"Starbucks is a company designed for the ideal customer service agent. In order to succeed and enjoy the job, you must be willing to compose yourself throughout the busy hours."
good,"Great job for college students. Not a lot of room for advancement and pay raises. However, great environment to work in."
good,"A typical day at work for myself is showing up anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour early and giving an extra hand without being asked or told to. I end up being given the task that needs most assistance. I have been a shift supervisor prior and stepped down to work on my outside of work life so I have the experience to help all members of the team. Having been at 2 different stores; a small lobby store and the busiest store in Colorado and having the same manager at each store the style changed based on the store. The first store I felt was the true embodiment of Starbucks. I met incredible people, learned about their lives, created moments and made friends, all while making sure their drinks were perfect and they left happy. The food and coffee sold itself. The second store was a colossus of corporate and sales. The environment is crazy and stressful and leaves no time for connection to customers or proper training of employees. This has lead to many drink returns, unhappy customers, and an uninspiring work environment which leads to a high turn over rate. My co workers are 50/50 balance of strict rule followers which has sacrificed the quality of customer satisfaction and crew broken by poor training of new employees but can't give up proper work ethic and proper customer service so they bend the rules to make everything fall together properly. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the continuous failing of making a customer happy because a lack of understanding of their request and being told to push a product that should be a higher quality and should sell itself. The"
good,I loved the environment and customer base that Starbucks always provided. This company really knows how to treat its employees.
good,Starbucks used to be a great place to work but they significantly changed from excellent to just good.  Labor cuts and increased responsibilities made being successful there difficult and very little movement from the store manager level up due to increased outside hiring and reduced internal promotions.
good,Starbucks isn't a bad company to work for. They've build a positive culture and work enviornment. I spent 11 years at the company and enjoyed my time there.
good,"Great company, great people, excellent compensation considering that your job is to make coffee.  If you want to make a career out of it, however, good luck.  The highest I've ever known anyone to climb is shift management."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast paced place to work. Great job to have if you are looking for a job to get of the house. Only drawback was that there is not a set schedule. I'm used to set hours from the military"
good,"Great first job! Teamwork is key and a person who is outgoing will thrive in this environment. A typical starts slow, speeds up, and then stays nice and busy! Sometimes the masses aren't the nicest, but there are individuals who come in and are always kind and make it worth it. Managers are usually flexible and they appreciate open and honest communication."
good,"Great fun serving different customers. Great training if you ask for it and love coffee."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks however my manager rarely managed me. I basically learned everything I knew from watching my younger coworkers do the job. I was a Sufficient worker once I got everything down pact, but my manager insisted on keeping me on the register. He then left a supervisor in charge of me who clearly did not read the rules and regulations of our positions and had me doing some of her job when he wasn't present which was often. I mostly worked evenings and had great regular costumers whom I still have healthy Friendly relationships with now. I really enjoyed my job and night shifts gave me great time to practice, but the managing staff needed to get it together. I was suppose to be relocated to a new building because our building was being demolished. The Hard Rock Hotel bought out the block so the manager was suppose to make sure everyone was relocated before demolition. My manager never relocated me or helped me at the least find a place that had a possible opening to relocate to. I am currently still a Starbucks employing in limbo. I am laid off I just assume although it has never been specified whether or not that I am. I couldn't get any of my calls returned by the manager, District manager or anyone from Starbucks with any real power. So over all my experience was in between not great but not completely horrible. I have a lot of knowledge about coffee and espresso that i would've never had without the experience of being an employee and I really enjoyed the position of a Batista, some of my coworkers were great and some not so great, most customers"
good,"Operated and maintained highly complex refrigerating machines to improve store efficiency. Maintained stability and order in the workplace by communicating with staff, and clientele. Compiled customer preference data to eliminate waste and loss of profit"
good,"I really love  my current job, but advancement is hard and reliant on who you know to get anywhere."
good,"It was an extremly busy environment. We always had something to do which made the day go fast. Everyone was really friendly and upbeat. We all loved to laugh and always had the customers joining in. I found the hardest part of the job was coping with the volume of customers when the machines were broken. It made things quite stressful, however, it was a very good team and we all helped each other out when faults had occurred. Management were great, always getting stuck in and making sure we were all ok. I definitely felt supported. The most enjoyable thing was meeting so many different people, talking to the customers who were from all over the place and had some great stories, it was very interesting."
good,"Back when I was there things were good. Management was willing to accommodate out work/life balance. We didn't have On-Calls, you were either scheduled to come in or not. I was paid nicely for a 32 hour week and the addition of tips. "
good,"Opening is fast and easy with two people with a short break before the rush comes in. The opener would order the daily truck. The rush last about four and a half hours, from 6:30 - 11 am, and sometimes longer. After school lets out, the rush starts in again from 3-5:30 pm. Breaks were issued before and after the rushes. The mid would come in at 9 and prepare the deposit and change order. Before the mid-day rush the closer would start pull to thaw and daily inventory. Three closers would start cleaning after mid-day rush and continue until close."
good,Starbucks is a great company but it was located inside a target which I did not prefer. Management was not up to professional standards at the location i was working at.
good,"It can be a great place to work. I am a separated employee but am trying to give an objective review of Starbucks. It can be a stressful thankless job and  it can be a positive place to work despite the high expectations of the job coupled with the tight labor lines used to conduct business. This depends heavily on the staffing of the store itself and all forms of management. It should be noted that Managers are expected to spend a roughly 75% - 80% of their time working on the floor greeting, ringing, cleaning, and creating handcrafted beverages with the remainder of the time allocated towards executing all other business functions. The amount of dedicated time allowed towards administrative, inventory, and development takes is my largest dissatisfaction.  Great benefits, good growth potential."
good,"Typical day consists of cleaning, prepping food and drink, stocking shelves, making coffee and tea, cash handling, and serving customers. I learned quite a bit about coffee and how to use 2 different computer systems. Coworkers are friendly and work well together. Fast paced environment."
good,"Overall a challenging, educational experience. Sink or swim environment on the team. Everyone is learning as they go, direction frequently changing and evolving thus requiring strong adaptation to new direction and process. "
good,The only reason I have been with Starbucks for more then 3 years is only cause of the people i work with and my passion for coffee and making great hand crafted drinks. Management has no idea what the partners do for the company
good,"Starbucks clientele can be very random at times, considering the location but most of all there are a lot of regulars. The very important thing the partners must do is always smile engage make it personal and most importantly up sale. Management is always changing to accommodate the season or the special occasion which is awesome. The staff can be great at time but sometimes you have to re coach on things they should already know. The most difficult thing about working at Starbucks is the constant change in management and the best thing is always meeting new and humble faces."
good,"un buen lugar para trabajar prestaciones y sueldo comodo. "
good,"Intégrer le premier Starbucks Coffee de France a été une expérience inoubliable..."
good,"Great job for a student, flexible hours and free drinks and 30% off"
good,"un día normal comienza desde temprano, en la madrugada a montar la barra de servicio, el contacto con las personas, y la elaboración de las bebidas con tanta destreza y preparación, el servicio al cliente practicándolo todos los días fue perfeccionando esta habilidad. dentro del café me lleve de maravilla con mis compañeros, tal vez la parte mas difícil era lidiar con el rush que se generaba por la alta demanda de clientes que algunas veces era excesiva. Lo que mas me gusto de este trabajo fue el contacto con las personas y el apoyo que encontré de mis gerentes"
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company that offers its employees great benefits. On the whole, I would say my experience there was really good. But the customers are horrible, disgusting, self-entitled jerks, and dealing with them after having to be to work by 4am gets annoying. Pay is pretty good and the first raise is automatic. Hours can be iffy. If you put down that you want 40hrs a week, you might not get it.  It can be really stressful when you are only getting 25hrs a week and you really need the 40hrs. They can accept your availability when you're hired but then still schedule you against it and expect you to find coverage. I came in as a supervisor but its generally easy to go from barista to supervisor. Supervisor to assistant store manager is more difficult. Benefits are really good including stock options, 401k plans, and a 30% employee discount. You get free drinks during your shift (and before or right after). They also have partner shopping days during the holidays where the discount becomes 40% instead of 30%. And you can get into your corporate discounts for discounts on anything from movie tickets to your phone bill. Overall, a good company if you can stand the downsides."
good,The job is best suited for students without kids or other obligations.  The medical benefits are fantastic.
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of interaction with customers. Customers are highly valued at Starbucks and creating more regulars is our goal. I learned how to make many signature beverages and I learned how to pay attention to detail. I learned how to manage a team, place orders, and organize inventory."
good,Starbucks is fast paced and allows for plenty of growth if you can gain the support of your upper management team. Hardest part of the job is dealing with poor communication skills which can hinder the daily operations. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with so many different personalities as well as dealing with customers from all walks of life.
good,"Working at Starbucks has changed my work ethic. It was a very high paced environment. I was surprised at the skills I developed from being working at Starbucks. Though I was only a barista, I developed many leadership skills. To work this job productively meant being able to multi-task, think ahead, and be capable of making quick decisions. Time management was an important skill I picked up working at Starbucks. I developed some great relationships with the Starbucks partners. Having fun employees made the job much more enjoyable."
good,"Loved how busy it always was, especially on campus and meeting new people (students, teachers, parents). Definitely a perfect place for personal growth and responsibilties to take initiative. Monthly meetings helped new and old coworkers improve work ethic. The hardest part of the job was trying to make days different with variety of work duties. Everyday was the same and quickly grew bored with it. Management played favorites so it was often difficult for promotions."
good,Good benefits. Average wages. Easy advancement for motivated employees.
good,Working at Starbucks built up my customer service by having to connect with customers and communicate with them. As well as building a relationship with them because you would want them to come back and become regular customers which increases sales.
good,"Most of the coworkers here are quite nice and take direction well. Most of them easily get to the point where they know what needs to be done at certain parts of the day and try to assist any way that they can."
good,Enjoyed working there for the most part. Pay was good. The upper management didn't always seem to see what exactly was going on within each store and seemed to make big decisions based on 30 minute walk thrus.
good,"I have worked at SBUX for 17 years; great organization. Sales and operations have been focal point throughout my career. National accounts business development is where is my last 7 years have been spent. Within that capacity, I have worked within Foodservice, QSR and C-Stores supporting and developing franchise expansion."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting to work for 5 am, refilling the pastry case, turning on the coffee machines, brewing coffee, making handcrafted beverages, taking customers orders, heating sandwiches in the oven, recommending new products, and asking for names for drink cups. I learned how to make some pretty delicious beverages, I learned the proper way of tasting coffee which made me enjoy it even more then I had before, I also learned how to work as a team to get things done fast. The management was good, always fixing any issues the partners may have had. I worked with a lot of great co-workers (Partners) we worked as a team to get things done efficiently. The hardest part of the job was constantly being on your feet. The most enjoyable part of the job was making people happy, and getting to know so many of our regulars,"
good,Management was often unprofessional and not in the best interest of partners.
good,"Can't go wrong with Starbucks. Typical day is fast paced, but by the time the chaos is done it's time to clock out."
good,"The day-to-day tasks came easily to me and in the end, it became more about making every customer smile on their way out the door. A highly satisfied customer was my goal every day."
good,"Great company, fast paced and fun. Led a well motivated team and achieved all sales targets, finishing first in our district for two years. Learned how important it was to work together in order to achieved success.  Enjoyed coaching and teaching all my co-workers to be the best at their jobs.  The hardest part of the job are the quick turnarounds, like closing the store at 11PM then opening at 430AM. Greatest part of my job without a doubt is watching my customers leave with a gleaming smile."
good,"A typical day at work would be to make coffee and all the drinks that come to order. Also maintain the lobby and make sure the place looks spotless. I learned how to make a lattes, Frappuccino, and smoothies. The management there was good, but I was a very hard worker and they wouldn't even promote me. The co-workers were all nice and fun to work with. The hardest part about my job was when the line is out the door and your by yourself on bar making all the drinks that come your way. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the drinks just not when it was super bust because it would be very overwhelming."
good,"work day starts at 430 am,learn point of sales. most enjoyable part is making drinks"
good,"the benefits from working for Starbucks are amazing! Free coffee, tuition reimbursement, health insurance. And meeting new people every day, build connection and networking. Good for college student that need extra money."
good,"Co-workers and management worked great together, very team oriented. Loved everything about working there."
good,Great management! Diverse group of co-workers and wonderful customer service experience.
good,"I loved working at starbucks, I was able to learn how to do inventory, answering calls, and learning how to make coffee to satisfy customers needs"
good,Starbucks prides itself on promoting from within and nurturing teir employees to become great leaders.
good,"Fast paced."
good,Learned how to make a plethora of mixed coffee based beverages.
good,"The company is awesome in many ways to work for, as long as you are good with a stagnant salary after coming in the door. Annual raises are quoted as being Performance Driven, although a typical raise amount is 2% a year."
good,"The toughest part of the job is meeting all the expectations while trying to have a work life balance.  This is truer to the area of my employment than all districts.  Days involve inspiring others, driving sales, controlling costs and waste, training, promotions."
good,"A typical day at work consists of handing off drinks in a fast paced environment. A great experience to meet great people."
good,"Working in Starbucks at a basic level allowed me to find creative and unique ways to expand my skill base outside of the required workload. I was lucky enough to become a CSR representative for my shop and the region, working closely with and building relationships with local and national charities to promote both themselves and Starbucks."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks and worked with some of best coworkers around. We built long lasting relationships with each other and our regular customers. We challenged each other professionally and always kept the work environment light and friendly. I was able to advance quickly with hard work and dedication to learning multiple duties. I was given the title of Shift Supervisor within 8 months of being hired as a Barista. The only downside to my experience was the store manager and assistant. I felt like as soon as Partners and myself got used to a new management style there would be another person coming in with different preferences and ideas. With this said, I would work for Starbucks again because of the great experience they try to give to each Partner, but I would be more selective with my manager and get a feel if there was stability within the particular store."
good,"I had fun while working at Starbucks. Compensation was nothing spectacular, but it was a good job to help me get through college."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for but the people that you work with will make it or break it completely.
good,"While working at Starbucks I learned how to effectively manage stress and time. I also learnt how to problem solve efficently as well think quickly in the moment on my feet. I enjoyed working with my co-workers I feel the mix of personalities helped to better improve my working and learning experience.The hardest part of the job would be constanlty being understaffed at the most busiest times of the day, as well as constantly being sold out of popular items. The most enjoyable part of my job was a combination of interacting with new customers (asking a few questions to suggest a beverage or pastry they would enjoy) in a high traffic/volume location. I also enjoyed constantly re-merchandising our product walls and pastry case to entice customers to buy."
good,It is a very organized Company and a fun experience. Customers and staff are very nice and it is great to have the one on one connections.
good,"I'd clean the store then tend to customers. I learned how to work on my memory and speed up a little bit so I could accomplish more. Management was laid back and nice, but serious as well. They didn't make me feel uncomfortable, but they expected things to get done a certain way, by a certain time. The way they carried themselves motivated me to push myself further to meet their expectations. The co workers were really nice and when I needed help they'd walk me through what I was doing so I could understand better. The hardest part of the job was memorizing the drink menu and memorizing regular customers preferences and personal things about them. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the free drinks and pastries. That was the best."
good,"Great place to have a job while in college. Work with a group of people who are interested in furthering their education, make some great friends, and meet a lot of amazing customers. Great experience for a first job."
good,"Over the past 8 years i have met a lot of customers and co workers. Typical day at work, i work as a cashier, i make handcraft beverages, warm pastries, engage in conversations with customers, i delegate tasks, keep the store clean and stock. Efficient time management and Effective communication skills are a must. As we get to know each other as part of a team, we begin calling ourselves members of a family."
good,"Most days contained a full schedule though had some health issues that got in the way of staying longer than a year, the hardest part was to take care of myself since massage therapy can be a strain physically. My co workers and management were kind and helpful."
good,"I was working random shifts and it was very stressful on my home life. Even when I was promoted to a Shift Supervisor, I was still having to get to work at 5am, and was exhausted 24-7. I needed a more stable environment. Thus I found work elsewhere."
good,"A lot to do in a short amount of time, however, good coffee and memorable moments."
good,"My experience in the workplace had some rough roads of lack of communication and judgements.  The staff and customers made the atmosphere a great place to work for. Management wise it all depends on the your manager- is he or she is leader to communicate, instruct, to observe without judgement then give feedback and allowance for those in training to have a fair share to explain or be able to give back feedback."
good,"Great company to be employed by, with a friendly, comfortable environment"
good,"I was at a corporate store in a mall. Normally Corporate Starbucks are standalone, however this one wasn't. Since we didnt have a regular group of customers and just the in and out of the mall shoppers we couldn't connect personally to customers because they never came in enough for us to learn their drinks. Management got upset too since a new person came in and scooped up the District Manager position he was applying for an ever since then that location has declined in moral. Its a great company but people are people and drama did happen making it become more stressful than needed."
good,"On a typical day at Starbucks, we like to have yet work. We learn new things everyday as well as teach customers new things as well, like coffee. While at Starbucks, I learned how to make special and delicious drinks as well as new things with coffee and how each is different. My partners were amazing! We all worked there because we loved the job and our customers, the only thing we didn't enjoy was being taken advantage of and not getting help from a supervisor when proper times arose. "
good,Great company to work for. Can have cliques in stores. Regular customers can be great. Learning the drinks can be tough.
good,"I shifted from a retail environment to one of fast food service. I've learned better time management as the days are very fast-paced and busy. Any short downtime had to be used to clean, organize and restock for the next rush. My days were early, usually 5 am, and lasted until noon or 1. While it was exhausting and never easy to wake up that early getting off early gave me more daylight to get other tings done."
good,"Good environment and Great team. Great benefits including healthcare, stock options, and 401k."
good,There are always stressful and busy days which make me happy. For I thrive under pressure and motivate my team to give the best of themselves which they do.
good,getting customers correct orders out to them in a timely manner
good,"90% of my 7 years of time with the company has been fantastic. The company sets up many standards that are generally the same anywhere you go. However, that isn't always the case. Like any job, there's always the chance of having really poor management. It's a crapshoot really. But the best part is it's an easy job that you can have lots of fun doing. "
good,Starbucks is a very fast paced environment. You are always busy and on your toes. I learn something new every day and never run out of things to do. I love my co-workers and am in a position of management. My co-managers and store manager are great people and are a joy to work with. The hardest part of my job is the lack of down time to accomplish tasks. We are always very steady and it makes for a difficult time in managing tasks. The most enjoyable part would be the customer connections that I have made in the past two years. I love all of my regulars and being able to put a smile on their face daily.
good,"Fast paced, with lots to learn when you fist start out. Management is typically well organized, and adaptable to almost any kind of schedule."
good,"Busy and flexible"
good,"a typically day at work, start making the coffee, cold tea, filling the trays with pastrys.. waiting on customers, keeping the store clean. I learned how to make mocha""s cappuccinos, teas, lattees, espresso. my co-workers were helpful  and friendly. the hardest part was learning the job but once got use to it it was easy. the customers and co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is calling out peoples orders and helping customers.learning a lot about the company and how to mix drinks.
good,Great place for outgoing individuals looking for their first job
good,"There was always a nice environment in the store. I felt like I was around a bunch of friends I grew up with in high school. My manager was very nice and well hearted, as well as the staff."
good,"If anyone were to ask me if they should work here, I would say go for it. The daily tasks aren't to difficult but patience is a must. Being able to not only deal with customers but making them feel like they are completely satisfied is key. That is probably the hardest part about working at Starbucks, as well as the high volume of business. It is fast-paced and easy going when slow."
good,The culture at Starbucks is unique and embraced by most.  It is open and understanding yet the focus is on results.  They embrace the coffee culture and encourage all to learn about the origins of the beans.
good,It was very flexible with my school schedule. My co-workers were very helpful to my growth from barista to supervisor.
good,"The main reason why I love my job so much is because of my co-workers. They are the best people! Our management has recently switched over and our new store manager is very unprepared to be able to efficiently run the store, therefore it is hard for me to remain at this job. The hardest part of working for Starbucks would be that you are severely under appreciated for your work by higher management."
good,"The health benefits, savings benefits, coffee benefits are great but the general pay for all partners sucks. For the amount of work ( = hours and schedule) that managers must commit to successfully run a profitable store the pay just isn't worth it.Working a very non-traditional schedule including weekends, most holidays, and in many cases during inclement weather, for an EXCELLENT company mind you I would expect the pay to be much better from hourly baristas up through management but it isn't. This is what I've observed in my short time and what I've heard from partners everywhere and why Starbucks can't get a more faithful commitment from those truly extraordinary partners that make Starbucks a truly extraordinary place. Most partners work part time hours in order to maintain the benefits but will honestly tell you that while we love what we do the pay doesn't justify a greater commitment. However I must say that Starbucks is great company to work for and we have some of the best partners I've ever had the pleasure of working with and for."
good,"* Made fine coffee and tea beverages."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a good place to work. You have good benefits, good pay, tips, fun coworkers and good products to sell. However, just like every other job, it always comes down to profits, Time and time again, Barista's are encouraged to ""sell, sell, sell!"" which is our job, but to never see any of the reward, aside from a pat on the back, because very tiring and terrible for morale. It may just be this specific district, but pay is not competitive and it is extremely common for an excellent employee to be paid the same as a lazy employee. "
good,"Typically, my day would start with either taking over the shift from the supervisor in the morning and then I would need to sort out my planning for the shift. I had to deploy staff into the right positions and make sure that all procedures are followed correctly. The hardest part of the job was having to have difficult conversations with partners / managers."
good,"Starbucks is a very busy place to work at,  the first week I worked there, they are already short of staff, so, I need to learn and trying to picked up very quickly. But I think that was a good time for me to train my memory since they have so many different kind of drinks to mixed."
good,"un día  tipico es que te pase de todo. aprendí a manejar un grupo de trabajo, sabiendo poner a un lado la amistad, aprendí a liderar."
good,I enjoyed working there!!! It was fast pace but still fun! My co-workers and management were very cool and helpful. The hardest thing about the job for me was trying to control myself by not spending my check before I got it.
good,"a typical day at my Starbucks would be stepping on the floor, making sure things are prepared and ready for use and serving. hello's were exchanged between customers and co-workers, minor jokes made to boost morale. Also in my Starbucks career I learned how to be more relatable and likeable concerning customers and not to be so robotic. Smiling and eye contact and sincerity were all very important. My Co-workers were super friendly and all had different personalities and backgrounds which was great for diversity. The job is fairly simple, as long as tasks are completed and everyone follows the guidelines to keeping the customers happy. The best part about working at particularly my Starbucks store was the laughable jokes and bonds we've made while working, even customers enjoyed watching us interact."
good,I love the ideas behind all aspects of Starbucks. They are an amazing company and on a corporate level they treat their workers like gold.
good,Not my kind of job but I tried to make it work for me. I was young when I got that job. but a great learning experience.
good,"I love working for starbucks, you meet new people on a daily basis and different interest."
good,Come in and make drinks for snobby people who think you owe them the world. Meet some cool people and some not so cool people. Managers who are lenient are the best
good,My classes were an hour and a half each with about 10-15 students in each. I would have a lesson prepared based on their level and continue with the topic we were focusing on. We would also go over homework and any questions.
good,"Enjoyable to work at as a first job. Fast pace, multitasking, and benefits were great. I've learned to deal with customers more as a professional by learning from my co-workers. But the wage could be a little bit better with the economy currently. Starting was very low. Tips were given at the beginning of the next week. Even after saying all of that is still a enjoyable work experience."
good,"It's a reletively nice place to work. I'd definately reccomend it to anyone in school, or that needs a flexible schedule. "
good,"Had a great time during my 18 months at Starbucks. Transferred seamlessly once, enjoyed both of my managers."
good,"spent a year as an ASM-promoted to SM at a very busy cafe store."
good,I honestly loved working at Starbucks. I will admit it is mainly because of the people though
good,"It was and very interesting and fun job. Really liked getting to know new and regular customers. Learning to make lattes and teas was very fun and interesting at the same time. Most of my co-works were very nice and very out-going, and some were rude and not so friendly. Hardest part of the job was, opening up by myself and washing, cleaning up, and closing by myself. I rarely got to work with others unless I was scheduled to cashier. I wish my training would had been a little better, instead of me learning some of the procedures on my own. Overall, it was an enjoyable and new experience for me working there."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, both the employees and the customers.  The hardest part of the job is leaving a shift with work left incomplete.  I like to finish tasks.  My co-workers are perfectly lovely people who enjoy people and have fun and work.  We do look out for one another and keep the workplace friendly.  Our management is fully committed to having the culture be friendly and welcoming.  What I've learned is that I enjoy having more responsibility."
good,"Il y a possibilité d'évolution dans l'entreprise, c'était mon cas je suis passée du poste de barista au poste de shift. L'aspect le plus agréable de mon poste était de gérer l'équipe en service, d'être en contacte avec des clients agréables et d'avoir une équipe soudée. Je m'occupais de placer le personnel en service à leur poste, j'étais aussi en contact avec les clients et m'occuper de préparer les boissons et d'approvisionner la vitrine de pâtisserie. Je comptais le coffre, enregistrais les caisses, veillais au bon déroulement de l'entreprise. J'ai dû arrêté car les horaires d'ouvertures (6h) et de fermeture (20h) ne convenaient plus avec la garde de mes enfants."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work with the exception of job advancement. Great benefits
good,"Can be very busy, but you learn to maintain a good attitude and be efficient. You'll learn quite a bit about coffee in the process of working here. The health benefits are big plus when making minimum wage."
good,Starbucks is a very relaxing place to be when you want to get work done or just have coffee with a friend. The co-workers are very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was memorizing the drinks and how to make them. The most enjoyable was seeing the customers happy and knowing you did a great job.
good,Be able to face different challenges everyday and work with different personalities. Have the ability to influence many aspects of this world wide famous brand in NZ.
good,"Enjoyed working early hours, learned how to work in an organized team and acquired Food Handlers Certificate.  Hardest part was often standing for extended periods of time but it was a generally fun experience."
good,"I'd come in early, I would start making the coffees, and ice teas. Get out the pastries, label them and put them out on display in the display case. Grab my register from the service desk, count the drawer to make sure it was the correct amount. Organized, and made sure everything was filled and neatly placed, such as cups, straws, sugars and stirs. I'd fill the creamers and set the timers. And customers would begin coming in. Everyday on the weekdays and weekends first shift were always really busy. I loved working there. I knew how to make all the drinks, labeled the cups properly. I was able to move fast and get their orders done quickly and correctly. Near the end of the shift I would restock, and after every drink I would clean, so my work area was always cleaned. I also had to fill the sinks one with sanitizer and one with water and the middle sink to rinse. "
good,"Day to day activities get somewhat repetitive and thus easy to manage."
good,Adapting to new processes used to deliver world class customer service.
good,"Great place to work with great co-workers."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for over 6+ years and I have enjoyed working for the company since day one.  I have gained great leadership skills as well as continuous learning throughout my career as it would deal with daily operations and/or legendary customer service.  Employees at Starbucks are usually my motivation to continue to go to work as they make the environment fun and friendly; customers see such an environment and are usually prone to join in on the fun and cheerfulness they see and/or feel greatly satisfied with the services they receive.  As a member of management I enjoy my job even more since I am given a greater responsibility in terms of daily operations.  I enjoy teaching others and love to see the progress they make during their time under my supervision.  It's a fast paced job that keeps me busy, motivated, and eager for continuous learning."
good,"I enjoy working in a Starbucks store because I can view all parts for the store operations and work in every aspect of it. I love business and single store is like a small business but also part of a large business."
good,"Love the job , new company and bought out all the stores and cut the staffing in half .Very difficult to run without staff"
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced experience, for the customer and, especially, for the employees. A typical rush requires a high level of multitasking, teamwork, communication, diligence, and adrenaline! It can be very taxing, but being able to connect with people and make their stresses melt away with each sip is uplifting. "
good,"There is never a typical day with this company each day is different and keeps you on your toes. I learned the roots of coffee and how the espresso shot was the making of a drink. I learnt that your loyal customers were the ones who apprecited you the most."
good,"So as a company Starbucks is great. As a Store Manager, the company really needs to listen to their Managers and really listen. I was a Manager for 6 years and in those years the amount of work life balance was almost non existent. So for every company I have ever worked in management for, the manager works their 40 hrs at the least and is just obviously part of the store logistics. Right? Well, at Starbucks, the company expects the Managers to get all their Managerial Tasks done in the 8 hrs of allotted time and the rest of their 40 hour, which is 32 hrs, you spend on the floor as a barista. You are actual floor help. Now don't get me wrong, I would pick working on the floor to paperwork any day, but there needs to be a better balance to the amount of work upper management expects you to get done in only the 8 hours allotted.  Which means that if you only need two people in the mornings the manager counts as one of those people. So what happens in any other business is that the Manager is just kind of ""extra"" help because they are there when needed at the busiest times of the day but they also have the two people there that labor is saying the workflow calls for. So this allows for managerial tasks to get done, as well as helping the customers when the business calls for it. Well, this is not how it works as Starbucks. So most managers end up working at least 60 hrs a week because they only had 8 hours to make schedules, do inventory, review sales and business documents, create sales plans, write and administer employee reviews, etc. Now dont get me wrong, the company itself"
good,Good for a part time. I am sure there is advancement within the company but starting pay is kind of low.
good,"Clock in and get on the floor, make beverages and prepare food items, and consistent cleaning procedures."
good,"Spend majority of your time making beverages and cleaning.  I have learned to be more patient with co-workers. The management has changed 4 times in my short time.  My co-workers are amazing people with great personalities.  The hardest part of the job is the constant changing of managers.  One person will say one thing only to be contradicted by another.  And the customers can be difficult.  It reminds us all to be nicer to the people we are dealing with because they might be in your shoes one day.  "
good,"My experience was largely positive. As a store manager, under my first DM, I had an amazing experience. Unfortunately, as is often the case, he was promoted and replaced by an absolute control freak who made my life miserable for the remainder of my tenure. "
good,"I have worked for this company for over four years and through four stores.  While the in-store culture and management styles differ, at heart Starbucks is a company that wants to take of the people that work there.  There are various resources available for different scenarios for ever ""partner"" that is employed by Starbucks."
good,"Working here was interesting. You (well at this store) start out at $7.35 an hour, but you receive a raise every 6 months if you have a fairly good review, so for an hourly job with food, it ends up being pretty good pay. You also receive tips each week, which is an additional one or two dollars per hour you worked. The company has a very ethical, liberal view and is decent with taking care of employees- you get fairly good health insurance, and such. Co-workers tend to be tight knit, you get good hours, and there's a good work-life balance. It's an appealing job for a college student especially since they are flexible and can adjust your hours to your college class schedule. The customers are often a upbeat, very cultured and sophisticated group so there's never a dull moment and you tend to have a lot of habitual customers you establish a relationship with. The only downside is that there can be a lot of drama with the baristas or personal grudges, so if a barista doesn't like someone or has some grudge, it can really cause a huge rift and some tension, so if you become employed here, be very careful in that aspect. Also be careful at first and let the other baristas get to know you and don't get too bold since the employees tend be really clique-y and everyone has a ""place"" and there is bias. Another issue is with management...management tends to be run on favoritism and so are promotions, instead of who actually deserves it due to work merit, ethic, attendance, leadership skills, etc. and there's a huge problem with fraternization and co-workers including supervisors and"
good,"Starbucks is an enjoyable environment to work in with friendly co-workers who can share their passion for coffee with customers. The hardest part of the job would be having to interact with the occasional upset customer. Sometimes it's because they ordered the wrong drink and then get upset at the barista for making it still. The best part about the job would be the generally flexible work schedule and positive environment. There are all types of people who work at Starbucks, but one thing every one has in common is a love for coffee. "
good,"Overall, I really like the company. They have outstanding benefits, you get free coffee when you are working, plus you also get a free pound of coffee weekly as well as good tips. Management is really the only thing that is lackluster. "
good,"i loved working with starbucks it is hard work which i love, dealing with customers i love, the staff were great, treat staff members how you would like to be treated"
good,Its a great job always meeting new people always busy co-workers are easy to get along with.
good,the company provides a good working environment thus a quality values to every employees
good,"Barista-Not what I want to be doing with my life."
good,"A typical day would be serving new and regular customers their desired drink or food item, prepping food and beverage products and monitoring the cash register. The company itself as well as the managers were loyal to the company's values and it was organized. The hardest art part of the job was the rush hours, but that's when my multitasking skills would come into play and focus on what needs to be done first.The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Management, respect, esprit d'équipe, esprit d'entreprise, carrière. Entreprise avec de grosses qualités."
good,"If you're not looking to make a career of it, it's a great place to work.  Management is typical.  Its a fun 9-5."
good,"I started working for Starbucks in high school.  It is a job I would recommend for young people mainly, they offer benefits for part-time and you get reviews every six months which are accompanied by a raise.  A huge amount of the starbucks experience depends on the management team in place.  It is a lot of work and you sometimes have to deal with grouchy customers.  "
good,"I loved working at starbucks. It really is a great company to work for especially during school. However, that is widely dependent upon the store you work at. Good managers and bad managers in Bakersfield are hit or miss, so be careful. I would judge the store you want to apply too based on the friendliness of the employees, if they're generally happy and efficient it's probably because they have a good manager. The people you work with here are very important, the crazy comes out during hectic drive-thru rushes. Starbucks could give bigger raises, but you do get raises every 6months which is cool, and it is easy to move up if you want. Also free coffee while your working, and a free pound of ground coffee each week are some perks worth appreciating. "
good,Hardest part of the job is definitely customer service. Customers are unpredictable and they can be a delight or an absolute terror. Definitely helps if you can adapt to a fast-paced environment and can be friendly to all types of people. Best part of the job is probably the people you work with. Most Starbucks employees are chill.
good,"This is a great job for someone just starting to work, or just going back to work after not working. The job can be hard, and fast paced, but it is also alot of fun. You get to know your regulars and you make friends fast!!! I learned alot about coffee there. AND they offer benefits for part time workers AND stock options!!!!"
good,I was a barista for 4 years and I learned a lot about myself and teamwork.
good,Starbucks has been a great company to develop my career. The advancements for growth internally are somewhat limited.
good,"Fast paced, structured environment. Learned to multi- task with specific goals in mind."
good,"Além de aprender sobre tudo em relação a café, obtive experiências importantíssimas para um convívio agradável e coerente entre colegas de trabalho e até mesmo para minha vida pessoal. Porém tive vários em previstos na manutenção dos banheiros, do tipo ""privada entupida"" mais que só me fizeram a ter mais vontade de batalhar pelos meus ideais. E o melhor de tudo isso, era o contato direto que eu tinha com nossos clientes."
good,"I stayed working here because the people were great. I loved the customers. However, they could not bring in a strong management team which reflected a lot of stress on employees. I was a very hard worker and never had complaints but was over looked for management due to favoritism of other employees."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company with great benefits. Expectations are set high for partners and I appreciate that. However, it is difficult to be promoted in the company and the raises are not that significant. It's a great place to go to if you're looking for a part-time job and if you don't mind a little hard work. You are expected to know the company and the products you are selling. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers and really connecting with them. You have the opportunity to meet some really great people and help make their day by giving them their much needed caffeine,"
good,"The atmosphere was a blast, but fast paced. Once you got to work, you were working constantly for the entire shift, regardless of when that shift was."
good,Advancement within the company is achievable in timely manner when you prove yourself to be qualified for the position.
good,"Come in from 430am. Open store and greet partners. Clock in and begin to merchandise the pastry case, check inventory levels, place order for next day, check sales, labor."
good,"Managing small and mighty team responsible for operational performance of Starbucks core, revenue-driving store equipment globally."
good,"Starbucks taught me how to multitask in fast paced settings, time management, and how to work as a team. I've built lasting friendships and worked with great people."
good,"Great place to work after 6 months you get benefits and a raise, after a year stock. It can be stressful at first figuring out the system then its easy. The job can be overwhelming but everyone there loves their job and we all mak eit better for each other."
good,"In a neighborhood store much like mine work days are repetitive and labor intensive. I began working as a shift supervisor and have continued to lead by example and delegate to the 2+ baristas on any given shift. I have learned to adjust my management depending on the personality of the employees I am working with. The most challenging part of the job is dealing with the customers who tend to treat my coworkers like they're much lower in society. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part is having short meaningful conversations with customers and putting a smile on their faces."
good,Great company to work for. Wonderful business. takes over your life.
good,"Starbucks Corporation has long been known as a great company to work for. With full medical, dental, and vision benefits offered for employees who worked only 240 hours in a quarter, it's a pretty good deal. However, for as much profit as their hourly employees bring in, they are underpaid for their hard work in such a fast paced, high stress environment."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, especially as a first job when working with management that stand strong to its core values. It is some of the best training I've received while working for a major company. The culture and integrity of Starbucks shows through the partners employed. I have had the opportunity of expanding my love of coffee through advanced training in their coffee master program. The life long learning while being employed their is truly exceptional. I also was fortunate to maintain employment throughout the company while moving multiple times across country with the transfer program."
good,"I was very happy in job description here. I enjoyed sharing my coffee and tea knowledge with customers, preparing delicious beverages (quite quickly, too) and being the go to girl for our promotional events. I especially liked training new employees after becoming a certified learning coach. I had wonderful customers that came in to see me regularly and loved having the chance to brighten up their day a bit. I had a singular but serious problem with this job - there was no effective response to my complaints about being bullied by another coworker. That aside, this was one of the most enjoyable working experiences I've had so far."
good,"A typical day consisted of cleaning the store, preparing drinks, finish daily goals, provide great customer service, and set up the next shift for success."
good,"You can have a very flexible schedule working here and you can get great benefits. It teaches you a lot about team work and efficiency, but sometimes the hyper-corporate nonsense can get annoying and overwhelming. This is definitely a good job for a year or two, but not a career move."
good,Good company to work for. You can definitely make more money at different places. But Starbucks does a lot for their employees; between benefits and tuition assistance.
good,•Applied customer service and knowledge of coffee from all over the world.
good,"Everything was perfect except for the pay rate. You have to work very hard, and I feel that the compensation was not nearly enough."
good,mot enjoyable job I have ever had. The management was encouraging and delightful. Gave awesome rewards! My store had won a contest and about 10 of us got a brand new itouch.
good,If you enjoy Coffee and customer service positions this is the place for you.
good,"There was long days but I loved every day working there. I met some really great people, customers as well. It was my first job and it was awesome working in a fun environment and having a good time while working."
good,"As an Assistant manager with Starbucks I am responsible for keeping the line of communication open between myself, the Store Manager, as well as, the District manager, via email, text, and/or conference call. I am also responsible for maintaining labor, preparing the schedule, as well as recruiting new hires to our company. I am proficient with the training of new hires as well as the continuing coaching of older employees. I can effortlessly delegate responsibility to my staff, and hold them accountable when task are not completed. I am proficient with the ordering of the store’s needs, and controlling our inventory."
good,"Great to work when going to school, very upbeat and fast paced, always cool individuals to work with, apart of the management team and they are professional and hard working. The most enjoyable part is my co workers and the hardest part is when we're short staff"
good,a typical day at work is 20-40 hrs weekly on your feet cleaning making drinks and having a goodtime. working at starbucks what i can take away is people skills. you learn how to work with all types of personalities and also how to service all types of personalities due to the diverse partners that work there and customers that walk through the door daily. Management for starbucks need some help. its a hit or miss. co-workers for the most part are good but here is also a hit or miss. hardest part of the job is as a lead they ask you to work 32hrs plus a week which is great!! the drawback tho is getting time off as a lead is tough. they cut cost at stores by cuttiing labor so they are not engough leads avalible if someone were to be sick for a few days they end up comming in because there is no coverage. the most enjoyable part of the job tho is the team. once you hav weeded out those that dont want to be there and the ones that are just not cut out to be there the team that is left will bend over backwards for you and you for them.
good,"It's hard to find a highly populated area without a Starbucks these days, which lends certain advantages. I never have to worry about finding a job if I move, so this is a great position for a college student who will likely be relocating in the next few years. They also offer very reasonable health insurance to part-time employees. The downside is the pay--not much more than you'd find at any fast food restaurant. Raises are performance based, and employees (or ""partners"") receive evaluations every six months."
good,A typical day would involve learning how to assemble drinks and customer interaction as well as drink demonstration. I've learned how to appreciate an array of coffees and teas well as assemble various drinks. Management was fair and constant in instruction and teaching. The hardest part was the confusion in making the drinks when you first begin but once you get the hang of it then it flows easily. I enjoyed the atmosphere the most because my co-workers were welcoming and that's something you notice at all the locations you visited which was comforting.
good,I was pushed to always do my best and management gave me great support
good,"Everyday at Starbucks is fun yet challenging because I need to face and deal with different customer and partners. I've learned many things in Starbucks especially how to deal with difficult customer, staff request and inquiries, sales target and forecasting. It is frustrating sometimes but is fun and I love to be multi-task everyday I work. To me, I learn from mistake, so no mistake and no challenge I will never learn a new thing."
good,"Responsibilities included working on the till at the counter; creating drinks, and maintaining an inviting atmosphere."
good,Making drinks
good,"I worked for Starbucks for a couple of years. I LOVED it. The day's went by quick, the people are friendly, and the most enjoyable part...The free drinks(as long as your on the clock) Opening shifts were tough to get used to. Depending on how ""relaxed"" your manger is, it is a great place to work. If they paid a little more, I wouldn't mind working there again."
good,"communicate with customers, identify and meet their needs."
good,Joined during Chrsitmas for a little extra money. Enjoyable experience and positive workforce. Learning and mastering the drinks with helpful staff is by far the hardest part yet the biggest reward. Very flexable hours and good wage (£6.24)
good,"It was a joy to work for Starbucks. Excellent co-workers made the day fly by. Enjoyed getting an early start to my day, and being able to put a smile on so many people's faces when they got their first sip of coffee."
good,"It is very repetitive. You come in to work and just make drink after drink, and then you have to clean."
good,- great fringe benefits
good,I served 200 customers every morning within a 2hour time frame. We where the second highest grossing store in the state of Florida. The management was one of the best I have evered worked with. I really didn't notice anything being hard because the atmosphere was always a positive one. The most enjoyble part of the job was having customers return because of our service and product.
good,"mall is constantly busy, made you clean 100% of the time you worked."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the culture of Starbucks. There was a real family element where everyone knew everyone, no matter which store you came from. The Management Schedule was a little skewed, in my opinion - not enough hours for administration - but a wonderful place to work nonetheless."
good,"Fast pace environment.Very funplace to work.Enjoyed greeting and meeting new people.We knew our regular customers by name and drink of choice.I enjoyed leaning about the differant coffees and tea blends.Also learning how to mix coffee and tea drinks.We sampled everything so we could decribed favors to consumers.We sold awsome coffee cakes and pastries.Management was great and, my coworkers all had one goal and worked on one accord although we all had different personalities we acheived excellance when it came to job performance."
good,"I worked with a great crew, and it was fun to work as a tight knit team in a busy environment. Some of my co-workers were current students who were always tired but often had interesting stories to tell. Some were just simply east side people living the simple life with little money and lots of friends."
good,"Great for college students and for those who are looking for a first job. The pay is minimum wage plus tips, but depending on the location, the tips can add up."
good,"This was a great job to be doing, particularly during post-secondary. They were usually extremely accommodating to each person's schedule. The people were the best part of the job. Being able to work with great people always made my work day that much better."
good,My experience working at starbucks was a pleasant one. I really enjoyed working with others. I was able to gain my experience with handling money and dealing with customers.
good,A very high stressed and busy environment ... can be fun depending on the people you work with
good,I worked on 3rd street Santa Monica. VARY BUSY!!! Worked later hours! It was my first job and I loved it! I loved how you have to always be busy and I always have something to do!!!
good,Starbucks generally provided me with a good place to work while I was in school.
good,"This company offers great benefits like insurance, 401k, stock,  drinks and a food item when you are working."
good,"Starbucks is a great place for the new hires to learn skill such as communication skill, listening skill and solve problem. Also, you will meet more friends at Starbucks because the work environment is very funny and relax. On the other hand, when you have complete skills and want to improve further  it cannot be satiated and can't move on."
good,"It's a minimum wage job, so it's not without its stresses; crazy customers, busy frappy hour, full coffees poured into the garbage; but the community of the team is the most important. Don't get me wrong, there are some workers that will make you dread coming in, but those few you work with consistently could begin to feel like your family."
good,It is important that I learn how to make most of the drinks within a few days so you can be independent as soon as possible to make it easier for the rest of the team.
good,"Working as a partner at Starbucks there is a strong sense of community and the stores often are like a family. However working as a shift supervisor, the general managers put a lot of responsibilities on us and often are not acknowledging our successes but focusing on our mistakes therefore leading to a feeling of being under appreciated."
good,"You must work hard while you are there, adhere to all regulations, however the environment is fun and friendly. Your customers become your family. Good benefits and"
good,Definitely enjoyed working there and I am beyond grateful for the opportunity given to work there. Benefits were amazing and the team there was incredibly supportive.
good,"Days at work are for the most part fun and enjoyable."
good,"being a barista is super fun, you still get all the benefits. Low stress, you make a lot of new friends. Once you get promoted to supervisor, there is a lot expected from you and it can get quite stressful"
good,"Starbucks was a very nice place to work. Even though it's a service industry job, it almost seems a little better and the benefits and overall job experience was really good."
good,"It's fine, it's an easy job, getting slammed by a lot of customers can be stressful, especially if when you're understaffed and the Playbook is strictly adhered to. If you're allowed to listen to better music, it makes the job a lot easier, the Starbucks playlist can get very repetitive and wear on you're soul. I tend to work as hard as I can all the time, so if I feel like someone is not pulling their weight or taking it easy, it makes me resent them a little bit, but that might be more of my issue than the company's. Overall, as long as you're not understaffed and the music is good, and you feel valued and not just like a replaceable cog, it's fun."
good,"A typical day at work has loads of customer service, as well as lots of cleaning/housekeeping and then lastly order fulfillment. Overall, would recommend working here."
good,"While it is difficult to fully master the art of making coffee, starbucks makes a point to teach that it is not only about the beverage but about making someones day right one cup at a time."
good,"Overall positive. Good benefits. Free coffee. Flexible schedule. Pay level is decent. Pretty good corporate culture and values, but business is business."
good,"Overall a nice place to work at. When i first started i was a little shy, but after working with the people i work with now and getting to do my job while making friends was a good work experience. I was always complemented at how fast and diligently i worked"
good,"Starbucks was a fast paced work environment that could often be demanding of your energy and patience, as many customer service jobs are. My fellow coworkers are what made this experience a good one, and encouraging honesty among your team works best."
good,"Starbucks is a great first job. "
good,"I learned on how to handle customers and meet their satisfaction."
good,"Decent job if you need someplace to work fast. I did have a couple of run-ins with the management which was frustrating at times, but overall I would suggest working here if you needed to get money for rent or something else fast."
good,"This job can be enjoyable with the right crew. There is also needing to be in good standing with your manager. It’s very fast paced, constant working, but fun."
good,"Morning shirts were very high stress and management handled the stress poorly. Evening shifts were very relaxed and management had no problem then. The best part of working at Starbucks was the other partners, they made ever shift enjoyable and fun and I made life long friends from my time at Starbucks."
good,"The pay is acceptable, the benefits were great, and your superiors genuinely want to see you succeed. The only downside is the brutal work hours. And if one of your employees calls out and you have no backup, guess who has to go in."
good,"I'm not super extroverted, so this job was draining for me. However it taught me to open up and meet new people. I'm much more confident and I feel like I can hold a professional conversation without nerves. Before leaving the company, I was promoted to a barista trainer. Training has dwindled down from 2 weeks to five days in the past ten years. You aren't expected to know everything by the first five days (Like drink recipes and espresso bar rules) But by a month or two in you might find yourself behind the bar on your own during peak business hours. "
good,""" most days tending to the products customers love most and learning the environment with thin the industry studies and  research marketing of the coffee industry. different. drinks served to each customers delight made timely and in order.  Its great if your a coffee drinker you can get all variety of iced cold or hot I remember it as a very respectable environment . a lotta love for Starbucks."
good,It is a fun job and I love being around the people and the drinks. All the costumers are nice and make me wanna come to work so do my coworkers. Making new drinks and giving them to costumers is my favorite part.
good,"Not a job for someone who isn't up and ready to move around quickly. With all of the standards Starbucks has set the expectation is high and the benefits are pretty great, especially for a part time job."
good,For the most part I love my job. I work early mornings so it's always well staffed and pretty busy. However for my afternoon crew I know they can be just as busy with less people. The benefits are awesome and free drinks all during your shift is awesome as well. I love my manager and my coworkers. It's a flexible job.
good,"Your work experience is entirely dependent on the competency and dedication of your management and the location of your store. It requires flexibility and commitment. As a partner, your presence is relied upon and genuinely appreciated."
good,"Buen lugar para ser tu primer trabajo."
good,"The highlights of working at Starbucks is that you meet a lot of different individuals which can be fun and enjoyable but rude and annoying at the same time, what makes it stand out is that these people come in everyday with the feeling of entitlement which we serve no question asked."
good,"A typical day of work involves putting on a bright smile to assist customers in finding the best drink and food pairing that would suit their tastebuds. In my 4 years of working under Starbucks as a part-time barista, I've learned to be patient, to think rationally and calmly. There have been countless instances where I encounter difficult customers that tests my patience, willing me to act out. If I'm being completely honest, the most difficult part of the job would be handling the customers. Their demands can be exhausting to deal with and with that, i've learned to handle those customers with a calmer mindset. "
good,"Working at Starbucks you'll find one of the most important aspects of working there are the connections you make with your customers. Greeting them on a daily basis and creating best moments. You're team will collaborate with you on the floor to get the work done and in this regard and my experience, its been great learning and interacting with the other partners."
good,Sometimes it'll get super busy to the point that you won't be able to step away from your position and then the entire team will be backed up. Weekends are sometimes the most horrendous days to work because it gets very busy unexpectedly.
good,They company values there employees.  It's alot of student's that dont mind work here because the are flexible. Starbucks is an great way to feel at home.
good,Overall very positive and fun environment. Daily customers are very sweet and fun to talk to. Partners were very excepting and made going to work much more enjoyable. Only downfall was the problems with management.
good,"Fun place to work at, but high intensity. Management varies by location, so it can be a bit of a gamble. I recommend asking non-managerial staff about their experiences before accepting any offer."
good,Can be very creative at work and enjoy working whilst getting everything done in in a fast pace environment to keep you busy. typical day would be making beverages and engaging with customers.
good,"Lots of cleaning and customer interaction, difficult customers occasionally but supportive team to help. Very routine each day not much change in daily responsibilities."
good,busy almost all of the time can be fun if you make it fun  there can be drama but it is best if you stay out of it. perks are you get free drinks when you work and free food
good,"Made coffee and specialty orders for customers, ensured cafe was presentable, learned time management skills necessary for most career options, job was fast paced and provided challenges along with cooperation in a group"
good,"Nice environment team work in. Very flexible with scheduling. Meet new people, great customers. Pay is decent. Benefits are great for school as well ."
good,"Great place to work for, good benefits, decent pay, good tips! Management was great & always made you feel as if you’re needed. Location was super busy as we were in a busy mall so lots of teenagers/young adults."
good,"Great people, vision and mission. Encourage partners to stretch themselves to achieve a high rate of performance and achievement. Continuous focus on cost management, processes improvement and partner development."
good,"I love the culture at Starbucks. More than anywhere I’ve ever worked. They helped put me through college. I’ve advanced in my career. I’ve been given support. "
good,"A typical day at work Well usually im greeted with a nice smile and my coworkers happily seeing me since each role I take to happen to be the ""underdog"" cleaning dishes making backups such as sauces, etc. But the best part is being the usuals and seeing how their day is going."
good,"I have met some of the greatest people to work with and under, truly a amazing time. Sadly, Starbucks lacks in tech advancement and improvement is slow."
good,"At times it can be quite face paced with targets to hit (especially if you are in a Drive Thru store). As with every job in retail, customers can be difficult."
good,"It's fun, productive and lots of learning in everyday experience of being a barista of Starbucks. This company motivates me to keep learning that will mold to bring out the best in me."
good,"I felt that I had already learned all the skills to perform excellent and efficiently at my job. Still, I continued to introduce communication tactics to my partners and develop skills I couldn't learn elsewhere: like how to take apart, clean and fix an espresso machine, nitrogen taps, freezers, refrigerators, air-vents, ice-machines, you name it. I no longer felt it was a worthwhile challenge. There was no long-term future at this job for me. "
good,"This job does not pay well, nor give many hours, 28 per week at best."
good,"Starbucks is a good job to start out at for anyone just looking to find employment. It is a friendly, good smelling, busy environment. There are definitely opportunities to advance if you are to stay at one."
good,"Very easy job, but slightly difficulty in management, easier then expected to to learn the menu and drinks, some good benefits, management not the best but still worth a try"
good,Overall Starbucks is a good company to work for and is everything I expected it to be. They provide good benefits and opportunities to own stock in the company.
good,Working at Starbucks presents many new challenges everyday. Some orders are complicated with many steps that need more time while other orders are standard recipes.
good,"This occupation was a great experience since it was my first official job. The work environment allowed me to challenge myself to new tasks, such as supervision of employees and guaranteeing the satisfaction of customers. This job gave me the opportunity to strengthen my leadership skills, starting from a barista and eventually being promoted to a shift supervisor in the span of less than two years. This job introduced me to learning how to work in a fast-paced and efficient manner. The most enjoyable part of this job was working closely with team employees and ensuring we worked together and fairly."
good,"In my three years there I was the only long term employee. The turnover is crazy high and schedules are usually unpredictable due to this. However, the customer connections I have made really helped me personally, and will always be the best part of the job!"
good,I loved my job and my coworkers but my store manager was ineffective and the entire store suffered for it. Multiple times higher ups were contacted with absolutely no change.
good,"I was very fortunate to work with a very supportive, diverse and open minded individuals. At work there was a sense of self worth and inclusivity. Upper management was rougher, but the store management and workers were a great bunch of people."
good,"The pay from Starbucks isn't the best but if you use the benefits that come with the job, it makes it worth it. It's not a physically demanding job per say, but the mental side can be taxing on people. The work environment on average is pretty dang good."
good,"easy smooth day, workplace is calm and steady. always something to do. Meeting new people everyday and getting to know them is a great part of the job."
good,It was very difficult working for Starbucks towards the end of mycareer there because I was working every day. +60 hours a week. I ended up drinking  lot because I had no time for myself to relax and unwind. I was picking up shifts for baristas and other shift supervisors. Even my manager. I was burnt out. I was unable to collect the overtime compensation because Starbucks does not pay for overtime.
good,"Starbucks is a great part time job for students and those in need of a flexible schedule. Managers are usually good about giving employees both the time off they need and the hours they want."
good,Super busy and needs from employees to be able to adapt quickly to any situation to ensure customer satisfaction.. If you want a rewarding career in customer service dealing with awesome clientele then this is the job for you
good,"Very busy work environment, being in Leavenworth. Starbucks was always packed during every festival, especially during the weekends. The workplace culture was hectic because of this, and a lack of good management made it a drama-infused and uncomfortable work place. "
good,I think that this site can help others like myself. Looking for a supportive group of people. It was a great place to work for the 8 years that I had at this job.
good,"It can be challenging at times, but all the stress stays at work so it is a nice part-time type of job, people were very friendly and the training was done in a way that it was easy for me to start being on my own within the week."
good,"The store I worked at was in the middle of a culture shift and had some staffing issues, so that made it not enjoyable. Other than that, it was a good place to work with fun coworkers."
good,"it's just a regular work but  required a fast work environment, stress work and meet at least 500 customers per day and you have to be good attitude al time"
good,"My experience overall was stressful, but many stores that I worked at were really great and welcoming to borrowed partners. It really depends on your manager and your team (and your location) as to how your experience will be."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to grow as a person and develop your skills. I would recommend Starbucks to those who are shy because that's exactly where I started and as time went on, my confidence level grew through customer experience."
good,Fun and fast paced job. Good way to socialize and make money. I would recommend this job to anyone who likes working with people. The environment is a bit cramped and the pay really is only helpful and an added source of income
good,Die Arbeitsatmosphäre war sehr angenehm. Es hat sehr spaß gemacht ei Teil des Teams zu sein.
good,I enjoyed working for this company for the most part. It was nice getting drinks at a discounted price as well as getting a free pound of coffee per week. I didn't always enjoy the type of people that would come into starbucks. Not everyone is super friendly before getting their morning coffee
good,"Starbucks makes you learn a lot due to its customer facing role.I have learnt a lot and was offered a management position. However, due to university; i had to leave. Moreover, the pay was very high for my age range. Would definitely recommend working here for students."
good,"The coworkers are great but the customers can be very demanding. It’s overall a good job, but you definitely have to be able to handle your stress level and maintain a “happy” face. There is a lot of walking around so if you find that your feet or back hurt easily after standing for long periods of time, then this job isn’t for you."
good,Starbucks is all about coffee and beverage also a kind of community development delivering the high standards of customers services preparing quaility baverage delivering high standard services and connecting with customers is main ethic of Starbucks
good,"It was fun, fast paced work, but sometimes the rude customers made the days drag on. It is easy to move up if you have good work ethic, but know that it comes with a lot of responsibility."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. I started out not knowing anything about coffee. I went through intensive hands-on training  and was able to work with other coworkers for 2 weeks before I started opening by myself.
good,"Starbucks definitely prioritizes customers over all. They want every employee to make connections with customers and provide customers with a sense of community but at times, the push for such connections overshadow employees authentic selves."
good,"Fast paced environment when busy, fun working crew, always opportunities for advancement. Provides work, life, balance for the most part. One downside - if you are sick or take a day off because something comes up short notice you have to find a replacement employee to cover your shift."
good,Starbucks Canada is a great place to work as it promotes an inclusive and free-thinking environment. They provide a strict dress and behavioural code but allows procedural adaptations based on the group working that day. The business side of the company takes the time to not only to check the consistency of the product's quality but also to talk to each of the employees. They take that time to ensure your mental health while also taking in your opinion on how to improve efficiency and ease of work as they are not working the floor like the baristas and shift managers.
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work at because of the fast-paced environment it throws you into. The benefits are a bonus especially since it is such a high school entry-level job. The most enjoyable part of this job would have been the people. without the support of your partners, working at Starbucks would have been stressful and just sad."
good,Starbucks has been an enjoyable work place. The busy mornings are always full of energy and make the time fly by. The customers are a joy to see and interact with and the fast paced customer service environment makes each shift feel like a satisfying accomplishment.
good,This job is a lot at first but as you get more training you start to understand that everything seems to link together. Looking at the baristas it seems to look like it is very difficult but it is not actually that hard.
good,"Great people, great perks. Made a lot of connections and was able to be a part of many community projects. Definitely a great place to work for anyone."
good,A very demanding job but I was always punctual and involved with my coworkers and focused on customer satisfaction the most. I was a part time employee but I generally made sure during each shift I could offer my help and services beyond expected.
good,My time at Starbucks gave me a good experience and a better insight of the Food Industry. It taught me about customer service and how to work in a fast-paced environment.
good,I started here as a student and I found that the environment helped to build my communication skills. The staff were great and we always worked as a team to ensure the best service was given to our customers.
good,"Depending on location, my view of the job tends to be in the middle. I have learned many things from the company, they have helped me threw in tough times."
good,Very active workplace. Challenging and customer oriented. Very jolly personality is a super plus. Career advancement if you are willing and passionate. Salary leaves something to be desired.
good,A typical day at work is hectic. You have many customers coming in so you must work at a fast pace. You have good days and bad days. Such as tips that’s given.
good,"I worked in a few locations, and I know that tourist areas are not where I want to be! Right now I am working at the university and it is really great and relaxed. Making the drinks becomes easy and I really love working with a lot of cool people."
good,Je ne recommanderai pas cet job à une personne qui n'arrive pas à travailler sous pression. Ce travail demande de l'autonomie et de la vitesse. J'aime cette compagnie pour les nombreux avantages sociaux qu'elle fournit auprès des employés.
good,"Working for Starbucks requires high-energy and a sense of urgency. I appreciate their high food and beverage standards, commitment to help partners with education, and full benefits as a part-time employee. Although, working with the manager can be a challenge if he/she doesn't have a long history with the company."
good,This job provides many opportunities for skill development. The benefits are fantastic and the job is rewarding. A Store Manager position is a good job with a good salary.
good,"After I arrived store, I basically need to throw myself into work immediately  , and work Continuously until I finish this shift. Everyone is willing to help everyone, which is great and enjoyable."
good,Overall I worked there 11 yrs of which 8were consecutive I left for what I thought was a better job and I'm not getting enough hours I tried going back to Starbucks and they wont take me back I would have to apply again as if I didnt give them 8 yrs of my life.
good,"Pro- free coffee, fun coworkers, laid back work environment"
good,"There is a really steep learning curve working with Starbucks, so it can be very intimidating when you start. They have plenty of benefits to make it worth staying."
good,"Enjoyable work atmosphere, fun job to do, great benefits, and flexible scheduling. Little room for growth and below-average salary. I was fortunate to have a good team, but it can be hit or miss."
good,"I was working as a part time,and mainly in the front desk."
good,"incredibly fast paced work environment. in a typical day was clocking in and figuring out your station that day. Either taking orders, making drinks, serving them in the drive thru, or cleaning behind the scenes. it was all pretty easy."
good,At first the company is great to work for with superb benefits and opportunities for advancement. However the burnout is real and the job is emotionally exhausting dealing with 1000s of customers a day.
good,"Is a good place to work and start your life in London. The company take care of you and your needs. The salary is not too much high, even if you work extra hours."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work "
good,"I loved working at Starbucks.  I loved the energy there.  I enjoyed being part of the team.  Being busy is great, that is what I love.  I like to interact with customers."
good,"Great starting job, the hours/schedule can be a bit much. This depends on each store and the customer flow. The store that I worked at was centrally located and incredibly busy."
good,A typical day at work is filled with making coffee and customer interaction. I have learned about the coffee roasting process and the pairings of each kind of coffee. I have also learned the importance of inclusion and diversity in the workplace.
good,A typical day at work includes quick decision making and a need for adaptability. I quickly learned how essential a positive attitude and encouragement from fellow coworkers makes days pass a lot easier.
good,"Great company to work for but if you want to grow with them, it’s definitely difficult to do so when there’s favoritism involved and you overwhelmed yourself with working literally every day to show you are fit for the next step."
good,"Its om to work, but not good when you want to have a life and enjoy with your families because  in most cases you have to wake up as early as 3am and for sure you are standing 8hr shifts."
good,"Starbucks is very fast paced for the relaxed coffee culture they attempt to cultivate. The culture of each store varies (of course), but overall I had some of the best friends come from my time at Starbucks. I was given lots of opportunity to grow and excellent benefits (hello free Spotify!). "
good,"Whether you are looking to build a career or work part-time, Starbucks provides a busy work atmosphere that cultivates a culture of community. Specifically, Starbucks values their employees -- who they call Partners -- by offering them stock benefits, vacation and sick leave, balance work-life organization, 401(k) investment,  and a work environment that embraces character expression and diversity."
good,Starbucks is a difficult job for new beginners. It's a lot of multitasking and a lot of updating. Every 6 months or so the store changes for the new season or holiday and new items comes along with it
good,Dedicated to creating exceptional customer service experiences while promoting a positive internal workplace culture. One challenging obstacle is the gap of understanding from executive corporate levels to front line resulting in ambiguity and lack of customer attention. The most rewarding factor is the personal investment in customers' lives. Enjoyed serving in various roles over the years based upon personal life seasons. Flexibility of work schedule with family life has been a great benefit.
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work. They hire great people and have overall great customers. They do their best to try to make the environment as stress-free as possible through good scheduling and a good environment. It can be a hard job though. It's hard on your body and can get stressful no matter how good the schedule is. I highly recommend to people for part-time work, but working full-time can be too much for many people."
good,"I loved working for Starbuck until the manager stating showing her true colors. "
good,"Great place to work however it completely depends on the manager you work for, not every starbucks is created equal. The benefits are great, and the company is very understanding about any personal things going on in your life that effect your schedule."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks was fun, my favorite part of the day was after peak when the team would feel good about serving customers with precision and speed. I learned a lot about managing a team and how to best serve customers with ease."
good,"Each day fluctuates on how busy it is, some days there few customers, others would seem like it was never ending, but no matter what there was always something to do. Whether it be cleaning the kiosk, restocking product in the kiosk, serving our customers..."
good,"Job has variety. During a regular shift you get switched to different tasks every two hours or so, you wont be stuck doing the same thing for the whole shift. Breaks are very consistent and free drinks while working. Busy fast paced environment, need to work well as a team."
good,"Advancement within the company does not seem like it is as much of a priority as it used to be. Being in the right place at the right time seemed more important to be considered for promotion versus years of documentable hard work and months of overtime worked. Other than that, the job was fun and the benefits were great."
good,Eğer ki kahve konusunda kendinizi geliştirmek istiyorsanız belki her şeyi öğrenemezsiniz ama tutkunuz var ise Starbuck size bu fırsatı verecek bir şirket. Popüler kültüre malzeme olmuş olabilir fakat siz bir şeyler öğrenmek istiyorsanız mutlaka fazlasıyla öğrenebilecek materyale sahip olacaksınız
good,I felt very welcomed from the start. There's a real sense of community and diversity amongst the baristas and customers. It's amazing to see how Starbucks strives to explore benefit options for its employees.
good,"Encouraged to be your individualistic self, flexible to your needs."
good,"Hours changed drastically and made it rough to work only there. Pay was lower, but the tips almost made up for it as long as they were decent that week."
good,"Typical day at work varies depending customer flow and partners on floor. If you have patience, great work ethics and enjoy change, this job is for you."
good,"The enjoyment of working at Starbucks is highly dependant on your colleagues. I worked there for a year, left for a few months then rejoined for a few months however in the months that I was away there was management restructure which ruined the enjoyment of working for the company. For this reason there was a high staff turnover which further dampened the excitement of going to work. Overall, the relationships that are formed between you and customers makes the job rewarding and the on shift benefits are good (free barista prepared beverages and 50% off food)."
good,"it started off s a nice place to work out of high school; however, after two years and a promotion the work became less fun and more tedious. the environment is nice but is also determined by your manager."
good,"Starbucks is a great workplace for those wishing to improve on your people skills and the company provides decent benefits for it's employees. The people you meet, guests and employees alike, are generally friendly and depending on where you train, there isn't too much pressure to be perfect."
good,"benefits, flexible hours, good people but low wage for the work."
good,"An amazing environment to work in, quick movement, always on your feet moving. Nice and welcoming team, felt like a family. They train bed well, being able to teach you how the drinks are made right."
good,"When you work various gigs and just need constant money coming in, tis is a good day job. You get offered benefits, discounts, and a chance to be part of the company at large, but the pay is not fantastic. (It's above minimum wage but just barely, and is actually about minimum wage for Baltimore City.) The plus side to the not fantastic pay is that you can plan ahead and work your other jobs at the same time, equaling a decent paycheck to get by with."
good,"Always lots going on to keep my interest. It's fun to get to know regular customers and interact with new ones. Have had, and taken, the opportunity for advancement."
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, me ayudó mucho. Es un lugar que exige destreza para trabajar ahí."
good,"Good company, strong values and culture , progression available unable to facilitate trained managers which means moving to franchise or looking for another job."
good,A great company to work for . Great employees. Understandable management. Awesome benefits . Superb treats. Great atmosphere. My favorite place to work at (so far).
good,Organized atmosphere to work in. Management is always willing to help. Provided easy steps to help retain job requirements. Must be able to resolve problems with unhappy customers.
good,"The type of day you have on the floor is based on who is on shift that day. A great team can make your shift, while a bad one can break it. I had more good days than bad"
good,My job was super fun and easy managers play favorites but they might have just been my store. Great job for college kids. Check out the stores reviews before applying
good,"I learned excellent people skills and how to make an amazing coffee. The people were fun, but there were the odd short-tempered customers. The best part of the job was getting to make drinks, and they provided a very goof amount of breaks for employees."
good,"If the store has a good culture, it can be a great place to work. They like to recruit from within and benefits are pretty good.  It can get stressful and mentally/physically exhausting."
good,Starbucks offers good opportunities for people just starting out in the work force. I learned time management and leadership skills through the job. You meet a lot of cool people too.
good,"I was promoted to supervisor fairly quickly. I had a great environment and my team was phenomenal when it came to handling pressure and busy stretches, and that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The team I got to hang and interact with. The hardest part of the job was learning to balance my role as a supervisor, dealing with frustrating customers, and making sure everything ran smoothly for the end of the night closing."
good,Mayor facilidad en el desarrollo del personal y mejorar el salario.
good,"Starbucks was a nice place to work with many great benefits. The coworkers and environment was not always amazing because of unhappy customers, but it challenged everyone to be a more inviting and quicker moving worker."
good,"The hardest part of the job for me was the hours. I originally agreed to work part-time as I was a full-time student. However, at the time, they were understaffed and had me working 30 hours + which was a lot to balance with school. However, the staff was extremely friendly."
good,if you cant multitask and move quickly this isn't a job for you. but the environment is great. the partners are cool. it is like a big family if you find a good location.
good,This is a great job if you’re great with customer service and can multitask. It is a lot of information you receive in the beginning but this company has great training.
good,"My fellow baristas and favorite regular customers really make this job what it is. Once you learn to make the drinks, a lot of the job is about connecting with others, and I've really enjoyed that. I also like that I can take on new responsibilities and concretely help my team out."
good,Starbucks was a wonderful company to work for as a first time career option. There was always high energy and determination to provide good service to everyone. The company cares greatly about training systems for all employees.
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced environment, especially during sales and holidays. Coworkers are amazing and truly make the experience enjoyable. Great if you enjoy working in customer service."
good,"Enjoyed working at Starbucks Kiosk in Kroger Grocery Store. Served clients, created customized coffee and fruit smoothie beverages and more. made to order."
good,A typical day on the job is chit-chat and finding anything to complete for closing time. Management was poor so orders and scheduling was not up to par. The hardest part of the job was time management with all the tasks needing to be complete.
good,"This is a great and stable company that values its employees. The road is tough for advancement as many people work here for over a decade. Despite the lack of advancement, the company offers opportunities to try new roles within the company."
good,"It can be a lot, espeically when training starts on bar. Peaks can be stressful, as well as it can feel like you're trying to do a million things at once. But, co workers make it fun and everyone is nice. Tips every week are also an extra boost."
good,Its a fun job for the coffee lover teaches you about teamwork and volunteering and being together and how experiencing volunteering can teaching values about your job he's a very nice experience
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for in terms of money and opportunities but be prepared to work hard and be stressed. Definitely worth working for.
good,"Overall Starbucks can be a great workplace, especially for students! It's great for part-time or full-time work, and great for meeting new people. If you're an outgoing person, I highly recommend this for you! Be prepared for busy workdays, a good chunk of training time, and learning new things."
good,"I've worked at a lot of different stores, and all of them have their own problems. The coworkers are always great, the benefits are great, but each management team has it's own problems. At the first store, they were misogynistic. At the second, then had mental breakdowns very often. At this current one, they show favoritism more than anyone I've ever seen, do nothing, and expect everything from us."
good,The work culture is great. Co-workers can easily become your friends. It was very easy to have a great work/life balance. Great opportunity to grow within the company. I was able to grow as a leader in my role as a Shift Supervisor and it equipped me in my new role in another organization.
good,working at Starbucks is ok just the costumers treat many of the workers poorly and many are not paid enough to compensate for this. the job is very fast paced and sometimes many new hires are not trained properly.
good,working at Starbucks is a crash course in customer service and time management skills. The fast-paced environment will make you an excellent employee quick.
good,"I was able to go to school full time and work as a barista at Starbucks since the company is flexible and as long as you communicate with your manager, your needs as an employee will be met."
good,"This job taught me a lot about how to adapt to a variety of situations and the importance of paying close attention to details. A typical day at work included lots of customer interaction and customer service, as well as cleaning and tidying responsibilities and going above and beyond for the guests. This job culture was very inclusive and progressive which I really appreciated. All the employees understood the value and importance of being a team player and it led to a very functional and successful store."
good,Good place to work as long as you have a good team.  Training hours were not there so I wasn't never properly trained. Fast paced environment depending on location but a decent place to work.
good,"Manager made sure to suck all the fun out of work and made everyone anxious. Never held herself to the same standards as she did others, berated employees for the smallest things, and never praised the good things. Absolutely awful human being."
good,"The benefits make the stress of the day-to-day, underpaid job worth it. Not for everyone. If you easily stress out or can't take a room full of angry customers staring at you while you make their drink, don't apply"
good,"Starbucks surely exudes a coffee cult type of vibe. I was eager and ambitious to work in a face-paced environment again, however should have more closely observed the specific store I was brought on to. I got this position through a close friend who worked in management here and appreciated the offer. I always viewed Starbucks as a temporary income solution, as I am not fond of the taxing and wired clientele and associated staff. The company has somewhat broken policies on how they manage conflict and resolution and I ultimately became disappointed in how some dire situations were handled, not to mention the daunting and daily customer backlash."
good,I loved my time as a barista! Very fun not too difficult. However my manager was terrible and played favorites quite a bit. Ended up leaving due to our bad relationship.
good,customers are prissy and snobby as usual. There were many good days but when you work on campus with a bunch of over caffeinated kids it makes interactions so dreadful at times.
good,"I liked learning so much about coffee, tea, fair trade and the origins of their beans. Even the customer service and company training really helped me to become a better barista, supervisor, and multi-tasker. Great benefits, wish that i had taken more advantage of the retirement and stock options."
good,"very customer focused, but very target driven to achieve goals set by head office. not enough time or staff to do all that is required a a manger to complete"
good,This is a good place to work if you are young and need a part-time job. This job has taught me many skills that can be applicable to my future career.
good,"On a typical day you might be working two stations at once, so be ready to work anywhere  at anytime. I disliked the small working quarters, but enjoyed learning how to make their variety of drinks and food."
good,"Good benefits. Fast paced work atmosphere. I worked at several stores throughout the country, the level and or quality of store managers can greatly vary."
good,"A typical day at starbucks involves me coming in and making sure that the floor is stocked with items such as milk, cups, ice, teas, coffee, and many more. I also make sure that my fellow partners are well off and will jump in if nessisairy. You get a lunch break which is 30 minutes long. Free beverages are available to you before , during and right after your shifts so that your always caffeinated if needed. Having regulars come back to the store to see you and have those personal connections is what makes this job worth it."
good,I was able to snag an entry level accounting/data entry type job through a temp agency. My entire department at Starbucks was in the process of being dissolved (within the next few years) so it was a confusing time for everyone as responsibilities were shifted immensely. If there was an opportunity for me to be hired on full time I would have loved to stay.
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work and I enjoyed going to work everyday. "
good,It was great to work when i was in college but did not offer any further advancement or training after shift supervisor to help become a manager or beyond
good,"I very much enjoyed working for Starbucks, I still recommend people to work at Starbucks. I left because of the my store manager, who is now no longer with the company. Starbucks itself has a wonderful culture and is really a great place to work."
good,"It’s a very fun job to have if you like a fast paced environment and can multitask while experiencing rushes from the customers, or if your good at memorizing recipes"
good,"Everyone treats you well and happy environment. "
good,"Definitely more screaming than a usual food/service industry job. Usually good screaming though. The people you work with are crazy, but  good crazy. Definitely a good job for you if you’re a people person."
good,Starbucks is a great working company with a lack of movement. There are very few positions and working full time is almost non-existent. Hours are inconsistent but the people who work for Starbucks are some of the best out there. If you are looking for flexible 15-30ish hours a week then this is the job for you. Anyone who is looking for a full-time position will have a hard time finding one here.
good,I'd work there full time if i was paid a living wage. I started at 9.33 and now im at 9.94. Just not enough. Stressful and draining but the people you work with are fantastic humans.
good,"Learned new skills while perfecting existing ones. Aided and assisted all employees with numerous tasks, either no customers or jam packed full of willing patrons."
good,A good company to work for as a second job. Part time gets benefits and tips are divided up by how many hours each person works. Hours can be flexible or not depending on each store location.
good,Wasn’t a bad work experience. Just didn’t have enough hours or pay rate. All coworkers were awesome and work as a team. Had a really good structured system.
good,"Good job with lots of benefits, able to work around your school schedule or if you have kids. Super great environment and energy. It is a lot of hard work and high pace job. It is a minimum wage job with little tips but overall great."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks dealt with ensuring that new customers felt no different from regulars. I learned how to deal with yelling customers whilst at Starbucks. Sometimes it is not the way that they feel towards you but rather how they are being dealt with that makes them feel unrecognized. "
good,"Overall I have really enjoyed my time at starbucks.  The work was challenging and frequently fast paced, but overall I found that the coworkers I had made it all worth while."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been an amazing experience. Sometimes it's stressful, but you get to meet a lot of people and have a lot of different skill-sets added to your belt."
good,"As a first job, starbucks is a great place to learn so many important skills. I enjoy the fast paced atmosphere and co-workers who support me.  There is always a variety of customers and new products and drinks to explore."
good,"typical day: multitasking, don't take abrasive people personally, focus on you and your goal at work, smile and know that something for the better is about to happen, you make a difference"
good,It really is a great atmosphere to work in. When busy it can get overwhelming but with the right help it can be easy. Usually it’s pretty chill unless you work at a store with a drive-thru. Tips also depend on amount of hours so don’t expect much if you don’t work much.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, and management seemed to change quickly, but it was easy to adapt to their work style and thrive. Busy work environment, quick thinking needed and it can be stressful at times."
good,"I originally started working at Starbucks primarily for the competitive health insurance, but I ended up really enjoying my partners (co-workers) and the overall company culture. Unfortunately, hard workers get taken advantage of while store managers pick favorites and hardly ever step foot on the floor."
good,"I would've left sooner but I literally only worked 2 days so it kinda helped. Flexible with hours, free spotify. 1 free meal and drink while on shift."
good,Its a fun place to work and the benefits of working here are amazing! Management is reliable and trustworthy. The best part is getting to know customers.
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced job, with so much to learn. If you love building connections with customers, you'll thrive here. If you're eager to learn, there are always ways to seek out personal growth with management willing to back you."
good,loved the job and the atmosphere. I got along with everyone I worked with. Making coffee was not hard to learn. I loved meeting and getting to know regulars or people from out of town since our location was right off of the freeway. Relaxed environment which I enjoyed.
good,"All the same coffee and training throughout the country"
good,"Great Grow opportunity."
good,"Work is good but workers there aren’t you get to meet people every day from all across the world you get extremely busy especially at night, also be prepared to work until 2:30 AM and be back at 10am"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. There is a lot of turn over though so it feels like you are constantly training people. If you enjoy working as a team and working hard and fast, this is perfect for you. Compensation should be more but the benefits are awesome. You even get a free Spotify premium account! You get to have as many drinks as you like while you are working. One free food item per shift and a bag of coffee, tea and other items for free every week. Health benefits, dental, vision also.  You will likely be working with strong personalities from your coworkers , management and customers. If you are sensitive it's probably not for you. It really taught me to be confident in myself and extreme patience haha. You also get tips each week. I think the average is around $40 per week depending on how many hours you work. Full-time employees typically get around $60."
good,"I enjoyed working here and loved the benefits. Management was nonexistent, but I had a lot of good shift leaders. The company was fun to work for, but the store I worked in was a bad fit for me. A lot of my coworkers were drama filled and it made company to work not fun."
good,"The thing I liked the most about starbucks was the people I worked with. They helped make the 3:30AM wake up call 5 days a week easier to deal with.  I usually opened the store, made the coffee, and prepped the pastry case.  My usual assignment was either the drive thru window or the order taker.  I developed relationships with customers and even memorized orders and could have them inputted and in production before they reached the drive thru speaker."
good,I really enjoyed working at Starbucks my manager was super nice and friendly. I learned a lot about coffee and what not. management team was nice. I worked at the reserved so it was more complicated than the usual normal Starbucks so I did learn a lot there. the hardest thing was to learn how to make the drinks haha but after a while you manage to learn quickly. I enjoyed the perks we had!
good,"They have all sorts of great benefits available, from healthcare, to help paying for college, to transportation benefits. The only problem is not getting paid enough, and management that did not give constructive criticism."
good,As long as you have a great manager it is a great company to work for. I don't know why I have to fill this up so much. That is all that I have to say.
good,"There are ups and downs, as with every place of employment. I love the environment and energy I work around and the people I get to work with. The energy one has to have to be a partner with Starbucks constantly ensures a fun experience on your shift, as well as the different interactions you have making your customer connections. The pay isn’t great, but the benefits are remarkable, including the school benefits!"
good,Its paid alrigth but the higher you go into the company the more they dont care about you specially busy stores they will ask for a performance that wont be worth your paycheck
good,"A typical day can range from really fast to really slow, but both require time management if you work as an opener or closer. It requires a team to get things done throughout the day and communication between partners to get work done properly. The hardest part of the job is mantaining the flow during rushes where people might put in the wrong drink order and the barista has to remake the same drink several times while maintaining good customer service, and also getting tasks of the day done and making sure you have whipped creams left and enough milk. The best part was working together as a team and meeting great people while getting new experience to grow."
good,Starbucks is a good place to start off your career. You learn many skills that will be applicable as you further your career. You get the opportunity to meet many new people an learn their stories which is one of my favorite aspects of working for Starbucks.
good,"Working at starbucks can be stressful, but as always with these sorts of jobs it's the team that makes the dream. Any job can seem like drudgery, or it can be fun and fulfilling. In the case of my experience, it was the team that made it worth coming back to, as well as friendly, familiar regular customer interactions."
good,"Good company to be employed with for a short to medium period of time, not for career job. Big companies, like Starbucks, are more interested in the big picture. Your voice doesn't get heard as an employee."
good,It's not a bad place to work and it provides you opportunities to move up if you chose to. The atmosphere with your coworkers is always a good time.     dfedvdx cfwsr
good,Overall I enjoyed it. The management was not the easiest to get along with. I loved the customers and getting to know the regulars. My coworkers were all very helpful and it was enjoyable working with them. The more experienced workers were harder to get along with because I felt belittled when I would ask questions or for help.
good,"its fun to meet new people, and the drive-thu keeps you on your toes, but it's very busy, stressful job. with all the perks you get, it's hot horrible for a person who's starting out a new job."
good,"Starbucks is a extremely fast-paced environment. Just make sure you stick to the recipe, do what you are told to and you'll do just fine. Lots of cleaning, most of the work is repetitive."
good,"Although the healthcare offered may not be the best, it is a great place to work for. Their mission with helping customers and giving back to the community is one of the biggest reasons this company is great to work for."
good,Starbucks has an awesome culture and values and it provides partners with some great benefits. The only thing I don't like is that the company does not allow managers to adjust schedules even if we posted 3 weeks ahead of time. Any partner can call sick to take care of his pet or a family member and the manager will have to cover if nobody is available to cover the shift. Managers are not even allowed to ask for doctor note. How do I know if people just want to take the day off and me covering for them. No OT for managers.
good,"It's not the best place to work, but definitely not the worst. IT all depends on the store your'e at and the group of people you  have with you. It can be high stress during the rushes, nut that can make it a lot of fun because your'e busy and the time flies by."
good,"Starbucks is a challenging though rewarding place to work because coworkers act like a team, customers (mostly) are wonderful and kind, with great benefits."
good,"If you are looking for a flexible schedule, full-time to part-time work availability, and/or teamwork atmosphere, this is the place for you. Keep these factors in mind before applying:"
good,The employees made it easier to work there because the management was terrible. My favorite part was interacting with customers because they made the Starbucks experience.
good,"Prepared food and coffee for customers. "
good,"Must love your craft as barista."
good,"- Customer connection has taught me more about communication than I thought I even knew."
good,It's an okay job. I didn't like the pettiness or childishness of upper management. They were very quick to play favorites and seldom recognize you for quality work. I did enjoy connecting with people and the discounts
good,I loved working with my team in Pendleton. Always new things to learn and places to grow. Good customers and customer service given there. 10/10 would recommend working there.
good,"Working at a mallbux is a bit difficult, but fun at times."
good,"as far as part time placeholder jobs go, it's fine for the time being. I couldn't see myself staying for the long haul. but money is fine. People are cool, environments decent."
good,"After working in a mind numbing fast food restaurant for a year this was a nice change of pace. Things are always changing, making drinks keeps me on my toes. I love all my customers. I was worried getting this job would result in hella stuck up customers but there are hardly any, at least at my location. I love my coworkers so much we all vibe so well. I think Starbucks just attracts generally laid back workers. I love my job :)"
good,The people who managed Starbucks were terrible training and helping. They didn't know how to schedule people right. And they told people that had a certain day off and then call them when they day was actually asked off by the person.
good,"Overall it is a great Company. However like many companies some upper management teams are not the best. And that is a reality you may face when being a Store Manager. But when you have a great team with all the right people in place, this company is great."
good,"I would say that if you aren’t the type of person to go to Starbucks in your free time, to make and live small talk, and to work in an incredibly high pressure and fast paced environment, then this job is not for you."
good,My shift managers where pretty awesome. It is a fast paced environment that gives you an opportunity for advancement. Morning are awesome to work if you like to stay busy.
good,"Great if you are moving to a new city and need a job to hold you down. Once you get acclimated and want to move up there is a bit of politics but, it's not crazy. Putting in more than a year as a solid employee will get you noticed. Great systems for organization, structure and discipline."
good,Working here was very fun and I loved having regular customers and being knowledgeable about coffee. However the pay is not worth the long hours of being understaffed. It is also very hard to move up in the company because they don't seem to like to promote from within.
good,"It is a great job if you are up for challenges. The downfall of Starbucks though, is that breaks are often forgotten and is mentally draining. But its great for people who like to work with teams."
good,Its good and can get used to for certain people . I love my partners and manager but you cant be too nice its a hard job but it had its moments when its so worth it depending on your environment and spirit
good,I've been with Rustan Coffee Corporation from June of 2004 till September of 2013. My stay with the company has been a very enjoyable part of my time because I learned a lot from this company which have develop my skills and expertise with regards to my personal development ang working skills.
good,"Work is easy enough. Coworkers are nice. Environment can vary from strict to lax. It's customer service man, it wears you down over time. If I had to work there again I would, but that said, I've done it for a bit and I don't want to anymore."
good,"Advancement is difficult if you're not in to the politics or live in an urban environment with high turnover.  Benefits are fantastic and make a great reason to stay."
good,Best job I ever had great company to work for..but hours are limited and u have to move on in life.good overall and clean place that works on 7 roles per person on a shift .rotation during shift is very helpful and you change job roles .
good,This is a job well suited for college students and teenagers. I would not recommend this job for adults looking for job security.  Your hours can be random at times and may not be enough to support your lifestyle.
good,"It's whatever you make of it "
good,I worked at 395 in Palmdale. This store is the most busiest store that I have ever seen. If you like fast pace and get along well with customers and I mean get along very well with all customers even rude ones then this is the place for you. There are few chances for company growth but mainly if you can be a good costumer representativeThis is the place for you
good,"I worked at the Reserve store in wicker and honestly wish I could’ve stayed longer( but I hate coffee and it’s hard to sell something you don’t like when you don’t enjoy it?)"
good,Great company to work for! Advancement is hard but not completely out of reach. Loved the benefits and being a barista. Middle management can make or break a store. Eventually I left because I wanted to advance in my management career. I always suggest working for the company and sometimes think about going back to being a barista.
good,"Starbucks has a lot of perks, but the pay isn't one of them. Helpful for college students, working moms, or people needing a first job to gain experience."
good,"I worked part time at the Starbucks in Target. I learned to cater to customers more than I have at previous jobs. Management wasn't the best because the manager was pretty disorganized and gone from the work area during most of the shift. The hardest part of the job was keeping the line down, especially if a crew member went on break. The best part of the job was learning new skills, developing a rapport with customers and making a lot of friends with other employees."
good,always kind to costumers there always the first priority. fun but hard working atmosphere. good and helpful management. the best part of the day id seeing all our regular costumers.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks and the work, but I think that was mostly due to my coworkers. If i wasn't close to them I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much, the customer base can be a little demanding at times, but overall had a good experience."
good,"Management needs some work, but the company its self is wonderful to work for"
good,Working at Starbucks is fun and offers lots of opportunities. It is a great team driven environment. There are lots of opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"While there were some times that I loved working at Starbucks, there were equally as many times I was miserable.  The experience is very heavily shaped by who you work with and who your managers are.  The pay is minimum wage, but many of the expectations for working are much more than what minimum wage would be worth.  The reason this is, is because it does offer health insurance for part-time workers which is unheard of with other minimum wage jobs.  However, if you are in my demographic where those benefits aren't needed - I was young enough to still be on family insurance - it can be quite frustrating at times.  At the corporate level, the demands of the job continually increased over the 4 years I worked there.  Mainly, the staffing vs. business ratio went down, which means more work per person per hour.  This is a problem when there is an emphasis on personal connection with the customer and the baristas are reprimanded for not taking the time to chat with customers about their days.  In general, it was a great place to work temporarily, when I had lovely co-workers and managers, but there were also some very stressful times and I would not want to work there as a barista for a career."
good,"I’ve worked at 4 different Starbucks locations and honestly, a store manager can make or break your Starbucks experience. Good benefits and fair pay for shift supervisors, depending on where you’re located. Very fast paced and can be stressful at times. I’ve had 3 District Managers and 6 Store Managers in my 3 years employed at Starbucks. 3/6 Managers were fantastic, other 3 could have made me make the decision to quit. All 3 District managers have been great, but unfortunately they are not in the store enough to catch poor attitude and bad treatment from managers."
good,enjoyed working at starbucks for 2 + years . definitely learnt the true meaning of teamwork and customer satisfaction while i was with them. thank you
good,"This is a very high paced environment that keeps it fresh, always introducing promotional food and drinks! It can definitely get hectic at times and stressful with some of our customers not being the nicest. Teamwork goes a very long way and is an important aspect. All in all, can be very rewarding as you grow alongside your baristas!"
good,This job is very enjoyable. It does get stressful at times but overall the experience is great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.
good,"Starbucks allowed me the opportunity to be myself while developing the skills necessary to become a leader within their stores. The partners at every store I worked at were easily the best part of the job and the benefits package is affordable with nothing hidden about it. The upper management (SM, DM, RD, etc...) was hit or miss. Depending where you worked the DM was either great or terrible. The store managers overall were alright, but sometimes underqualified to live out the Mission and Values that Starbucks wanted to create. Overall a fun place to work with above average pay, great benefits and exceptional partners."
good,"Solid place to work.  Starts at minimum wage for baristas, but there are experience raises every 6 months.  Easy to promote to supervisor within a year.  Issues with promotion to management; management training program needs some work.  Great medical benefits for anyone working more than 20 hrs a week.  Lots of great people employed across our locations, customer base is solid.  Ability to memorize dozens of drink recipes definitely a requirement."
good,I loved the job and the connections as well as friendships made. The management although was not the best. I would go to file complaints and they would be disregarded.
good,Easy to transfer out of state . Loved the life long friends and love for coffee i made here . Moving up in management can be hard if your not in a store for very long
good,"Working at Starbucks is definitely a fun experience! It's not work if it's something you love and I loved going in everyday! You make relationships with not only your co-workers, but with your customers and you can't really find that in most places. I definitely recommend working there!"
good,Baristas were expected to do too much while supervisors did not share as much of the work in the store. My coworkers were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Good starter job, training is awesome, room for growth in company, very fast paced, every position has different tasks to get done, lots of new people and people leaving constantly."
good,"This place will keep you busy - it's one of the first jobs that taught me how to best utilize my time. You typically work with other awesome employees and if you stay long enough can establish a good rapport with the customers which is always a plus. "
good,"Starbucks has very low standards as far as remote store managers and the management team, however I found the interactions with customers and the demand of the quality of work produced was valuable to me as an employee and eventual shift supervisor."
good,Fun job with great benefits! Just takes forever to try and get promoted. They keep changing the focus of the company and therefore re-training all the time.
good,"Starbucks used to be a great company to work for about 9 years ago but now they just fall suit with the customer service of a bad mcdonalds, but good company lol"
good,"Training is difficult if not properly staffed, otherwise the workplace is very fast paced and stressful. Customer service is a valuable skill that must be mastered."
good,Starbucks paid for me to return to college through the 100% tuition reimbursement program. I graduated and was not required to continue employment with the company.
good,"Es un buen trabajo, aunque en algunas zonas los administradores de sus tiendas no tienen sentido humano. Es un trabajo sumamente desgastante y cansado y cuando te pagan lo que es es gratificante. Ojo, no todos lo haces y varios te hacen trabajar horas extras sin un buen sueldo."
good,"I have worked for multiple locations and the main concern was the people in management. The job was hilariously easy, the pay matched the level of difficulty, hours were decent, my coworkers were alright (some lazy - even as easy as it is), but management is where it's usually an issue. Of the 3 locations I've worked, only one store manager was a complete headache. Corporate should NOT leave reviews up to a person because as mentally unstable as she is, she gave top performers a zero cent raise because of jealousy. She didn't reward people helping her store to succeed. She was my last location I worked for and left for a job that paid me double and added management to my resume. If you're looking for a fun place to start and test your ability to comprehend simple recipes, they're great. The training was super easy and I had so much fun making coffee that I want to buy a close to commercial machine to make my own in the future!"
good,"A typical day was fun, however, working 6 days a week got to be a little bit much. I did learn management skills which is useful, but the workplace environment was a little unorganized and having to work for Safeway and Starbucks corporate was more than a little difficult. I enjoyed my regular customers and the creativity that came with making drinks."
good,I enjoyed the team environment within this store.  I loved interacting with the customers and fellow staff alike and appreciated getting certified.  It was a loss when my husband was required to move out of state.
good,work with smile and fun. management always is supportive and put on your consideration when they schedule your work. Good place to learn coffee culture and taste the best coffee in the world. highly recommended to college students.
good,"The Manager I worked under made use of my supervisor skills to detract negative feedback regarding policies from himself to me. Starbucks carries itself as a business that wants it's employees to succeed but at the store I worked at, it was not the case. It was all about the Manager making his bonus even if it meant sacrificing his employees."
good,Great job to work in regardless of prior experience or knowledge in coffee. Being in such a high-paced environment encouraged excellent multi-tasking skills and exceptional customer service.
good,A great place to gain experience in a fast paces environment. The environment is constantly changing with the new customers coming and going. Also have regulars that need expect you to know their drink or order even if you are brand new. The busiest days are the weekends specially during the Summer time and everybody wants cold beverages.
good,"Free drinks while you work and food, discounts on everything else, they offer full health benefits at part time hours, which is great for someone who needs that for only working 20 hours a week. "
good,"Starbucks cultivates an environment that is conducive to creating and maintaining relationships with both coworkers and customers. It's a social workplace with constant interaction and opportunity to encourage or tear each other down. Working here has taught me the responsibility I possess to either harm others or build them up, and the importance of the latter."
good,"un poco pesado, los horarios no son tan flexibles."
good,it wasnt too bad i enjoyed it but also i hated how short staffed it can be sometimes. Be prepared to deal with complicated customers because sometimes they can make your shift even worse.
good,"Overall i loved working here for the beginning part, and the benefits are truly amazing (college, coffee mark outs, lunch), however it is hard to move up within the company and it is just customer service. If you truly want to live breathe and be coffee then this is it for you."
good,"I really enjoyed most of my time at Starbucks. Most of my co-workers were enjoyable to work with, and everyone was helpful to beginners. Loved my first manager in terms of providing feedback and assistance whenever needed. He encouraged customer engagement and tried to keep baristas balanced and well-rounded in all positions, keeping in mind their preferences. We learned a lot about coffee and were encouraged to do coffee tastings whenever service wasn't as busy."
good,"Opening the store consisted of preparing machines, counting tills and safe, setting up the store for open. Best part of the job is the coworkers and regulars. Hardest part of the job is unruly/disrespectful customers"
good,"After highschool or during highschool it's a decent job, after that not much room for advanced. If your store is the busiest in the region like mine was, that makes the pay not worth it"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed starbucks as a whole, it allowed me to transfer once or twice, and pick up shifts at other stores freely so i could contribute more to the local starbucks culture. District Management was frustrating at times, and turnover was high in my area. I did my best to help with it by becoming a trainer and a shift manager so that I could help with the two biggest bottlenecks in our production."
good,"I love Starbucks but I’m ready for a new working atmosphere.  I don’t like having to cover many roles and picking up where lots of people slack. Also, having to fight for days off/finding coverage."
good,"I liked working for Starbucks, overall.  The wages were really the most stressful part.  As someone who relied on this job as a primary source of income, I struggled to make ends meet.  Now considering that I live in Vancouver (which is very expensive), this is not surprising."
good,"If in a great store then experience is incredible and will make life long friends, If in a poorly managed store you  will dread going into work. Store managers vary drastically from store to store"
good,"This job has taught me a lot about managing my time wisely, and knowing when to step up. It was a great opportunity to work here and i have made a few really good friends that I'm planning on keeping in my life. The job can be stressful at times, but overall a nice place to work. I would work here again in the future."
good,The overall workload does not equal the pay. The only saving grace was the coworker. Well some of them anyway. The management was lacking and sometimes lazy.
good,Starbucks can be a fantastic or miserable place to work. Its all determined by the abilities and attitude of your SM and/or DM. They have all the tools required for a great work experience if they wish to use them.
good,"I enjoy working there and making customers happy and even my partners. The environment is usually fast paced with down times here and there depending on the day and hours, but it is usually fairly easy to make the most out of it."
good,Personally I had a great time I simply wanted to advance in school starting with working somewhere that is more related to my area of study in college
good,The Hardest Part Of The Job For Me Was The Fact That When somebody Called Out I always Had To Make Sure I Stepped Up For The Person Out & It Happened Often
good,"Starbucks really is a great place to advance. You have the opportunity to meet great people that basically turn into family. It can be fast paced and stressful, but that’s not an issue when you have the support of a great team. Constantly learning in this job."
good,Before working for Starbucks I had never been a Barista before. They were kind enough to give me a fair chance and it work out pretty well. Thank you.
good,"The average day at a Starbucks was mainly focused on maximizing customer happiness along with making sure we had a clean environment. Most of the day was spent cleaning and taking orders. As a supervisor, it was my job to ensure that workers were following these key principles throughout the day. Other important matters that fell upon a shift supervisor are to take inventory, money management, and take on any store responsibilities left by the manager."
good,"This is particularly a great job if you need a flexible schedule, perform well under pressure, and love coffee. Store to store experiences will vary however, so be sure to spend some time in the location your being interviewed to get an idea of the volume/crew to see if it is the right fit for you."
good,"a typical day at starbucks was opening shifts I would make sure everything was fresh products to be put out, I also would write schedules put orders away and also send orders aswell."
good,Only good for keeping you busy for college. Not a company to stay in forever. Flexible with your work-life balance. Usually for college kids that need the extra money.
good,"I did enjoy my time with Starbucks. My frustration came with not being able to promote past Shift Supervisor as upper management kept outside hiring for Assistant and general manager positions. I spent almost 5 years as a Shift before deciding to take my skills elsewhere. "
good,Good place to work. there was a lot of change going on when I was employed there. Stability with employees and managers is not very high. Great team. Had a lot of team building exercises so you would get to know co-workers
good,"Working as a Barista lets you engage in the artistry of latte art, but only if you make an effort to learn it. The fast paced nature of the job gives you a great opportunity to practice as you'll be making many drinks in repetition."
good,the hardest part about this job is just keeping your self busy. its a small shop so making sure you have everything ready for days to come is the challenge .
good,Overall I have had an up and down experience because of management inconsistency and because high turnover. I do feel that the direction the company has chosen lately is trying to focus on the values such as nurturing the human spirit but it’s overshadowed by turning Starbucks into a “fast food” experience.
good,"At Starbucks when the line wraps around the street and you have a hundred drinks to make your partners will always find little ways to make everyone laugh and smile. Though the Store Manager can be a bully, if you make real connections with your partners it'll always be a fun place to work at."
good,"You really have to take this job at face value, it is an entry level job mostly for students. The hours are nice, the pay is low but the overall stress to pay ration is fine."
good,"Great environment and good people to work with good discounts and benefits. Mandatory 30 minute lunch break every 6 hours, free meal and unlimited free drinks."
good,Love the relationships I have made at Starbucks. Benefits are nice for those employees over 26. Could foster more opportunity for advancement. Have worked in 3 different states and 3 different districts and some districts are better than others. Mostly a positive company to work for.
good,"When I worked at Starbucks in Tysons' Corner, and I was able to get along with everyone pretty well. I was able to go for 8 hours a day, I interacted well with customers, and I was pretty well liked by the bosses. When I moved to California and switched to part-time, all of that seemed to disappear, and I wound up leaving the day after."
good,The company is kinda going downhill but it was fun. My store was extremely busy 24/7 so there was hardly any down time. The employees are hit or miss. Everything is dependent on the location
good,"I got to be trained by amazing managers and shift leads. I became one of them. It was a TON of work, but it made me REALLY appreciate the hard work for little pay saying. I looked at all the free drinks and food I got and kept telling myself it would get better. It would eventually come back to me. Ultimately the sacrifices were too great for the return."
good,"Good part time job to start as to build up customer service. I was able to talk with customers, but the work environment was not the greatest, but I was able to work with great people."
good,"lots of good connections with customers, fast paced environment make the day go by quickly, Good crew work as a team with everyone filling a specific roll for the day"
good,Starbucks is a fast paced environment. the benefits are fantastic and the people are fun. The management do the best they can with the tough situations they are given.
good,"at starbucks you are expected to work in a past paced environment and expected to provide excellent costumer service, most of the time the conflicting schedules and availability result in working holidays and weekends which isnt bad but  can be irritating when you feel like you dont have a job outside of work. but overall great starting position to understand the importance of teamwork, and multitasking."
good,No dull moment during work hours. Fun to serve customers and receive compliments from them. You learn new things everyday. You improve from your mistakes.
good,"Like many restaurants, Starbucks is very high-paced work. Dealing with customers while preparing a quality product can be difficult, but at Starbucks, I believe the stress factor is greatly reduced with the policies, benefits, and culture instilled by the Starbucks Corp. and the individuals I had the personal pleasure of working with."
good,"It was good, my store a was bit more relaxed than what i've seen from others, from time to time it would be stressful especially during peak or if something would break down on us."
good,"The Starbucks company in general was amazing. Amazing benefits, FULL college tuition, health insurance, dental insurance and we all get a share in the stocks. I would have loved to have stayed with Starbucks but unfortunately the store I worked at had very, very poor management. The overall environment was very stressful and the store manager was (to be blunt) a terrible person. She was reported to corporate management by several people for the way she treated the partners there and went under investigation at least twice that I know of. But, Starbucks itself is a great company and I would definitely recommend working at a store to anyone that could handle the stress level. It was definitely a stressful job in the beginning because it is a very fast paced job and it’s stressful on your mind if that makes sense. It’s obviously not the hardest job in the world but you just have to get used to it!"
good,"Working at Starbucks was a fast pace job and stressful. No time to sit always something to do. Pros: you meet a lot of cool people and free drinks. Co-workers a friendly,"
good,I enjoy working here as it is a very challenging yet fun occupation. It can get very rigorous but the people and environment is very lovely and positive to work around.
good,There was always something to do. I hated cleaning the bathrooms but the management and benefits were good and fair. If the location wasn't so sketchy I definitely would have stayed.
good,"Manage opening or closing duties."
good,If you get flustered really easily this is an a job for you ...  but I loved working at Starbucks I was a very fun environment people were friendly you build relationships with your customers get to know them by their name. The coolest thing I’ve seen working at Starbucks is at the drive-through. One of our customers paid  for the customer behind him and the next person joined and paid the person behind them 38 cars later it ended.  Aside from being fired from Starbucks I have no complaints about them their drinks are great and it’s just a fun environment to be in.
good,Starbucks is a good place for a student to work hours are flexible and people you work with are good too. The money is good considering I have worked at other companies for less.
good,"If you have a good manager, your time here can be very beneficial and can definitely turn into a career. Unfortunately, I had great difficulty in advancement, though I worked for the company for several years. The pay could definitely improve, particularly given the public knowledge surrounding the company's CEO. However, the benefits are really great and I've known a fair amount of people who came into the position on that incentive alone. There are also lots of discounts on local entertainment and restaurants, you just have to check in with the portal. If you're a student, make sure that you can be firm and communicative with your manager about your schedule. If they tell you to work a shift that you cannot do, it will be made your responsibility to find a replacement. Try to find your groove, but also don't be too stubborn to work the register on a busy day. The anxiety of working with a crowd of un-caffeinated people is very stressful, but you'll survive, and everyone has to put in the effort."
good,"It’s a nice and fun job, lot of stuff to learn about coffee, especially if you get to work at a Reserve Starbucks. The benefits are interesting, they have nice coverage for health/dental/etc. expenses. You also get discounts to a number of places, so that’s a plus. The employees are usually super fun to work with, it’s a nice atmosphere and you’re never bored. "
good,Corporate Starbucks went through a lot of changes while I was there but I do think they truly value their team members.  Overall I recommend working there.
good,"great company with great benefits, higher ups do not care about your personal life dont really have flexibility if you need things. they just say oh well."
good,"A typical day at my branch, and I can safely assume is the time hours. Rush morning hours. Back at lunch time, and then during after school hours. It's just a matter of getting used to it if you're new to it."
good,"A typical day at work was very repetitive and most problems that arose came from awful customers."
good,I've always enjoyed working at Starbucks. Staff is usually very friendly and benefits are helpful. Work hours for me were pretty manageable. Overall I enjoy this job and would recommend
good,"The pay was not good for the work. The environment was quick-paced and very well maintained. The associates I worked with were a lot of fun, as well as very good at their job. The Starbucks I worked for made sure the customer was priority."
good,"The work is fast paced and intense, but you work with some of Starbucks' bests employees and learn new methods of coffee preparation. Enjoyable experience if you have a lot of energy and intensity."
good,"The review shouldn't be mandatory, I'm not interested in reviewing Starbucks, I haven't worked there in 4 years. And then you have a 150 character minimum?"
good,"You get to work with some really nice people and it can be a fun experience to enjoy working with whoever you are on with. You really feel like you're a part of a team. Regular customers are great and make the day really easy for you. "
good,I had an amazing experience at my first store. It was such a fun environment and everyone cared about the cleanliness and customers. At my most recent store management was unpredictable and uncommunicative.
good,Thankful for my first job at Starbucks for giving me leadership experience and amazing customer service skills. My only complaint is that staffing was a big issue. We were either severely overstaffed during rushes or overstaffed with an empty store.
good,"I enjoyed my job as a barista at Starbucks overall. However, it really all depends on the store you work at. Some Managers are better than others, and the chemistry of the staff plays a huge role. There is often a lot of drama that goes on in each Starbucks district, which can be frustrating."
good,The best part about the job is the people you get to work with. The customers have become my friends as well. I have learned a lot about what it means to work as a team at Starbucks.
good,"The best and worst days of my life have been had at starbucks. I've made my best friends and worst enemies there, had great bosses that changed my life and awful ones that have nearly made me quit. But it's who you work with and the customers you meet that make your day."
good,"I loved the job itself and the people I worked with. Proper management was lacking and customers complain A LOT. It was nice to make good connections with customers though. Tips were good, most people are nice, but it can be very stressful during peak hours."
good,A typical day at work would be kind of stress free in my opinion. Most of my coworkers would try their best to make all the customers happy. Management was great. I'd get to work and set up the pastry case and start brewing coffee. I'd work the drive thru most of the time which was fun because I got to meet lots of people. I cleaned somewhat but my managers made sure to divide the work up.
good,"This wasn't my first job, but it does make a decent first job. The days were pretty easy and stress free, sometimes management wasn't good to work with."
good,Excellent Leadership and great work life balance. You get all the tools to do your work. Work culture id very laid back. People respect each others time and situation.
good,"Overall experience was nice. I still dream about making drinks sometimes though I work in finances now. :P "
good,So usually I work right after school making it very easy because it's closed and I learned about how to make a drink and the amounts. just recently I've been learning how to count money and warm up and serve food.
good,birçok şey öğrendim iyi dostluklar kurabildiğim bir ortam oldu
good,"It was a fun job and I loved my teammates. However the manager was very pushy and required us to work really quickly, oftentimes messing up orders, and we didn't get to enjoy our breaks as she always called us up to ""help""."
good,you have to learn quickly and work hard. have excellent customer service. If those are all the things you can do ! try applying and talk to the team members and manger directly so they know you.
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me a few things. It taught me how to communicate within a team effectively, it taught me how to be a good team player and it also taught me how to have a good work ethic and be a professional at all times. A typical day at Starbucks was busy and fast paced. When were fully staffed its a fun environment to be in and the work culture is usually very encouraging."
good,"I personally had a great time during my Starbucks experience. I started as a barista and was offered a shift management position within a year. The customers were friendly overall, the work was engaging but not overly demanding and the staff were mostly cool and relatable. I will attribute my experience to fortune of having a decent location, but every place has it's share of pros and cons. Plus tips help to take some of the edge off too much financial strain."
good,short staffed most of the time. We are always out of what Starbucks is promoting that month and we get yelled by the customers because of that also we get bad reviews because of it which makes are store look bad
good,"fun company and workplace."
good,"A typical work day depends on the time of working, morning shifts are obviously busier as well as lunch rush, and after school/work. Easy to remember systems from training.   Lots of support from coworkers and management.  Great employee benefits from the company.  Great getting to know regular customers."
good,"I really like this job, it's very fun interacting with regulars and making drinks, and it's amazing the kind of people you meet working a job like this."
good,Overall Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. The environment is very friendly and on occasion it can get rowdy. Paying attention to the customers needs has been the focus and I believe that customers respond well to positive attitudes
good,"Very stressful, fast-paced environment, but the benefits make it all worth it. Employees get stock with the company, free coffee, free food, free drinks, and at one point they had a tuition reimbursement program."
good,There a very good company there mangers could do a lot better for the workers that are there they could really do better with the pay rate and how the customer can say whatever
good,It has been a really enjoyable experience. I would recommend it if you're looking to enjoy your coworkers and you don't care about making a lot of money. It is however very difficult at times.
good,I really enjoyed working there. I liked serving coffee and to meet different people all the time. I quit there but I definitely want to go back. miss all that rush
good,Starbucks was a good temporary or first job. The management was always nice but tough to move up with the company as they started hiring outside of the company.
good,"I liked working at Starbucks it’s relaly fast paced and the shifts are short which makes time fly by, plus you get many benefits as a partner and you get good training before working on your own."
good,I have had the luxury of picking up shifts at different Starbuck locations and the atmosphere was very different. One place was very tense and the employee relationships were very off. At the other location it was the complete opposite. It all depends on the location where you work.
good,"Bon management, très bonne ambiance dans une sympathique équipe"
good,"Un posto di lavoro consigliato perlopiù a studenti, o come temporale."
good,"My work experience was a little different in that I worked in a Starbucks inside of a Safeway. Most of my issues stemmed from Safeway management rather than the management in my specific department. I will say, I would work almost my entire shift by myself, which while manageable, was also difficult to do shift duties involving leaving the counter without making customers wait, and a co-worker would have been a huge help. Other than that, I was impressed by Starbucks streamlined process of coffee-making and their attention to detail in training workers and keeping up with new recipes. Overall a good place to work and was a valuable learning experience."
good,"This is a really great job. For college students it works out really really well. they pay a decent amount, have great benefits in the form of free coffee and food. and a really good discount at 30% off all purchases."
good,"After spending a few years working here, I find that this job is perfect for those who are starting to work, especially if they are planning to work in business. The cafe covers many aspects that you can apply to other jobs, such as customer connecting, setting up displays for promotions, serving the customer demands to specifications, cleaning and health hazards, management in inventory, etc. With all the employees from every walks of life, I found a second home there with the people who helped me and the people I helped. I really did enjoy my job here for all the time I spent."
good,"Only reason I had to leave is because of an injury.  Other than that coworkers were fun to be around, most of the customers were pleasant, and rarely had any issues."
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun and enjoyable especially with the people you worked with. Morning shifts were my preferred shift, it went by fast and the customers were pretty much all regulars."
good,Good first job! they were very accommodating with the hours I was able to work because of school. I was able to learn a lot about working with others and customer service.
good,"Co-workers were friendly and become like a little work family if you stay long enough. Although the hours are inconsistent and not enough to cover bills. The manager I had made it extremely difficult to have a second job, so I had to quit in order to get a full-time position elsewhere. "
good,"Job if pretty cool if you're looking for a minimum part-time hours. You become eligible for benefits once you work 240 hours within 3 months, but the managers barely give me 15 hours a week no matter how much you ask. They also have a college program, but you have to meet that hourly amount within that time frame. It's like this for everyone. They say their offered, but trying to get that amount of hours is hard unless the scheduling manager is sweet on you. As a mom it is hard to schedule off for special events without getting shafted on hours for the other days. You get a free pound of coffee a week, 30% off merch, and 3 free mark outs (drinks) on a shift."
good,Good company to work for and easy fast paced environment. Theemoloteea were friendly and I enjoyed the discounts. Always something to do made the day goes my faster.
good,"Working at Starbucks can be fun, there are good people and great opportunity for promotion and healthcare. However, like every retail job, there are bad days and horrible customers. Sometimes management has your back and sometimes they can be hard to talk to. Depending on where you are and what team you have, this job can be easy and enjoyable or hard and unbearable. I've worked at various locations and have had varied experiences. Either you fit in with your crew or you don't. It's a fast-paced environment and you will be on your feet all day."
good,Wouldve stayed but current manager was unprofessional i dont wish to write more in regards of the review so please let this be enought thank you and your welcome
good,Working at Starbucks was great! The team and management was fantastic. The other team members and customers i met was the best part. I enjoyed learning new things from them/
good,cool place to work part-time while in school. learned a lot about coffee and bar operations. got to also meet a lot of people i would normally not interact with.
good,"Starbucks is a great position if you want to progress from barista to management level positions as there is lots of opportunity and encourage due to high company turnover. However, the job can be quite stressful when you start stepping up to supervisor roles and up, and you are expected to bring work home with you as you may have to cover shifts when you are not scheduled. Main store Starbucks do offer more benefits than franchised stores. Breaks are unpaid however, you are not guaranteed hours and shift work can affect your personal life."
good,i love making coffee and enjoy my day to day work the hardest part was doing the rota as you have to try to keep everyone happy i was a supervisor for a week then manager as my skills and my work ethic was very good
good,"No matter what shift you're working, you can be expected to instantly jump into action. You are expected to perform efficiently at whatever station you're placed in, no matter how quickly or slowly the day might be going. Everything from prep to drink creation comes extremely naturally after a while."
good,"Great job, lots of fun. But much harder than most anticipate. It’s about 75% cleaning 25% making coffee. Almost impossible to get promoted unless you are excellent at networking and talking yourself up. You’ll see lots of outside hires, especially for management positions, as they tend to pass over supervisors for promotions. Outside hires usually won’t last longer than 6-9 months before quitting. "
good,Meet and greet great customers. They become like family. I learn a lot of their names and personality and meet alot of their kids and spouses. My manager was a very hard worker and tried his best to keep alot us employed with enough hours but being that we were a very small store located in a big super store like Target e had to try and meet everyone's needs and it became stressful for his. So I choose to look for another job that fits my needs and one I could grow within the company and learn different roles with in the company and has better benefits as well.
good,I go to work. i clock in. i make drinks. i make people smile. i make food. i clean up. i work hard . i work long. i really dont want to type this out and decline thank you.
good,This place is alright when we are staffed correctly but that rarely happens which make things harder to do when we are super busy. Things are more when you have a great staff that likes to get their stuff done but also makes the mood light.
good,"Starbucks was my first job in high school. It taught me a lot about things like task prioritization and how to work under pressure and how to deal with unpleasant people. I made friends with people outside of my usual sphere and got outside my comfort zone. I loved my boss, more because she was like a mother figure to me, and less because of her role in my job. The workplace culture was great, we were all friends and most of us worked very well together and we always supported the newbies. I loved helping train new people after I learned the ropes myself."
good,"The benefits are good, and there are opportunities for growth within the company if you are willing to put in the time and dedication. The prospect of memorizing the menu and offerings seems daunting at first, but manageable."
good,"Very busy store, some employees only wants to stay at the bar station, sometimes the rotations of each positions are limited, specially when you want to learn making drinks but they will only put you in the cash the whole time of your shift. It is unfair sometimes for other people who wants to learn."
good,"Good place to work but not very easy to move up in the company and hours were very shy, no money was really saved as i worked here. The job is good but pay and hours were not."
good,This is a nice environment to work in. The company has a great structure and motive behind it. Coworkers are always very kind and have great personalities!
good,"I enjoyed the stores ive worked at , not too much about the management at some locations. Overall, it was a learning experience that ive grown from and made me a better person."
good,"A typical day at work is structured. I go in and make a plan for my self and my team. We interact with customers on a personal basis and create lasting moments to help foster an inclusive community. The hardest part of the job is the unpredictability of outside forces affecting the day. In response to these challenges, my team and I work together to overcome challenges by communicating, collaborating and creating moments of connection with customers to show that we are there to help and serve."
good,"This was a great job to pass the time. I met a lot of new people and I really enjoyed the customer service aspect of it all. I learned a lot about coffee and food pairings and how to accurately describe them to customers and fellow staff. The workplace culture was good and everyone was very friendly, encouraging and helpful. The hardest part of the job would have to be Frapp's in summer, anyone who has worked there will understand this! Also, there were some times with difficult customers in the drive thru that would ultimately hold up the line and make it hard on everyone else behind them. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to try new things and talk with a wide variety of people everyday and getting know know the regulars."
good,"Everything is organized and follows a routine, so you'll never go into work not knowing what to expect.  I worked at two stores--the first one I worked at for 1 full year.  The manager was fantastic and always thought about every one of us like her own children.  In that sense, she was great at hiring good partners that fit in well with us.  My second manager after I relocated was very inexperienced, and often overlooked the standards of health and the routines, which made days at work confusing and unorganized.  The team that she hired was very negative, with partners often arguing loudly and everyone felt disconnected.  The managers play a huge role in the work environment, which may lead to an unfortunate experience.  However, if you find the right store, you will have fun everyday, make long-lasting friends, and learn a lot about connecting with people.  The hardest part about the job is definitely handling drive-thru customers, since they seem to believe it's acceptable to be extremely rude at the drive-thru."
good,"A typical day at work involves working several positions including the bar, register, customer support, ovens, and drive-through. Throughout the day there are several busy hours which can be exhausting but getting through it can feel rewarding. I learned how to work under high-pressure situations and to keep moving even when I felt overwhelmed by the number of customers to adhere to. Management had its ups and downs. The culture was eye-opening to me as a very sheltered missionary kid. The hardest part of the job is staying caught up with orders when it gets busy. The most enjoyable part is when you have the time to craft a high-quality beverage and see the look on customers' faces."
good,I enjoyed my time at starbucks for the most part. It can be stressful at times when it gets busy but if you have the right crew everything flows nicely. Management where I was could have been better. Lack of organization and would run out of items frequently. Customers were mostly rude and over bearing to staff members.
good,"Typically days went by quickly, lots of local and regular customers with a decent amount of kids who want all sorts of blended drinks. I learned standard coffee procedure, how to prepare specialty beverages and excellent coffees. It wasn't a hard job, I liked the regulars."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks! It's a great company and my coworkers were friendly. The culture was good and I loved building friendships with the regulars. The hardest part was the schedule. It changed weekly so it was hard to plan life outside of work. Starbucks taught me a great deal about time management and I will forever be grateful for my time there!
good,Good Culture and Gives a lot of learning experiences. They will teach you to be passionate and dedicated in all you do. Their mission works and applies well.
good,what i learned in starbucks is team effort and learning to please different people knowing how to join in with different cultures dealing with personalities that contains coffee and being able to accept changes without having no control over certain matters i also learned that a coffee means a whole lot to someone day that depends on it i also learned to move in a fast motion when the job need to get done i also learned different taste of something makes a difference the hardest job was the cleaning to win expection because i was at the flag store which requires a whole lot more then usual and bathrooms are use by the public so it makes it hard for the lobby person the most enjoyable part was to see my customers with a smile and being able to connect with them when they first enter the smile and the energy that i show them they would want to spend money with me the management team wasnt so great because things wasnt handle according to the matter it woud be adressed to the barista or in the opening but if you catch someone in management that is doing they job they will make sure this done correct
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work, but only if you are looking at it as a stepping stone for the rest of your career.  It pays the bills, and thats pretty much it.  It's a good stepping stone job because it teaches you how to work as a cohesive team, and how to work out customer service details, that would usually never come up in another place of work"
good,Fast paced work environment while ensuring that we are neat & prepared. Providing the best customer service and attitude between guest and within team.
good,"It was a good first job for me,because it taught me how to be multitask orientated. It also strengthened my customer service skills. I would recommend this job to anyone looking to save up in post-secondary or high school."
good,"Overall. I think this is a fantastic place to work. The company is strong and growing. The location has quick access to the freeways and it is rare to get caught trying to get to them. During a typical commute on I-90 during main work times, the actual drive time was never more than a couple of minutes longer than the legal best."
good,"The job itself is so much fun and so many other partners are kind and supportive, and the work environment is always positive, even on a bad day. However, there is poor management in my experience. I was illegally scheduled during school, over the legal limit for a minor, and treated poorly. Overall, if you have a good manager, then the job is amazing! When the manager is good, I rate the job a 10/10. For a short while, I had an amazing manager who truly cared for her partners and was very responsible."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. Their mission statement is what the employees live by and includes supporting the community and its employees.
good,"busy fast paced makes the day go fast or slow depending on the volume of customers, learned alot working for starbucks canada"
good,"Quality and quantity of drinks are varied depending on customer business. A culture of ""3rd place"" is prevalent that tries to make customers and partners comfortable."
good,What I learned from working at Target Starbucks was how to work better as a part of a team. I learned how to work better under pressure and how to fix mistakes when they were made. The job provided me with a different work experience and it taught me that you should always preform your best even on your down days.
good,"Your team has to be collaborative to succeed in efficiently delivering handcrafted drinks. "
good,Starbucks was a halfway decent place to work. My only criticism would be the customers who believed that the entirety of the universe revolved around them.
good,"- Lärt mig mer om service yrket i allmänhet"
good,I enjoyed most of my time with Starbucks. I worked for a total of 3 different managers at 2 stores. The first manager was amazing and really cared about her employees but the other two just didn't seem to care about the job or the any of the employees.
good,I enjoyed being a SM with Starbucks but I wanted to move up within the company and there were to any opportunities available. I was offered a DM job with another company so I had to leave the company I order to advance my career.
good,pay needs to be better as it is not an easy jobs comes with alot of duties and work nice to at least get free drinks and coffee and lunch living cost is high pay here is low
good,"The benefits are amazing, tips are a plus but nothing substantial, supervisors can vary and store managers are usually good. This is a great job if you use all of the benefits they offer, if you just need a job for quick cash you'll find there's a lot expected of the average barista for the wage you earn. Currently taking advantage of the online school with ASU benefit, and at just over 20 hours, this can be a low stress enjoyable job with great perks. Moving up to SS is easy enough if you are a hard worker and make it clear you want to move up and will do whatever necessary in order to achieve. After that, there's really not much opportunity to move up. Most new SMs I've had were external hires, even when some of my fellow SS were MUCH more knowledgeable and deserving. Don't expect much in the long run, use it as a stepping stone and be on your way or stay for the benefits and work low hours."
good,"Even though Starbucks was a place where I could be flexible with my schedule and still get benefits as a part-time worker, I still found management and other little things to be inconsistent on my end. Even though that is resolved, I was able to learn about balancing more than just work but school and my personal life. Go there knowing it is only temporary but great experience for helping your growth."
good,"I was promised at least 30 hours, and I get between 24 and 31.. I applied for full time. It’s a decent place to work but they keep hiring new people when I’m always available for more hours and don’t get my minimum"
good,"Working at the location I was at was undoubtedly my most stressful job. However, my loyal customers were one of the reasons I stayed for so long. The other thing that kept me there, was the benefit package."
good,"Starbucks is a good company and I feel they truly care about their partners, but being in management is incredibly demanding at times. My DM was supportive and a wonderful resource, but store structure leaves the manager as THE CONTACT for the store. My first few months were spend working 6-7 days a week because I had taken over for a manager that had mentally checked out and left me short staffed with virtually no leadership besides myself. If I needed time off I would make sure I had a neighboring store manager willing to look out for my store and make it very clear partners were not to contact me except in an emergency. "
good,Good starting job. Allows for advancement if you are willing. Low hours and rate keep it from being a good long term unless you advance high up in the ranks.
good,"Starbucks is a good job to have if you are in school or do not have a high level of education and do not plan on pursuing one. There is mobility, but it is a very selective process from my experience. If you are planning to make this your full time career, I would suggest against it. It is very difficult obtaining 40 hrs/wk without working at  multiple stores a week. When you move up the Starbucks chain you are watched like a hawk by regional managers or branch managers and the laid back environment you experience as a barista expires. The customers are very daunting at times, but inversely you will also make friendships with customers that will often extend outside the store. Along with your coworkers, for the most part you will get along with most people you work with as long as you are open minded and work hard. Overall, it is a good job to hold you down until something better comes up. The company takes care of their employees very well with several benefits, but it is not a good long term option."
good,"Overall Starbucks as a company is very great. But specific stores and managers make the job awful. It is either really hard to move up, or it's ridiculously easy. It feels like favoritism goes a lot further than dedicated hard work."
good,"A great company to work for as a student. Very fair to employees and provides a positive work environment. It is however a high stress environment, depending on location."
good,"I loved working there vause i meet lots of cool people and co workers but then it just became a very unhappy place, some co workers would have attitude for no reason"
good,It gets very busy but you have to also talk to every customer that comes in. You get in trouble for not talking to everyone when you're trying to do everything you are asked to do.
good,Good company to work for. Nice getting to know your regular customers. Employees and customers are generally nice to you. Company provides unlimited drinks while at work.
good,Is a place with friendly awesome nice people and collected people to work with. Serving coffee and food and making sure of the best experience for people.
good,"Starbucks is very fast paced and requires you to have a positive attitude, no matter what. The job is great if you are working with a great team. It can be difficult if you're understaffed. It's important to always be willing to learn, and to always be willing to help your co-workers. The best part of the job for me was the friendships I made."
good,It's not a bad job. You are paid fairly well and get tips on top of that. It can get really busy and hectic at times though. The process of learning is not that difficult.
good,As a barista it was a fun way to connect with people in the community. As a shift manager it was a fun way to gain management experience. The company had decent benefits and competitive pay.
good,Overall a great workplace if you’re in the right store. Made lots of good friends here. Always hated how wasteful they were though and there were some very long hard hours.
good,"-busy mornings"
good,The Starbucks experience really depends on the store you work at. I lucked out to work in a low volume store which allowed the baristas to really get to know our customers and provide them with great customer service. I loved my regulars and it made the store feel like home
good,"A typical day at work was fast-paced and fun, enabling workers to interact and network with many different customers. I learned how to keep track of multiple orders and tasks at once while maintaining high accuracy and excellent customer service."
good,"Starbucks was a great interim job to have, especially considering the ease of transferring between store locations. I had a wonderful manager who supported my growth and helped me advance."
good,learn on how to make the drinks and learn on how to satisfy the customer’s need. the harderst part of this job is you have to memorise all the recipes and the SOP of the the work.
good,"I believe working for this company is a great place to start for someone needing an introduction to the work force. I don't personally believe this company will help anyone achieve anything higher than retail management unless you have proper connections, though I believe it was a great job when I was apart of the team!"
good,"Very demanding customers, this isn't the job for you if you get overwhelmed and frustrated easily. Managers were not always the nicest when it came to requesting time off for school/personal issues."
good,"Extremely high paced environment that was hard to get the hang of at first, but definitely manageable once you have experience. Great culture and usually great relationships between baristas and managers."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you are looking for a position that provides benefits; however, the pay can be...bad. My insurance is great, but most people have to work a second job to make ends meet."
good,Starbucks is a really great company to work for especially having the ability to receive benefits. A Normal day at Starbucks usually depends on the hours you work. Usually mornings are fast paced rushes with very little down time. Mid days are usually stocking for the night shifts and night shifts are usually a lot of cleaning and prepping for the morning crew.
good,This job requires great team work and people skills. You'll have great customers to some not so great so temperance is very important as well. There are several 'positions' a Barista must be comfortable switching to at any moment.
good,It’s a fun place to work especially if u have a good toeam working with you but also everyday isn’t going to be a good day you have some customers that can be annoying at sometimes but just smile be calm and say thank you and hope to see you a again.
good,This is a great place to work if attending school. They will also assist in paying for classes if needed. There have tones of programs to benefit their employees. They REALLY do seek to help their employers expand in life and become a better individual.
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Starbucks. To me the most fulfilling part of my job were the daily interactions with costumers. I greatly cherished getting to meet and connect with interesting people, and bringing satisfaction to their day."
good,They were very flexible with schedules. Coworkers were great people. Managers cared about the store’s well being. We kept the store very clean and organized. Volunteer opportunities with the company.
good,"In this company, I learned many concepts. One of the most difficult, but at the same time very rewarding, was learning to do late art. I gained experience and skills in customer service. A very important concept for me, we managed to make a family of our team generating a very good work environment."
good,"While working at Starbucks it was very stressful depending on the day. It was a great workplace, employees were friendly as well as the customers. Also, I gained the capability to communicate with customers if and when their was a problem. The overall hardest part of being a barista would be making so many different drinks at one time. Being a barista had its benefits which was getting free coffee before, during, and after a shift which was pretty enjoyable."
good,"great position for students, good environment and people around. Management can be overbearing and it Can get stressful and moves very fast, but overall is a great place to work."
good,"It’s a good place to start, and it changed how I see the world, from a customer to a staff. It gave sufficient experiment for people who just start looking for a job, and it’s a less intense and more flexible job."
good,Great benefits and fun people to work with. Company sometimes has unreachable goals for the stores. Culture is different in different stores depending on manager.
good,"Great job just extremely stressful, and never enough Labor to meet the expectations they want. I love working here and it made me who I am today but I've put my time in and it's just getting harder and harder."
good,I loved my job at Starbucks unfortunately I just felt like there was not much room for advancement. I had a few managers that I wasn't necessarily fond of but other than that I really did enjoy my job. And that was what kept me going. I love being a barista. I loved most of my co-workers. Over all the company gives you fantastic benefits. Overall it's a great place to work.
good,"Great while in school, as each store worked around my available hours. Very fast paced at times, especially during morning hours, and working hours were very early in the morning to very late at night."
good,I currently work in an extremely busy location with Drive Thru and there is hardly a moment where there is not a customer being helped at all times. The manager doesn't have enough hours to give for the store to be fully staffed at all times either.
good,I liked working at Starbucks because I am a very passionate coffee lover and the people I worked with were very friendly. I like to always be doing something and at Starbucks that's just what I did. I felt that I the employees could be paid a little more than we were but other than that it was a good experience.
good,Overall I enjoyed working at corporate.  My team was fantastic.  Upper management is completely disengaged with day to day work and there is little support for advancement within the particular group I was in.  Lots of ego and lack of transparency.
good,"Is a fun workplace, you will learn a lot not only of coffee but how to deal with people, in Puerto Rico the pay is the minimum that is the saddest part."
good,While working at starbucks I gained a lot of team experience. There are a lot of benefits that you could gain from and the pay is fairly good. I would recommend working here if you are trans trying to pay for top surgery because they cover all costs.
good,Starbucks was a lot to manage when working. Multi-tasked frequently. Pushed me to handle situations under pressure. Was able to learn to perform a task successfully with only a minimum amount of time given (concerning when peak starts).
good,Çalışanların işine saygı göstermesi ve ekip ruhunu oluşturması benim için maddi olanaklardan daha önemli etki yarattı.
good,I love working at Starbucks for the customer interaction. They show a lot of passion for their employees. I also enjoy my employees i work with they make a fun environment to make the day go  by!
good,"Very stressful but there are moments that make it worthwhile. Love the regulars, love the team, but there are some people that bring it down. It requires very meticulous planning or you will constantly be running uphill. The hardest part of the job is staying staffed when other jobs are now offering more, or better benefits. A lot of the recruiting falls on the store manager, which we're given very little time to do so we do it in our off time."
good,"I worked at a licensed store with great management, friendly people and amazing regulars. We got trained very well and were always able to talk to our store manager with no issue. Only issues I had with this particular store was there were no raises and when moving up it took them months to increase pay. There was barely any room for moving up and people who were unable to perform their job functions were not moved out of higher positions."
good,A typical work day would be coming in a little early to talk with the staff before going on the floor and going on Point of sales where I would take orders if I wasn't taking orders I was stocking and cleaning.
good,"I honestly loved working for Starbucks, and support the company with all I have; however, I had problem with my particular location. Even when you have an amazing store manager and baristas, the shift supervisor team will make or break your store. I got transferred to a store 30 miles away from my house with no raise with the intent to ""develop."" I was at this store for almost a year, and with no direction on how to develop quicker to the next position, and eventually decided it was not worth the stress of having awful supervisors as my peers and was not worth the drive for not even $12 an hour."
good,"A great company to work for with tons of benefits for their employees. I would recommend working there for everyone. Barista-ing is also an essential skill to learn, because we do acquire a taste for some good coffee."
good,Working at Starbucks was easy fun and simple. Co workers were always helpful and understanding. Fast pace environment but easy to adapt and learn. Management was easy to talk to too.
good,the benifits are great but for you to move up in the company its who you know and not what you know. They give the partners alot of things to keep people coming into the company.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks while I was there. I was forced to quit due to medical reasons but the hours weren't bad, the pay was pretty good considering the area. It's a good company to work for. Downsides to working there, usual work drama and it runs like any fast food place."
good,Not impressed with how issues were handled. I did enjoy the discounts and flexibility. I didmt enjoy how biased my employer was towards senior employees
good,"Typically in a normal day at work one would be on bar, cleaning, interacting with customers,  and multitasking. I learned how to properly handle customer service, and develop efficient working habits. The management was wonderful and very caring. The workplace was energetic and filled with quality coworkers."
good,I enjoyed see all the repeating customers and meeting new faces. I also loved working with my co-workers they made my experience working there even more pleasurable.
good,"Every store is different, and your experience is vastly affected by your store manager. If you have one that's flexible- great! If not? Good luck. I enjoy the actual job itself and even the customers, but I feel that Starbucks is such a fast-growing company, that developing their partners isn't a priority. Baristas get paid more than minimum wage and the benefits are great. As long as I work at least 20 hours a week, I get full benefits. I haven't utilized it yet, but they also reimburse you for Arizona University classes online- as long as you pass. Overall, I would recommend working for this company, but start when you're in high school or college."
good,"It was a fun experience, I was glad I had some of the bosses that were on the job. Great place to network with people. Wish it paid more and was in a bigger building, had my apron stolen about twice. There was a lack of team building which I was there was, but I'm also a kid at heart. The ladder was visible and within range assuming you had the dedication."
good,May seem tough in the beginning for the amount of things you need to learn but it gets easier once everything is down. Management is hit or miss depending on your manager and their boss. The customers are the best part of the job and sometimes coworkers also.
good,"The job was always clearly defined, and training was very well thought out. Incorporating new employees is fairly seamless, which was beneficial in a fast-paced environment. New ideas were welcomed, and often implemented by higher management teams."
good,"Usually we're required to greet customers and try to bond in a way, with them, management was very friendly and kind also very understanding. You're expected to learn quickly about coffee and their business."
good,"I found starbucks to be very flexible hours for college studens. Very resourceful as well. Benefits such as 401k,stocks,graduating ASU program,healthcare premium ,dental and affordable programs for young families for only working part time."
good,Not hard easy work lots of fun meet a lot of people cool coworkers some are lazy & just want to work for brand not the job it comes with overall good workplace just needs to pay a bit more
good,"A growing company,  with an international brand. If you can thrive in an environment where people depend on your attention to detail and efficiency, then this is the position for you."
good,Let customers talk to you however they want. Not good pay for very hard work but great opportunities to promote if you would like more money. Great benefits and tuition reimbursement.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun, but challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the regular customers. You really feel responsible for developing a community within the community. However, the technical aspects of being a barista can be more challenging than one would expect."
good,"The environment was that of a typical fast food place. This is a great place to work if you are in school and possibly have a second job or are not financially independent. However, I would not recommend anyone to make this their only source of income, as it is very hard to get more than 20 hours per week."
good,starbucks is a great work environment with numerous benefits. Everyday is a fun day a work. majority of managers are very accommodating and work with your scheduling needs.
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks! I would go back and work there again if the position opened! It was a fun job and the hours passed fast because you are always busy.
good,"Depending on the foot traffic of the store location, I worked at a busy location so sometimes you wouldn't feel 8 hours go by. Everyone is constantly active and always have something to do. Customers can emotionally drain you, some customers are unfriendly and rude and will try to take their anger out on you. Staff can sometimes feel pressured due to customers wanting their drinks made quickly. Mobil orders and cafe orders build up and can get a little hectic."
good,"The work is fast paced depending where you work, so it's never really a dull moment especially with a dynamic team. The benefits are good, but the pay we get for making all those drinks + weekly tips feels underwhelming for a job like this."
good,"When working for Starbucks, I can say that it was a very fun and fast pasted environment. When going into work each day, was explained what the day may entail, and what my responsibilities where for that day, like most fast food places. I of course learned how to make coffee with the espresso machines, but also learned more on customer connections and interacting with the customers."
good,"Starbucks was awesome to work for, you learn a lot about coffee and the customers. i built great relationships with customers as well as my fellow employees. however my self and my assistant manager did not get along at all so i quit. "
good,Working as a barista is fun yet very stressful. At times I would feel like the work I was putting into the job was way too much for just a minimum wage paying job. A great first job or career with amazing benefits. Also very helpful if you relocate because you never are out of a job.
good,"Starbucks is a terrific employer, they truly walk the talk interns of culture.  Keeping it very simple we actively make peoples day one coffee at a time."
good,Starbucks is fun at the beginning but once you’re a full team member the manager expects you to have work as your number one priority and my manager did not let me get shifts covered. Learning drinks and keeping up store decorations is plenty of fun though
good,"Starbucks is coffee but it should be promoted as fast food. The Labor is not intensive, its indoors and air conditioned, but work flow is constant. One shift can be hours at a time in constant endless motion of steaming milk and queuing shots, to blanding frappuccinos and shaking teas. it can become very mentally frying. schedules are very flexible, and it is very simple to pick up shifts"
good,Good management at the location I worked at. Fun environment. Learned continuously about different kinds of coffee and brewing methods. Good training and benefits for working part time.
good,"Sendo uma empresa de comércio seu dia é comum como em qualquer fast food.Apenas o púbico muda em determinadas lojas, o que te ajuda a aprender a lidar com a variedade de público. Oferece também um planejamento de carreira bom e bem visto no mercado. A empresa apenas peca em escolha de alguns gerentes e diretos, eles acabam esquecendo a missão da empresa e desmotivam os funcionários que não estiverem preparados.A cultura herdada da própria empresa de lá de fora, é muito boa, mas não é seguida por todos. A parte mais difícil é quando a falta de tato com as palavras, vindo da gerência, acaba desestimulando toda a equipe. A parte mais agradável é o treinamento bem dado pelo pessoal de SP."
good,"Starbucks can be a high stress job. I'm pretty relaxed in most situations, but starbucks is really only for a certain type of person. It's almost always busy (which can be good), you are frequently understaffed because there isn't a whole lot of accountability for people calling out, and customers are usually pretty harsh. With all that being said, Starbuck's as a company is really great and they try their best to compensate for okay wages with really awesome benefits. Free coffee, free spotify, 401k and stock grants as well as really awesome insurance benefits with low-costs help to balance out the ""difficulty"" of the job itself."
good,"I've worked for Starbucks for three years and for the past three years i have gained a lot of knowledge of coffee history, learned about coffee I've never knew about, and my connections with customer has increased dramatically. I learned how to understand customers needs and being able to make their day right with just a cup of Starbucks coffee makes me happy. Everyday at my drive thru Starbucks is a new experience, We are a high volume store, so that means that when my team members and I open up the store for the day, I have to make sure that we are following food regulations, my bar is prepared and ready for action, and making sure that the espresso machine is functioning normally. Working at Starbucks is a great experience and a perfect place for those who are looking for a flexible job. For a while I worked two jobs at once and Starbucks was able to work around my schedule as well as my school schedules. Definitely recommend working at Starbucks to learn how to connect with customers and to gain more knowledge of the Siren and her coffee."
good,"I love what I do at Starbucks. The company itself is great, the partners I have worked with have been all in all amazing. My favorite thing about my job is forming the customer connections, learning names, people, and becoming a part of their everyday life. Something where they love to see you and you love to see them. All in all I’ve had a wonderful time working for Starbucks."
good,"Great place to work at if you want work experience and growth, working with coworkers and creating relationships with them as well as the customers, Starbucks gave me the skills I needed to advance myself into the supervisor role."
good,"Workplace was both relaxed and quick paced. Learned how to make all beverages quickly. Team members were welcoming, fun to work with, and easy to get along with. We are usually low on inventory, which upsets the customers, however, we offer alternative options on beverages or pastry items that are in stock that are similar to what the customer wants. Hours are flexible. We are not paid time and a half on holidays."
good,"Es war nie wie der Tag davor, man hat immer was neues erlebt und was neues gelernt."
good,"The typical day at Starbucks would start with asking the shift manager for the position you're taking on the clock being: customer support, bar, order support, or register."
good,"really fun job, theres always something to do so its easy to keep busy, great co-workers that are super fun to work with, get to create and experiment with different drink flavors"
good,"Great place to work, visibility in teams, healthy work life balance. Company is going through restructuring so things are a little unsettled with positions/processes."
good,My Review On Starbucks is that I like working there. I wasn’t stress I enjoyed making coffee and interacting with my customers. Also I was reliable and made a great connection with my coworkers. I even made the best connection with my customers while on making their drinks and interacting with them at the same time
good,"Fantastic place to work for the benefits provided.  However, if you are looking for a place with consistently new and challenging tasks, it may get dull after a while.  Chance for advancement is slim, especially once you get past becoming a shift supervisor."
good,Busy / can be stressful work environment .  Costumer service is always a priority .  I would recommend this job if youre a quick thiner / fast on your feet .
good,"-overall could be amazing"
good,"It's basically the McDonalds of coffee. I've been here for some time and their attention to detail with drink quality is lacking. But the company culture and attention to customers is great. Room for advancement is mostly political, I've been fortunate but I've seen many people not be so lucky."
good,"Very great work environment, great benefits!!! Amazing team members. The only thing I would suggest if you are working there, is to be patient with customers who are greedy and rude."
good,"Fast paced environment, sometimes can be stressful dealing with customer situations. Starbucks is all about making every  moment right for customers which can be difficult when dealing with customers who are scamming or taking advantage.  The benefits are okay, not great but when you're a college student it works. The hours are flexible however they tend to cut hours alot and claim we dont have the labor for it so you find yourself working short staffed most of the time."
good,"Fun place to work. Lots of interaction with people, and new drinks to learn consistently.  Pretty low wages, but there is health insurance and 401k. Great culture."
good,Good for short term only not enough hours. The company overall was good but they could not provide enough hours to continue working there. Good for students.
good,Starbucks is great whether its a temp in your career or Full time advancement. They provide awesome benefits that every employees receives (full time or part time). I don't believe they pay enough for the amount of work and sometimes stress you deal/do with (depending on if your store is super busy). The environment is great. Benefits great. Pay not so great.
good,"I worked at Starbucks because I wanted to, not because I had to - one of the best decisions I've ever made. I had a fantastic team to work with and friendly regular customers. However, compensation (non-negotiable) was fairly low and difficult to live on, given cost-of-living in my area (even with the regional adjustment)."
good,This Starbucks is a great place to work fro students as it is flexible times and closes early. The staff is great and management too. The staff and management is always easy to talk to and easy going. The only complaint would be that some of the Safeway cashier try to tell you how to do your job
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Starbucks. The people I worked with were fun, the hours were flexible for me as a full-time student, and I got free coffee. I gained many skills in customer service, time-management, and organization. A great first job."
good,"I personally loved working for starbucks, the environment was relaxed and if there was a rush everyone pulled together and helped each other out. The management crew were always extremely understanding and helpful."
good,I enjoyed my time there and like the uniqueness and diversity but hated the management and I felt like the advancement opportunities were run based on favoritism.
good,"I work for a licensed store in a hotel, but applied for Starbucks because I wanted the benefits, which I don't get here. I heard they're a great company to work for!"
good,it was pleasent to work here the new faces was very nice meeting all the new people and helping them find out what kind of day they are having . i love helpimg pople and hearing about there days
good,Throughout my time at Starbucks i felt more pressure to be smiling and welcoming and less to be productive and skilled at the craft i enjoyed. Other rhan that I enjoyed the environment and culture of the business itself which kept me for my time there.
good,"If you are looking to move up, it gets difficult to make the jump from shift supervisor to assistant manager (which is just a manager in training at Starbucks)."
good,I work at a Starbucks in Harris teeter. I love the company and what it stands for with its employees. The management is very poor though and you often end up working by yourself all day.
good,"The company is fabulous, they have plenty of perks and benefits and if I could've grown with the company more so I would have loved to do so. But unfortunately, I felt that the manager placed at the location I worked at shouldn't have been given that position due to the lack of human compassion and the highschool drama mentality."
good,I would and have recommended people to work for the Starbucks company. Most of the guests and team members are pleasant to work with. I enjoyed working for Starbucks.
good,They have many opportunities to grow and move up in the company. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. The job has great benefits and cares a lot about their employees.
good,"A typical day at star bucks is fast pace, filled with lots of customer interactions. The people i work with are great and love their jobs. "
good,"Job overall is okay, benefits would be relaxed co-workers, free food, free coffee, free Spotify. Can get hectic at times during peak hours. Really nice customers at times."
good,"Its a great place to work, especially with all the perks and benefits. However, the store environment depends on the Store Manager and District Managers. Depending on the skill level of your District Manager, the expectations can go from achievable or impossible. Same can be said about Store Managers. "
good,"Great place to work for persons new to work life, especially students. Good pay and hours, but can be vigorous, fast paced environment at times depending on location."
good,Starbucks has allowed me to balance home and work life. They offer benefits and college tuition for employees. The fun and laid back attitude of fellow employees and customers alike make it a great place to work for.
good,"It's a fun place to work! Pay isn't the selling point at this place, but Starbucks offer great benefits for their employees. If you need experience it's a great starting point."
good,"This position contributes to Starbucks success by providing legendary customer service to all customers. This job creates the Starbucks Experience for our customers by providing customers with prompt service, quality beverages and products, and maintaining a clean and comfortable store environment. Models and acts in accordance with Starbucks guiding principles."
good,Starbucks was one of the recent jobs that I enjoyed. I enjoyed making drinks and the environment. I really liked the customers knowing my name and vice versa. I also liked knowing what the customer wanted even before they came to the register.
good,Starbucks is a place of high volume very intense and demanding work but satisfactory. While working here i have learned and gained an appreciation for coffee makers as well as the art of brewing and serving various types of coffee and espresso.
good,Starbucks offers great benefits. Ideal for someone who works well in a fast paced environment with little or no supervision. Company will train employees.
good,Overall great company to work for. There tend to be a lot of silly regulations that effect your desire to move up on the chain of command. However it was a great job to have while in highschool/college. Very flexible work schedule
good,"Starbucks has been a joy while working there. It's a fast pace environment, everyone has to work together and communicate. I've learned to multitask more than I was used to. You learn what needs to come first and what can wait. All the employees are helpful and understanding and make work more enjoyable."
good,The environment was productive and fun. It was very fat paced at moments and then relaxed at other moments. The managers were very cooperative and willing to help.
good,"Is a good company where employees are not only count as employees but also as family. It could be stressful at times but what job isn't at times?"
good,I thought it was a good part time job alongside my studies. Good management and fun place to work and meet people daily. I would recommend this company to people looking for part time fun work.
good,"Too many managers and top heavy."
good,"Starbucks is a good ""for now"" job that you do while working towards a career elsewhere. I worked at Starbucks for four years and I'm glad that I did because this work experience did help me grow professionally. I had the opportunity to advance to a shift supervisor and experience a little bit of the management side of the company. There are a lot of things that I really liked about starbucks and some things that I didn't. The company has done some really good things for its employees, such as college tuition reimbursement. However, I believe that the industry is becoming less customer oriented and more money oriented. The mission ""to inspire and nurture the human spirit-one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time"" is becoming a vague remembrance of what Starbucks used to stand for. The once customer focused practice is quickly becoming a fast food style, quick paced practice that is concerned only with increasing profits rather than nurturing the human spirit."
good,Star bucks was a fast pace and a fun part time job. I enjoyed my time there and of course the free coffee. The benefits are what make this company great.
good,"Having worked here for several years, I've seen different management styles. If you work here, you're manager can try to micromanage, be just right or largely ineffectual. Communicate with your team over the day to make sure you are on the same page. Its very frequent to be understaffed on weekends especially if someone calls in sick. Customers and coworkers can be the best part of the job."
good,"Super busy location especially when there is a happy hour special in place. The crew is fun and the regulars can be too. This location needs to be remodeled already, they have outgrown the space provided and there is no room for storage"
good,"I loved working for this company. The job was fast paced, which i loved. I would have continued to work there, but they were not offiliated with the actual company, therefore when a school semester ended so did your job."
good,"This job was exciting,. You work with students, teachers, and staff. Everyone is always upbeat and cheerful. Its a relaxing and great place to be employed."
good,"Enjoyable team centered atmosphere. Well managed with good benefits, especially if you love coffee! "
good,"une journée de travaille très intense "
good,Can be fun with the right team members and management.Otherwise it can be chaos and stressful. Just depends on your team.  Job is simple but does require you to remember beverage recipes.  It seems like a lot but its easy once you get the hang of it.
good,"A typical day at work is high energy and quick paced, definitely not for the faint of heart. I have learned so much about customer service because starbucks is essentially a fast food chain. I have enjoyed so much working with and meeting my coworkers. Starbucks is a no judgement zone and the people you work with quickly become family. The hardest part is the first few weeks, but with the help of coworkers it gets easier."
good,"A typical day of work at Starbucks consists of angry customers and unmotivated staff. Of course not everyone is like that but for me that's what it felt like. I learned making drinks is a lot of fun and interacting with the customers at the register is awesome but sometimes things can go sideways. Most of the time everything goes smoothly until a specific person gets on the floor or a customer throws a fit about a drink that a barista didn't make perfectly. For the first year the job in general is enjoyable but after that it becomes tedious if you don't get a supervisor position or get transferred to another store. The management at my store was great, they were the nicest two managers I've had, and also the only two, no flaws there. In terms of culture though I find it to be lacking in many places, really the only main focus is selling coffee, making coffee and talking about coffee."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, and am actually hoping to get hired again.  Although I don't enjoy the always shifting work schedule week to week (which always takes a toll on you physically after while), there are a number of great things about working for this company.  It's one of the few companies I've worked for that actually has integrity and treats their people well.  You do get health insurance at about 20 hours/wk, and now they have a really great program for college tuition.  A typical day is very fast-paced, keeping up with cleanup, customers, restocking, etc. But it was also one of the only places that literally told me that I could take paid 15 min breaks."
good,"It was a decent experience, despite having to go through at least 3 manager so far in my time here. The coworkers are awesome but some of the customers are a bit insufferable."
good,"My Over All Review Of Starbucks Is Pretty Decent , I Just Been Working There For 3 Yrs , The Customers Are Some What Nice & Some Customers Love To Have Conversations"
good,"Some problems with the management that made many employees uncomfortable (unbalanced schedules,swearing) but overall okay (discounts,fellow employees,etc."
good,"Working for Starbucks for this long has given me a unique perspective."
good,Working with Starbucks Coffee Co. Is a great starting job for young people wanting to get into the customer service industry. It currently accepts applications of those 16 and Older
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks is very intense, mostly a fast pace environment. There is always something to do. "
good,"You should kind of know what you're getting into with Starbucks. Your experience will depend on your store, if it has a good staff and a good manager, things should be relatively smooth sailing. If your store is dysfunctional, it might be a pain because you will be picking up the slack of those who aren't performing. "
good,"Management was amazing. I have never had a manager like I had at starbucks. It is heartbreaking that they are shutting down and I will no longer have her as a manger again, It was such a great job and an amazing opportunity for m family."
good,This is a nice job while in school. Those trying to make it a career will find it takes a toll on their mental health. High stress at all times. Pay is rarely worth the hassle.
good,"Although a sense of community lies within the coffee shop, the opportunity for advancement is a slow process even with a degree in business. Timelines are made infinite and movement laterally is futile."
good,Working at Starbucks is fu but can become stressful at times. Must be able to multitask and not get easily frantic. A great way to work in customer service.
good,Well picked and wonderful support help to drive a customer focused culture and environment. All messages are consistent regardless of who is planning/supervising locations.
good,Very great and positive atmosphere. You get to interact with others whether it’s a conversation or a simple hello what can I get started for you. You have tasks to complete and it feels  great when tasks are completed.
good,"Nice easy pace. Cool ,calm and collected"
good,"Training for Starbucks is rigorous, but working there full time takes a lot of nerve and stubbornness. It isn't for everyone, but If you are able to handle the stress then you will have a lot of fun working here, and you will learn many life skills that you were unaware you needed"
good,Target Starbucks is a good place to work but there is not much room for development. Target promotes internally but AST has no pay raise even though it comes with a lot more responsibility than Barista. We also weren't allowed to accept tips.
good,it was a fun place to work and it was also a fast pace environment when very busy.  everybody usually worked good together and help  in every way possible
good,"Honestly I really appreciate the company values. I think this job is great if you're just starting out or if you need an extra paycheck to make ends meet. You just have to be willing to work and try to understand that it is an everyday process of learning and maintaining the third place environment that we try to create. There are some management problems overall, however if you have a set schedule to give that is fine. It would be a great idea to go into the store you want to work in and just watch the business. See the long lines that are inevitable, watch how the partners handle themselves and the customers. Don't panic it's not difficult it's just sometimes fast paced with a lot of information."
good,Be prepared to deal with many customers who expect superhuman efforts and timeliness to the point of absurdity. Your coworkers will quickly become a family.
good,Starbucks delivers on its benefits plan however does not compensate its workers for the ever increasing amount of work a single human must do as hours are cut and labor matrixes tighten and productivity goals slope ever higher.
good,Starbucks was a great place to work for while in highschool. Starbucks was also know for paying for schooling through them was also great! I didnt like sharing hard earned tips throughout the day just to get them at the end of the week that was kinda hard cause that help with gas getting to work through the hard days. But over all i would work here again. Stressfull during holiday if your not head strong and outgoing you wont make it in this business. Very competitive but also fun and great vibes while working makes thebshift go by fast!
good,"Starbucks was one of my favorite places to work. Though as the years went on it became a lot more political, and didn't follow through on their commitments to the environment which was slightly frustrating to me. "
good,Fast pasted environment.  Great coworkers.  Management was not the best.  They hire from within so you can grow with the company. Typical day for me was working the drive thru.  Learned how to make great coffee and how to multitask.  The hardest part of my job was when we would be extremely busy and customers did not understand there may be a wait.  The best part was my coworkers.  They made each shift great.
good,"As I joined the workplace with no previous experience in the workplace, nor at making beverages, they were patient in training me everything from till management, beverage making, preparing food and customer service. "
good,It was quick paste and alot of team work. It's a very great place to work if you're a people person and if you love coffee this place is great for you.
good,"It was a great working environment if you have a good team to work with. Management varies store to store but otherwise, it was a good part time job as it was flexible."
good,My last two managers at Starbucks got fired so i have had a bad experience with poor management but customer connection and the comfortable atmosphere in general made it fun and something to look forward too coming into work.
good,"The benefits are what caused me to apply at Starbucks. They offer benefits to part time employees. You get the chance to go to college if you don't already have a degree. This is paid for by Starbucks. You also get medical, dental, and vision for great rates. For employees, Spotify Premium is free. These are just some of the great benefits."
good,"Food/beverage prep"
good,Enjoyed my employment with the Starbuck Team. Territory got much larger over time. So much so that I was spending seventy five percent of my time traveling.
good,"super fast pace work environment, you move up quickly though."
good,"Depending on day, you could have a blast working there or you could have a very bad day. Hardest part of the job can be customers but you definitely learn how you can make most customers happy. and 99% of the regulars that come in can really  make your day brighter. Money is pretty good and once you get used to the Starbucks lingo it can be a lot of fun to work there."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. The benefits are more than what one would expect from a part-time barista job, although the pay is minimum wage. I've had the benefit of working with some wonderful, down to earth people. Management is understanding and quite friendly. Being a Starbucks Barista challenged me to become comfortable engaging in conversation, and building relationships with people I didn't know. That part was both the hardest, and most enjoyable aspect of my experience as a Starbucks Barista."
good,Nice job to work at friendly staff just do your work and time fly by pretty fast lean new things here some of the workers do to much but everything is fine if you stay to yourself
good,"Overall, working at Starbucks helped me develop my customer service skills to the point of excellence and taught me how to deal in a high stress, fast paced work environment."
good,"It wasn't a perfect workplace, but where is?  I learned a lot, met a ton of great people and improved myself while working here.  If I could have stayed, I would have."
good,Let's say you been working at Starbucks and everyone is pretty chill and fun to interact than suddenly you get slammed by a rush of people. Its a fun place but sometimes it gets too boring that I just don't want to do repetitive things on the job. Here in Tampa the manager are horible
good,Bonnes conditions de travail. C'est une école solide pour améliorer ses talents de gestionnaire. Mauvaises expériences du upper management et stress inutile constant.
good,"Learned a lot from being with Starbucks for 5 years. Time management, working with others, and how to approach someone with confidence and optimism. Great first job"
good,Starbucks really prepared me for getting out into the real world. I learned so much from my time there! I just wish there was more push to promote from within instead of finding outside hires.
good,great place to work with great benefits. the environment is what you make of it. Most starbuck's are pretty chilled out though. cant go wrong with working at starbucks especially after the fact that they offer you stock in the compnay after working with them for 6 months
good,It isnt the best at providing very dependable hours or getting you in to begin with. The hours you end up with were sometimes one 4 hrs and  they aren't consistent.
good,"It was a good company, at the time.  Lots of benefits, but nepotism is a general practice, and certain policies made little to no sense.  Overall, in ways I miss working there, and I would probably be running a store if I stayed."
good,The typical work day was very busy in the morning and afternoons. I learned to make drinks and how to handle customers. The people are helpful. The hardest part is memorizing how to make all of the drinks. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with drink options and telling them all of the most popular drinks to help make their decisions easier.
good,"Keep head down, and definatly don't stay as long as I have. 18 years is waaaaaay too long. It began, as a great place to work. But it turned into that place with fire and brimstone on Earth."
good,"Starbucks invests in its workers in so many broad ways, and usually pays them competitively from market to market. It tends to attract the best talent, although premium coffee die-hards will tend to still work in some smaller coffee shops. "
good,"Great benefits for partners. Overtime has to be approved by the district manager. Good for a short term job or retirement. I enjoyed working with my partners and definitely had a fun time. However, if you get a manager that is negative, it wears you out. Labor is terrible so it makes the job more stressful than it should be."
good,"The pay for a starbucks in target is a lot better than an actual store."
good,I will always value my time spent working at starbucks. While working there spending each day with the regular customers made the experience great. You learned all about them and made life long friends as you worked each day making it fun to come into work.
good,I enjoyed working there and hope I can fall back on that job if needed in the future. I was moved through 3 different Starbucks and I wasn't a fan of that but never had a bad experience.
good,You Make coffee very fast paced lots of stress I worked alone some of the time but the more experienced you get the more you will woke alone theirs long stretches of doing nothing fallowed by lot of work
good,Making beverages or preparing food. Cleaning during downtime. Maintaining proper communication with the supervisor or manager to ensure stock is readily available.
good,"It was a great place to work."
good,"Fairly decent job with a great team and culture within the workplace, some days can be fairly stressful like any job but for the most part the benefits outweigh the negatives. A great job to have part-time if you need consistent hours whilst either studying or pursuing other things."
good,"A typical day at work is very productive, I am constantly doing something whether it's helping a guest, making beverages, cleaning up my work area, or restocking all necessities. By working at Starbucks I have learned to love and appreciate coffee/espresso. My manager at the Starbucks was a great manager. He was always motivating us to do better and constantly applauding us for all our hard work. I believe he definitely made me feel appreciated and made working as a barista worth it. The hardest part of the job were times when certain machines were out of order or certain products were out of stock and I would have to apologize to the guest. I dislike having to let down a guest especially if they came into the store already knowing and anticipating what they wanted. The most enjoyable part was being able to make someone's day, coffee prepared just right is a great way to make someone very happy."
good,"starbucks taught me alot, and I'm grateful for the experience."
good,"It was a great place to work, was flexible with my schedule, had great benefits, and taught me a lot about customer service, coffee, and getting a good workflow."
good,"The store that I worked at had a manager that was a little to obsessed with the ""numbers"" and made the scheduling unfair. But overall, the job allows a lot of room for growth and individuality. The environment of workplace is typically fun, and company keeps you involved and updated with any changes."
good,I worked at the on campus Starbucks in Glendale which is far from the Tempe campus. I loved the environment and getting the hands on experience the main issue I had was the commute which got to be too hard!
good,"Starbucks overall is a great company to work for, there's opportunities to move up, healthcare benefits, competitive pay, and best of all a flexible schedule especially for students and its so easy to get a shift covered if needed in your region. I learned how to deal with customers and any issues that may have occurred, and developed multi-managing skills."
good,"It is a great job, especially if you are looking for something to keep you moving. The environment is great, there are benefits and discounts that make the job even better. People are typically in and out, so connections don't form unless they're a regular. Management has been wonderful so far."
good,"The hire ups are basically useless when it comes to assisting you in anyway. 2 managers in a row refused to listen to my schedule needs.  The crews I worked with however were steller. Amazing baristas and Shifts who felt like family. Showing genuine concern about my health and well being after a miscarriage while the manager scoffed and gave me a final notice despite my doctors note telling me not to work."
good,"Employees would create a variety of different drinks, to the customers satisfaction.  We would handle cash and card payments, work efficiently and quickly, as well as maintain a clean and safe work environment."
good,I miss working at starbucks as the environment and work itself were quick paced and collaborative which I enjoyed. Starbucks was one of my favorite jobs and I could see myself reapplying in the future.
good,"Although I made one mistake that got me terminated (with 0 prior write ups) , I still enjoyed working there. I made decent money, had insurance and worked hard at what I did. Coffee was a great way to connect w/people and it was a blast. I was devastated when I was let go."
good,"It was fun working as a Barista on Starbuck because i doesnt feel like work at all. It always feel like home every time you're on the job. The typical day at Starbucks would be you go to work in your uniform and get excited when customers get inside your store and order drinks. I learned so may things in Starbucks like improving my honesty and integrity. The management and workplace culture was great as well, i enjoyed every moment of my stay at Starbucks. Lastly, for me the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job would be the same. You just need to love your job for you to enoy every part of it."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks could of either gone great or stressful. Rush hours were difficult and took a long time to get used to. Workplace culture was really respectable though, and all workers were respectful, kind, and helpful. Management lacked at the specific store I was located at but still was decent. The most difficult part of the job was just specific challenges in customer service with unhappy customers or issues with items sold."
good,Everyone worked well as a team and there was a fun atmosphere around work and made friends for life working here. There was staff discount available on all products
good,"I spent nearly 17 years working with and for Starbucks, with a short time separating long employment."
good,"Although the company felt very corporate, and I didn't like the ""starbucks speak"" they wanted you to use which never felt natural. Otherwise, They invest in employees and create a good work environment. I felt that they were genuine with their efforts and followed through to create a great working environment and culture for their employees. Morale was always pretty good."
good,"Os dias de trabalhos são agitados, dinâmicos;"
good,"Friendly atmosphere , Very fast paced which I particularly  liked . Learned a lot about coffee & kind became a coffee person due to the fact that they make you taste all their coffee"
good,Overall Starbucks is a great company with a great benefit package. Its more for the typical college student who wants some extra cash while they're on a school break.
good,It can be a  face paced job depending on your location. they have amazing benefits if you take advantage of them. The benefits make up for the hourly wage.
good,"Overall, the people that work at Starbucks tend to be friendly outgoing people and that's a plus. The work environment can be very stressful, though, depending on which shift you work and the area you're in."
good,"My time with starbucks was more than just a job. I met my adopted family at Starbucks, I fell in love at Starbucks. It will always hold a special place in my heart."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to get your first job at. They teach many skills that other employers look for such as: How to run a cash register, how to build a relationship with the customer, and how to effectively work in a face-paced environment."
good,The company itself provides a lot of perks as well as benefits. The environment completely depends on the people you work with. It can really make or break your experience working there.  Other than that you also have the chance to go to school with Starbucks as well. I had really cool regulars that I loved seeing everyday and I was sad to leave but I needed change and I needed to work on my career
good,I learned a lot and it was a very good job for me as I went through my college experience.  I would recommend for someone who needs flexibility but not necessarily a full time job for sustainability.
good,"Great culture, easy going and well managed. Good place to work for people just starting out part-time. Good place to learn customer service skills. Great first job."
good,"This job is super faded paced, very tight quarters so there is no personal space, and can be pretty high stress. But hey, you get a lot of free coffee haha."
good,"When the mission is followed, the stores grow tremendously. This company has provided me with countless networking opportunities, life long friends, and career advancement."
good,"Starbucks has its limits , I started this job at 9 dollars an hour and was given the option to have full time benefits while being part time . The job is stressful but at certain times. I can say the morning is more fast pace and night is more cleaning but you barely get time to lean . Many people work only for the benefits . I'm less ur a manager I don't think this job is one to depend on for a living"
good,"Typical job, not too stressful and not too successful, fun at time yet customers can be a real downer. Always very structured and step based job, not much leeway to be innovative and creative based on who you serve, all cookie cutter."
good,"Atarbucks has been apart of my life for many years and being a partner is such an amazing experience, the great atmosphere, the love of your team and guest, getting to interact with so many different people in fun and creative ways."
good,"great team spirit, made lots of hard working friends, and had a fantastic time when i was there. gave me experience, made a big effort with customer service and was able to bring in second service, up sale. Provided the training that i needed."
good,A lot of multi-tasking. Learned how to work time management and to also work under pressure.The Culture is great there. The hardest part  was the amount of tasks that needed to be done within one shift. The most enjoyable part was being able to make drinks and work on the bar.
good,"I worked here while in college. It paid more than other food-industry jobs, but it also demanded a lot. I often had to be willing to cover others' shifts just to keep enough hours. However, that flexibility was helpful when it was Finals week at the end of semesters. "
good,"Day and night shifts are completely different."
good,"I had a great team, was in a decent location, and like any front facing/customer service job, there was a fair share of a**holes that would come in, but for the most part, customers loved us and our team."
good,"Unfortunately, most closing crew members seem to be in agreement that it's much harder to gain recognition for efforts at night, with no management around. However, I have enjoyed working with nearly every partner at my store, and we have cultivated a real sense of home and family together."
good,"Destaco solamente la flexibilidad de horarios, el resto depende de cada local y el personal."
good,"Competitive atmosphere, but people are willing to help. Learned a lot about the importance of a professional atmosphere, it was lacking in some of the stores I covered at."
good,"Being a barista is a typical everyday task; But, with the heavy flow of customers it can be draining at points. An emotional and mental break is needed"
good,"Can be understaffed at certain hours, besides that it's fun. Takes a long time to be trained on bar but there are other positions you can do while being trained"
good,"It was a great place to work especially if you're in school. It is a laid back, but quick paced work environment. Management and staff was excellent as well. However, it's hard to get enough hours let alone a 40 hour work week. Must be willing to multitask in a quick paced environment."
good,The company cares about its employees and provides a good amount of training. Fast paced environment where you will earn your money. Excellent company for students looking for income while attending school.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are a college student, or somebody who is juggling multiple different jobs. The schedule flexibility is something that I really appreciated during my time there. Always be wary of the management though (this is applicable anywhere you go, really). Lack of management skill and caring is what ultimately led me to leave this company. "
good,"You can expect a fast paced environment, some customers can be very demanding, and other coworkers can be unreliable but that is typical for a job like this. The pay is good for someone starting out, benefits are available and there are plenty of opportunities to move up and to continue education."
good,The daily work in each role relayed on the continuity of structured tasks. It was the responsibility of each partner to provide excellent customer service while delivering a quality product efficiently and consistently. Anticipating the customer's needs while maintaining the demands of the unexpected variables was the most challenging part of the job. I learned how to be flexible in order to adapt to changes.I thoroughly enjoyed the partners I worked with and the regulars who became a part of my every day.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you can handle it. Stress and urgency varies greatly from store to store and the management does too. my first manager was a train wreck but our new one is awesome. Starbucks offers great low cost benefits.
good,"Starbucks does provide great benefits even for those who work only 20 hours a week (stocks, insurance, etc.), but if your store is high-volume, it can be incredibly overwhelming and demanding. This can become even more stressful if not all of your coworkers put in the same effort or your managers are tough to work with. It can be flexible to anyone's schedule and the pay raises can be beneficial, but the stress may not be suitable for all. But when you have coworkers that you enjoy, and have a fast-paced environment to keep you going, it makes the job well worth it."
good,"It can get on your skin real fast, but it's a great way to start off going in to the adult life and getting used to a job and some basic responsibilities. If anything it builds character, by a large margain"
good,fun work place and learning alot about coffee and espresso and alot other things. learning alot from co workers and work well as a team and rotate positions
good,I enjoyed my job as a Barista. I love interacting and getting to know my customers and co-workers. The coffee culture is very interesting and I love preparing beverages of quality. I would like to see the wage of the job increase. I needed to find new employment only because I could not afford to pay my bills on $10 per hour.
good,"Shifts are not long at all and is easy to balance a work life and college. Sadly if you cannot keep up with business you'll be quickly overwhelmed, over time multiple new hires just up and quit mid shift. Benefits and pay are relatively equal to amount of work, and raises are know to come."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for that generally does a good job of taking care of their employees. Been going through some bumps recently with slowing US comp sales. This has been affecting the at work environment a little negatively due to constant pressure to deliver results and increasing threat of G&A cuts.
good,"Days can be challenging, but there can be rewarding moments. It is helpful to have a team to rely on and have fun with. Not all stores have great managers who are dedicated to their partner's growth."
good,Great place to work if you like a fast paced environment.  Lots of room for growth and the benefits are amazing.  The training is good but there is a lot to learn so some work on your own is generally the norm.  Free lunch and beverages while you are working and the hours are generally flexible which is great for college students and those who want part time work and have limited availability.
good,"If you were closing it would be slow compared to the opening shifts but that also depend on the current show times and what was going on in the casino. If you were opening you came in knowing that it would be a fast paced and busy day, and it was some of the best work I have done because of how fast it was and the environment that was made there."
good,Over the last few years of working with Starbucks I have made some of the closest friends of my life. I wouldn't have wanted to work anywhere else. It's very stressful at times but I thrive under pressure.
good,"Working at starbucks requires a lot of physical work, and it's really easy to mess up the job. The problem I had with the management there was that I had tests, and homework -- but late night hours which wasn't really working out for me."
good,"Typical day at work is to make sure everything is in place, fresh milk,clean lobby, clean bathroom, and make sure every food and milk was day dotted."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks because of my coworkers. It was fun, fast paced, can be stressful but the time goes by fast. You must be able to prioritize and multi task."
good,Like most jobs it can be pretty good or pretty bad depending on who you report to. Customer service of the nature at Starbucks can be rewarding and also very challenging.
good,"Each store i have worked at had a tight knit family bond amongst its partners. I found it difficult to fit in coming into a new store in a supervisory role, I made my way thru it and learned a lot about my role as a supervisor. I have never found a company more flexible with rewarding benefits."
good,"Starbucks is fast paced but doesn't have a lot of pressure on you. From my experience, the job has been chill even with the work. Got to meet awesome people as well as worked with awesome co-workers."
good,Great place to work. Fun to meet and get to know new people every day. Management will be the reason you truly enjoy working at your store or not.  Good management makes the biggest difference.
good,"98% of the people I come across in any setting at starbucks is always kind and eager to have a conversation. The 2% outliers consist of gruff customers who are often just having a bad day. I like the collaborative environment where everyone wants to work together as opposed to casting blame on others. I enjoy that everyone knows how to do everyone else's job as well, and we often switch out our roles and positions if need be."
good,"Starbucks was a very fun place to work when you know what you're doing. At first, it can seen pretty overwhelming having to learn all of the drinks, having regular customers expect you to know their orders, and working in such a close quarters environment. But, it gets better! When you figure out what you're doing and which position you're best at, it makes it a lot easier."
good,"Even though the company has certain policies in place, it depends on your manager. I had a great one when I started and my current manager ignores our time off requests and doesn't teach us anything."
good,"Starbucks fue una gran experiencia para mi persona, aprendí mucho de la empresa y de mis colegas de trabajo."
good,"Management was probably the worst I've ever had. Never posted the schedule in advance. The store manager was never in the store, he barely actually did work."
good,"good job to bridge gap, worked while in college..pretty decent pay along with tips. Variety of tasks to complete...don't work here if you cant remember recipes or crack under pressure"
good,"Starbucks, my store specifically, is a fast-paced environment which relies heavily on the collaborative efforts of management and partners. While I cannot speak for other stores, my store experience has been exceptional due to the coworkers that make me enjoy the work more than anything. Overall, I enjoy what I do."
good,"Starbucks was by far one of my favorite places to work. The team was very inviting and friendly. The only problem I ever had there was when another coworker was acting inappropriately towards me and saying some very uncomfortable things. I reported it to the store manager and was fired a week after on basis of attendance when I refused to work with that person and requested to transfer to another store. The job can be stressful, due to the fast-paced nature of everything. If you like being busy, then you'll love it as much as I did."
good,Starbucks has a great work culture that incubates diversity and such. This company is great for someone right out of high school and offers paid college tuition. Barista position does not pay to well and your not typically guaranteed to get over 20 hours of work.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. Getting to know the customers and learning the art and history of coffee is the best part. It keeps you busy and the days go by quickly. There are cool perks to working there, such as free drinks, free schooling at ASU online, investment options, and other benefits. However, it is not a place to stay long term, it is a stepping stone to where you want to be. There are few advancement opportunities within the company."
good,I worked in a facility on campus. Our building was always busy but the employees and the managers were always positive and encouraged team work and efficiency. I loved working there.
good,"Starbucks was a decent part time job for students. During my time of employment, they were flexible with my school schedule and needs. However the employees are not compensated for the work load and stress they are put through."
good,"Friendly team which in this area of work it is required to add some enjoyment. Area in growth so work load can be high while getting in support,although feels rewarding to be part of the development. Like most jobs in this area you become award of lots of different aspects as you are interfacing with customers, producing product to say, stock managing, and of course cleaning. So great place while your considering your future plans or in study."
good,"It's fairly fast paced and if you are an opener, it starts super early and the morning rush can be absolutely brutal for someone who is not trained properly or working with an understanding crew. One of my stores had constant fights with each other and another worked in harmony despite the stress of the workplace."
good,"Lærte mye og så mye. Veldig grei arbeidsplass for noen som først starter i arbeidslivet, synd det ikke er tariff"
good,Great benefits even for part time which is great! But it is retail and the hours are long and the caffeine deprived customers are cranky just getting off the interstate!
good,"This is a very fast paced and stressful job. I do not recommend this job for anyone who is looking for full time hours. This is a great PART TIME JOB. Your store manager will usually be pretty flexible with your desired availability. Most people work here for the health benefits, which are fantastic and the main draw for employment here. You are expected by the company to treat customers with ""white glove"" customer service and many regular and long time customers also expect this of you. Even when they are clearly wrong and violating the company's policy, they are always right. Honestly just meet the 20hr a week quota for the benefits and move along, no need to work here longer than that."
good,"Starbucks helped me develop great relationships with a team and taught me to connect with customers. Days were long and hard, trying to balance necessary store management tasks with attentive customer service, and sometimes coming in on your days off to cover a co-worker or coming in early for promotion days. If you wanted to move up in the company, there were many enthusiastic mentors to help you get there, and the benefits were unmatched by most customer service jobs. The atmosphere was very much team oriented, and if there was a good team on the floor, it didn't matter if business was slow or insane, it was manageable with great attitudes and personalities. The hardest part of the job was putting your own emotional needs aside for the sake of customer satisfaction, even if life was getting you down. Smiling and connecting with the customers wasn't always easy, and if a customer started verbally abusing a co-working, it wasn't always easy to refrain from returning in kind instead of *politely* asking the customer to leave. The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie and the artistry of making a fun beverage."
good,Starbucks is an incredibly difficult job that not many people realize when applying. The baristas are in charge of everything in the store and it is a place that praises multitasking as a way of life. The skills learned here are useful in any future job and the flexible hours and benefits make it an ideal first job.
good,"Pretty great job, good benefits, tried to work with my schedule but unfortunately couldn't stay. But everyone was very respectable and kind. Wish i could've learned more about coffee though."
good,"I loved many aspects of working at starbucks.  Management however had many issues.  If you can get past that and possibly not advancing It is wonderful.  The benefits are worth the negative aspects if you take them.  Pay may not be what you hope for, as it is normally around 2 dollars over minimum wage, however the reduced cost insurance and tuition reimbursment make the job worth having."
good,Starbucks was a friendly and diverse environment to work at. They truely care about their customers as well as their employees. I would recommend others to take their shot with them.
good,Fun place to work with if you have the right hard working people to help you out . Management never seemed to stay steady or bad mangers. I loved that we would get in total 3 breaks throughout the day two 15 minute and a 30. That would help de-stress  shift after very busy rushes.
good,"Great collaborative environment, fast paced, but you have the opportunity to learn a lot. It helps to have a supportive manager when you're ready to make a move as it's difficult to get new positions without your manager going to bat for you."
good,"After 11 years with the company I changed my field completely.  It was the right move for me for where my life was at with my family.  Love the company and still tell others to work there.  I appreciate"
good,"The best part of working at Starbucks is having a sense of belonging while at the workplace. There is a big team focus. The mission and the idea is very strong and provides a good backbone to working there on a daily basis. The hard part about working at Starbucks is the disconnect that can occur between your customers and your work environment. When customers have to take a back seat due to time constraints and other work tasks."
good,"Starbucks est une bonne entreprise, les horaires de sont pas toujours faciles, mais l'ambiance dans l'équipe est bonne."
good,"I worked at Starbucks while I was finishing up my Bachelor's degree. They were very flexible with my school hours and the pay was decent for only being part time. They were a great company for customer service expectations and it was a fast paced environment where I was located. "
good,"A lot is expected of Starbucks partners, and the hard work was mostly rewarding, however sometimes it became very grueling and time-consuming even when off the clock. My time here was fun and I made so many friends, but once I left, I felt like I was finally free from a cult. I had no idea that all I talked about in my free time was Starbucks until I hung out with my Starbucks friends post-quitting and realized that Starbucks had once taken over my life. My advice to anyone who wants to apply: do it and have fun, but when you leave after your shift, leave all the store's expectations and drama at the door."
good,"I worked mornings here, usually starting at 5am. Being a barista was a face-pasted position, but working in a team helped. I learned not only how to work with a team, but to work on a till to make sure no money was lost in transaction, as well as counting and reordering inventory. The environment of the store I worked at was very relaxing, despite the pace of the job. The team I worked with was incredible and welcoming, answering any questions I had. The hardest part of the job was getting backlash from impatient customers, in which I handled it in a politely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to find a team that welcomed me and made me feel comfortable."
good,"Even if I came to work in a bad mood, I never left without a smile on my face... Maybe it was all the free coffee but I'm pretty sure its because of all of my fellow partners who collectively created the most mentally healthy work environment I have ever had the chance to experience."
good,Good place to make lifelong friends and to meet new people. Good discounts for working there and hours we okay. Enjoyed the atomosphere and people a lot.
good,The work load can be intense but the atmosphere is rather laid back. Benefits are offered that is above what typical retailers provide even part-time employees. It's a great starting off point for high school and college students to start building work experience and even save for their future retirement. Advancement from within is readily available.
good,A fast paced environment where teams are lead by shift supervisors to achieve daily goals while providing great customer service and quality drinks and food everyday. It can be a fun place where you go and enjoy the atmosphere with friends and family.
good,"Starbucks is a nice place to work, lots of great benefits. I’ve learned how to interact with all kinds of different people. They always push you to do better and very supportive. I love the interactions with customers and being able to get to know them personally."
good,you meet amazing people that show you that the culture in the world is really diverse and shows you what it really means to be a hard worker that deserves their pay
good,"As a member of the management team for the store I was a part of, my daily pace was non-stop. The job was very demanding and it was not always easy to meet corporate expectations. I found success with my team in the end. We were all able to work together to create a great experience for our customers."
good,The atmosphere at starbucks is one of a family orientated. Makes individuals thrive to want to do better and create special bonds not only with coworkers but the customers themselves.
good,Working at Starbucks was fun and time always flew by because of how busy we were. It was fun due to the people you'd work with they became family and though I don't work there anymore I am still in contact with old shift supervisors and staff.
good,The schedule was really nice because it can work into anyone's day to day life. The work becomes so repetitive and mundane that after a while it can be very boring.
good,"Nice atmosphere, fast pace and keeps busy."
good,"very high paced workplace during the morning rush. learned how to make a wide variety of espresso beverages. a typical day at work consisted of me opening the store, stocking the fridge and shelves with products, brewing batches of hot and iced coffee, and handling cash transactions and assisting the other baristas with drinks and food orders."
good,"I enjoyed working with most of the people at my location. It was a smaller location, which would get crowded very easily, especially during promotions (i.e. Unicorn Frappucino). The hardest part of the job is trying to clean everything at the end of the day while servicing customers."
good,從工作中能夠了解每位客人對咖啡的要求，而為他們調製獨有的味道，並為他們創造出第三空間，令客人置身於在家一樣。
good,Employees at this store are hard working.  They are always willing to help others and work hard for not only each other but also for the customers that visit the store.
good,A typical workday includes brewing coffee and making beverages according to customer specifications. I learned how to make a tasty cup of coffee while working here
good,Typical morning you would come in early start brewing tea and coffee.  Make sure all products are still fresh and within their expiration date.  The peaks times for business is from 6-10 and again from 7-9.  Overall an extremely relaxed place to work and very enjoyable
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work part time as a student while earning fair wages and great benefits. However, Starbucks like every company has its ups and downs, its a fast paced environment and relies almost entirely on costumer service skills. The managing staff often acts on favoritism among employees. Yet the workplace culture can be enjoyable as long as employees communicate and work together."
good,"organize baristas"
good,Starbucks is a busy place and requires lots of energy and teamwork each day. Starbucks trains their partners from the ground up with the basics needed to be a quality barista. The hardest part of the job is the super fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free coffee while at work and discounted coffee and other items.
good,"Encouraged a friendly working environment through personalizing interactions between customers and partners.  A typical work day included taking inventory of supplies, proper deployment of staff, and cleaning."
good,The company has a great culture and really promotes an almost familial unit in the stores. Time and stress management are an absolute must. Very organized company overall.
good,"Starbucks is a flexible company to work for and it's easy to have a second job on the side thanks to the early work hours. Monetary compensation is not great, much like other costumer service jobs, but there are plentiful benefits such as healthcare, company perks/discounts, etc."
good,"Starbucks as a company is very into benefits. In a lot of ways, this is a good thing. But it also isn't. If you dont care about free coffee beans and you aren't trying to go back to school, then you dont get a monetary benefit from working at Starbucks. The management often has no clue what goes on in the stores. Although, once you reach Store Manager, you are given a lot more compensation and leeway. The people who you'll work with in store will be some of the best people you'll ever work with."
good,"Starbucks as a corporation to work for is pretty great- that said, I believe most of the experience of a job is with the team you work with. My team was amazing - the crew got along tremendously and while there were parts of the job I didn't love, there always are, with any job. The work was fun, though repetitive. Management was respectful and did their best to help us have a good time at work. Salary wasn't great and tips didn't equate to much, but schedule was mostly flexible."
good,"Was a good place to meet and have fun with not only co workers but customers that came in too. Lots of flexible hours as you could work early mornings, days, nights, weekends."
good,"I truly enjoyed my one year and eight months of working as a barista at Starbucks. It was a terrific job to support myself through the end of high school and the beginning of college. We received awesome benefits such as a free meal mark out, a weekly coffee bean mark out, and unlimited free drinks on the shift! The relationships I made with coworkers and customers alike I will never forget."
good,"They hired me so they said at a bad time. And didn't have the ability to train me on drinks because of my shift needs. I liked the idea of the job, enjoyed the perks greatly. I just wish they'd of been more organized"
good,"I like this company. I am a bit of a coffee snob and they change my mind. Starbucks has integrity and good policies. The Managers are dedicated, sometimes too much. I liked it even the hard which was keeping in step with one and only one of there standard work procedures of getting food before finish a transaction. the easiest was making drinks and talking with the consumer. I love coffee so it all felt ideal for me."
good,good benefits nice place to work I only had problem with management and the hours are crazy. other than that I have nothing to complain about. it was a great place if you want benefits.
good,Had a very good experience working in Starbucks. The work culture is great. The projects in Starbucks are very good and provide a lot of learning opportunities.
good,I learned how to communicate and manage my customer service skills. Everyone acts like a team at Starbucks and we all work together to meet our goals and satisfy customers.
good,"The job is perfect for so many people from different walks of life. It is first and foremost a job dealing with people, coffee comes second. How you approach problems or challenges makes you a great barista. I learned a lot about my neighborhood, neighbors and my community through this job."
good,"In all Starbucks is a good place to work.  Good pay, nice benefits if you have been with the company long enough and usually nice customers.  The only reason I left was I finally got hired as a music teacher which is what I went to school for."
good,It was a good job to work while I was in college. I enjoyed working there but the pay is not great. It was a fun job but nothing long term. Every job that I have worked since then has loved that Starbucks is on my resume.
good,I worked at a starbucks drive-thru which meant that we were expected to work at a very fast pace and have extensive knowledge of technology. My team was very kind but it was hard to get days off.
good,"Starbucks is a very nice, defined workplace. Tips are included, they also provide help with college scholarships and an option for a 401k, as well as health benefits for full time employees."
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for over three years now and my experience has been good overall. It's hard to plan for some things when it comes to scheduling, but it's a good starter job. Some of my closest friendships were made at Starbucks."
good,"A typical day was non-stop cleaning and customer support. I wish there was more time allotted for hands-on training to advance in the coffee world. Being older than the average employee, I felt slighted and not given the opportunity for advancement. This was a manager issue, not a Starbuck policy."
good,"A typical day at work includes writing schedules, performing inventories, planning promotions and ordering merchandise and supplies. The hardest part of the job is balancing my time at work and getting home."
good,"I love my job here. I work with decent people, i get a good discount on my coffee when i'm off & I've learned quite a lot in the last year and a half of being there."
good,"Since working at Starbucks I have been provided the opportunity to grow as a person and develop my customer service skills. In addition, the management shows that they value and trust their employees which has boosted my confidence in the work place."
good,"Wonderful people, difficult to get decisions made.  The company is doing great work by offering free college tuition, pay equality and strong company values.  HQ is very meeting centric."
good,"Always remember to smile. A lot of your customers will seem like they’re having a rough day so being friendly and helpful is always a plus. Multitasking is a must! If you have a problem with that, let your shift manager know so they can help you achieve your goal."
good,"A typical day is stressful, with high customer volume and usually low staff. That said, it's a fast paced and fun environment if you are skilled enough to get the most out of it. Sometimes it can be overwhelming, but each day is a battle and at the end of it you still get to go home. Good benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working for this establishment. A typical day consisted of working at a very quick pace, but very efficiently. I would most definitely recommend working here."
good,"great place to work, learn new things . Great environment "
good,"Starbucks was a fun work culture to be in. I met a lot of great people, employees and customers while I worked there. "
good,I had a terrible manager when I worked for Starbucks but I know a lot about the company... enough to know that this is not the regular perception of employees to managers.
good,"Employed as a Barista, my responsibilities are much the same as they were while working at Dairy Queen: I do a lot of quality control work, payment work, organizational work, damage control work, etc. However, continuing with the ascent pattern of my responsibilities, at Starbucks, I am often looked at as a leader of some sort, as I’m always pushing to get tasks done in between rushes."
good,The communication between entities made management of this store challenging along with high student turn over rates. Keeping this store one of the highest grossing locations in the nation was an accomplishment to out supervising team.
good,"I loved working for starbucks and absolutely would again. But only for the benefits and amazing pay. Management is awful, they get away with talking to you poorly and treating you poorly. & no matter how many employees went to corporate nothing was done. Which is disappointing after spending 5 year busting my butt off for them! Also was promised a promotion 2 years in that I never received. AT that point I left the company."
good,I have worked for starbucks for five years at over half a dozen stores across two states. there are many benefits to starbucks but at the end of the day it is a tough fast paced job that pays very little while demanding excellence.
good,The days here move very fast. Must always treat customers with respect and greet them with a smile. It was fun and as long as you work great with others you will enjoy your time here.
good,"The culture has changed a lot, meaning they care more about numbers instead of employees. and they have started to hire more outsourced management, so they don’t know much about the company. It’s just gotten very difficult to enjoy working there."
good,"Starbucks culture and benefits are amazing, but with the amount of work they should pay more. If it was not for the level of unprofessional-ism both management and employees, I would still be an employee."
good,"A typical day usually consists of customer service, and faced paced movement. Learned to multi task effectively. Management was always encouraging. Relaxed culture. The hardest part was learning the drink recipes, while enjoying to learn them at the same time."
good,"The company provides lots of benefits, however depending on the location, the customer base can be overwhelming, rude, harassing, and arrogant. And management can sometimes be a main contributor of that"
good,"Once you're clocked in first main thing is check in with your shift lead so that they can inform you where you'll be stationed. After its mandatory to wash your hands, and from there begin."
good,"The regular days at work were always fun, always different, I particularly appreciated the changing promotions and having new things to learn so that you never felt that the work was boring. Becoming a Coffee Master was a fun part of the job, as well as the semi-regular coffee tastings and trying out of the new recipes for the new promotions."
good,"Very fun environment, great people. Loved the focus on volunteering and giving back. Alternating between very late night and early morning shifts can be a difficult adjustment, makes work/life balance more difficult."
good,"Great place to work depending on your coworkers. Fast paced and a typically clean, modern environment. So long as you push towards working on the bar, you will not get stuck sweeping floors and scrubbing toilets/dishes every day."
good,Environment was fast paced to service customer in a fun way.  Work relationships helped build strong teams.  Starbucks encouraged team work.  Fun place to work
good,"Management listens to your needs and wants and best the best they can to apply them to the schedule, also if you wish to swift shift/ give up shifts it is fairly easy. If you have to pay rent, phone bill, insurance, utilities, etc. this job is not the best option if it is your only job. Would highly recommend to high school and stay at home college students. The work place is fast-paced, great break times, and discounts!"
good,"It has good scheduling that works around your school schedule and provides you enough work/ life balance. The only problem can be the amount we get paid isn't very good as well as the management and people can make it a horrible job. Customers can be needy, aggressive, impatient, and just unfriendly when you're trying to do your best. It is Customer Services bases so be prepared. Besides that though I really enjoyed working at Starbucks and would have loved to continue moving up the ranks."
good,Best part of the job was getting to know my coworkers and especially my customers. Especially the regular customers that came through every day; making a difference in their lives was the best part.
good,"Good Job, excess amounts of coffee, staff discounts, and major benefits for all employees. The rush isn't for everyone as it tends to get insanely busy during cold beverage promotions in summer."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for because they offer amazing benefits like free coffee/ food while working, free Spotify, they pay for school tuition for a specific online college, and opportunities to move up. I loved making drinks and finding different ways to mix the syrups they have. Although the management at my store was a bit of a trainwreck, I've heard at other locations it's a lot better. The communication between my store manager and assistant store manager just wasn't there, causing me to lose hours. The pay isn't the greatest, but you get a pay raise every year, and depending on what location you work at the tips make up for the poor wage."
good,Starbucks is a really good first job and temporary job. They have really good benefits for even part time and will accommodate school. They have really flexible hours as well.
good,"Most of the employees and customers are fantastic to work with. However as a Shift Supervisor company expectations of your performance and work load increase exponentially with only a minor increase in pay. Total benefits are nice but the Shift Supervisor position could easily stand to earn an extra $2-$3 per hour. Store environment is heavily dependent on the management style of the Store Manager. Some Managers are friendly and lax encouraging an enjoyable work environment, where it is encouraged to create the best customer experience possible even if that means bending a few rules depending on the situation. While others may try to enforce every single minor obscure rule they can find, even when it decreases overall customer satisfaction. Store moral can also be brought down by Barista's who do not carry their own weight. Depending on your store location you can expect anywhere between a nice relaxed café environment to a constantly fast paced never ending parade of customers. Location matters."
good,"This job was good but for somebody that was getting married, starting a family, and trying to get out of debt, not so much. This job is good for the high school student that wants something to work around a busy schedule, or somebody who is in school and needs a couple extra dollars, but if you're not in management, you're not guaranteed hours and you can have a very wonky schedule. It's very face paced and you're thrown to the sharks after about a week of training. The best part is the discounts and the creative ability the barista feels (but really doesn't have). It's fun though and you do end up meeting some pretty interesting people."
good,Learned a lot. Very structured and fast-paced. Would recommend as a first job or someone looking for a part-time job. Does not pay enough to support area cost of living.
good,"The people were amazing. Management weren't qualified to work in Starbucks due to not having any previous experience in the field. Overall, I'm happy to have had such a fulfilling time with the company."
good,"Very fun work environment and excellent customer interactions, People were happy to come and experience the store and engage in our fun activities daily"
good,my particular store was a barrel of laughs and such a good place to work. Prefect for someone who's between jobs and looking to move onto a more stable career
good,"Great company. I loved the job, working at the understaffed to-go location, was hectic for me trying to balance hours they needed from me with student life, but it was a very cool job."
good,"If you are clueless on how a business is run, Starbucks is a great place to start. You learn about effective and ineffective management techniques from day one. Depending on the store you start at, you will either get excellent training or you will get no training at all. "
good,"I loved working for this company. My particular location had some weird vibes however. The manager was great in most aspects, just that she really frowned upon calling in sick which lead to a very unhealthy environment, with many baristas vomiting in the backroom when they were told they had to work their shift despite being ill."
good,"Overall it is a lovely place to work and I have enjoyed my time working there. I got the job as a second job and at the time it was perfect. Now it has moved to my primary job and it just doesn't make nearly enough to provide me the income for my current bills. The job is not always easy; there are many stressors and it is fast pace! but if you are a person with an upbeat personality and the ability to multi-task it is perfect. I enjoyed making quality beverages for customers and getting to know our regulars. I have enjoyed all 3 managers I have had indeed! I must say some days it is hard to deal with certain customers and some coworkers attitudes, but am aware and accepting that is something that comes with most any job."
good,For the majority of the time I could honestly say that working at Starbucks was a fun and enjoyable experience.  I however also found it to be more stressful than I believe it should be for the pay you receive.  My experience could be related to the management I personally had.  I worked at second store during a remodel of the main store I worked at and found that mangement experience much more enjoyable.
good,The baristas and leads ive worked with have been amazing. There is some lack of experience when it comes to Management. Especially when it comes to living by the starbucks standards and beliefs.
good,"The work environment was great, they just didn't give me enough hours. The only reason I decided to leave the company is because I found a better job opportunity."
good,"I truly loved working at starbucks.  I was fortunate to open a new store and the experience was inspiring.  Sadly, the drive was too long and the promised store in my town was delayed so I left to find work in my town.  But as soon as starbucks makes it to my town, I'll be reapplying."
good,"I worked at starbucks throughout my highschool years, and I will say for sure if starbucks is still ran the same way it is now I will definitely be encouraging my children and any young adults I know to start their first job path out with something like starbucks. They taught me how to provide excellent customer service, keep my cool in stressful situations, build team working skills, and understand the importance of taking a little extra time to get to know the customers you see regularly. Starbucks offers a multitude of wonderful opportunities for teens and young adults as far as health insurance, college scholarships, stock investments, etc. The only reason I left was poor management at my store after a new manager was brought in a year and a half into my time there."
good,"typical day at Starbucks consist of making drinks all day, putting food in the oven to heat up and also taking orders and communicating with customers."
good,"Overall I have really enjoyed my 5 years with Starbucks, however, I need to be making more money. It is also frustrating that a new supervisor makes .40 less than I do after 4 years of being a shift. My current management situation is not good and it is holding me back from growing."
good,Starbucks was a great place to work. I loved the customers and the team I was able to create. It became very demanding and I didn't feel as appreciated by upper management as I feel I should of been.
good,"The team can be instrumental in keeping one there. It is a fast-paced high-stress environment at times. Customers complain, but benefits are worth it."
good,"Though this is an excellent place to work, the difficulty of advancing within the company is what is enticing me to seek new opportunities. Starbucks has an amazing culture, and overall has a great business model. I am not excited to leave, however, I am excited to seek new opportunities within the hospitality industry."
good,"Depends on the part of the day the routine would be different. But, mainly I work mid or night shifts. The typical Mid-day shift would be focus in fast service and take care of the customer needs. During all day there's some things that have to be do and keep that way like clean. But, during this time our mainly respnsability of each partner is the customer. At night, half of the partners focus in clean and close the store, and the other part in keep the store focused in the customer."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced enviroment. If you are not taking orders, making drinks, food, or washing dishes, you will be cleaning. During my time with Starbucks, I was able to grow my customer service skills. Customer service is sometimes the best part of the job, and others the worst. I was able to learn how to de-escalate upset customers. You work side by side with the same people and they become like family. It is great to have family, but sometimes they aren't fun to be around."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. They paid really well for Management compared to a lot of retail stores. Working here taught me a lot about managing a business, budgets, profit and loss statements, and managing people."
good,"This job was so much fun and so hard sometimes. I had moments where I left work crying, not because of coworkers, but because customers don't understand that baristas are people too. I've had so many laughs and met so many great people both on the coworkers and guest side of things. This job really taught me what I'm made of, not doubt about that!"
good,Great place to work for a teenager can move up in company if you know the right people you must be able to work under pressure and fast paced have a great memory and find solving situations for customers on the spot
good,Starbucks has a great work environment for those who want a starting job in any compass of existance. It teaches great productivity and customer service in a comfortable environment.
good,Communication was an issue with management but my coworkers made the work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is the movement and inconsistanct customers.
good,"I worked at a Starbucks attached to a gas station, so it made it a bit different than other Starbucks cultures. All in all, I enjoyed my time there and had very good managers. You just have to be patient with people and have sociable skills to go with coffee making."
good,"Slow people cannot work here. You have to be on your feet and ready to make orders flexible with hours, a little too much that you wouldn't even get some at all."
good,"I learned how to make drinks and how to do it two at a time in a set routine. How to work my way around the register on the front counter and drive through for taking a customers orders. When its busy, it gets a little hectic since there is usually only three people on the floor at a time which can cause a bit of trouble when drive through is busy and you're expected to take the orders while handing out the orders and getting payment from the customers on the drive through window."
good,I worked for a licensed location and not a corporate store so my benefits and experiences are not  the same. The worst part being having to pay for food and drinks even while working.
good,Typical day at work is prepping for the day. Customer service is key. Management is always changing. Work place culture is fast paced but great coworkers. Great benefits for part-timers.
good,Great benefits for part-time workers; occasionally shifts are during strange hours but good for students; fun and fast-paced environment; customer service heavy.
good,"fun, fast pace also can be stressful  a lot off multitasking; cleaning, cashier, answering phones, getting to try new drinks and making up your own drink to try."
good,Good. Fast paced.Great co workers. Manager is very good at her job. Keeps the place and employees in order. Love starbucks!. Customers are very consistent.
good,"Unrealistic expectations of what a human is capable of doing in assistant manager and up positions. Great fun as a shift supervisor and barista. Awesome job for students. Flexible hours, vacation pay, benefits and coffee."
good,Was a barista for 2 years. Really good job when you are in college. Not a good job for after. Unless you became a manager and that is a stressful job. A lot of managers hated it.
good,"A typical day includes making many different drinks for all types of allergies and diets, and running a till that may have upwards of $600 in it at any time. "
good,"A typical day started early and went by quick. I learned a lot about their products. What was in them, how to make them, etc. The management was super understanding and awesome when it came to scheduling and the work environment. The hardest part of the job was how fast paced it was at times. The most enjoyable was my co-workers and free coffee!"
good,"While working at Starbucks has been a pleasure, and I've learned quite a bit about customer service, lack of communication can greatly affect the work environment. If there is an update in inventory, a change in recipe or a new promotion, it needs to be communicated. Granted, other stores might be better at this than my store is. But w/o communicating these changes, the employees suffer."
good,"great company to work for, needs better managers. a typical day at work with Starbucks goes by fairly quickly, since you'll always be busy doing something."
good,"Day to day operations include setting goals for the store team, developing organizational capability, modeling how we work together, manage with integrity, honesty, and knowledge that promote the culture, values, and mission of Starbucks."
good,"If you are lucky to have a great boss you are sure to have a awesome time working here. I have gone through 5 different managers in the last 3 years and let me put it this way! 3 out of the 5 managers I had throughout the years were demoted. Store managers are not always trained properly and have a hard time running a store therefore, the whole team has to suffer and work harder than the pay accommodates to keep the store afloat ."
good,"Starbucks was an excellent place to work except when I would have a manager who was unfit for leadership.  I had managers scheme to get me out and managers to take advantage of their position by playing candy crush and forcing me to do their jobs.  But under a great leader, the job is fun and engaging and such great experience."
good,"Starbucks is a good company, lots of opportunity for growth within the company. I loved the benefits the most. I've worked at several SBUX because of the ease of transferring. Depending on management it can be an awesome place to work"
good,fast pace and very safety driven-team work- decent place to work- and overtime and various types of shifts to work -8hrs-10hrs-12hrs are available-also warehouse work
good,"My time with the company has been balanced between exceptional benefits and unreasonable expectations. While the basic duties/responsibilities of the job are relatively easy, the mandates from corporate make the job stressful and unbalanced. However, the benefits that Starbucks offers are really the best, and it's hard to find a better option at a customer service job."
good,Faced paced work environment with excellent benefits. Management can be unsteady and often chaotic. Day to day operations are always the same. Good opportunities to advance.
good,High paced and exciting. The job is great for high school students and servers who can do well in stressful environments. Starbucks is a community and the free drinks are a bonus.
good,working is fun but getting paid for that work is not so fun. they should look into increasing pay. benefits are good. work life is so much fun. you like to work when you know you have same kind of people there.
good,Working at starbucks is often very stressful. It can become very busy. Overall most customers are really great and ive made some great friends working for starbucks. The benefits for a part-time job are also unmatched
good,"Bien connu, j'ai travaillé à cet enterprise 10 ans. On a des advantages incroyable pour leurs partenaires."
good,Fun place to work with flexible scheduling. Manager turnover can make advancement challenging. Easy to bond with coworkers. Fast-paced environment depending on location. Great benefits to take advantage of.
good,"I learned how to work with a lot of people in a small space in a high-paced environment while still being customer focused. Starbucks is a great company to work for. However, they sometimes focus on the small things that do not mean a lot to the company or the customer experience as a whole."
good,An excellent place to make connections if you make the most of it. Find a store with a strong team and the job is pretty straight forward. Excellent starting job to build up interpersonal skills and develop client facing skills.
good,"You learn a lot working for Starbucks, it's a job I think everyone should have at least once in their lives. Overall not many complaints, pay could be better for how hard we work."
good,"Starbucks' stores open early and close at a decent hour, which makes it easy for students to pick up shifts with a flexible schedule. Even if you aren't scheduled the amount of hours you want, there are always opportunities to pick up more shifts at your home store and others within the area."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a good place to work. The discounts are great, you get a free premium Spotify account, and free coffee every week is always nice. I, however, don't agree with their ""never say no"" policy. Customers can, and will, take advantage of our kindness. Everything would be fine except the fact that your common barista isn't paid near enough for what they do and deal with. You'll definitely need a second job while working here unless you find a high volume store."
good,"A Starbucks é uma empresa maravilhosa, com bons benefícios, um ambiente de trabalho quase sempre agradável."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for three years but went been through at least 4 different store managers. I think Starbucks as a company is great but the location I worked at was really difficult. It was in the middle of the city where the surrounding population is largely homeless, which ends up that half my job was kicking people out of the lobby who aren't customers that swear at me and dealing with an infestation of roaches. It was way more stressful than it needed to be. I picked up shifts at other locations that are easy as pie - never busy all nice rich customers who tip well, but work at a Starbucks with a struggling surrounding area and you will be lucky to get $1/hour in tips and will have to deal with people smoking in your bathroom, stealing your tips right out of the jar, drinking on the patio, etc. etc. etc... Great company but I probably worked at the worst store there was."
good,"-busy, overwhelming"
good,It's a fun place to work if you like fast pace and working with your hands. Fun environment but mainly depends on management you have. Free coffee with shift and free coffee beans a week!
good,"Lovely big quiet store not far off the local motorway, very standard work flow, hope I can come back as a customer soon, time table was given two weeks in advance thought it may change at the last minute."
good,"The biggest issue that has stayed constant at my Starbucks is the different drama that would always take place. It had somewhat of a high school atmosphere, the saddest part about it is the ones who are starting most of the rumors are from the most of the shift leaders."
good,"Most of my working experience at Starbucks was purposefully chosen early and long hours. I worked mostly during ""peak"" about 6-9am when most people are grabbing their morning coffee. I specifically asked to work during the fast-paced hours of the day in hopes of learning the ropes quicker and proving my value as a Partner to my management and peers. Overall, the other baristas and management maintained a congenial and bright atmosphere, even during times of discourse."
good,"You get free coffee 30 minutes before/after work along with a food item. Working with a good team makes all the difference. Management will either advance you, or keep talking about advancing you without ever doing anything more. Corporate takes bullying/retaliation very seriously which is great. Definitely not a hostile place to be since everyone is so hoped up on caffeine. Honestly, the worst part about it is the mean customers that run through. Good grief so many people are not able to hold it together if they have to wait longer than 30 seconds for their beverage."
good,"Starbucks provided me with a wonderful opportunity to employ and advance my customer service skills. I thoroughly enjoyed the environment, workers, and all tasks involved with my position."
good,Working here has been such a challenge. It isn’t just a “summer job” because it takes so long to actually know everything. It’s definitely a hard position to get comfortable with but one day you’ll wake up and be able to do everything with your eyes closed. Very rewarding if you work hard and stay dedicated.
good,"Working at Starbucks has really been a great experience so far, I really enjoy my co workers and customers. It is a very fast paced job, that is more difficult that I had expected."
good,"Every day is a new adventure at starbucks. With different guest complaining about something else ridiculous and new drinks every few weeks it really is fun. it can definitely be a challenge to keep up with the big rushes, especially through the summer, but its cool."
good,"Friendly coworkers, fun and easy going. I made so many friends working here and still see some regularly. Great place for someone that needs caffeine, haha."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful place to work with the right crew and management. The team I worked with was fun. The only downside is extremely low pay for the amount of work you do.
good,"Was a very fun job with cool perks such as discounts. but there is no chance at career advancement. I would reccomend as part-time job, being low stress. The training helped to be able to work at kiosk alone"
good,"Great work life balance with managers only working 40 hours a week, mostly day shifts. Transition out of training was rough for me with no assigned District Manager at the time. I feel like this didn't set me up for success and I fell behind, which discouraged me. Lots of hands on management, with only 10 hours a week to take care of all your manager tasks, including payroll, schedules and new roll out checklists. It felt like every time we finished a new ""launch"" we were already prepping for the next one, with little time to perfect what we were doing. Very fast paced environment, constantly changing. 8 week training program was sufficient, but didn't cover everything needed. Other Store Managers tell me it takes at least 2 years to get promoted, regardless of prior experience. This is also discouraging."
good,"Shift Manager responsible for developing and executing a structured plan to achieve goals with a team. The opener is responsible for reaching daily sales goals, creating a daily deposit and placing the daily food order. The closer is responsible for completing the daily deposit, recording food deliveries and finalizing inventory entries. The core focus of the team is to maintain all working stations to ensure high quality beverages."
good,"I loved my team at my first store. When I transferred to a store closer to home, I was very disappointed and ended up hating it. At times it can be a very repetitive and monotonous job, which can make you crazy if you are someone who is looking to consistently advance and develop skill. I would not recommend working as a barista more than a year."
good,"Great work environment with tons of room for improvement. Management varies location to location, but I seemed to get lucky and was always working under wonderful managers."
good,"Une journée typique au travail se résume en quatre mots: service à la clientèle. Peu importe les tâches que je devais exécuter, nettoyage, préparer les boissons, etc.., offrir un bon service prenais toujours le dessu. "
good,Starbucks are very good at recognising and rewarding great performance. The store manager position within Australia is an excellent role although there is little room for promotion once in that position.
good,"Everything depends on the people you work with. As its a low skill job, the turnover is quite high so you need to deal with that. despite this the environment was fun, I felt as though the company cared about the individual and I learned that nothing is eviler than a frappuccino"
good,"This job was very fun to be I got to learn so many new different things and I also loved the relationships I got to build with my everyday customers, its what made my job fun."
good,"It is a great company to work at, but they did not state a policy or inform their employees directly that they are not re-hire-able if they do call in sick, in their two-weeks notice. I certainly called in once in the two-weeks notice because I was sick and now I am not in the state of being rehired at Target."
good,"I certainly wouldn't want to stay a barista forever, and the pay isn't great, but it's a lot of fun. The free coffee is a nice bonus. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people while under time pressure."
good,"Was incredibly stressful toward the end of my days there."
good,"Starbucks is a fair paying job but not great for people hoping to start working and through hard work move up in management ladder in a fair and justifiable way. Most promotions are judged on how you much kiss up to upper management and if youre not willing to do that then forget promotions. "
good,"lots of making coffee, maintaining positive attitudes, dealing with customers who expect the highest level of customer service possible. Strong leaders."
good,"Typical work day would start out around 5:30 A.M. The hardest part of the job was memorizing every drink as well as not so mainstream drinks. Management was always upbeat, informative, and helpful. Workplace culture was always fun and quick paced. Talking to different people throughout the day was the most enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks is good company to work for. Every store varies on functionality, I've helped out in many stores and had three different stores as my home store. The overall work environment depends on how well your manager does their job and whether or not you like your coworkers. Do not expect to get any raises other than the yearly minimum wage gap. You will be compensated with bean stock instead. As far as health benefits, I didn't use them and Starbucks doesn't pay you the difference for not using their benefits. If you aren't getting enough hours you can help out at other stores to get more."
good,"Fun, high-pressure workplace. Serving customers in a busy environment on a daily basis. Busiest on the weekends. Learned a lot of skills concerning the preparation of food and drink items."
good,"If your a Creative or building a career, I would recommend. Depending on the role, work-life balance is a challenge. Management can be removed if your position is out of the store. The BEST part was the people."
good,Working at Starbucks is very busy and stressful at times. Really fun though. You get to know your costumers very well and get to have a relationship with them.
good,Great place to work.  Problem is low hourly wage. culture is driven by top management and well constructed. Starbucks has in place a very strong long term strategic plan.
good,"Tons of benefits , pretty relaxed environment , store managers are a bit lazy. Overall i still would recommend  because of the work life balance. I was able to go to college and better myself while working here."
good,"It's all about who your boss is. A good manager makes a good store and happy baristas and happy customers. A bad boss who doesn't like what they're doing won't like the baristas, they make the environment aggressive and awful, and generally make life heck. Starbucks is great when it's great but definitely not worth it when it's bad."
good,It is a very face paced company. I learned many skills such as patience and learning to multi task. The hardest part was probably working with management.
good,"The management was overall really terrible but the other baristas made the shift worthwhile. Hours were low for everyone and was always an issue for everyone. Call-outs were unacceptable, even when you were sick; which was an issue for me. My experience at Starbucks was not the best but it wasn't terrible."
good,"Everyday was predictable, yet unpredictable. I always knew the drinks and procedures so that everyday was meditative - but also people would come in and you would just never know what was happening next."
good,"Ever since minimum wage has been rising throughout certain states in the country, hours have been forced to be cut across the board. Sometimes, when I was a full-time worker, I would only be scheduled 25-30 hours a week, and that was before I was part-time."
good,"I was at a very hectic and poorly managed Starbucks. "
good,"Even with complications like every job has, I enjoyed my time working at Starbucks. Being promoted to a supervisor gave me a lot of insight on growing with a company and taught me a lot of responsibility."
good,"Good place to work.Pay is not great and I never get enough hours, but the people you work with are amazing. You learn how to appreciate your coworkers and desire growth."
good,Stay as long as you can. Gets mind numbingly boring. The benefits and pay are very good but the job itself is great for a while and then you will hit a wall.
good,"It was a great place to work for people who love coffee and want to be around fellow coffee lovers! You get to learn all of the secrets to the drinks too, which is always fun."
good,"It is a great place to learn about Work Ethics and Customer Service."
good,"This job is extremely fast paced and often times feels as though you are not being paid fairly for the amount of work that you do. However, being a customer service job, it is often necessary to be the backbone of the company. When things do go well, the job is very fluid and less stress, however, with many new-hires, the job often becomes more cumbersome than anything else."
good,"Is very fast paced. For an entry level customer service job, it provides great benefits. Most of the baristas are good people, the problems are the customers and the hours. The schedules are released only a few days before the next week. Every day the hours would change so it was very hard to make plans around your schedule. The 4:30 am shifts are miserable to work. When working at the bar, a few of the customers would reach into the work area to grab supplies or stand near the hand-off area heckling the baristas working there. The supervisors (at least while I was there) don't get paid much more than the baristas and often got stuck staying at the store long hours when another supervisor called in sick."
good,"Westside village Starbucks Victoria, has an amazing team with great work ethic. The manager is phenomenal. Lots of benefits and rewards due to partner status."
good,"not stressful, management changed frequently, culture depends on manager. cleaning tasks can be mundane, hardest part is cleaning and learning this drinks."
good,"Lots of drama and favoritism, things really aren't the way they used to be. I used to love it and now I feel like I csn never grow but always needing a paycheck makes you have to stay"
good,"Aiding to people's addiction of caffeine - we love it and more importantly they love it! It's an enjoyable place to work (especially with charismatic coworkers) and once you're comfortable, it can be nice go above and beyond for a customer. Great student-job, but not long-term (unless you're wanted for a promotion)."
good,"Over time I became dissatisfied with the company and the way things were being run. It's a really good place to work for benefits, but the pay can be unsatisfactory for the amount of work being put in."
good,good job but requires multitasking and ability to work under pressure.  Benefits are good and we get a free food item and free drinks while working as well as a free pound of coffee a week.
good,Starbucks is a fun fast paced job that is very flexible while you are going to school or have children. There is advancement available but it is difficult.
good,"I work at a high volume store, so it tends to be stressful. Overall, the job itself is great. I love my coworkers and the benefits and perks are worth the work."
good,"Making coffee is fun, coffee is a good thing; as well, pastries are a good thing. It is fun to eat pastries, it is fun to drink coffee; it is not always so fun to deal with people before they've had their coffee, but every job has its pros and cons. "
good,"The work is stressful, the hours can be long, early, and flexible. However, if you enjoy working in a customer-driven environment with great healthcare benefits, this is a great choice."
good,"This job is perfect for entry-level workers who are excited to participate in the Starbucks Experience and coffee culture. You will be trained thoroughly to succeed at this job, and the company provides many benefits to retain its partners."
good,"Starbucks, is great, well organized and fair company. I enjoy the staff and scheduling is in advance. the work is beginner level and easy for ESL. Benefits and annual raises."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks because of the culture that was there at the time. I had the greatest boss and most of my coworkers are some of my closest friends now.
good,"Coming into Starbucks was always one of my favorite things about working there because of my love for coffee.  Being a barista was a dream I had growing up, but once I became one it quickly wore off due to the stress of making customers happy and balancing my schoolwork/other responsibilities.  In the end, we got a new manager who changed a lot of things that made it difficult for me to keep up and eventually left after I got a better position elsewhere."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral , buena paga. Grandes beneficios personales"
good,"The shifts are flexible which is great if you are a student or parent.  If you want to move forward, there is little required, just hard work.  It's difficult to make a living at this job, so if you are a sole breadwinner, this is not the place to work. It's GREAT as a second job though.  The partner discounts and perks are wonderful - free pound of coffee and all the drinks you want during your shift (before, after and on break)  and the benefits are really great.   I had a great experience at this job until I wanted to move forward into management - since I was a single mom, I wanted to invest in this company, but couldn't make it work due to the low pay."
good,It's extremely taxing mentally and physically.  It's fast paced.  It's a completely collaborative team enviroment.  They don't pay supervisors enough.
good,One thing I enjoyed about working at Starbucks was the atmosphere of the place. When walking in it feels welcoming and inviting. The employees are all nice and sweet because it seems like they actually enjoy there job. The customers are kind; always wanting to pay for the person behind them. Great atmosphere to work in.
good,Starbucks is a great starter job for someone in college or looking for part time as they work with your school schedule.  Upper management is more challenging for work like balance.
good,"Working at Starbucks was not easy. It was fast paced and where I worked, it was in a small space. It was often stressful due to the number of orders coming in and the size of the staff. Even with all of this I still enjoyed my time there and would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a job."
good,"Most days were a combination of fun and stressful. There were times when I felt that communication between shifts was lacking, which fueled morning vs. night rivalries. The vast majority of people with whom I worked were pleasant and hard-working. Occasionally,  I felt under-appreciated for the work that I did. I definitely miss the camaraderie that I had with my baristas, but I do not miss the drive-thru."
good,I been employeed by the company for over 10 years now. great people to work with. great team players and great team leaders. just need the management level to care for the operational level more.
good,Overall the company is amazing and I’m grateful for my time of employment there.  I’ve learned how to build my skill set from working there and plan to take that knowledge with me to future jobs.
good,I really did enjoy working at Starbucks. It was very fast paced and allowed for a lot of customer interactions while being help to a very high standard. I was able to lead a team successfully.
good,"The best part of this job is you gain a family. The culture among the baristas are amazing, not always with management. The company promotes a well balanced life and good environment."
good,"My day would include either being positioned at cash or bar, depending on where I was situated I would either take orders and prepare food or make drinks. During the day the Cafe would have to be cleaned regularly to maintain the QASA standards. I learned a lot about coffee and tea products along with different ways of preparing and making drinks based with coffee and or tea. The management was good but had lots of turnover. The hardest part was dealing with rude or angry customers but can easily be handled. The whole job was enjoyable."
good,Its a good job if you are looking for some extra cash but you can't survive off of the paychecks. It has good benefits I would have stayed if the pay was better.
good,"A normal day was come in clock in, then start making drinks/taking orders. This was most of the day other then doing that all baristas really do is clean. The Pros were the people coworkers and customers, Cons were the receptiveness of the job and lack of Job growth."
good,"Our store has a drive through and is very fast-paced.  We get a lot of traveling customers, so they don't act as nicely as our regulars.  Our parking lot is too small and it causes a lot of issues."
good,"It was constantly busy, but I always left with a sense of satisfaction that I was able to complete the goals that I set out to achieve for the day. However, if you have a bad shift manager then your day is going suck."
good,"It's fun to work there, can be stressful at times with all the customers that come in at once. But you just have to push through it and rely on your coworkers. The benefits are great, the company gives you great opportunities to grow and learn."
good,"The work environment, at any Starbucks, is all about a warm and welcoming atmosphere. As a customer, when you walk in, you feel as though you're coming into a quaint cafe where you will receive a quality beverage and a comfortable seat to rest your feet. Working at Starbucks was a look behind the scenes at this mecca for coffee. You do get to enjoy the benefits of a fun, hip workplace and team, however you may not like the idea of having to stand on your feet a majority of your shift. Dealing with the fast-paced tasks and making sure you complete them in a timely manner can be stressful. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. You meet great people, learn new things about coffee and tea, and you genuinely have a good time."
good,"The location that I used to work was crazy busy. not balance well between work and life. they pay is not that great, because i need that money for my life. but if you are a part time student, i think that will be a good position to start. Benefit is not bad. free drinks, medical insurance."
good,"There is too much workflow dependent on who the manager is.  I've worked at stores with incredible management which made every day a delight to come into work.  I've also had terrible managers with no experience, making every day a terror and causing me to leave the company."
good,"Good workplace culture, good benefits, very flexible. Love working here other than the fact that there arent usually a lot of hours. If you're looking for something closer to full time than don't work at Starbucks."
good,Being a barista is a great job. It is easy to communicate with people especially since the shop is so busy for almost every shift. Sometimes customers get upset but being respectful and dealing with the situation in a positive manner is key. The pay is the one con that is related to this job.
good,"Great place to work for little pay! Great benefits after working 6 months, and some perks involved. Company definitely cared about it's employees. Refreshing to work for managers that care."
good,"Good environment to work. Nice people to work with, fun to learn new skills. Nice to be able to try new products to better serve customers. Helping customers decide on drinks, maybe turn them on to a new favorite."
good,"Usually I'd get in really early in the morning - like 5am. I was the youngest out of the whole crew, but it didn't bother me too much. It was a shame I had to go, but I got really sick and was delusional with a fever and body chills for 3 days. I also got really depressed, so I lacked communication with my boss and I just quit without explaining why really. Besides my mistake, let me tell you some don'ts and dos. I'm a fast learner so I learned a lot in this short month. "
good,"Not something I want to do for the rest of my life, but I enjoyed my time here. Routine was nice, but not as creative as a coffee shop should be. Can be tedious at times."
good,"This job was fun at first, but the inconsistent work hours and stressful environment wore me down after only a couple months of working here. Overall, it was a good work environment with good partners and management, but the high stress environment wore me down and made me constantly ill."
good,"This location is very busy and can definitely have it's good and and it's bad days. There can be a lot going on, but making sure you can maintain your focus and get the job done is what is really important."
good,"Work could be incredibly fast-paced and stressful, but that would be the biggest downside. The coworkers were fantastic and felt like a family. Benefits were great, including health insurance, dental insurance, stock options,a 401k, free Spotifiy Premium, and discounted college through their College Achievement Plan. Overall a great work experience."
good,"My time working at Starbucks has been short, but i will say it was a great place to work, great people, and great discounts! Starbucks is not the job for me because they do not give me to pay i need in order to pay all of my bills."
good,"Tight knit company community=a sense of worth and value behind your work even at the entry level. I greatly enjoyed working for this company, and honestly, the sense of fulfillment and ownership for the drinks that I made/service I provided made up for the low salary."
good,"Starbucks is a great company. The biggest reason as to why I left was the lack of advancement. I was told from the beginning that I was to work my way up after I graduated from college so I started as a barista and within two years I had just become a shift manager and the sight of corporate was too far in the future for me to continue. With a college degree, it should not have to be that difficult to advance. Otherwise, the employees are great and the work environment is one you can only have at Starbucks."
good,Worked as a barista to put myself through college. I enjoyed working for the company overall. Getting free drinks and a free lb of coffee a week definitely helped during college.
good,"Overall a great company to work for, they offer many benefits that is a great offset to the lower wage baristas make. This is a great place for a full time or part time job, if you work at least 20hrs per week you are eligible for full benefits."
good,"The workplace and environment is great, but the amount of hours Starbacks allows stores to schedule is a disaster. And the primary reason is squeezing as much money out of as little labor as possible. As someone who closes this created incredibly stressful situations on a regular basis."
good,I got on very well with everyone at Starbucks in Bicester. Very friendly staff. The job was a little demanding in terms of you had to stand up for extended hours which was painful on your back. Breaks very short too.
good,"I worked at different location before for almost 3 years and at the time I was working with some fairly older people or parents so it was a lot less drama has far working with your co workers. The pay is fine considering and you get tips weekly so you should be making an extra $1-5 per hour depending on the tip were that week. They have pretty good insurance and the company pays for most  of it and you get stock. Free drinks and food, a free pound of coffee or K cups. They did loosen up there dress code so its more casual. I think depending your age it could a great place to work. Did find when I worked with much younger coworkers they also have I'm right your wrong attitude and NEVER listen if you were the shift manager it kinda made it hard for everything to flow. But the mornings went by pretty fast I think the rushes are nice because your brain is always going ( in a good way) I would recommend this job for anyone who is up for the challenge. As far as moving up it hard to get passed being a shift manager, they tend hire outside for upper management and they never last because they understand the culture and they aren't ready for the stress that can come with the job. But if didn't have the job I have now  I would definitely go back."
good,Very supportive leadership and good working environment. Good training and encouraging and patiesnt trainers for the most part. most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,"If Starbucks didn't provide as much as they do in benefits, the pay for the amount stress if not worth the time. I suggest that if you're not going to take advantage of the College Achievement Plan, that you search for a different coffee shop."
good,"While this company carries a lot of expectations to keep it's pristine image, working for this company requires some guts no matter what your rank is."
good,"Working there was very fast paced and could be stressful. I liked working with my coworkers and discounts. Downside was manager played favorites and the drama. Literally had someone walk out on shift, quit, then they ""forgave"" her and rehired her. Then forced me to resign last minute when i was supposed to transfer, was moving the next day. They just aren't very fair and i dont think any of this gets back to corporate or they would probably get repercussions."
good,"les journées dynamique et enrichissantes"
good,"The company does its best to create a better environment for a food service industry job. It provides great benefits such as a 401k plan, healthcare, paid vacation time, discounts, and also education opportunities. However the pay isn't great, and at the end of the day, its still a food service job that's fast-paced, stressful, and draining."
good,"Great place to work, If you are a CW you are treated a little different don't get benefits. But overall great place to be. Everyone is helpful, and the environment is fun and relaxed."
good,It was a nice place to work. It was a while back but I remember hving a pretty good time. It could get stressful though. I enjoyed my work crew and the atmosphere of a coffee shop.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for.  The management is supportive. There are many way to advance within the company.  Every day was a challenging day full of excitement and fun
good,"It is great you guys offer to pay tuition so I'm currently fulfilling my dreams of getting my bachelors.  However, I wish that the pay was more because I live in an expensive place to live."
good,"Starbucks is a company i worked for them for two years and they have great benefits such as health insurances, free mark outs and a free pound of coffee or k-cups a week. i loved working for them but there are also draw backs such as not being able to do your nails and its also a job people get stuck at for a long time because they have such good benefits people feel compelled to stay and its a very stressful environment."
good,The most enjoyable part about this job is interacting with people. I find it very easy to do the drinks. It was easy to learn and the people i work with are nice.
good,"Positive vibes from almost all Starbucks partners. Benefits are extraordinary. Making connections with customers is fantastic. My only issue with the job is that hours are never guaranteed and since it is an entry level job, it doesn't pay enough for someone who is looking to move out of their parents' home. Job is also fast paced, so it can be stressful at points, but that gives partners the option to learn more efficiently."
good,"Starbucks is a top notch corporation, intended to provide income and job experience for people that haven't had many jobs.  I worked there until i was advanced enough in my studies to begin working in my related field."
good,As a barista we would create awesome customer interactions as well as coffee. We learned about the various roasts and the origins of each particular roast of coffee. All the employees are very welcoming and create a fast and awesome working environment
good,"My job consists mostly of cash handling, employee deployment, inventory counting, labor adjusting and of course making drinks and preparing food. It's a solid job with the right management, of course any job can be ruined with bad management but I've been lucky in my experiences. The benefits are plentiful but the pay could be better."
good,I can't complain about my job because when I applied at Starbucks I knew what responsibilities that I needed to do. I worked at the O'hare International Airport so I knew it will be a busy one. My main reason why I stayed for that long it's because my manager and supervisor was really nice. I like all my co-worker and got along with them so well.
good,It is a great place to work part time and receive full benefits with flexible work hours. Depending on the store it can be fast paced or slower paced.
good,"Making coffee is a fun job, though can be fast paced at times. Starbucks treats their employees very well with several perks such as unlimited free beverages and one free food item during every shift, 30% off when you are not working from any corporate Starbucks, a free bag of coffee beans/teas/instant coffee per week."
good,"Working at Starbucks is an amazing experience. They provide many benefits as well as insurance. However, unless your goal is to become a store manager at one, I would not stay. You are always moving, with little time to rest, and at times, it can get very stressful, even for the shift managers."
good,Starbucks is definitely a high-stress environment. It is definitely a place who likes to work under pressure and loves a little bit of challenge. You have to deal with all types of people (customers and coworkers alike). You definitely need to understand that it's not personal when a customer is rude to you and you have never met them before. It's also hard to work here if you aren't passionate about coffee or starbucks.
good,Starbucks took good care of me. Performance reviews were timely and raises were frequent. As long as you work hard you can go far with the company. The stock options were great. I enjoyed the company very much!!
good,I loooooove starbucks. I probably would have been there longer if it were not for a conflict of interest. I worked the early am shift 430-1230 and the morning rush was stressful  but it was a great time.
good,"El trabajo en equipo en este puesto laboral fue imprescindible para mi como trabajar en un ambiente con muchos compañeros."
good,Always busy. Customer service and tending to equipment are  constant. I had a lot of fun there. The only real downside was there didn't seem to be a chance for advancement.
good,"Its a great job, you get to know a lot of different people and it allows you to be social and connect with people on a daily basis. I recommend the job to anyone who Is looking for a flexible schedule."
good,"Meu primeiro emprego, um ambiente que me fez crescer e aprender muito. Me perfil expandir os meus conhecimentos, aprender sobre negócios e pessoas. Me ajudar a projetar a minha carreira na qual pretendo seguir durante toda a vida."
good,"Fun place to work that is more relaxed then most companies. The people that work there are passionate about coffee and social issues, not just the bottom line."
good,I enjoyed this place greatly. This is a great place to work especially if you are in college. I worked here for six years and would love to continue to work here. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,Nice if you are student but don't look at this as your main job. No benefits (if you are part-timer) and sometimes crazy shifts. But nice people and culture.
good,Starbucks has a great environment and a lot of really cool people to meet throught the job. They provide great partner benefits. Very flexible hours. Kind of has a shortage on hours and wages are low
good,"Needs to have more growth opportunity for existing employees verses reaching out internally for open jobs.  Lack of communication at Vice President levels, they manage up and don't really build below."
good,"I had no issues with he job but management could've been a lot better. Had three store managers within a two year time frame. Was not able to advance in the company even thought I fulfilled all obligations. Managers often played favorites at the work place,"
good,"The work was often hectic and stressful, but my coworkers were patient and easy to work with. I learned a lot about the coffee economy as well as the coffee community in Bristol."
good,The company sets a relaxing environment. The training includes mastering ingredients and recipes. Customer service is mandatory. The company provides high salary.
good,The place was alright for me. The room for upward mobility is slightly stunted by the veteren baristas however it was still an enviorment I ve much enjoied.
good,"Great company for college students. Has health benefits, 401k, stock options, and pays for your college. Pay isn’t the best but for the food industry it is not bad."
good,People were constantly coming and going and there never was a constant group of employees so we constantly had to deal with new people who did not know the job which can be extremely frustrating to say the least. Besides this everything else was great.
good,"A typical day at work would be me clocking in and taking over bar if it was busy. I love coffee so i enjoyed getting to learn about the origins of the beans and the different techniques. It was the type of workplace that allowed for you to form relationships with your coworkers. There was never a dull day. The hard part of the job comes in when you have to constantly deal with difficult customers. Starbucks holds a strong policy of ""the customer is always right"". If you have a temper, do not work here."
good,Starbucks needs to give more labor allowance for high volume stores. Work environment is stressful for employees and managers when they don't need to be.
good,"I learned how to make drinks and the employees were somewhat supportive, but the manger didn't take my school schedule into consideration. It wasn't enjoyable."
good,"I appreciated the training and pace of work at my branch. The hours were fair and I felt like I was able to take the skills I learned as a barista and apply them to future food-service roles. Unfortunately, my manager was a bit overbearing in my personal life and cared more about appearing friendly to customers than making sure things operated smoothly. He also took a month off while I worked at his branch and did not leave instructions or information about upcoming scheduling and date conflicts. While this was frustrating, the managers that took his place from other local branches were great."
good,"It's a good job if you fit in with your fellow partners. It's your coworkers that get you through the day. Dealing with customers can be difficult, as any other customer service position. Making coffee can be a lot of fun though if you take a liking to it! I loved my job but had to leave due to relocation and the new manager not working with a transfer. I would not have wanted to leave if I hadn't moved."
good,"good benefits, can be stressful depends on the location you work at. my store had a new store manger, poor management skill, leading most of the hard worker left this location."
good,"A typical workday consisted of prepping the store to open for business. There are different duties depending on which position you are scheduled to work for that shift. Taking customers' orders, working the registers, brewing coffee, working the espresso machines, working the cold-station machines, working the drive-thru window, stocking shelves, cleaning, inventory, making retail sales of equipment or coffee are some of the duties."
good,"As someone who has a degree in Accounting, Starbucks was only meant to be a part time job where I would be able to collect cash in my pocket to help my parents pay a few bills and to ultimately save up for an automobile. Prior to the opening of a new store which sent my old manager and 90% of the staff away, this was probable. Although my new manager (who lacks company experience but is learning the ropes quite fine) is nice, and the staff on hand is really great, we are overstaffed with barista's and my 3 years of working there and seniority seem to not mean anything as I struggle to get more than 5-10 hours a week, which I deem shameful."
good,Great place to work. Had fun working with staff. During my time there there I had 4 district managers. none of witch were promoted from within.Advancement was non existent
good,You can honestly meet some of the most amazing coworkers/ friends by working at starbucks. The hardest part of the job is having to treated so poorly by the customers. But from being treated like this it teaches you to be the bigger person and let things go easily.
good,"Great for people who want a fast paced environment and willing to gain friendships, learn many new things, make connections with customers and management. Includes tips (varies depending on where you work and how often you work)"
good,"I worked this job through college and felt it worked well with my always changing schedule of classes each semester. Although the pay was not much, It did offer a large amount of benefits to its full time and especially long term employees."
good,"i've met some of the best people working at Starbucks, customers and employees but it is a stressful job. My location was one of the highest volumes stores in the district and stores like that are pretty stressful and I think the volume of transactions doesn't match the pay. But there are also many great benefits to working at Starbucks."
good,"Es una buena empresa donde trabajar, la cultura de protección al colaborador y la calidez y empatía que se imparte es bastante interesante, no en vano pertenecen al grupo de best place to work en  el mundo."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. if you love coffee you will enjoy this job. You will learn more about coffee. If you like face paced work and like coffee this is a good job for you.
good,"fun place to work, learn how to work as a team, sometimes shifts can run long, customers can get nasty(like any other customer service job), lots of extra food safety rules that always need to be kept in mind."
good,"Starbucks can either be a fantastic location to work, or a store with huge turnover that runs on a barely trained team. While I loved my time there without myself and a handful of team members stretching thin, things could have fallen apart."
good,Love my job. Fun fast paced environment. Management needs some work. Focus goals are mostly customer experience and that is a plus. Lots of opportunity for creative expression. Pretty routine.
good,"The company tends to roll out a lot of new features that aren't really practical, or if they are, don't stay promoted long and then the customers get upset that they can't get their limited time fix anymore. Scheduling can be a bit of an issue depending on where you go, but you can work hours at different locations with no issue. Once you get past the customers who take their coffee too seriously (don't complain to me that the coffee is $5, no one here is making you buy it), you get some really nice regulars who make the job worth coming in for. One of my regulars was the reason I was able to take on a school year position of more than double what I made as a barista."
good,"Can be stressful with customers. A good place to work, if working with the right people. Manager not really aware of bad coworkers. All in all pretty good place to work, and learn."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. They provide great benefits, you get to work with amazing people, and they are more than accommodating with school schedules. At times it can be very fast paced and sometimes stressful but that can be true with many customer service jobs."
good,"Overall, I had a positive experience working at Starbucks. We are welcome to share opinions and to be ourselves. With office days once a week, that meant we spent a lot of time on the floor with our Partners (Team Members). That allowed us to feel the pulse of our business, interact with our guests and team. We could easily give feedback to our team and we had tools to acknowledge when someone did a great gesture. "
good,I was a fan of the coffee before I was an employee. I will forever be hooked on Starbucks!!!! I am glad I took this job at Starbucks. Now I know what is going on behind the counter when I order my coffee.
good,"Its definitely a great entry level job. Great benefits, good discounts, flexible hours,  and it is an easy job overall. Wether or not you'll enjoy working at starbucks depends on management and the partners in your particular store."
good,starbucks was a good job overall. the atmosphere is great and every team member always has your back but the cut in hours makes it hard to work there for a living. Its more of a high school part time job.
good,Starbucks or just about any coffee shop in general has a fast paced environment. I never knew there was so much memorization to just coffee itself. Mornings are the busiest time of the day but are the most fun sometimes. I've made so many genuine connections not with just customers but also with the people I work with.
good,"Overall, working for Starbucks was a pleasant experience. The job itself can be quite fast-paced, so multi-tasking is a required skill. Also helps if you are an extrovert, since you deal directly with the public."
good,"It was a fun place to work, if u like fastpace jobs. It could definitely be stressful at times, especially during rush hours. But an overall great environment to work."
good,It is a great place to work at if you are a student or someone looking for decent pay with low hours. It is more beneficial for those looking for a part time job.
good,"I worked at the busiest Starbucks in the southeast, so my typical day was rather hectic. Stress could often run high due to this, but the other employees were certainly a benefit as everyone was very friendly and kind. I also very much enjoyed the culture of Starbucks, as it seemed to me that corporate actually did care about barristas."
good,Worked at ms host contracted Starbucks. Hms host hired me to learn starbucks opened morning shift ...manger was ok . Only two were properly trained . Overall easy great experience
good,"Starbucks allows for advancement and suburb benefits but competition and cooperate environment dictate all aspects of culture and life quality,standards are very high at a management position"
good,"Llevo mas de 5 años en la empresa donde he tenido una serie de beneficios y he podido desarrollarme dentro de ella, sin emabrgo ya se volvio un tanto repetitivo y me gustaria poder encontrar nuevos horizontes donde poder aprender."
good,I did training for this before I got hired so the over all start is easy. I loved at the time how fast it was and enjoyed the people i worked with. I also loved the drinks.
good,"Being a student, they accommodated my schedule. Very good benefits: dental, massages, free coffee or tea every week, free drinks while you're working and discounts when you're off work."
good,"Board range of shift times, flexible scheduling. Diverse work environment. lots of cleaning. standards reign supreme. discounts, free drinks/food during shifts."
good,"The atmosphere at Starbucks and they opportunities/benefits they offer are phenomenal, however, it's hard work and long hours, meaning that the team you work with is completely responsible for how  much you like your  job."
good,I was a partner for a while I wasn't trained very well and was thrown in positions during my training sometimes with no help i got by ok management changed 4 times which caused problems assistant  managers constantly changed even our director our rules changed with each change in power to a point most of the partners that had been there since its opening had either transferred or quit I even had a shift lead leave quit and drive off because one of the many store managers and her expectations now that im no longer a partner i check in with the few that are still there they say that everyday it gets better and im glad because the disorganization was stressful
good,"Starbucks has been a joy to work for. I have met many friends that I know that I will be friends with for a long time. I have learned strengths about myself that I was unaware of before and I have even been able to work on my weaknesses. I enjoy making peoples' day, simply by giving them perfect foam on their latte. And I love learning about how to drive sales and push our partners to be the best they can be."
good,"I have always enjoyed working at Starbucks, the people, the coffee, the culture. Starbucks has always been a sort of safe haven for me since it was my first job and I've met some of my best friends there. It is a fast-paced working environment with the stores I've been to (but not with all stores) the pay is decent, and they give you a lot of benefits."
good,"Every day was fast paced but once you had some experience it wasn't that big of a deal. First month was overwhelming sometimes but my co-workers were very helpful. I worked at the airport so that added some time to my day. The hours were also very early (3am to 11pm) The management was spotty but there were some changes happening at the time. The turn over rate for employees was really high though. "
good,Loved the people I worked with; very supportive and fun to be around. Great team. Excellent work-life balance. Great work environment. Meaningful and impactful work.
good,It was a very good experience working at Starbucks. I've gained a lot of valuable and transferable skills that I can use. Staff were very fun to work with and my Manager was so kind
good,"You will be asked to work in one of about 5 positions. Everyone hired is expected to do grungy physical labor and cleaning as well as memorize all the recipes on the menu. They give you about 3-5 months to get all the drinks down. You will be expected to work during either the morning rush, starting at 6am, or the afternoon rush, about when kids get out of school. Most Starbucks require you to work weekends. The culture is awesome. I've worked at many different locations and at most of them they have a very friendly atmosphere between co-workers. The hardest part of the job is how quickly your expected to finish a cleaning task and move on to the next one. It is a very timed job because during an 8 hour shift there are 30 things to get done on top of being the best you can be for the customers. That is another hard part, being happy for customers and move fast at the same time, even on your bad days. The most enjoyable part of the job is obviously free drinks while you work and being the best part of your regular's day. The health benefits are wonderful."
good,"Working in a coffee shop with free coffee on shift, What's not to love? The staff were fantastic and the customers were just as good. There was always a great time to be had on shift."
good,Starbucks was a nice break for me after graduating college and allowed me to grow in many ways I can now use once I leave. Starbucks taught me how to work in a fast paced and high pressure environment and how to find a solution through chaos.
good,"Fast-paced, you learn about espresso drinks and teas, coffee loves culture. customers can get to you but they also can make your day. best part of the day is seeing customers smile after you make them there drink the way they love it."
good,"When I started out with the company, I loved the people I worked with and what I did, though it was stressful. My new store and manager have me wanting to run. The benefits are great and I only need to work an average of 20 hours a week to have them. "
good,"It's a part-time job, made lots of life-long friends, great first job experience. On your feet basically the whole shift, you do everything that you see in the store."
good,It was a great job fir the time being but my time has come to an end I need to advance in my career and support my son and as a single mom I just need something more that offers more . It's a great job to enter the work place with great benefits but like I said it's time for me to leave the nest after being there for so long and have no desire for a management position
good,"Working the morning shift was terrible, but once the rush was over it was nice. You'll find customers that will make your day, and you'll also encounter people that make you wanna quit right there. But you really grow into the job, once I left I've missed it ever since, I just don't miss being underpaid, stressed out and life falling apart for not being able to pay for much."
good,"In order to be successful in the workplace, baristas must maintain a positive and energized demeanor. Professionalism is a desired quality for all baristas."
good,"Working here was fine, just takes some getting used to. I learned patience, how to get along with unruly customers, and how to make a great cup of coffee."
good,Working at Starbucks actually taught me a lot about how a business is run. The job wasn't difficult and I became fairly good at it. The best part are the workers you eventually become a very close team.
good,Good starting job. Paid every other week with tips on Monday. Made paydays come faster. Nice community of people and relaxed workplace when not overly busy.
good,"As a closer at this location, it was fairly slow paces most of the time, but it could quickly pick up the pace depending on the type of day.. A typical day included servicing customers with different types of foods and beverages. I worked very close to my co workers and manager so we worked well together. I learned fairly quickly of how everything is done, but it can get complicated fairly quickly so lots of questions are asked throughout the day."
good,"Made great memories, great friends and I'll always be grateful for learning how to make all those drinks. It was always interesting to see the diffeence in people before and after they got their drinks they seemed pleased."
good,Starbucks is a very welcoming fun place to work. You get a a solid foundation of what it is to work as a team. It might be a laborsome job but the reward of knowing that you might help to make someones day better by giving them coffee and interacting with them makes aabig difference
good,The south collonade was extremely busy during the mornings. I only worked there for 2 months but it taught me a lot about how to behave and deal in the work environment. They provided all the training and support necessary
good,The location was in an outlet mall in the most touristy part of Orlando. There was a huge language barrier and everyone working there hated the location as well. All but two managers tried to make it a really positive experience for me though. My coworkers were all very nice.
good,"Very fast paced environment during peak hours. Job can be stressful if the day is not properly staffed. Management is not the best., but there is always room for improvement for everyone."
good,Starbucks was my first job. It's a really enjoyable job that doesn't feel too much like work. The most enjoyable thing is being able to interact with a diverse customer base while completing tasks. You never know who might walk into your Starbucks at any given time.
good,Starbucks baristas have it tough learning everyones favorite drinks off the top of their heads and then being able to spin them in any which way they are ordered for impatient consumers who will likely forget that the person making the drink is just as human as them and irately voice their opinion saying so.
good,"You obtain many benefits and discounts, however, as with most corporations they hold a tight grip onto rules and regulations that are out dated or marred with inaccuracies. Management, as with any service industry job has become difficult and within a city such as Philadelphia there is a great deal of staff change over which can become frustrating. Regardless, I have made many friends and on average find myself and my team making productive, positive changes to our store."
good,"Very quick pace, but very nice co workers. Management can be good or bad, I've some very nice store supervisors and some who are over worked and too stressed to be a good leader.  Overall a good part time job for someone in school."
good,"Overall, Starbucks has been a good place to work, however, I am kind of at the end of my advancement at Starbucks.  Starbucks has shifted their views a bit and are putting too many expectations and roles on a single person without staffing for those new expectations."
good,"I'm sure it is far more enjoyable to work at a Starbucks that is not THE busiest location in a major city. Because the store is so busy, a bond is formed with other coworkers. Of course though, working in close proximity with a large number of people, there is an inevitable ""drama"". The hardest workers get the night shifts because they require the most work."
good,The hours of working at starbucks can be daunting. Sometimes you wake up at 245am just to be there until 11pm the following day. Advancement is easy of you work it.
good,i had a lot of fun with it but its fun while you are young with energy and its a fun step up job while you are in school and a tight schedule they are awesome to work around your schedule
good,i love the job as a whole but I had a really bad experience with coworkers and managers. I didn't stay at this job for very long because of that. I love the company though.
good,"The Starbucks bridgelink store is in all honestly, poorly managed, an unsafe working environment (Too cramped, and temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius) and you have to pay full price for you own parking up to 20 minutes walk away from the job. However, the people you work with are almost always lovely and a joy to work with and the customers are usually friendly and happy for a chat."
good,There is not enough money to live off. For Starbucks to be a better place to work there needs to be a balance of basic salaries and benefits. The benefits are great and this is a great start to the world of Adult hood but for those who have started working there after becoming an adult there is just not enough money to sustain life in a manner that will benefit them and their families. This is a great secondary income.
good,This job was a really good experience. I would recommend this job to anyone who loves to be around people. Great benefits and great pay. There is nothing not to like about it.
good,The culture at Starbucks is very familial and close knit. There is a sense that they care about your future at the company and want to help you learn.
good,"You come to enjoy everyday because you never know how your day will be. That is the hardest part of the job, but also the best. There is never a dull day at Starbucks, you can always find something to do. You not only learn how to make drinks, but you learn about people, working with them and serving them. You will have great shifts and managers and terrible shifts and managers. However, in the end, they balance each other out and if not you can always transfer to another store, they are on every corner. Do not get caught up in the details."
good,"Working at Starbucks is usually enjoyable, not at all a bad job. A typical day would include cashiering, barring and a lot of cleaning. I learned how to create interesting small talk from whatever was relevant to the customer at hand. Management in truth is an issue in most of them, theres always a lot of dissent among staff and issues with new and learning leaders."
good,"Opening is really brutal if you're not a morning person (i.e. waking up at 4 am). The hardest part is dealing with entitled customers. Contrary to popular belief the customer is NOT always right. Making drinks eventually becomes muscle memory and the first 3 months are usually the most stressful. Making it past that means you can probably handle anything. The best part of the job is the coworkers. Most every store is like a family and its easy to make friends and integrate into the ""barista lifestyle."" Benefits are awesome. Free coffee all shift (blessing and a curse). All around great company to work for."
good,Loved the coworkers I had. Great experience and great place to learn new skills. Management was not the best with training and communication but hours were flexible and accommodating
good,"On a store by store basis, Starbucks is a great company to work for. You get good benefits, decent pay, and meet a bunch of nice people. The major downside of Starbucks as a company is that corporate is tending towards stricter and stricter labor usage, usually resulting in your store being understaffed most of the time. This in addition to the trend away from the classic coffeehouse feel and a new business model focused on mobile ordering; is causing us as partners to have to focus on individual drinks, and getting them out quickly; rather than focusing on customer interactions. Normally this would be fine, except corporate is not budging on customer relations at all. They expect us to be able to get drinks out quickly, while having meaningful interactions with the customers, all while being understaffed; all while introducing more and more drinks which require significantly more work than the others."
good,"It's a good company that works with you, not against you. They hardly ever give more than 20 hours a week so it's definitely not a place to make decent cash. Management is great.I sometimes feel overwhelmed and understaffed. Corporate has unrealistic expectations of how long closing the store should. The people are the ones that make work a lot of fun. All-in-all, a good place to work."
good,"Constantly busy, which is enjoyable"
good,Excellent learning environment with many opportunities from retail store operations to outside sales.  Starbucks culture is top-notch and high expectations are set in producing best-in-class individual and team performance.
good,"A company that encourage positivity and passion towards your goals,"
good,"This was a fun job. I never thought I'd enjoy making drinks all day and warming up pastries but I did. And after only a short time there, I got promoted to Lead Barista which was great. I trained new employees and actually enjoyed it."
good,"It is a retail job. There will be times that can be frustrating. There will be times where the job is enjoyable. Management varies with each store. Fellow coworkers are mostly enjoyable to work with. While there are some bad customers, most are very appreciative of your work/service which makes the job worthwhile"
good,It was a good part time job with great benefits. I learned to work with many diverse people and serve a multitude of customer bases. I had no desire to advance so for me it was an easy non stressful job
good,Working for Starbucks allowed me to learn how to keep a level head during a huge amount of pressure. Seeing a line of customers out the door and 20+ cups does not stress me out like it would have a year ago.
good,Buena empresa enfocada a la venta de café en grano y bebidas. Busca que el cliente en cada visita obtenga la mejor experiencia combinando la cultura del café y la vida cotidiana.
good,"The culture could have been better. Management would not take disagreements among employees very seriously, and many employees could be lazy and selfish. But the pay was good, and the schedule was flexible with school and classes."
good,"I enjoyed working at several stores in southern California, mainly for the customers and good compensation management offers to all baristas. The best part had to be the regular customers we saw every day and chatting through the drive through box was fun. Hardest part was the first few weeks catching up with rapid fire orders and long lines every day but you get the motions down eventually."
good,Challenging and motivational company to work for.. always trying to get you to strive for your best. This is a great place to move up and forward in your career.
good,"I always had fun at Starbucks. It was a busy place, especially in the mornings and that was difficult, but my store was filled with good people and we laughed and enjoyed ourselves. We also had regular customers and I enjoyed that, having regulars whose orders you knew by heart and you could great like old friends when they walked through the door."
good,Starbucks was my first job and i didn't realize how good it was until i had other jobs. the training is concise and sufficient. the benefits are available at 20 hours and the discounts are good. speed is the key if you can make a drink with love and care and not just slap a drink together fast you will go far. 8/10 would work again.
good,"When you have a great team with you, anything can be achieved. From sales goals to target food sales per hour. You learn a lot about moments of connections and the hardest part about brewing coffee was getting the filters apart."
good,"Super flexible hours and locations. good benefits. don't expect to pay rent, buy a car, and food working as a Barista. Store can be crazy During morning and after school rushes."
good,"Amazing benefits, beyond amazing. Hugely flexible schedule. Corporate is very big on employee feedback; if you're having an issue and aren't getting support at the store level, corporate will step in if they need to to resolve it. Fast paced environment, great co workers no matter where you work. Easy transfer process and easy to pick up shifts at other stores. Standards are the same at every store."
good,It's a great first job for someone who has never worked before and is looking for part time while in school or doing other activities. Always a good atmosphere.
good,"Very good for college student and people going back to school. Not the best if looking to promote and advance. Some stores move a lot faster than others, but overall fun job."
good,"It wasn't a bad job, things can get hectic at times but the people you meet are incredible. I love this job at the end of the day. Benefits are awesome and you get to meet wonderful customers."
good,"I've really enjoyed working at Starbucks at Winter Park. It's been great getting to know people from all walks of life, being creative and interacting with resort employees. The environment is positive and upbeat and the girls work great together as a team! "
good,Depending on how busy your store is determines how hard your job will be. Busier stores are extremely physically demanding. Customers can be pretty hard to handle and there is a lot to learn and keep up with. The thing that keeps you there is the coffee and the employees.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. Great benefits. Coffee. Fun coworkers. Volunteer opportunities. Tuition reimbursement. Health benefits and STOCK! What more could you ask for?
good,"At Starbucks I would be given different roles through the day including, cleaning up, working on the till, teaching others and making beverages. I enjoyed this role a lot as I was in a very sociable environment and got to interact with new people every day, meeting some very nice people. The job was very fast paced and being on the motorway, a lot of people wanted a fast service, which I had to provide. I have had shifts where I would be working alone and trusted to complete the job to high standards."
good,Good place to work during studies or temporarily but not engaging enough for people looking for a challenge. Can be very busy at weekends and during holidays.
good,The job had the potential to be a good experience but the downtown city location cause a lot of problems and we were constantly having to call the police
good,My job as a Starbucks Barista in the BNA Airport is always productive and steady. The goal is to make specialty drinks for every customers' requests. Working in the Airport I'm able to meet all people of all cultures.
good,You learn a lot about coffee and to tell the differences between blends. This helps to educate the customer and introduce them to new flavors instead of their usual beverage
good,"I have been with Starbucks for almost 10 years. The company has treated me well.  I have great insurance with them, yet I have found that they rarely hire store managers from within the company and seem to hire from outside of the company.  I would love to be a store manager but my district manager seems to play favorites and the new managers that seem to come on board have no idea how Starbucks as a company works. It takes more than the love of coffee to work here."
good,"Starbucks as a corporation is pretty good to work for. Excellent benefits, easy to get time off if you plan ahead, easy to get your schedule needs met. It's great for students."
good,"A fast paced environment that holds the benefits of still being able to uphold a sense of legendary customer service and incredibly tasting coffee.The job itself is not difficult, but can get hectic at certain times of the day. Starbucks has standards in order to maintain efficiency and beverage quality. Management is very flexible with school schedules including extracurricular activites for those who are involved. Starbucks' culture is to create moments with customers and maintain its world renowned LEGENDARY customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to connect with customers and being able to put a smile on their face with a quality refreshing beverage."
good,This is a great transition job when in school. flexible hours make it a breeze to make money on the side while going through school. If you like coffee its a bonus.
good,"Starbucks was a positive environment where you were able to meet new people, earn benefits and also advance in their ranks. Company was very fair and encouraged growth."
good,"I loved working and Starbuck and working in a team. The only thing I did not enjoy is the stress and excessive pressure. The job obviously has it's peak and slow hours, which make it a fun and dynamic work environment."
good,"Working at Starbucks, is like working at home. My co workers were like family. My love for coffee was shared and I got to talk to coffee lovers all day."
good,"Starbucks is ideal for a student at university trying to make some extra money on the side. There is usually flexibility in scheduling your shifts, and Starbucks even offers certain benefits to their part-time employees."
good,"Was an ok job for 1 year, got depressing and frustrating year 2 through 4. Issues with short staff, issues with co workers, and customers were rude and entitled. Shift managers didn't receive tips."
good,"Multiple shifts to fit anyone's schedule, plenty of chances to learn new and exciting skills. It's fun to get to know regular customers and coworkers. Overall company management leaves something to be desired, but the company is taking steps to improve that with a long drawn out plan to change customer service and store management."
good,"Typical day involved working wither morning or evening shift. Morning involves ""opening"" the store - preparing the store in order to open for the day: ensure coffee is brewed, pastry case stocked, fridges stocked with dairy/non-dairy products, etc. Evening shifts included ""closing"" tasks - cleaning, taking stock, emptying pastry case, etc."
good,"Awesome people, great environment, amazing options for food and drink, nice people, ok management, ok with advancing into higher roles, needs more commitment from employees"
good,"Fun place to work, a lot of the managers are not capable of their jobs due to bad communication and leadership skills.Benefits are fantastic and perks are great!"
good,"Although, I do believe this company has great benefits for many different aspects of life, it is not what it seems depending on your store location. I personally would like to be able to focus less on how fast we produce things and more on making better experiences for our customers. This is something that my current manager focuses little on because drive through window times are more important than overall experience. To me, this is not ethically correct."
good,"Its decent pay and very easy to move up if you have what it takes. You are asked a lot of but sometimes it's just worth it. You get decent discount and free coffee when on your on shift.. which is always helpful doing an opening."
good,"I loved my job  management could be difficult at times, but my fellow co workers were great.  must work as a team because can get busy and stay that way all day!!"
good,its nice to make customized coffee to customers and be part of their everyday life. When you get to know the customer they become your friends eventually.
good,If you enjoy a great flexibility in your schedule and a lot of benefits then Starbucks is pretty good. Co-workers are usually good and management is typically hired from within. Hardest part could be dealing with difficult customers
good,"High paced, fun co-workers, prepare you well, but can be very stressful at times. Need to know how to manage and adapt. Management was alright, but good when everyone worked as a team."
good,Meet new people everyday and drink all the coffee your stomach can handle! Starbucks is a great place to take your first step into the workforce. Beware...people can be grumpy before drinking their coffee!
good,Training is easy and informative. The sandwich making is a little lengthy however over all Starbucks is a nice place to work. All staff are friendly and seem happy.
good,"Its a very fast paced work environment but once you get the drink recipes down you start to get into the way of it. It is a fairly easy job and can be a lot of fun if you're working with the right people, though baristas tend to be a little bi*chy."
good,"Job is very easy and enjoyable. I loved being able to connect with customers on a daily basis, and having fun with my coworkers while delivering great customer service at the same time. I believe in Starbucks culture, but I believe management don't care for baristas as much."
good,"A typical day at work was normally a non-stop day, lines as long as a football field on a normal summer day for hours. I learned how to deal with and serve all types of people. Management was very unprofessional but where they lacked myself and my coworkers picked up the slack."
good,"The biggest thing with Starbucks is fluctuations in hours. You could work 35 hours one week, then next week work 25. Consistency was a big thing that lacked there."
good,"I would have stayed at Starbucks but it wasn't enough money to take care of my kid.Besides that, it's a great company to work for! Highly recommended!"
good,"Worked at starbucks for 4 years, great benefits and builds a culture around employees. Bit of a brainwashing type of place but overall not bad. Management varies from location to location but my most recent manager shouldn't be in customer service she was just always miserable."
good,"I really enjoyed working in this fast paced environment. I was always able to pick up shifts or work at other stores if I wanted to. Pay was OK, and the coffee was a great perk. Starbucks treats their employees very well."
good,"Cool Job. I worked in a kiosk so I was by myself most of the time when I did work with my co-workers they were super cool. Management was typical, no strong pros or cons."
good,I am employed at a target based starbucks. The management is terrible and that is why I am seeking for employment elsewhere. If it would be more than one person during my shift then im pretty sure I would be more than happy to stay at my job.
good,"Working at starbucks was very good, it had busy periods and quiet periods meaning that you could do your cleaning tasks in the quieter times. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle difficult situations. It was a very friendly environment and you're more of all a team rather than the partners and then the manager. meeting customers was one of the best parts of the job but sometimes some can be difficult and it makes it more of a difficult experience."
good,Used to be amazing to work there but things have drastically changed over time and many long time partners have left. Labor cuts have hurt us and a coffee company had turned into a company that focuses on frappuccinos and instagram friendly drinks but will not allow us the extra people to keep up with the changes if a new focus on those sorts of drinks.
good,"good starting job, some nice people, good training. Pay could be better. Nice getting free coffee each week. Good hours. Would be nice to improve on the pay."
good,I learned a large amount about all the products offered at Starbucks as well as the origin of the coffee beans sourced for the different roasts.  The hardest part of the job was during late night rushes and keeping track of everything ordered.  The most enjoyable part was the companionship.
good,It's a great place to work enjoy great food the people just a little things that need fixed in the way they treat people but other than that great money great people some people great general manager HR need to work on things Starbucks managers need to work on a lot of things great banquet servers great people great banquet managers all chef
good,"Depending on the leaders of the store, one can have an exceptional experience working for this company, yet some managers may put profit in front of their staff, treating them with little respect. In addition, the benefits of working for this company do not exceed the pay of wage, nor do they fit the type of work we strive to put in to our daily experiences. We strive to excel in speed, efficiency, and excellence, yet are not treated with the rewards that we deserve for our work ethic. Starbucks has great mottos, such as ""Be welcoming, be knowledgeable, be considerate"", etc. These are great mottos to have and I believe this company enstills great work ethic and customer service traits, yet depending on the district manager or store manager, work and team morale can be quite low."
good,"Management needs some overall work, but the dedication of each barista is truly inspiring. Meeting a dynamic group of people with different interests and great personalities."
good,"It was a very fun place to work for. I met a lot of people and I enjoyed every second I was there. I am a people person and I love helping others. Even though the management team wasn't 100% good, my coworkers were awesome!"
good,"I enjoy working in the fast paced environment. Management could be better, current manager has issues with many employees but all other employees are friendly and easy to work with. I do wish that Starbucks offered more benefits to their employees, every coffee shop I know offers discounts to employees when they are off the clock or at another store and Starbucks does no such thing. The only ""perk"" is a free drink at the end of your shift. It has helped me with fast thinking and memorization skills."
good,"Do not work here if you are a bad test taker. You will be expected to take a barista exam which can make or break you depending on how well you do under pressure. How nice this place is to work is entirely dependent on your location. Each location develops its own culture and, if you land at the wrong one, you won't last long."
good,"I love the company itself, although it is hit or miss with your store manager. The hardest part are the early mornings, the best part is all the free stuff."
good,"Fast past but yet so mellowed"
good,"I loved working at starbucks! its fast paced and challenging but you build a little family with your coworkers and everyone helps everyone. the only reason i left was the pay was a little low, but theres plenty of ways around that. you can pick up shifts at different stores in your area if needed."
good,Starbucks is a corporate job.  They have a come a long way since I worked there in terms of individual expression for workers.  I miss the health insurance.
good,"I love the family culture at Starbucks, but managers often are disconnected to the staff's needs. I loved this job but my manager was adding unfair work on to my already busy shifts."
good,"Bonne ambiance, possibilité d'évolution, bonne expérience"
good,"A typical work day for a shift supervisor involves more stress than typically desired.  The people, customers and coworkers, are great, occasionally you get the generic rude customer but all in all it isn't too terrible.  There's a significant amount of responsibilities asked of the shift supervisors in a given time frame and depending on the scheduling or business, it may or may not be realistic to complete and it does get overwhelming to try and ""do it all"".  Usually running one-man short so everyone is exhausted, breaks sometimes get missed or is very late, but the teamwork and cohesion is incredible, everyone tries to help each other through the tough times."
good,Great company. I feel cared about by the people above me. One thing I don't love is the amount of hands on and heads up on new roll out items. We are just thrown into them with limited knowledge.
good,flexible hours for students. you can pick up shifts at other stores if you needed more hours. depending on your manager you can be scheduled from 4-8 hour shifts.
good,While being a student this was a really good place for me to work but when I started needing benefits for myself after a serious car accident that was impossible because of my position as a barista but overall management was always willing to help and the work place was always welcoming
good,This was a fun place to work that allowed you to be creative and energetic. I loved the people I worked with as well as what I was doing every day. The customers were the best part of the experience.
good,"Overall a great place to work, just depends on who your store manager is. Make sure you communicate your availability clearly to them so there won't be any misunderstandings."
good,"My location was extremely busy, line out the door every saturday and sunday. This combined with management scheduling all new people on those two days, management not communicating with lower level members of staff or being present in the store regularly made for a stressful work experience. Only other complaint was that there wasn't enough transparency between upper management and shift leads."
good,"Good if you get the right store manager, if not it can be rough. Requires hard work and ability to move competently fast, and a lot of memory to make a mass amount of drinks."
good,I loved the people that I worked with and I learned so many valuable leadership skills during my tenure here.  The Store Manager role is very challenging and extremely fast paced at all times.  Senior leadership doesn't seem to understand the nature of the challenges and continues to cut costs and add complexity to the role.
good,"I LOVE working at Starbucks. It has really helped me grow as a person in the past year. It is very fast paced and older baristas WILL breathe fire onto you if you do not catch on quick, but once you're in you're in then it's like you have your own place in the family. There are always chances to move up in the company, at least in district. I think Starbucks is a great way to enter the coffee world if you don't know anything about coffee, espresso, etc . I have a new found love for coffee culture because of this job, and I used to NEVER drink coffee. "
good,"Very fast paced and hectic place to work. The majority of the customers are in a hurry. So having the ability to adapt and pay attention to a person's specific wants and needs for a customized drink are not only difficult, but also very rewarding as much they are important. Seeing customers satified and being able to make their day a little better is one of the best parts though. It is very team oriented and driven. If one person is making mistakes it can slow the whole operation down."
good,They're wonderful with their benefits. The hours are severely limited and it rare that we have enough people on the floor to make operations run smoothly.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They provide benefits, stock options and a generally great culture. However, the management is very focused on increasing sales and you are always under constant pressure to sell more to customers."
good,"At Starbucks the work is busy and hard and the job is always changing. There is always a new drink or set to be taken care of. The benefits are great if you're looking for free coffee when you work, healthcare and free college tuition if you're willing to take online classes. The overall pay isn't as high as expected and the area I work at is extremely low in terms of tips/hour. The smiles on your regulars faces is what really make the job worth it and seeing how happy a cup of coffee can make someone."
good,"A surprisingly demanding job. Your enjoyment and experience is VERY dependent on your team. Customers can suck, but dont let them bother you. On the whole, a very good workplace."
good,"Great company to work for. Typical day is 20% off the floor doing management activity, 80% barista work. I learned how to better balance my time with strict constraints. Management is a solid choice with a people-friendly workplace culture. The hardest part is managing your time, the most enjoyable is seeing regulars on a daily basis."
good,"Good company to work for, it does have a few flaws like any other company. The people I work with and the  amazing customers is what makes the job great."
good,Ik heb geleerd om bij Starbucks klantvriendelijk te zijn en wat het betekend om altijd de klant tevreden de winkel te laten vertrekken. Ik heb veel geleerd en was ook erg blij met de mogelijkheid om door te kunnen groeien.
good,Good coffee. Great culture. Employees were a pleasure to work with. We maintained a great atmosphere for our customers to come and relax or do whatever projects/work they had to do.
good,"In the beginning, you learn a lot. Making different type of drinks, daily routines, opening and closing. Most of the days it's nice and to succeed in your shifts, teamwork with your crew is the key. Overall, its a great starting job for people who have no experiences on customer service."
good,Great company to work! If you want to advice or move-up you have to make that known to your manager and take the necessary steps to do so. You drive your own development.
good,"I love Starbucks as a company. They treat their employees with respect and care. The benefits are amazing. However, I am looking for more career growth. I am also in college and pay my own rent, and my manager can not guarantee even shift supervisors full time lately. I also want to build my career/use my degree, and Starbucks sadly, is just a job for me. I feel improvements could be mad in management, hours and pay. Taught me a lot about working under stress and people/communication skills."
good,"Decent pay, but not a career, really should be for paying bills while finding a real job. The company is run decent enough, but the customers can be very particular and there are some high stress situations daily"
good,great work environment and growth for their employees. You will be able to learn more about coffees and will develop you on your full potential. Will challenge you to excel in your field and discover more interesting about job.
good,"Loved working there, great benefits and they care about partners. my management was a little bad but Starbucks itself is a great company to work for!!"
good,"Something for everyone. Busy stores for the active and community stores for the laid back. Generally safe environment, good culture and easily accessible."
good,Great school to learn how a successful business looks like. Great sense of community/friendship. benefits are great and plus you get a free pound of coffee every week and free drinks on your shifts.
good,"It's a great place to work for. Very enthusiastic environment, along with diverse and challenging complications that motivate you more each day. Also, wonderful place to work when you love human interaction, everyone is quite pleasant for the most part."
good,Working with Starbucks is great. Its fun and challenging. Only thing is working for the number 1 store in the state takes a toll at times in a tourist area. Its great.
good,"New Hyde Park Starbucks is a very fast-paced, stressful environment. My coworkers are what really make the job somewhat enjoyable. Management is very flexible with scheduling, which is great."
good,I love working at Starbucks and I really don't say that about most jobs. I honestly admire my partners enhancement on customer service. Partners for life ❤️
good,It was a good place to work with great people you get to know over the years.  The beginning of my time working there it was very strict and business orientated where things was getting done.  They worked with my schedule around my school days and great benefits.  It was a great experience where I learned to work with people and employees.
good,"Dagen zijn vaak kort. Gezellige mensen om je heen. Elke 2 uur zou er een andere positie voor je zijn alleen kan dit vaak door drukte niet waargemaakt worden. "
good,"Always enjoyed my work. Always worked with great people and interacted with fascinating customers (this was however all in a different country but I have no doubt it is the same everywhere). Great job, great benefits."
good,Average day would be making beverages or cleaning the work area. Providing a third place environment was key. Making beverages is of course the fun part!
good,"Empresa seria, comprometida con el cliente y sus trabajadores. Facilidades horarias, especialmente con estudiantes."
good,"Every Starbucks is kind of different, but there's always an inviting atmosphere. Team work and being a unit is very important to Starbucks, which in turn make working at Starbucks more enjoyable."
good,I had a great Time there I had to move state so it ended on a good note I had made many friends there (including some customers 😊) . I had also gained my closest friends a position at my location . Loved my boss awesome workers !
good,"Handling customers order by educating or sharing the coffee knowledge. Identity potential customer in order to up sell company products. Build a strong relationship with customer by following up their preferences. It is a fun workplace where you can actually work with people from different background and this strengthen my language (English, Malay, Chinese & Cantonese). This job also requires multi-tasker that able to work under high pressure environment as you need to achieve daily sales that targeted by the management team. Overall, this job is where you can meet people from different background and it able helps you to improve your social network and sharpen your social skills."
good,"The Sbux Culture in infectious in all the best ways. "
good,"Busy, with many customer interactions. Great results are very achievable with the lead of our hard working shift supervisors. "
good,"Starbucks offers wonderful employment for college students and others interested in part-time, low responsibility work. However, the moment you enter management-level work, the stress and expectations are far to high compared to the compensation received. The men in this area are far more likely to be promoted and receive higher wages than the women. The district manager sees to that."
good,"Great experien ce at first an slowy it became draining, more strict, giving less hours, an unprofessiional. I did although gain the partner of the month award, an a cou ple other awards"
good,"If you can bite your tongue, and love coffee. This is the job for you. Best part is you could have a drink as many times while you are working."
good,"Its a good place to work if you wish to work in a fast paced environment, and with lots interactions. "
good,"Busy, always a line and very demanding customers, which is to be expected. Since I worked alone it gave a me a sense of managerial experience, improvement of time management and multitasking."
good,"Working in Starbucks taught me a lot of valuable skills, sometimes a bit mismanaged though. Overall I think people in Starbucks care about their workers."
good,"its quite hard to work at starbucks at first. i learned how to make a simple coffee, and i learned the culture of coffee. and it is easy to make friends with customers."
good,"Las aperturas tenian que ser muy rapidas "
good,This company taught me the definition of customer service. As a supervisor I was given numerous responsibilities as a generally young individual and excelled due to their proper training and evaluations.
good,"Senior Shift Supervisor :"
good,I enjoyed my experience at Starbucks. The employees were wonderful and the management very dedicated. The experience was great but the pay a bit discouraging.
good,"De grande opportunités de développement chez Starbucks Coffee. En tand que manageur, on a est une vision globale sur l'activité. En effet, on s'ocuppe de passer les commandes du salon, reception de livraison, Gestion du personnel et du cash ( Recette quotidienne) , Management... Notre tache est très varié, on en apprend tous les jours. Partage de la culture du café."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. You meet amazing people and create lasting memories! A typical day at work for me was coming in at 11:30 am and doing the stock and cleaning. Then i hop onto bar or the till and go from there. I learned how to create delicious drinks and connect with customers. I learned true patience when it comes the a very complicated drink and a busy day. Starbucks workplace culture is very welcoming and chill. The hardest part of the job that i can think of would probably be the customers. Any face to face customer service job can be telling sometimes. You always have a few grumpy people a day, but the mass majority are very happy to see me and happy to get there fix of caffeine for the day! The most enjoyable part if the job would be the fun I have with my coworkers! Ive always had a great time at any Starbucks I've worked at."
good,Everyday offers something different. I work with a diverse crew that delivers world class customer service. I am always learning more about how best to lead a team.
good,"A great company to work for with good benefits, but work load is very overwhelming and can begin to weigh you down. Not rewarded for the hard work you do, so don't expect any pats on the back for going above and beyond."
good,"Starbucks can be a great second job for people or students. If however you are trying to make rent, it is very hard to completely pay it with this job."
good,Workplace was full of friendly co-workers and learned a lot about how to interact with customers. I have learned how to make coffee and features of different types of coffee .
good,"Ingressei no trabalho com experiencias básicas, e com o tempo consegui obter facilidade de comunicação e flexibilidade com os colegas da empresa, me esforçava cada vez mais para dar o melhor de mim, acredito eu que um trabalho só se torna difícil se você não souber ter o controle de tudo oque você esta fazendo, por tanto eu sempre conclui com meus objetivos para que eu pudesse crescer em 8 meses dentro da empresa."
good,"It has a great workplace culture and put importance on the values it promotes on all partners. Salary and Benefits are ""enough"" but expect high workload as a challenge. "
good,It's a good job if you like to be in a fast paced environment and a team of great people but keep in mind people are impatient and do not like to wait for a small period of time
good,"Long hours with multiple days in a row. Upper management will hide behind the image created in the media about employee relations. If you love those who you directly work with, you'll be fine. They become you family. You see them a lot!"
good,Typical day of the job involves many interactions and lots of lattes. the hardest part of the job is multitasking. I learned how to balance work and play all in one place
good,I really enjoyed the fast paced production and community feel of family oriented environment. Gaining both friends and customers along the way is well worth it alone.
good,"Very fast pace environment to work in, all workers were very professional and treated one another with respect making customers want to come back just because of the experience they were given."
good,"Working at Starbucks was always challenging but we always worked as a team. On a daily basis managing store operations, partner development while delivering exceptional customer service. Training partners was difficult but getting to know my customers on a personal level was the greatest."
good,"Ik leerde enorm veel over leiderschap, bedrijfsstructuur, koffie (origine, brewing methods, bereiding, pairing), groepsdynamiek... "
good,I love the culture that Starbucks has to offer but the quality of a lot of the store has slowly fallen. I spent almost 9 years with brand and it had its moments. Ultimately I made the decision to leave due to management and the lack of motivation from its employees.
good,"Depends on the manager you get fantastic job with a good one can kinda suck with a bad one."
good,"Great company for first time workers. Teaches many job skills and is a fast paced job. The management on the other hand is terrible. The store manager clearly onlycares about the work and not the workers. Id recommend Starbucks to anyone for a job, but just not this location."
good,"Công việc linh hoạt"
good,"Starbucks is a busy, exciting place to work. The environment as a customer is admirable and the customer service is great, but as an employee it can be very challenging to adhere to all guidelines without becoming too stressed out. We are compensated well through tips and many benefits.  I love working at starbucks as a temporary job until I complete college. It is a great part time or full time position for someone with a love for coffee and customers."
good,I enjoy working with co-workers and providing the best customer service possible.  I enjoy being a barista because I am fast and efficient at making drinks during rushes. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers who are ignorant and rude.
good,"Very fast paced, customer oriented. I love most of my coworkers and the customers, especially the regulars, always make for great times. Management of my location isn't the best, there are too often scheduling issues that shouldn't have ever come about in the first place. However, I have loved learning about coffee and the culture of Starbucks. There are great benefits: free coffee, 401k, health benefits, and 30% discount."
good,It is a place to work and grow. The boss is sweet and it's a place to get yourself together and learn the basics. It's better than Burger King that's for sure.
good,Starbucks overall cares about their employees with benefits and additional options for the employee.  The overall change in daily activities keeps everyone on their toes
good,I love Starbucks and everything about who they are and what they stand for.  Wonderful place to grow a healthy stable career.  I have loved every minute of my 10+ years.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks very much. It was an exciting experience which I shared with great co-workers and customers. The workload was demanding, requiring a lot of energy and exact work. I loved that people depended on to get through there day."
good,"Starbucks is great at fitting to your schedule whether it is early days, short shifts, etc. But the real plus is the benefits, health, stocks, free coffee, tuition reimbursement. The pay is good for a part time job but not something that you can live off of comfortably."
good,"Lots of customer service with a smile! I learned how to balance many tasks and prioritize between them. It was a very busy job that required full engagement to do the job right. I learned a lot from this job and it helped to have the management that I did. The hardest part of this job was the continuous mind numbing customer service in the early mornings, but the best part was also the continuous customer service. I enjoyed being the smiling connection that helps others jump start their morning and get their day going."
good,Starbucks is a very fun and active place to work. You work together with a team of people you love and help create a third place from home for customers.
good,"starbucks really makes employee happy and enthusiastic all the time to work towards customer needs . We make people happy everyday and also my responsibility is make both of them happy ( employees and customers ) ."
good,"Daily working hours is not enough and not worth to go back and forth, especially without proper transportation, as they only give part-time hours. Most enjoyable part of the job though is that there's a lot of benefits."
good,"Mid Valley is the most busiest outlet in Kuala Lumpur, so that I lacking of time to learn and do the hot beverages. Overall, it's a good place for any hospitality personnel to learn about coffee knowledge from the type of coffee beans and to what extend an espresso can lead to."
good,"I would recommend Starbucks as a first job for anyone. It teaches you great customer service, problem solving and multi tasking skills. Typically a fast paced environment, working at Starbucks will keep you busy and help develop bonds with customers and employees."
good,"Loved working here , the employees made it worthwhile . Management fell short and was poor at times but loving environment.  Allows you be completely be yourself and have a little fun."
good,"The best thing about working at Starbucks is the ability to build and maintain rapport with customers. We're encouraged to have conversations and learn about the people who come in. We joke with our customers, tell the occasional story, and listen about what's going on in their daily lives. That we are able to make them feel like people and not just a transaction really builds moral, at least for me. "
good,"To be brief, I've had a blast working as a barista at Starbucks. The hours are very flexible, people are very nice, and the benefits are great. The only downside is that it is fast paced, and it can be stressful. This is a great job for students trying to juggle work and school."
good,trust me you need to be able to work under pressure. Its an okay job for the average young adult. the atmosphere is very busy. Constant work providing great service to customers
good,"My review of Starbucks was that each day was different. Some days could be incredibly difficult, while others were more easygoing."
good,It's not often you see a corporation investing back into there communities and in to the environment and that is one of the things that I love about Starbucks.  Another astonishingly nice thing is that no matter what location you work you are a part of a community with a lot of open communication.  Starbucks is a very positive and uplifting place to work.
good,i learned how to be professional and to build my life. The hardest part of my job is to failed my targets... My most enjoyable part of my job is if my customer satisfied my service and left me a wonderful smile.
good,"I could honestly say I learned a lot working there. Managers there was okay, easy to talk to. the coworkers there was nice and always fun to be around."
good,"if u love Coffee you will love Starbucks, been a while since i worked there, but to let everyone knows its a great place to work, amazing staff, friendly, kind, super helpful"
good,"Typical shift was from 3:30-5:30. This job refined my customer relation skills, I feel much more confident in talking to customers and suggesting products based off of that customers preference and experiences with products. My manager for this job wanted her employees to remember origins of pastry ingredients and that was a bit difficult to do especially because it was never a question that came up. I enjoyed crafting drinks but most of all connecting with customers and my coworkers."
good,Go to my scheduled store visits. Work with partners to ensure highest quality of drinks being served. Highest level of customer service standards are being met. That the store cleanliness is at the highest level. Work with manager on ways to build sales.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me clocking in and everyone on staff dumping everyone else's responsibility on me to catch up the store in what we were behind on. Constantly understaffed, I learned how to multi-task and work under pressure with deadlines and quotas that needed to be met. Co-workers were lazy or clueless as to how to due their job, even the more vetted employees who had been working with the company longer than myself. Hardest part of working their, was the ""political correctness"" agenda of the company. What made it worth sticking with the job was the benefits."
good,I wish Starbucks had more structured hours. Shift work is hard for people with families. Great for younger people but once you have kids its too hard to maintain the hours.
good,Accommodating with your schedule. Teamwork is key to make the customer's visit a easy experience. The regular customers are nice.
good,This job was a lot of fun because you never could get bored because there were always people that needed to be waited on. Everyday was different because of different customers and also different promotions that were going on throughout the company.
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for a while now, and I must say it is a good company to work for. Although customers sometimes abuse Starbucks employees, Starbucks as a company does take care of their employees and try to make the best experience for them. The hardest part about working for Starbucks in my opinion is dealing with different managers and their management styles."
good,"A typical day is full of fast paced service and above average customer interaction. One also has to have the ability to work well with others who may odor may not be on the same level, based on skills, so that they compliment each other in a way that is supportive and effective in getting the job done by providing the service to the public, accurately and swiftly."
good,"I worked at my starting location for a year before I moved across the country and transferred stores. I LOVED my first store. I had a regular schedule and always had two days off in a row. It was clean, everyone worked hard and had a good time and took pride in their jobs. This store's schedule is so irregular, I'm working closes and 6am shifts in the same week. I have weird days off like Saturday and Tuesday. It's filthy and nothing is done to company standard. I've never even thought about quitting Starbucks until this store, now I resist the urge to walk out every day."
good,Starbucks is a great place for college students to gain experience in the working world. Benefits are really good and raises are given once or twice a year.
good,I worked at Starbucks for almost and 2 years and I loved it my managers are really helpful and great to work with and my co-workers are all wonderful and hard workers
good,"working here you meet a lot of cool people. Both working with and serving. I had such a cool group of coworkers, very understanding and helpful. Even a bit silly at times which could be a much needed relief from the chaos that comes from working there. "
good,"The typical shift supervisor ALWAYS has too much on their plate. Those who make lists and lists for their lists. A major focus on accountability and time management. This is definately a place for those who thrive in faced paced, high stress environment. Many long-lasting connections made through this job, both personal and professional. Schedule flexibility is a MUST! Early mornings, late nights!"
good,"Although the company has its many benefits which include medical, dental, vision, life insurance, 401K,  and pension the hourly compensation does not substantiate the work load level nor take into account the amount of stress this job produces.  The CEO does a great job of making his employees feeling valued but needs to focus on more practical applications of actually running a store."
good,"The core ethics that Starbucks backs are great and they can help create a relaxing, fun and fulfilling workplace. What kills the enjoyability is the low number of partners that Starbucks allows on the floor and the high stress of performance they require isn't congruent with pay or understanding.  The workload of six people is now placed on four people and the stress is felt by customers and employees alike.  I learned a lot working there though, and their beliefs of treating their employees fairly is hovering in the background just waiting for them to realize that it needs to be reworked to remain accurate."
good,Everyone there knew how to do their job right and they knew how to do coffee and food..not everyone was rude. not everyone was mean. The manager was very nice.
good,Starbucks was great to learn how to manage a high-level stress workday while providing excellent customer service. Seasonal changes brought seasonal drinks with new recipes and promotions. The job offered security and benefits which was a great asset. Depends on the location to be honest. I worked at locations in different districts and there's a definite difference between clientele and how each district manages their stores. I love the customers the most. Always young professionals or artsy folk that visit and are usually friendly.
good,Hard to progress in company and takes a long time to advance. Should get hired as external manager rather than trying to promote within. Overall good company
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers, making drinks, and running a cash register. We also have to have a clean and productive work station. Working at Starbucks I have learned many skills I use in everyday life. Starbucks management is very thorough and helpful when problems occur, also very fair with employees. Without my co-works shifts would be impossible to get through, they help keep my job running smoothly.  The hardest part of my job is when we go through a rush and we are short staffed, when that happens it is hard to get caught back up on tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to the customers, you seem to get so close to them and learn a lot about them and they can brighten your day."
good,"Starbucks provides great benefits and helps their employees if they are in need. Employees have to be able to multitask, stay on their feet for long periods of time and have to be able to handle any kind of customer. Working at Starbucks has taught me how to be friendly and how to get to know my customers because they push for friendships between employees and customers!"
good,"Friendly and happy co-workers. The constant smile and positive energy within the team makes it easy to work as a team and deliver exceptional customer service."
good,The people you work with at starbucks are great and loyal. The store managers are amazing and family oriented. The customers are a little rude but there are a few good ones that you make lifelong relationships with. Corporate Starbucks has changed in a way I didn't like. We weren't really given the time to communicate with customers anymore and the district manager were more concerned with our drive through times than if we had enough people to work that day.
good,Being a Starbucks barista is a good life experience. This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The corporate environment is amazing compared to other companies.
good,"A typical day at starbucks is fast paced and enjoyable. The hardest part was constantly switching roles, from cashier, to making drinks, to customer support. However, an environment that necessitates flexibility, encourages the ability to think on your feet and being able to adapt to sudden changes."
good,"Starbucks is a great company with quite extensive benefits yielding to primarily college students.  There are many small benefits offer had Starbucks.  Perhaps the best benefit offer is the potential to have ones college completely paid for due to the partnership Starbucks has with Arizona State University.  "
good,The management was bitter and rude at my location and just a few others where i worked a shift or two occasionally. The most common problem was a language barrier or just trying to understand my management team.
good,"Great teamwork atmosphere "
good,"I had a great time working Graveyard shift. Had wonderful shift superiors and experienced partners. I would have loved to continue to work there, but at a different store. I love the ideals behind the company and love the culture the CEO wants to foster."
good,"Every job has it's bumps and problems but overall I would have to say that I definitely enjoyed my time as a barista. The atmosphere and the benefits that they offer are wonderful, and it's easy to connect with coworkers and most of the management."
good,A lot of the time working at Starbucks can be a pain but once you learn everything it isn't so bad. The fast pace can be a very overwhelming evidence so just remember we all started out where you are at.
good,"Starbucks is a great company. The people i work with make it all the worth while. But sometimes, i think the company takes way better care of its customers than its own employees."
good,"A day at work consists of prepping for open by prepping and dating food, brewing coffee and tea, Helping customers from drive through or in house with drink food and shopping orders. Keep store clean and organized. Refill everything in store as needed. Prep for open the next day. "
good,"As a young two year shift supervisor and coffee master, I'm going to advise you not to invest too much into this company. It's great for a temporary job, but sometimes the pay is downright unfair (based geographically) and the management is really hit or miss."
good,"Depending if I was on the morning or late shift I would have to either open or close the store (preparation or clean), check the cleaning roster, orders, run the shift, organise breaks, serve customers, sample the promoted food and drinks, make sure my co workers knew the targets for the day and for the week. I learnt a lot about time management, handling a large team, motivating the staff to hit their targets which forced me to think of new initiatives if our original plan didn't work."
good,"Working for Starbucks is great as long as you don't mind constant cutting of hours.  Over the years, I have watched the company slowly move away from a partner (all employees) focused company.  The work is consistent and the work environment is high energy.  The people you work with quickly become like family, and management is highly focused on team morale.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of labor that corporate provides.  As business grows, labor was stagnant.  The pay of the company also diminished. Employee raises and vacation time growth was cut exponentially.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the regulars and making them happy."
good,"Typically I get the amount of hours I need, but I was getting too many at one point (which may sound stupid) but I'm a full time student so I really couldn't handle the amount of hours plus school work. Getting days off, as long as you ask for them well in advance (think 3+ weeks) normally isn't a problem--at least I haven't had a problem with it. However, the most annoying thing with hours is other people not coming in. I've been called in COUNTLESS times, even when I'm not even near by because it's my day off. In general, that's bound to happen period, but I feel like at my store it happens way too often."
good,"Would love to work at a corporate store, very friendly place to work."
good,"My career with Starbucks has not been a negative one.  I love the customer connections I have.  I look for areas to go above and beyond their expectations.  I love giving back and being able to help others.  I am looking for another avenue in sales that is not retail sales.  I am also ready to find hours that are not very early in the morning.  With being in a management position, I have had different personalities to adapt to which has helped in my interpersonal skills."
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits for it's employees including 15% above minimum wage in the state you are working, weekly tips, free stock granted to you yearly, the opportunity to take free online classes at ASU, weekly pound of coffee markets, and free beverages and food daily. The problems I have are, the management tends to forget about the worker and sometimes views them as machines that just whip out coffee by the second. Sometimes it doesn't feel so much customer driven as it does money and sales driven. We can tend to loose the customer relationship touch that Starbucks strives hard to achieve. They also have great insurance and match your 401k! If you work an 8 hour shift you get two paid ten minute breaks, and an unpaid half hour break. If you worked only 5 hours you would get one paid ten minute break still."
good,"it is fun working with customers who are very energetic and come in to brighten your day. As I've worked at Starbucks I've realized that it is not only my job to brighten the customers, day but they feel obligated to brighten mine as well and that is a fantastic thing. Also, i get along with a lot of my coworkers and it is nice not only having interesting conversations but also working as a team to get what we need to get done. of course there are hard days and hard people to work with but overall it is a good, growing and learning experience."
good,"Starbucks would be great for anyone looking for their first job. It teaches you responsibility, and forces you to learn how to work with a team. However your experience with this company can greatly vary depending on the type of manager you have."
good,"I would love to work at Starbucks forever, if I made a living wage doing it. The culture is fantastic and I feel every day like I'm working with my best friends."
good,"I really enjoy working in Starbucks, the environment, customers and staff are considerably friendly, it is easy to vary your shifts during week. The hardest part of the job would be managing to clean and serve customers at busy hours near close. However, heart is warmed by lovely customers who do smile a lot and thank you for your hard work, which makes me happy to do what i am doing."
good,"durante mi trabajo alli, aprendi como hacer los cafes con velocidad para que los clientes no esperen al comprarlos. Aprendi que los clientes eran mas importantes que proporcionar los cafes. Al principio, lo parte mas dificil del trabajo era que cuando habia cola muy larga, tuvimos que preparar muchos cafes distintos y enseguida. Lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que comunicar con los clientes al preparar cafes y trabajar con el equipo muy amable como ellos."
good,"Le management étais trop imprévisible ce qui fait ensorte que l'uniformisation de mon poste était trop inconcret, donc inréalisable."
good,"I have worked in a cafe store and mall store. Both are have a very different environment. Working at a mall store can be very overwhelming and crazy, especially durning the holidays. But working in that type of environment can give you the best experience on striving on speed, accuracy, time management, and how to learn to stay calm during the high peeks of rushes because its basically all day. When working in a cafe store its pretty much getting your rushes in the early morning, lunch hour, and afternoon. You have plenty of downtime to clean and get ready for the next rush. The only common ground you have at any location are the people you work with and your customers. People who work for starbucks are the most interesting, wonderful, and diverse partners. They are one of top reason why I love working for this company. People are just naturally fun and happy. For customers we have a loyal one and our we see them whenever they feel like it. I have notice that they tend to love stores with happy partners, who enjoy being there. They feel the atmosphere as welcoming and inviting which is why we tend to have plenty of loyalties."
good,"This was my favorite job I ever had, and if life had not gotten so crazy and burned me out, I would not have left. Management, depending on location, ranged from awesome to terrible--again, depended on location. District and Regional Managers were the same way. There was immense capacity for advancement, and was definitely a great career choice for me at the time. The hardest part of the job was having those difficult conversations with my coworkers, whenever there was conflict of some kind. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flip side of that same coin, in that, in pushing one another to be better, I became a better person, and learned a lot about life itself--not just the job. It taught me a lot about communication and responsibility, and I am forever grateful for that."
good,"I generally work on the weekends.There is no downtime on the weekends as i currently work in a kiosk located inside of a shopping mall. I generally make approximately 840 drinks per 8 hr shift. Other duties include transportation and the restock of milk, juice, dry products, condiments, cleaning fluids, pastries, and other food. I deal with people in times of both high physical and mental stress. Interaction with the customers and co-workers is the best part of the job. The management is sufficient to provide everybody with a pleasant work environment."
good,A typical day at work is interacting with great customers and building relationships with them. It is more than just coffee. I wish we would had a steady schedule out in our store. Our schedule is published for us 24-36 hours before the next business week. The hardest part of the job is the scheduling and juggling life and kids when you have no idea what you are working that following Monday. The best part of the job is the people. I love the people i see daily and work with.
good,"Great place to work you meet so many different people of many backgrounds, they also offer a wide variety of products to get familiar with. excellent job for students lots of benefits that can be taken advantage of"
good,"My typical day at Starbucks started at 4:30 pm. My work environment had the most friendly customers and co-workers. Everyone got along in the best way. The most enjoyable part of my day was getting to see my regular customers and make coffee. I enjoyed making coffee, making the customers drinks the way they requested. The hardest part would have to be when customers ordered 5 or more drinks. There was always one other person and myself at Starbucks. Sometimes we would have a line out the door but those lines would come in waves. That would be another difficult part of the job, trying not to make the customers wait more than 5 mins for their drinks. Our manager was good. She wanted everything as precise as she could get it. My co-workers and I did our absolute best to get everything the way she wanted it but some things couldn't be that precise. Good work environment but a difficult one to coop with."
good,"i would open Starbucks at 4 am every morning. assemble the espresso machines, make coffee, and clean and prep the rest of the store before opening at 4:30 am. i learned how to work fast and smart. management was good they handled every situation very well and are store ran pretty smoothly for being one of the more busy stores. co workers where great we all meshed well and worked as a team. hardest part was waking up at 4 am and having to deal with the early rushes. the best part of my job was the guest and giving them something they enjoy and engaging in conversation with them."
good,The most beneficial part of working for Starbucks is the atmosphere that you get everytime you come into work. Everyone is super friendly and extremely welcoming its like working with family.
good,Making hand-crafted beverages for our valued customers. Consistently learned new recipes all while maintaining a clean and friendly environment.
good,"10 to 12 hours of work a day with two days off per week"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Can be pretty stressful, but it is usually worth it.  If you've got a good attitude and are customer service oriented, then this job is great.  You make genuine connections with customers and fellow partners."
good,"Friendly work culture"
good,"Considering the amount of work that needed to be accomplished with limited baristas, especially working at a drive thru, the pay was relatively low in comparison to amount of work done. Tends to attract rude customers"
good,"Empresa dinâmica, com propostas diferenciadas em relação a fast food, incentiva seus funcionários a aprenderem sobre café, dando premiações em relação ao nível de aprendizado."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you want to work in a fun and accepting environment. The hours are flexible and if you can handle working at a very fast pace under a lot of pressure then this is the job for you. They strive to always deliver legendary customer service and there are many extra benefits to working for the company.
good,"A fun, relatively easy going job with great staff, friendly management, and excellent benefits. Salary is minimum wage and there aren't many opportunities to progress further into the company. A good job for students."
good,learning how to make high quality drinks and becoming very familiar with how drinks are made and the machines work. getting to interact with some wonderful customers who try to get to know as much as you want to get to know them. Management is very flexible and try to accommodate your life and hire people who are fun to work with. The overall job isn't hard it just involves a lot of standing and interacting with people. The best part of the job is building those regulars and getting to interact with them everyday. Also your free coffee mark outs and partner beverages while you work
good,"We have three people that work through out the day, there is little overlap, so most of the time we work by ourselves. While there are no guest to serve, we usually clean up behind the bar and the lobby, refill anything that needs it, and we also serve out samples to any guest that may be walking around the store. I've learned how to talk to guest and how to make them happy; as well as how to handle certain situations. I have also had hazmat training in food and safety situations. Management could have been better in handling things. our store manager always harassing us and got upset very easily. There were times when they would not do their paper work and made us do his work. They would leave in the middle of their shift to go chat to someone. They would also always leave at least an hour early. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is that you cant make everyone happy. Though we try to talk to the guest to see how we can help, we either don't have the product they are looking for or they are upset about how a team member treated them. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing the guest happy, and they keep coming back because WE can make their drink right, or they like the way a certain barista talks to them and makes their drink right, or they like the environment. I really love seeing a guest happy to be in our store."
good,"* A typical day at Starbucks is a fast past environment satisfying customers."
good,très bon emploi pour des étudiants. il y a de très bon avancé personnel.
good,Working at Starbucks was a very challenging job. Everyday I loved seeing customers and making them happy bringing them world class customer services. At times it was challenging because customers would be angry with me and it wasn't my fault but I would find ways to help them. My coworkers where great most of them there were a few that I didn't''t get along with so well just because of there personality but I made the most of it. I wanted to advance but felt like I was being led on with no real promotion in sight.
good,Very fast paced workplace with an emphasis on speed and quality of service. Time management was key to being a successful barista.
good,"I love working at Starbucks. Love the people that I work with, the customers that I deal with. I would just like to say that maybe having to choose an option of having a higher Pay, rather than profit sharing, would benefit the partners who would love to stay with the Company, and also be eligible to potentially sign up for a car or a house or something that we can Tie into our names. instead of being paid ""minimum""."
good,"Starbucks is a great company with great benefits. The hours are not consistent which makes for a hard normal schedule. Coworkers are amazing, management varies between location."
good,"fun loving place, making of coffee,management is good n taking care of me n helping me in all type of work, team work take care of the customer, they also provide good food n beverage,i work has a barista,i also awarded has a coffee master apron."
good,"It is very important to check the systems and keep up to date on new beverages and promotions. Finding ways to communicate changes throughout the staff can sometimes be a challenge to ensure everyone is receiving the same information and that all questions are being properly answered. My day consists (typically) of: delegating and assisting with tasks and chores, and ensuring that the work is being properly documented, conducting inventory counts using our mobile and online system, accurately keeping data on temperatures and bar cycles and calling in any maintenance requests. We do have the benefit of creating a personal connection with customers, which in my opinion assists with any customer escalation needs. The company gives us the tools to make sure we do right by the customer in any tough situations. Although we sometimes have issues with staffing, over all everyone is willing to help out when needed."
good,"I was a working student, my workplace was very far but i did really enjoy my job because whenever i work, I motivate myself and i am doing customer service."
good,"I've been switched around departments and have seen the best/worst of the job. Every once in awhile there are changes in leadership (and that seems odd) in the name of becoming more efficient/progressive as a company. I like the people I work with (mostly) and tend to not complain unless I need to make a point. Like any workplace you have your oddballs, many of them don't bother me too much. At the very least this job helps you understand the basics of warehouse work without becoming a cluttered mess of mismanagement or misinformation."
good,I work the morning shift so I deal with the kids on their way to school and others on their way to work.  You have to work with a sense of urgency but yet be efficient.  Many that come in don't like the wait times so you have to learn how to keep the customer happy as well as get them their order efficiently.  I enjoy the customers because you meet people from all walks of life.
good,Loved the fast pace and most customers.  Learned many things; including; how to adapt in an ever changing environment. Great training classes. Enjoyed being apart of something bigger with the volunteer opportunities.
good,Starbuck is a productive and organzied business that teaches useful skills such as mulittasking and dealing with high stress situations calmly and rationally.
good,"Great place to work, not an easy job."
good,J'ai adoré travailler au starbuck l'ambiance était juste parfaite on s'entraidai et tout le monde était unis
good,"Working at Target was overall a very positive, and beneifcial oppertunity.  With that being said, the management needs a lot of improvement, Most of the Team Memebers were amazing to work with; theTeam Members often try to help build each other up as professionals.  Management had issures respectfully comunicating with employees."
good,Opening up the store. Verify all cash drawers and safe. Prepare day for operations. Co workers worked well as a team to make work life easy. Best part of the job was the customer interaction.
good,A typical work day consisted of either making drinks and connecting with the customers. Also being on register taking customers orders and gathering food items. Keeping items stocked to ensure customer satisfaction.
good,i loved being able to put a smile on a customers face just by starting their day off with a cup of coffee or a latte. I really enjoyed the environment and learning the customers drinks. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing satisfaction in my skills.
good,Very good company to work for. There are some amazing people within the company. Usually plenty of opportunity for growth. They have good values and in most cases people are treated with dignity and respect. This is a large company and there are many layers of management this can sometimes be a downfall depending on the size of the department. Managers are at times over bearing and unreasonable in some departments.
good,"The cleaning duties were minimal as cleaning staff came in the evenings. Training and working as a barista was extremely fun and rewarding. It was a very fast-paced environment, but had a laid-back atmosphere. Management was very supportive and forthcoming. My coworkers were diverse and welcoming people. The hardest part was working in such a confined space with many people during a shift. Working the espresso bar and making drinks was definitely the best part of the job and regular customers were a joy to see."
good,"My position at Starbucks was a shift supervisor; which entailed cash handling, managing and running a shift, a key to the store, and basic managerial tasks. Everyday was unpredictable, due to customer flow; the customer experience was great. The most difficult part of the job is keeping up with cleaning everything. The most enjoyable part was the customer experience, and the culture behind the coffee/company."
good,"I love working for Starbucks. However now that I am out of school and can't afford to pay off my student loans, I am stuck with a barista job that doesn't pay (or tip) well. I love everything about this company except for their reluctance to pay their baristas better wages."
good,"I spent about a year wearing the green apron and it was mostly enjoyable! Getting there at 4:30am was no picnic and a few people were fired because it's hard to make yourself go to bed at 8:30!"
good,"Originally the job was great for a school job and helped with its very flexible and accommodating scheduling, but soon began to drift away from being a great job and slowly started to be very taxing like customer service jobs usually are. Over the years Starbucks has changed its focus from serving the customer and making meaningful connections, to speed of service above all. The coworkers have always been the best part of the job and the room for advancement was a great intensive to invest in the company but with the way things are now, partners are all frustrated and fleeing the nest. advancement is based on favoritism and raises are now based on a percentage that reflects ""not meeting expectations"" on old reviews.The hardest part of the job was watching it slowly drift away from its roots and focusing on the money and not the clientele or the employees."
good,i had a great experience until new managers came into the mix. great people to work with everyone is really nice fun work space
good,"A typical day there is always exciting always busy and have great customers,"
good,"I begin my shift around the same time everyday. I work with my store manager to effectively run the store and oversee the work of my coworkers. It is definitely a family environment between customers and partners. We work as a team to get the job done right, every time. "
good,"They are willing to work around a class schedule "
good,"Great job and very flexible with scheduling. The hardest part about the job is the entitled customers that try to rip you off on a daily basis. The best part about the job is that it is a fun job to have with cool people everyday. As long as you have a good Store Manager, you should have no problem fitting in and loving every second of it."
good,Overall I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks.  I did enjoy the the culture and the benefits were amazing.  The company has very high expectations of it's employees and they constantly challenge their partners.
good,"While working at Starbucks, I was readily welcomed into the store. Everyone was friendly and more than willing to help and train me. It is a constant changing environment, so I learned a lot about being able to work with others because my team would change so much. The management there is very understanding and flexible. I am also a college student, so they are very accommodating to my busy schedule. The hardest part of my job, to me, is trying to please everyone: coworkers, managers and most importantly, the customers. I love learning about coffee and tea, and my knowledge has expanded greatly in my time here."
good,"Being a barista is definitely a challenging, but very fun job. Working in a busy store can be stressful, but the team atmosphere that comes along with this job is like none other. This is a great job and you will make some of the best friends you can find."
good,"A typical day at work for the distribution plant was a 8-12 hour graveyard shift. It included pallet building, picking and packaging items to ship to different stores. The coworkers and management were amazing and the only hard part about that job was the long hours in the middle of the night."
good,"Starbucks serves coffee and coffee beverages to hundreds of customer every day. With such a high demand, a typical day can be stressful and demanding; which makes the job more fun. My coworkers were fantastic! We functioned well as a team and created chemistry. The only downside was management - which seemed overworked, stressed, and frustrated on a typical day. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving and conversing with customers every day."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced work environment, however, I enjoyed that perspective because it made the day go a lot faster.  I loved learning how to make drinks and learned quickly.  The management was always fair, trying their best to accommodate my life.  The coworkers I worked with also made this job fun and got along with everyone.  I think there were really no issues or hard parts to this job.  The most enjoyable part was being able to satisfy the customers with their delicious drinks."
good,"Grande entreprise qui  s' occupe et forme au mieux ses employés."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks included making and remembering orders of a handful of customers at one time while preparing and handing them out. While working I learned how to multitask while maintaining upbeat and positive energy for long periods of time."
good,Over all they were relatively flexible when it came to the schedule. They were very customer orientated and a pleasure to work for. We also got a .25 cent raise every year if standards of work were met.
good,"A typical day at work was challenging but manageable. I learned various skills of the trade and also many life skills. Responsibility, communication, customer satisfaction, work ethic, and team work were all areas that were stressed and honestly helped me become a better person in general. Management was lackluster. Co-workers tended to get along well, but did have problems with expressing surprising opinions about each other behind backs. The hardest part of the job was keeping everything up to ""required"" cleanliness levels. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the art of making certain beverages. The experience that I had there was enjoyable and I would not trade it for the world."
good,"Loved the environment, people, co-workers, besides management it was a great job. They offer a great education plan and also benefits. Hoping to return to this company."
good,Good place to work.  Treat employees well.  Not the best pay.  Potential for advancement is available. A fun environment in which to work.
good,"People are friendly(at least the staff is)"
good,"Actively recruiting employees, hiring, training, coaching, and performance managing up to thirty employees at a time. Setting store targets and goals while creating sales plans and personal targets for partners to obtain these goals. Forecasting business needs, schedule writing, and managing inventory and ordering. Identifying problems or speed bumps and creating action plans and solutions to eliminate potential problems."
good,"My current store is very high volume, we are almost always busy and our entire day seems to be a ""peak"" period. I have tons of fun with my coworkers and our regular customers are amazing. There are a ton of partners that currently work within our store because of the high volume, but we all get our hours for the most part."
good,"Great place to work. It's a fast and friendly environment. The best part is when you meet new people and they become regular customers. I love when customers ask what I would recommend and once they try it, their eyes light up and that smile is put across their face. That makes me feel that I have done my job. There really is no hard part in my job but if I have to pick one it would be dealing with difficult customers."
good,"At Starbucks, we have sucj a great work environment. Managers and co-workers are so friendly and respected people. Working at Starbucks taught me a lot of life lesson that I will definitely need in my future, such as, knowing how to deal and get along with hard and disrespected people.I think it's a fin part-time job. Starbucks offers their employees health insurances which I think it's great."
good,"I learned a lot from working at Starbucks. I started out as a barista , then shift manager,  assistant manager and then finally Store Manager. What I took away is how to run a profitable and successful business. Fortunately, we have a product that is in high demand, had the privilege to meet some great people and Starbucks is one of the few companies that actually does have great training for all its' positions. The toughest part of the job isyou have to have tough skin. The customers can be brutal but if you take it all in stride you can carve out a great career path for yourself."
good,"Great and fun working environment. Fast paced, and energetic atmosphere. Met great people that have built long lasting friendship with both professionally and personally."
good,"starbucks culture was probably the best part of the job, other employees were easy to get with and the pay was decent they can be strict on rules but fairly and there always looking for those who want to make an extra effort to progress in the company"
good,"Friendly workplace with great staff, excellent team building skills. My favorite aspect of this job is working with the public , getting to meet new people everyday and interact with them. The Linger i am there the more i realize i need to grow and I am now looking for something more challanging"
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consisted of expecting the unexpected. In my opinion, the decision for the manager hired was poorly made. A Shift Supervisor, like myself and two others, could have only done so much for the store when she wasn't around or felt like being ""unprofessional"". Some Baristas were very lethargic, and one as a team leader can only get on them about it so often. There were days that running a shift went spectacular! Everybody was fulfilling their role, nobody was complaining, customers were actually tipping, and the work floor just ran smoothly. As shift supervisors, we had to manage our time efficiently because there were several tasks needed to be done before the end of our shift and handing off the keys to one another so that that next Shift Supervisor could take over. The outcome of how well we may or may not have handled our time was based off the efficiency of the Baristas and manager. I enjoyed my job very much as a team leader because I personally understood each Barista since I was in their position for six months before being promoted, and that is why I was able to have their trust and loyalty when it came to running a shift alone in the absence of our manager. If she was ever around, she micromanaged, and that is something I did not appreciate on the account that it was against policy. I took action several times and tried to notify my district manager, but she herself was no help at all. All one could do is tough it out and make the best of what they had. If there's one thing I got out of working at that particular location, it was coming out of"
good,"My job title is a Barista and as a Barista I can have many roles during a shift. I can work in the register, drive thru, customer support, or make drinks in our bar. My favorite task is making drinks. I like being able to move at a fast pace and hearing customers tell me the drink I made them was delicious."
good,This job has been essential to my progression in life. It's flexible work schedule has allowed me to pursue my degrees and certification in Broadcasting and Communications. It is a great job to have for someone that needs flexibility in their schedule whether to balance time for a second job or school.
good,Starbucks is a wonderful place to work with all the benefits it provides. Allows for a regular connection with customers. The flaw that I have seen in several stores I have worked in is the complete disconnect between management and baristas. Every manager I have worked with was from outside the comapny so they had little knowledge of the pressure on the floor or how to make drinks properly. Starbucks is very flexible when it comes to school and availabilities.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a fun experience, meeting new people, and creating a variety of drinks. The other employees where friendly , and work was never to difficult. Other than making drinks , my other duties where to keep the store clean, work the register, and sometimes take over other managerial duties."
good,"Just as the title says, the job is fun and challenging at first, but with many of the customers treating you like a robot every day and no one taking ownership of their own mistakes, it becomes difficult to justify why you continue working there."
good,"Great job with great benefits, some room for growth, good customer service experience job, early and late working hour shifts, great partners to work with"
good,"A typical day at work could either be very slow paced or extreme high volume. I craved busy days, record setting busy days, I thrived! It was such an exciting experience. I learned patience and how to give luxury service. I also gained even more experience in treating every guest like your first guest of the day because you never know what's going on in peoples lives, and in customer service you have the ability to put someone in a great mood,you have the opportunity to make someones day. My management team was great, they made me feel valued and appreciated my hard work. I had some amazing coworkers, it was such a diverse group of people and we were all able to get along and make the workplace a fun, enjoyable place to be. What I enjoyed most about the job was to be able to meet people from all around the world."
good,"A typical day for me starts a little rough sometimes. My shift usually starts in the middle of the afternoon rush. But I know how to do my job. I worked hard for my fellow coworkers and they worked hard for me. The trust I built with my coworkers helped me conquer the job at hand and go home on time. Some days were hard, but I always had a good time."
good,"love this company. easy to move up, you receive great benefit packages, plus weekly tips as well as raises every 6 months. great way to meet tons of people as well as network and they provide a great work environment."
good,"It was busy all year round, this made time go quickly. "
good,"My favorite part of working at Starbucks is that, generally speaking, I've had really great co-workers and customers.  A lot depends on your store manager, they can literally make or break your experience."
good,"A great company to work for when your boss cares. It is hard work but when your heart is in it and the team that surrounds you cares, its like being with family and is so worth it to get up and go to work everyday."
good,"My manager sometimes have moments where the non-busy hours were overstaffed and the rush hours were understaffed."
good,"Fun work place, easy to move up, coworkers were excellent. Management changed every 6 months or so, had to adapt to new management styles, not enough pay for doing managerial duties."
good,"Typical day at this store was pretty much what you would expect, we worked to keep customers happy and our floor clean. We regularly had meetings between each other to go over how we could improve customer service and new employees were treated as family."
good,"At Starbucks Coffee Company my position was Shift Supervisor. As a Shift Supervisor I was in charge of giving lunches and breaks, counting and handling money, counting inventory and having occasional Shitft meetings."
good,starbucks is a great company to work full of benefits and caring people to work with. I love it so much I would never leave.
good,"A great company to work for if your just starting out or if you need health insurance, not that great if you have finished college and are looking for something more. Very hard to move into the corporate side of things."
good,It is a great company to work for but advancement is very hard. I have learned many life lessons as well as good work ethic in working for Starbucks.
good,An great environmental buisness that always has have room for growth. Always made sure you was comfortable with how you working
good,Working for a well established company like Starbucks is a very rewarding job. The job atmosphere is amazing and the early morning rushes make for a quick day. There is always something to do to stay busy.
good,I love the company. They have been great to me. I love the management team that I am a part of. Not that any jobs is perfect but its something that you need to be ready to d and commit to.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you can handle the fast paced nature of being a barista, the physical nature of the work, and the different kinds of customers that walk through the door. "
good,Good place to work if you're a student as it is very flexible. Work with other students as well so it has a very easy going atmosphere.
good,"It was a good company to work for, they just have a very high turn over rate with very little opportunity for any major advancement. I am looking for something new in the customer service industry with long term career opportunities."
good,"work with great people we all get along, we all love to be around each other, we always ask each other for help when needed. The manager is a great guy he is always happy."
good,"Fast paced and personable. Had to learned that there is not a one beverage that fits all. Most enjoyable part of the day is when guests hangout and are productive themselves ""in-house"" and they share their stories."
good,"Starbucks was really great to work to work in the years I was there. You meet very different people (coworkers and customers) and that can be very good or very challenging since everybody has different personalities. As any restaurant, it can get very busy and have times where there aren't many customers which gives you time to catch p on cleaning/management duties. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks to me was connecting with the customers and meeting new people."
good,"Excellent benefits : Health, dental, vision options. Good salary and bonuses at management level. "
good,This is a rapidly growing and changing company. Exciting to be a part of.  The people are some of the best I've known. A very dynamic work environment that moves quickly.
good,Every day we're given a chance to get to know our customers and create a friendly environment at work. We ensure that we're able to serve not only a high quality beverage but also deliver an exceptional customer service.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes: cleaning, putting sticker dates on items in order to note their expiration dates, setting up the food case and putting items on display for customers, warming up food items for customers, recommending new drinks or food items to customers, handling cash transactions, recommending merchandise or coffee beans for customers to purchase, reporting to supervisors or management, answering phone calls, preparing handcrafted drinks, and connecting with customers from the second they step in the door until the second they leave the store."
good,"Working at Starbucks, I learned that being quick and efficient are a must; for the company and the customers. There was never a day where the stores weren't busy. The hardest part of the job was definitely making the drinks correctly and fast. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet different people, being co-workers and customers. The coworkers were very passionate about their job, and the customers were always happy to get their coffee."
good,"The store management was great, always working to make the store and staff better. Treated everyone with respect and understanding."
good,bom trabalhar na starbucks foi agradável sem mais e sem menos.
good,"I had a wonderful time working at Starbucks. I was a supervisor and would have to manage a team of baristas and deploy them to give the best service. Starting at 6am, getting the cafe stocked and ready to be open at half 6.  By half 8 the cafe gets incredibly busy, starbucks likes to focus on efficiency and customer service, this means that I would deploy my team based on their strengths. I loved my coworkers, everyone would help each other. If you've ever been in a starbucks you can see that everyone has their position and if they stick to it, together they work incredibly well. "
good,"Great benefits including free food markout during shifts, free beverages during shifts, great healthcare and 401K options, stock options, and a free markout of coffee or tea once per week!"
good,Starbucks does offer more coverage and health insurance than most companies for minimum wage but it's still hard work. Moving up isn't super hard but you can get stuck as a manager since going higher requires DMs to step down.
good,"Through Starbucks I was able to support myself through my undergraduate career. By providing benefits they allowed me to avoid the stress of finding health insurance while being able to focus on studies. A typical day at work might involve a multitude of projects, from managing inventory to training new employees. Most importantly my co-workers at Starbucks have always been supportive and easy to work with, making enforcement of policy an easy task. The most stressful part of the job comes from making sure that every customer has a great experience every time they come by."
good,"At Starbucks I learned how to open and close a restaurant style business. I preformed my job as a Shift Supervisor for two years which gave me money handling, ordering, and safe experience. I was a trainer and trained my fellow co-workers on many different things as big changes came to the company. A typical day consisted of working with customers and co-workers to help solve problems, suggest items, and help them understand what we were selling. I learned about the history, processing, and development of both coffee as a product, and in the company. It helped me to develop a passion for people to make sure they're taken care of to the best of my ability."
good,"During the past 10 years of my career at Starbucks, each and every day has involved ensuring that every customer has the best possible experience.  I have learned over the years that with change comes challenges and one must rise to the occasion.  Being a Shift Supervisor/Barista, you have to be ready, willing, and able to adapt to whatever changes come your way.  Managers keep the team up to date regarding changes and make sure the team is functioning at maximum capacity.  Working at Starbucks is like working with family as we support one another in everything we do. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is taking care of customers and developing long lasting relationships with them.  They become part of the Starbucks family!  The most difficult part of the job is realizing that there are days you can't make everyone happy.  Customer service is challenging and we strive to do the best we can to bring a smile to their face.  "
good,It was a fun environment to work in. It just wasn't for me. long hours but not a bad place to work. learned a lot about making coffee and just coffee in general. the location i worked at was a drive thru so it was hard to always understand the orders.
good,"THe company itself has great benefits and many ideals (especially for students) but the experience depends on the customers, co-workers, and your boss."
good,Making the drinks and making people smile was great. The pace was never too much to handle as long as we were properly staffed. The hardest part of the job was keeping the work area clean when you had a lot of customers to serve.
good,It was an amazing place to work and to meet friends. Coffee is always the same and management was very iffy. The mornings were usually pretty backed up but we could handle it with the prepared staff on board
good,"Opportunities for career advancement if you have a proven track record. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is developing your team and finalizing key deliverables (i.e. budgets, forecasts, projects)."
good,I love our customer base and having the opportunity to talk to all types of people.  A typical day is balancing customer needs with administrative work and maintaining store cleanliness.  The hardest part of my job is trying to balance my personal life with the needs of my employees.
good,"Typical day consist of taking and filling customer orders, as well as maintaining a clean and safe work environment. I learned much about coffee and preparation. Management seemed mediocre, co-workers were excellent for the most part. The hardest part of the job was meeting the demands of an inexperienced shift manager with poor employee utilization skills."
good,"It was fun and very lively. I learned how to multitask and get along better with customers. The management was very cool and helpful. If anything would arise that you need help with, they would be the first people to be there. Overall the job was very fun!"
good,I would start my day at the cash register taking lobby orders. My responsibilities while at the cash register was to maintain a clean and fully stocked pastry case. I then would be moved to our drive thru area. I would be responsible for taking drive thru orders as well as collecting payments. The last part of my shift I would be responsible for making handcrafted beverages in a timely mannor.
good,Typical retail managerial duties overseeing high volume store with a commitment to deliver high quality products in a friendly fast paced environment.
good,"A day of work at Starbucks is pretty straight forward, depending on which area they put you in, you will know how to work your area correctly."
good,"There is always work to be done at starbucks. Such as, getting ready for the next customer or cleaning up after the last. There is always something to do."
good,"It was a great first job. I had an amazing team and an awesome boss. It ranged from being extremely stressful to absolute boredom depending on the time that was worked. My tasks for the day would switch daily, from taking orders, to making drinks, to cleaning. The hardest part was being understaffed during a busy time, which unfortunately happened quite often. The best part would have to be the friends that I made there."
good,Starbucks is a great job for someone going to college. They are super flexible with schedules and really nice to their partners. Ive learned to be patient with my customers and gaining knowledge about coffee.
good,"A typical day varied greatly, depending on the time and day of shift.  My coworkers were great team players and we were always willing to help each other out.  Management was accommodating and constantly helping me improve."
good,"I Love working for starbucks, if i were  making more money i would quit my second job and just stay here but now that im on my own financiallty its time for me to find a better paying job."
good,"The staff were amazing, the managers were always there to help you and I quite enjoyed the location of the store. Its was like one big family and I wish I had never left."
good,"Everyday we deliver a legendary customer service. We aimed to customized our approach to each customer and gives them a perfect cup of coffee."
good,"I worked at Starbucks as my first real-world job.  I was trained, and continued to work at the store on 114th and Broadway in NYC; right across from Columbia University."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes friendly customer service, beverage production and various cleaning tasks. Each person is assigned a position and is responsible for certain aspects of how the floor is run. The most valuable thing I have learned from Starbucks is building a customer relationship can make everyone's job more enjoyable. "
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo es en la apertura de tienda, cuadre de caja chica, revisar el invenario del cierre anterior para verificar el ingreso, asignar las cajas e indicarle al partner cual es la meta del dia y la estrategia de venta."
good,I have been with Starbucks for many years and really enjoy working there.  There are many great benefits and exciting projects to be part of.  Rather quick job advancement can be attained through strong performance.
good,"Honestly Starbucks is a lot of fun, but there is only so much money that can be made selling coffee.  They can help with tuition re-imbursement for many career paths, so if you are a student it can be a very good place if you can work till 11 pm.  If you want to make a career of it, sadly the era of growth is pretty much over, so you will be waiting until someone else quits from a higher position than yours.  Don't even consider a job at the home office or coffee buyer or anything like that.  You can gain some clout by becoming a Coffee Master, but there isn't any extra money, just a different color apron."
good,You will feel happy every day to work there since you can talk with different customers. And the benefits are fair with the free coffee and teas to mark out every week. The only thing is that the salary there is too low compared to the duties and responsibilities that partners are asked to do.
good,"Laid back atmosphere, mentally easy work.  For just 20 hours per week Starbucks provides amazing benefits.  The fact that you get unlimited free drinks while working and a pound of coffee to take home per week is pretty great as well."
good,"Had a great time at Starbucks, great staff. Got to know a lot of customer by their favorite drinks and names.Things change when we got new AD no longer a family friendly team. All District Manager were fired or quit."
good,"The day entails customer interaction, daily reports, inventory, deposits, orders, and running a shift to Starbucks standards."
good,I enjoyed the experience of working at Starbucks. the company is constantly improving and their mission goal is excellent. I would recomend them.
good,"It's a fast paced job and the only way to learn is to jump right into it. Management would tell partners they were there for us to speak to about any subjects of concern, but they did not always show that."
good,"producitve work place to be, making drinks for customers, meeting new people Consistently achieved daily revenue targets through strong leadership, teamwork and customer service."
good,"This Starbucks is the third busiest Starbucks in the world. I liked it at times and not at others.  "
good,"A great place to work, with decent hours, however the particular franchise I was working at was owned by target Canada and thus I've lost my job"
good,"Its a great company to work for. My typical day at work is always at a fast paced. I have learned a lot from different people and how they run the business. Most co-workers are well-educated and come from all walks of life. The hardest part of the job for me is to try to keep other co-workers motivated and be on the same page. It's not hard all the time but there are some people that don't care and take pride in what they do. Therefore, I always try to be discreet and talk to them when the time is right. Other than that, the job itself is not hard at all and I myself never get bored. The most enjoyable part of the job is I get to be on bar and make lattes drinks when I start my day. It warms me up and keep me in good spirit."
good,"the things I like about this company is that they are very flexible. they will work with work schedule to the best their ability. the pay and increases are minimal, which is one reason why I left."
good,"Satrbucks is a great company to work for. They have great benefits, and excellent partners. The customers are very appreciative,"
good,The hours were hard and long because a high turnover.  But was an easy job.
good,"Fast-paced environment. I enjoyed customer interaction. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with supply and demand, especially when seasonal drinks or new food items were introduced, customers were upset when we ran out of items early in the day. It is a great environment to work in."
good,Starbucks is a very demanding job with great benefits. As a company they have high standards and have been willing to change to help insure that both the customer and employee are happy. Having worked at different 3 different Starbucks locations I have noticed that each one will work slightly different according to the management. The thing that helps make sure that the day runs smoothly is through the other employees at each location. Everyone must be great at multitasking. If you can not do it then this job is not for you.
good,"My duties through out any shift greatly depend on the time of day I am actually working.  I could either be doing the daily deposit and order placement as well as intake, or be in charge of inventory counts as well as setting up for the next morning by making sure things are properly stocked and pulled and counting out all the tills.   Then there are the jobs that i do regardless of the time of day i would such as deployment of other employees break scheduling while keeping other baristas on track with their responsibilities, maintaining food safety and QASA guidelines.  All of these tasks are easy as long as you time manage well.  My favorite part of my job is being able to connect with the costumers who come in and giving them a unique customer interaction that keeps them coming back.  I also love connecting with my fellow coworker, in an attempt to keep moral high I collaborated with one of our more artistically inclined barista to create a holiday themed partner board representing every barista and acknowledging what they bring to our store. (i hope to continue this though out the rest of my time there)"
good,"As a Starbucks Barista, we create the Starbucks experience for our customers by providing legendary customer service with prompt service, quality beverages and products, and maintain a clean and comfortable store environment"
good,"Deming Street is a high volume Starbucks that require a lot of energy and mental stability. We are required to remember orders in advance in order to perfect the customer's wants and needs. "
good,"I am a supervisor at Starbucks, I would work with my partners to accomplish goals like cleaning tasks, sales, etc. For the most part I had a good team to help me through the day and achieve the layout of the day. Hardest part of the job was dealing with lazy workers and having most of the work fall on my shoulders while having to complete my supervisors duties as well."
good,"Starbucks is generally a great place to work. It has it's up's and down's. I used to love what I did there. The bonds you made with the other employees and with your frequent customers. It was a great experience. I learned a lot there, not only how to make coffee but to make each and every customer and coworker feel at home. The Management for the most part were good. But some of them demanded a lot and gave very little. In overall it was a great experience working with them."
good,"Amazing benefits and flexible with your schedule. A little hard to move up in the company because there are only three levels: shift, assistant manager, and manager."
good,"Always busy, never idle. There is always something to do."
good,"Cashier is fun to learn"
good,"We are one of the busiest Starbucks in the region. So a basic day at Starbucks is just how it sounds busy and very fast paste. I enjoy my job here but it is time for me to find something Ill grow from and learn more valuable things. Management is great, very understanding and super awesome people. My co workers make my job feel like a second home. The hardest part of my job would have to be being on my feet all day, that is something is don't look forward. The most enjoyable part would have to be getting to spend the dray interacting with great people and having great co workers that make the day go fast."
good,"I enjoy my many years at Starbucks.  They are an extremely values based organization. The systems, process and policy are rational and justified at every turn.  As the company has continued to grow at unpresidented rates they work diligently to maintain a people company servicing coffee not just a coffee company serving people."
good,A typical day at work would always be focused on customer service. Dealing with customers all day. Making sure they leave happy with their order. I learned to work with any type of obstacle they throw me and manage it with patience. I get a long with all my co-workers. We tend to help one another all the time. Hardest part of the job might be when I'm by myself with no one to back me up. I don't like having customers waiting on me while helping others. I tend to work fast and do everything as it should be. I never like to just stand and do nothing. I like to keep myself busy. I love when customers come to me and tell me I'm such a nice and patient barista. Specially when they come back and tell me they loved the drink I prepared for them.
good,"Starbucks is a really fun place to work, fast paced, always have something to do which makes shifts go by quick.  The work can get a little overwhelming, especially during peak season in this location, which is a tourist town, as the staffing is lower than it seems like it should be.  This makes it hard to keep up with Starbucks very high standards of customer service and cleanliness.  My shifts were three closing shifts, one opening shift and one early shift typically.  This was very difficult for me, especially as a parent.  It was very hard for me to just go to sleep at a decent time on the nights before I had the opening and early shifts, because I was so used to stating up late for the closing shifts, which in the summer was as late as almost midnight (closed at 11 pm).  This really mess with my circadian rhythm and was conducive to the work life balance Starbucks touts itself on.  If if weren't for the schedule, I would probably still be there."
good,A great company to work for  but advancement is limited. training is always available if needed. I learned through education and feedback that it is important to be a active listener and always show empathy to employees.
good,"It gets very busy and to get through a typical work day, it's definitely recommended that baristas are well rested. During my time with the company, I've learned more about how I want to present myself to guests, I've gained the ability to move quickly and multi-task while working under pressure and gain the ability to learn quick and adapt to any changes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I get to work with so many different people and make connections with not just other baristas but guests that come in frequently."
good,"excelente ambiente laboral, buen desarrollo de proyectos"
good,"If you can work fast and stay friendly and connecting with customers (overlooking that they may not be having a great day or be in a good mood), this is a place for you."
good,"The Starbucks on the North Post of Ft. Bragg, NC is located on the base, because of that we were mostly serving military personal, which appreciated our work a lot. "
good,"I liked the flexible hours, free drinks, good people and lively atmosphere. It was hard dealing with difficult customers and the high-stress times. This job is not mentally simulating."
good,"A typical day at work is high energy and fast paced. I learned how to succeed in a stressful environment and how to connect with customers. The management team is very supportive and always encouraging us to succeed. My co-workers (partners) are dependable and set a great working atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is when demand exceeds supply and we run out of product. Above all, my favorite part about working at Starbucks is how I’ve been given the opportunity to grow as an individual and a professional."
good,"My five years at Starbucks gave me a really good perspective of how corporations run things. I had several managers that loved my work ethic and thought that I would be a good candidate for promotion, but due to not wooing my district and regional managers, was often over looked for less motivated, hard working people. The company, at the time, really did an outstanding job with giving opportunity to those that were looking to thrive in the company. Waking up early was one of the harder aspects of the job, although a perk to accompany that was having endless coffee at your disposal."
good,"If you like coffee and people, this job is for you. I loved working with my co-workers and being able to drink as much coffee as I want. I also loved knowing that my company takes good care of not only the customers but equally the employees. Overall I was very happy with my job. A BIG plus is knowing that if I were to relocate to another city or state where there is a Starbucks I would have a job as long as they have a need."
good,"From the minute you clock in to the minute you clock off, there is always something for you to be working on.  I've learned to interact with customers on a personal level while efficiently making their beverages."
good,"Dias de semana era pouco movimentado, mas finais de semana e feriados o fluxo de clientes era intenso."
good,"For store managers all administrative work is completed on Mon. and Tue.(weekly payroll, forecast, schedule reviews and etc. A store manager works on the floor for the remainder of the week. Day to day tasks are still completed by the store manager or shift supervisor including all inventory processes. "
good,I learned how to communicate well with others and to be outgoing to customers and other employees. Management was sometimes hard to deal with but dealt with it. Some co-workers were harder to deal with than others but overall got along with everyone. I love the busy environment. I was rarely ever bored and met a lot of really great people.
good,"Training on the job could be better. Overall, great place to work. Great for college students."
good,"A typical day at work begins when you arrive and are assigned to one of several positions/stations, which are switched up throughout your shift.  Cleanliness, a general awareness, a sense of urgency, ability to work  well with and without direction, patience and a friendly sales personality go far in this position."
good,Starbucks was a great position where management was very organized and provided a positive environment for partners.
good,"A typical day at work involves crafting espresso beverages, inventory counts, managing a team of 4-6 baristas, connecting with customers, and handling money.  Management is strict and depending on the district they can be corrupt. The hardest part of the job is dealing with high stress situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is crafting beverages and making people smile."
good,Open the store in the morning...prepare all the coffee. snack..beverage ...i learned how to cook different coffee. like how long it will take for blond coffee. etc...My supervisor and co-workers are very nice and helpful.. i love to communicate with customers and i remembered what are their favorites and offered their drinks to them ...enjoy their smiles every morning ...
good,"My day starts at 4 am I look forward to going into work and seeing my regulars and non regulars and my awesome partners. I enjoy working in a high volume store keeps in on my toes and very busy plus, I work better in those situations."
good,growth opportunites were great I was promoted every year bonuses were great. hardest part was working in the store when it was very busy.
good,"A lot of good cultural coffe and calm environment, and the associates were kind and considerate."
good,Great benefits for part-time employees.  Semi-flexible schedules.  Opportunity to move up for motivated people. Underpaid shift-leaders is where the company will lose people.
good,"A typical day at work isn't so typical, every day I find new challenges and obstacles I have to face. Being a shift supervisor im in charge of coaching, breaking, leading by example and being a role model for my team. The hardest part of my job is the location I work in. The starbucks im located at in inside of northwestern hospital. Everyday im learning how to adapt and brighten my customers day. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I made some ones day with just a cup of coffee or excellent customer service I give each and every customers."
good,"Responsible for all aspects of business management including but not limited to logistics, marketing, financial analysis, sales, staff recruiting and development, operations management and accounting."
good,starbucks is a great and stable job while in school they are very flexible with scheduling and have great benefits. the hardest part is working at a high volumes store with a short staff at times.
good,"I am often one of the people who works at night and performs the closing-store tasks which include many different cleaning tasks, and setting up for our morning crew. I have learned how to be efficient and accurate on a daily basis because little else is accepted. My co workers and I rely on a team effort to keep things moving. Often, if one person doesn't complete their task, I find myself picking up the slack. But I do have to say, the most enjoyable part of my job is the customer interaction, and the friendships I have built with my co workers over the years. I often spend more time with them than my own family!"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work and you will meet lots of different people. It seems hard to learn at first,but soon you'll be a pro. Take advantage of all the great benefits!"
good,"A great place to work.  The energy is very upbeat and the people, both employees and customer, are great."
good,"I've worked with Starbucks going on seven years and have worked at five locations within the time frame. Since then I've become a trainer where it is my responsibility to train new employees that come to the store. "
good,"Starbucks has an amazing way of knowing how to hire people with fun personalities. Over the past ten years working there the people are going to be what I miss the most. They really know how to make the best out of any situation and keep moving forward to a goal. The work is fun as well; mixing drinks, meeting all kinds of people, and seeing a lot of different life styles. The hardest part would be the push from the company to reach goals but never any incentive for the team. I heard a bunch of people say, "" Why should I work so hard for the company but they give me so little?"". I never viewed it that way and encouraged others to see what the company did offer. I learned that costumers are what hold a business together. Keeping people happy and giving them a reason to come back is what will make a company thrive. Whether it be the amazing drinks or special offers to loyal customer, or even the baristas that make people want to return. Customer satisfaction is key and should always be the main focus."
good,"Travailler à Starbucks c'est travailler dans la bonne humeur."
good,I enjoy putting smiles on my partners/customers faces each day. The benefits are great.
good,"I've worked at Starbucks far longer than I ever planned. I love so many aspects of this job."
good,Great company overall- good PT jobs- flexible schedule. I got good face to face experience dealing with customers.
good,lovely people. flexible hours. friendly coworkers. fast pace job during certain times of the day. inventory comes every week. but there are several people who you work with at one time. and you also make tips.
good,"I love Starbucks. I have worked here for 5 years and I have always loved my customers and coworkers. However, ""labor hours"" leave the store constantly understaffed, making most days very stressful. It's not that I am unwilling to do my job to the best of my ability, but I don't feel I am paid enough to do all of the things that are expected of me. It is a great company with excellent benefits (Health Coverage, 401k, annual stock grants) and if I were paid more for my hard work I would work here forever,"
good,"Great work place. Fun and exciting, but no management growth."
good,t was awesome making coffee and being able to talk to people and get to know your customers. I had a blast.
good,"A typical day at work for me was good , i got promoted to team trainer after a moonth of hard work . i learned how to locate items using the PDA handset. I got along very well with my co workers and management was ok. I didnt have any hard days im a fast learner. What i enjoyed most was meeting new people and helping others."
good,"Working at Starbucks has presented me with a lot of different situations and experiences I could grow and expand on. "
good,"I love working at Starbucks but I cant afford to work here anymore as I live on my own. My co-workers are sad to see me leave as I am one of the top supervisors in the store. My store manager, Cara Cser, would tell you the same. Last QASA audit I was supervising and got us a 96% which is very high. I have learned people skills working here, as well as customer service and how to work all day with high energy. Hardest part of the job I would say is keeping the customers happy, while also supervising the team, making sure everyone is doing their tasks and keeping the store looking great so ensure customers come back."
good,"As a part time second job I loved my time at Starbucks.  I picked up every shift that was offered to me, which included people calling me to pick up their shifts.  I worked just shy of 40 hours due to all the shifts I picked up.  I love the customers, most of the time, and loved my co-workers.  Once Starbucks became my full time job the new manager started cutting my hours because she didn't like me.  I suspect she put me on the none rehire list because she took what I said to her in a negative manner when trying to help her bond with the employees VS how she was treating them as her own personal slaves."
good,"Taste test candies on a regular basis, interact with customers and manage floor stock. It was my first job so I did learn about customer service, and about putting the customer first, regardless. Management was wonderful, my supervisor helped me out with my scheduling while going to school. My coworkers were upbeat and so much fun to be around. The most enjoyble part of the job was working in the mall."
good,"Everyday Is A Busy, Consistent, And Devoted Day To Make Customers Happy As They Walk In And Happier As They Leave Out."
good,You will make handcrafted drinks daily for customers. Assist customers on coffee and drink choices.
good,"Although I do think Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for, I am looking for a new challenge in the workplace. Unfortunately, many of the positions that I would be interested in are in Seattle, our corporate headquarters. I have worked with some awesome partners over these many years and have learned a lot from them. I am looking to take my enthusiasm and management skills to another company, where I can continue to learn, grow and provide customers with an excellent product."
good,"The company's policies are very straight-forward and all employees are treated equally.  There's a lot of good things about Starbucks; however, my biggest problem with my experience has been the management.  Of course, it's a lot of customer service, which I've always had a love-hate relationship with, and a lot of cleaning and upkeep, but I think it's worth the pay and benefits."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks was very busy with repeat customers. I learned about all different types of coffees, the regions they came from, and the difference in taste and effectiveness of the caffeine. Management was not the best at the locations that I worked at which took away from the overall experience of working for such a great company. My co-workers were a little immature for the age group of people that I worked with but were overall great with the customers in which that is all the really mattered. The hardest part of the job was realizing that no matter how hard I worked and that I would never get the chance to advance. Once again the most enjoyable part was the relationships that I built with the customers, it was more like serving friends."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks was just the same thing everyday, get there sign in and just on the register, fix the pastry case and make the drinks of the customers that came. "
good,The job is very hands on and knowing how to talk and interact with customers is key. This was very is for me as I love getting to know customers and making sure they want to come back to the company in the future.
good,"Great first job, Starbucks values its people and the culture that is created by every individual that they employee. Despite some very high strung customers working with people that are so drastically different from yourself helps acclimate a person to the real world of work. Great place!"
good,"The friendly employees, flexible schedule and multitude of locations made Starbucks a very pleasant and rewarding place to work during my years in school. While moving between home and college, year to year, I was able to find consistent work and develop a very strong appreciation for customers service. The regulars alone make the retail environment feel more comfortable while the generally knowledgeable and amicable management staff train and motivate you to make the best out of your experience at the company. The wages are competitive and the benefits are comprehensive. Overall, a great option for a position in the food service/retail space."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consists most importantly, of making people smile. It also consists of serving coffee, interacting with co-workers and customers, cleaning, organizing, stocking shelves, etc. "
good,"Difficult clients, long hours but friendly staff."
good,"Serving and Meeting a new customers and enjoying the smell of coffee. I learned how to address myself to people and how to prepare drinks. Being friendly and getting along with my Co-Workers, they are very productive. Getting the chance to make a signature drink."
good,"Starbucks provids a fast-paced job great for multi-taskers.  I have gained so much knowledge in customer service as well as cash management, leadership skills, and deployment."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a very good experience, I have learned a lot about time management and speed in doing the things I do."
good,I work 2 different locations in Southern Missouri and would still be employed with them if i hadn't changed locations.
good,"Working as a shift supervisor really developed my leadership skills and cash management skills. Also, I learned how to operate a business and gained great exposure to different aspect of the company."
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers while they waited for their beverages.
good,"great place to work, started working there when i was 16 whilst doing my gcse's, great place, great staff and great coffee."
good,"As a barista, I learned practically everything I know now about customer service and coffee. A typical day at work for me started around 5-6 in the morning and being assigned to the bar area to prepare beverages and man the morning rush. When the rush was over, duties included deep cleaning and re-organization of the pastry case."
good,"A typical day is talking with regular customers, preparing drinks, and cleaning. I learned how to become more personal with people and how to be a leader. Management depends on what store you work at some stores had very understanding merciful managers and others kind gave an attitude that they didn't care. You will meet very interesting people who are open to help and guide you along your journey with Starbucks. The hardest part is when you first get hired learning all the routines and drink recipes. The most enjoyable part is going to other stores meeting new people and getting to know the customers."
good,A great Starter job. Helped to enstill in me a very high ethic when it comes to work. Met some really great people while working for this company and learned some very valuable skills.
good,"I worked under difficult management, but consider myself a coffee connoisseur and was excited to work for the company. I opened on weekend mornings and was often exhausted, so it was difficult to find a work/life balance with those hours. I loved working the bar and making delicious drinks for people. This location is difficult in that the customers are very particular and hard to please, but that just means you have to be willing to cater to your clientele."
good,"On a typical day at work I make coffee for the world! I've learned a lot since working for this company. Customer service skills, how to make drinks and a lot about the coffee world. I've had good managers and bad managers. Aside from management, my coworkers are a blast. Without them I don't know how I'd make it through the day. In my opinion the job isn't hard. But the hardest parts about the job for most is the constant change in routines and providing legendary customer service to the customers who aren't very friendly. The best part of the day is providing that legendary service that just so happens to make someone's day."
good,"In my journey with Starbucks i learned a lot, and developed my management skills, and got courses as well, for food safety and deployment and retail mindset. I got a lot of experience in retail as well and in managing the stores and working in a team environment and being a leader. Customer connection, promoting products."
good,This has been a great experience with this company. I am always busy during the day.
good,"Great Work place"
good,"Fun work place "
good,"Overall, my time at Starbucks had been very positive.  At no point did I ever feel ire or frustration with my partners on the floor.  The training program was fantastic and I learned a lot about how to successfully run a store and effectively manage a team."
good,"I liked Starbucks, as a manager there i worked in a very fast paced environment with alot of variables."
good,Worked with the most amazing people. Enjoyed the interactions. Most difficult part was moving up within the company.
good,"Preparación de distintos tipos de café, atender desde la barra, ofreces algún muffin o dulce para acompañar el café."
good,"When you join Starbucks you become a part of a family, I started off great as a barista, learned a lot about leadership, hardwork. Then I was promoted to Shift lead and transferred to another store. A lot of politics but im not the type to complain, push yourself, work hard, and dont complain. You will learn a lot about yourself. I would recommend this job for the students, the schedules are flexible. If you show you are a hard worker you will move up with the company. AND FREE COFFEE!"
good,I found the security in hours the worst I ever had to experience. I worked 16 hour days just to make 40 hours.
good,"Great benefits, and a company that cares about its employees."
good,"I handled the needs of customers on a daily basis. I did my best to provide ""the Starbucks Experience"" to whoever entered the store. I work closely with my co workers to maintain store appearance and cleanliness."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been an overall great experience. Day in and day out my job is to deliver great customer service which is more then just a smile. It about creating a warm and inviting environment, cleanliness, speed, quality beverages, engaging in conversations and just going that extra mile. It has taught me work ethic, management skills, to work well with people from all walks of life. Taught me patience and how to handle difficult situations professionally. The hardest part about my job has to be the unusual hours from waking up at 2:30am or getting home past midnight. The most enjoyable has to be the not knowing. Everyday you see and speak with customers from different countries, meet celebrities, get unusual drink orders, you just never know what kind of day it going to be at Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks can be a very enjoyable company to work for.  There is a lot of customer interaction, which can be excellent for a customer-minded person.  The work can be repetitive, but this is made enjoyable by an excellent group of co-workers.  Like most retail jobs, however, the schedule follows business patterns pretty closely, so there is really no such thing as a regular schedule.  This works well when you are in college, but when you want some regularity in your life, this is not where you get it."
good,"I worked the closing shift at night starting from 5pm -11pm.  The job was very tense at times during the rushes, the job gets very fast paced at times but not stressful due to other starbucks' in the area.  "
good,The greatest part about working for Starbucks is the interaction with some of the best customers. They become family over the years of serving them. It always brightens my day when I hear how much they love their drinks. It is fast pace at most locations in the mornings but with great coworkers and communication it can run smoothly.
good,"I am lucky to be part of an excellent management who manage a great team of workers. "
good,"Daily operational management and customer service. All of the benefits and downsides of a corporate environment with a successful, recognizable brand."
good,"great job, learned a lot serving peoples needs in a timely fashion. also enjoy connecting with my customers daily"
good,Productive workplace learning the way a business branch should be managed.
good,"With the sheer volume of stores in the area, the opportunities for advancement within the company are limited due to a high number of people being interested in and competing for openings at the store management level. Otherwise, this job is a great environment to learn valuable skills in being a productive team member and gaining skills in retail leadership."
good,"mostly everyday I would take orders from customers and prepare requested foods for the , also drinks(barista) . the hardest part about this job is maintaining the cafe clean and restocked and ready for the next day especially when its a steady day, but with my good team we always have a way to overcome difficult obstacles. The most enjoyable part about this job is that I make peoples day by giving them what they crave and making them feel comfortable!"
good,"I was a Barista and loved it. I learned how to make a great cup of coffee and lattes. I enjoyed my co-workers, nice friendly group. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the customers."
good,"Busy mornings. Learned customer service, beverage routines and retail sales. Unstable management over the course of a year and not everyone is cut out for the job."
good,"A typical day would be opening or closing the store and making the best drink on earth! Training the co-workers to give the best service to the customers that came from a great cup of joe. Making the drinks, greeting customers, checking the store for cleanliness and a stocked  area with coffee enhancements or products to take home."
good,"nice people, get to interact with lots of customers, gain a lot of coffee knowledge and share it with the customers. weekend was very busy and that's how you show you can work in a really busy environment and stay calm even when its a lot under pressure. "
good,"Keeping busy."
good,It's a great company to work for but advancement within the company is a very slow drawn-out process.
good,"This job was immensely challenging at first. Memorizing drinks, customer names, and beverage routines was exhausting in every regard. Once you've got the gist of it, it becomes an easy job to be lazy at; however, if you're like me and you enjoy pushing yourself, you can turn this job into a very exhausting workplace. "
good,This is a great company.  Insurance and benefits are given to part-time employees.  The only cons are that not all shift supervisors are consistant with how they manage the baristas.  The co-workers are all very friendly and make any new-comer feel very welcome.
good,"When I come into work I either work at the registers, behind the drink bar, or at the drive thru. I enjoy working with all of my co workers because they are very easy to get along with them. When you don't know something they are all welling to train you and help you in any way possible. The hardest part of the job was learning all the drinks and how to make them. The best part of my job is remembering all the customers name's and knowing their drink before they can say anything. They always love that. You also get some good conversations and get to know a lot about the regulars."
good,"A typical day at work was setting up the kiosk and keeping it clean through out the day. I learned how to effectively time manage and great customer service. My coworkers were all fabulous and helped me a lot while I was just starting. The hardest part was learning the beverages, but once I had that down it was easy. The most enjoyable part of my days were seeing my regulars."
good,"Fast-paced environment. Customer service skills tested on a daily basis, but regular customers remind you why you love your job. As a shift supervisor, I improved my time management and became more assertive. District managers and regional managers are typical of any other big corporation: they have no idea what it's like to work behind the counter! A wide range of ages but always fun and energetic.  "
good,This is probably one of the most fun job I've had thus far. I wouldn't change it my decision ever!
good,High quality is expected at Starbucks. Quality in beverages and service is expected. Interesting to interact with customers through out the day.
good,"Great job and very flexible with hours and school scheduling, and benefits are offered after 6 months of employment."
good,It's an amazing company to work for. Your experience will REALLY depend on the location and the crew that you're surrounded by. I loved my time at Starbucks. But have worked at different stores and some outside of mine I would NEVER apply to. REALLY REALLY hit or miss.
good,There are many pros to the corporation. The customers were the best part of my day as well as the majority of my co-workers.
good,This job redefined the term multitask for me. Good job if you love interacting with people all day long.
good,"I usually worked the closing shift. So during the whole shift our team would handle regular duties and be closing down/cleaning for the night, little by little. We would all have our duties/place we were assigned to. I was usually on the pastry/register side. It was a fast, multitasking, prepping, cleaning, serving, getting to know your customers, up selling kind of job.. Always busy and made the shift go by. Management was kind of crazy. We had four different managers in the year and a half I was there. They all had there own way of running things. My co-workers were mostly all awesome to work with. Had a few slackers here and there. The hardest part of my job would had to be closing in the night and sometimes covering someone for opening shift the next morning at 5:30..but I always came when needed.. Most enjoyable part was getting to know all the usual customers and looking forward to seeing them everyday.."
good,The hours varied. Generally worked the opening or closing shifts. The jobs was basically making coffee based beverages for customers.
good,I have enjoyed my job at Starbucks on a military base. I enjoy working for the soilders.
good,"I had an amazing time working as a Starbucks Team Leader. Overall I helped to hire, train and develope my staff to become the best representation of myself. I worked on the schedules, set up all new promotions, maintain an accurate inventory, placed all the orders, maintain a strong communication with the Starbucks regional manager, Target's store manager and the Executives in the building. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping to develope my team. I enjoy working closely with individuals who have ambition and go above and beyond to make sure not only the guests are happy but they are happy with their overall performance. I have a better understanding of running a business day to day and look forward to bringing these skills to a great company."
good,"Se priman los standares, la atención al cliente y el compañerismo."
good,"Love working with Starbucks! It's a one-of-a-kind of company that upholds a certain culture that I believe in, that is providing a third place for each and every costumer. The first place being home, second place being work, and the third place (I personally believe) is a haven where people are allowed to not only relax, but to work as well. It could even be a regular hang-out place or even a conference room!"
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. I loved the culture of it, that if I needed a shift covered I could call another store, that I received a free pound of coffee every week. While I worked there, almost every friend I had a met at Starbucks, and I'm still friends with most of those people. While it is a corporate environment, a lot of that fades into the background as it's a fairly fast-paced job and there aren't any guidelines that are difficult to follow. Also, having worked at 5 different locations, I can honestly say that each location has it's own flavor/vibe."
good,Starbucks opens early and often closes late so typical shifts are during inconvenient hours.
good,Typical day at work
good,"Overall great place to work. Management needs some work, but our sales are going up. My co-workers are great. the hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers, but most of the time they are understanding after we talk to them. The most enjoyable part is seeing people come in from all parts of the world. I've met people from France, Germany, Australia, Canada, India, Africa, and many more."
good,"A great place to work. The only drawbacks are your usual customer service issues, other than that it is an excellent company to work for."
good,"Typical day: Provide exceptional customer service, stay on top of all store cleanliness and mandatory stocking in down time, and create a perfect coffee experience for every customer."
good,a typical day at starbucks is just being busy.
good,I was able to use my experience in management and retail to work and mentor the team members to expand their knowledge of the products the company sells beside the drinks. Showed them how to maximize a sales opportunity and rewarded them for their great results and effort. Great comraderie in all shifts and team members.
good,The company really focuses on creating a great experience for their employees as well as for their customer. Great place to develop your management skills
good,"Working at Starbucks never a dull moment. Certainly more than just serving coffee. Must be able to multitask to meet the store and customer needs as customer service and sales are core goals of this company. Starbucks offer plenty to their partners and one of the best ""fast food"" restaurant companies to work for."
good,I love basically everything about this job. Especially my coworkers. The hardest part about this job is that it is no where near what I want to do with my life.
good,"Overall Starbuck was an okay workplace. The Starbuck I was at was very fun. Unfortunately the job is fairly stressful, and the pay is not good."
good,Great benefits. Family-like atmosphere. Starbucks gave me the opportunity at a young age to develop life-skills like management.
good,"Duties included supervising Barista's, Assisted the store manager in executing store operations during scheduled shifts. Implemented new partner training by positively reinforcing successful performance and giving respectful and encouraging coaching as needed. Also provided feedback to store manager on partner performance during shift. Delivered legendary customer service to all customers by acting with a customer comes first attitude and connecting with the customer. Developed positive relationships with shift team by understanding and addressing individual motivation, need and concerns"
good,"Everyday was something new, new people, new stories ,and new smile....Greeting people was the best part of the job ,you can make somebodies day jus by saying Hi"
good,"The store I worked in was very friendly, happy, and clean. My associates and I worked very hard to maintain the environment as efficient, clean and fun. A typical day at work was very enjoyable, we cleaned everything, held conversations with regular and new customers, and the lineups would go by quickly with excellent teamwork."
good,"Through my experience working there i love the people, customers and co workers. Its a good vibe when you enter the location, everyone greets and meets people in a good and profeesional way."
good,If you have great management the job is a breeze and customers can be great.
good,"Starbucks is one of the most enjoyable positions I have ever been in. There was never a dull moment, and the job itself had very few, if any, bad points."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast-paced environment with lots of memorization involved. Customer service is a our number one priority, so talking to customers and making sure they get exactly what they want is necessity. I've learned a lot about how to manage my time and also how to ask for help when I need it!"
good,at starbucks you'll have fun with co workers and customers all the time
good,"Meeting a lot of wonderful people on a day to day bases. Loved my team at Broadway and Canal. I never thought I would have loved the experience as much working in the food & beverage industry but Starbucks was the best. Learning to make and customize drinks was amazing. Although sometimes customers could be a pain, I made it my job to make sure there experience weather it be the first or third time for the day was personal. Starting out as a Barista and making Shift Supervisor in 6 months. I would do it again in a heart beat."
good,When I started with the company it was a great place to work. I enjoyed coming to work because it didn't feel like work but as the emphasis stopped revolving around the customer and started revolving around expansion the enjoyment of being there disappeared.
good,The co-workers are fun. Managers' need to be a little more willing to work. It is a fast-pace job. It is fun but stressful. The customers with get on every nerve you have.
good,"A typical day at work consists of serving your regulars their coffee, helping new customers find just the right drink to suit their needs and encouraging people who seem to be having a hard day."
good,Starbucks provided a fun atmosphere and people you meet are phenomenal
good,Wonderful co-workers and enjoyed the manager experience.
good,Great place to work. The staff are supportive and friendly.
good,Valuable job experience. Lots of turnover in upper management.
good,It is a great company to work with. The benefits are amazing. They have very strong core values as an company as a whole. Limited Store management opportunity but definite growth from barista to shift supervisor.
good,"a typical work day goes by fast because it is a fast paced job. i've learned how to develop more my multi tasking tasking skills, learned how to deal with pressure, not to stress too much from work. the company itself is a good company with all the good benefits. we have a good working relationship in our store/branch itself, we are like a family. the hardest part of this king of job is that you need to control your emotions because there are days that customers are just as irrate or difficult but still you have to keep your composure. on the other hand the most enjoyable part is that you get to see your regular customers, have a little talk, lighten up your day if it was not that goos as you pictured it to be."
good,A typical day at work was also either a typical day or had an exciting change to it. I've learned that each location runs differently. Management is okay but I think it depends on the store. The co-workers were okay in my first store but other stores I worked at were horrible. The hardest part of the job would have to be when an upset customer would throw a hot drink at you. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing my regulars and having their drinks ready for them. Another exciting part would be suggesting or making a memoryable drink for a customer that was not listed as one of our every day recipes.
good,Here I was able to learn valuable lessons about teamwork and understanding the importance of communication in the workplace.
good,It is great experience workings for Starbucks the benefits the people the loving customers I’ve learn how to survive the health department the hardest part of the job was dealing with the little rules and regulation set forth and there is no changes... Management was management always there to apprehend you if you’re doing wrong trying to developed you into becoming better. overall a great experience.
good,"I started out loving my job, but over the years, the company turned into a money making company. A typical day consist of ringing up customers, brewing coffee, and making bar beverages. I have learned great customer service tools from Starbucks. My co-workers and I are more like an dysfunctional family. Hardest part of the job has to be interacting with displeased customers. Best part of Starbucks has to be the relationships you make, with co-workers and also customers."
good,"Extremely busy. If you like a fast- paced environment this is the job for you. Fairly easy to move up with dedication and hard work. You can always make your 40 hours. Even if your only schedule for 25 hours at your store, you can work at any other Starbucks location with open shifts to get your hours. In addition to your weekly pay, you also get tips every week."
good,"The management at the store was not professional, although working with starbucks changed my life. It made me more of a confident person and I enjoyed going to work everyday."
good,Great Benifiets and Fun Job While in school I bacame an assistant manager then Graduated! Was sooo Much Fun While It Lasted
good,my day at work start of as taking customers orders and preparing drinks as well as ringing them up on our register. After closing the store we clean up and break down everything to make sure the store looks spotless for the next shift.
good,"Starbucks has some of the most loyal, and interesting customers. They are a company in which is truely dedicated to providing excellent cutomer service. My typical day at work was a little hectic. Sometimes it can get kind of crazy, but i managed to do okay. It helped turn me into a great multi-tasker. I personallly loved my store manager, she was a wonderful caring person. Though, i must say that they sometimes did not find the best candidates to manage other stores. They did a lot of ""outside"" hiring, which is fine, but starbucks can be a difficult job to just jump right into. It can be expecially hard if you have no previous barista skills. All in all i feel very grateful to have trained as a barista through starbucks, and to have worked with such great people. Starbucks definitley has a way of attacting great workers!"
good,Awesome co-workers and management was fantastic! Unfortunately the hourly pay was min wage.
good,Starbucks was a great experience overall. They are a highly organized retail restaurant company with a boiler plate approach to management; all of the tools necesary to managing are there along with the support of field management and operations support.
good,"Come into work, and generally receive a till (register) on the drive-thru window. Depending on the shift: stay at drive-thru all day, switch registers as needed, make drinks as ordered by the customers, clean certain areas of the store on a daily basis, sort and put away the product shipment, count and divide tips among the partners on a weekly basis, help break down things for the store at closing time (including: cleaning store, washing out machines, gather register tills for shift-lead, and prep for the opening crew's success)."
good,Starbucks is a very fast paced environment where everyday you will learn something new.
good,"Fast pace environment with a constant flow of people eager to buy coffee, lattes, and smoothies. On the other hand, the health benefits are set at a very reasonable price."
good,The most enjoyable part about working at Starbucks would have to be the culture and the people that come into the store everyday.
good,Learned many valuable skills and love the coffee. Fast paced and still fun to add artistry to drinks. Fellow employees are fun to work with.
good,"You learn to make coffee drinks, use the cash register, and clean everything in the store. The Starbucks Culture is one of the best I've ever seen in a company. You get free coffee and wonderful co-workers and customers. I loved this job."
good,"With a decent crew, the job is fast-paced and hectic, but enjoyable. The pay isn't high, but the health benefits are very good and cheap as well as available to part-timers."
good,"What I enjoy most about working at Starbucks are the people I have met while working on the job. I have met and have become acquanted with interesting people that are my co-workers as well as customers. Starbucks isn't lying when they say people connect over company and/or Starbucks is a person's ""second home."" For alot of the customers and (and Starbucks Partners too) if they are not at home they are at Starbucks. I feel people are able to feel this way because we provide great customer service while actaully getting to know some of the customers we see everyday."
good,"This company is great to work for because of the benefits and usually because of your co workers. It has a great way to work up into better positions. It is tough if you are working more then 20 hours a week and want to balance your life, its dupable but you will be feeling like you have to go to bed and then you have work at 7 in the morning. Or you will have what I call the day killer shift which is your 10-630, no time to do anything at all in the morning except go to dinner or go home and wait for work. Now when it comes to your boss it differs from store to store. Depending on how you interact with your boss what your boss expects from you and what you expect of your boss, it can sometimes cause stress in the store or could make or break you day. It just depends on who your working for your personality and theres like any business. As I said in the title it is one of the best jobs to have while looking for another job or a high school, college job. I would say go for it if you need work but cant find anything yet and done want to be sitting around until that interview."
good,"With Starbucks, I was promoted within a month of being employed to a shift supervisor. My typical days consisted of arriving at work at 4:15 A.M. to set up the store. Setting up the store involved counting each register to make sure they had started out with a certain amount of money, getting the coffee machines ready, setting up the pastries, and putting out the tables and trash cans. Because I worked the morning shifts near a hospital, the line was always out the door, so I always had to be on point with things work through the rush. My first day on the job I was sort of in shock, but I loved that shift. I got to know all the regulars and definitely learned how to work in a fast paced environment. I also learned about multi tasking and how to prioritize as there were regulars who came in needing their orders at a certain time and I had to take care of the others in line. I enjoyed meeting a lot of people and seeing the smiles on their faces once they took their first sip of coffee for the day."
good,"A typical day at work would include large amounts of cleaning (I am usually working a closing shift), and setting up for the next day. However, when I did work mornings or mid shifts, I would usually be the barista making drinks and passing them off to customers. It takes a certain talent to be able to make beverages at the customers' desired speed, and with the quality that Starbucks expects, but I consider myself to be fairly good at what I do on my shift. Co-workers can be hit and miss, I am usually one to stay out of drama and things associated with other people at work, but I also have some good friends at my workplaces that I have made over the years. The biggest obstacle I have run into when at work is dealing with the management, because in my three years' experience working at multiple stores, I have worked with probably only one manager that I believe deserved the title of her position. I hardly felt a superior aura in any of the other managers I have had, and was a victim of workplace misconduct by the managers on multiple occasions. On the brighter side, I think this job has provided me with immense communication experience, and has helped me break out of my shell and show people my skill and determination to be a good employee and individual in the workplace and outside of that environment as well."
good,"This was one of the funnest jobs that I ever had, but the recession of 2008 hit Starbucks hard - therefore, hours are tough for baristas. It's very competitive. The benefit are good, if you can manage to consistently work 20+ hours a week."
good,"Everyday I look forward to going to work and working with my fellow partners. I am part of the management team, who is lead by one of the best managers I have had the pleasure of working with. The hardest part is following all the intricate standards, but because they are easily defined and concise and because we all hold each other accountable, it is an ever-changing paced positive environment."
good,"Team mates very coachable, and management very understanding to sales associates"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great experience for students. It allows for flexible hours as well as shifts during the morning, afternoon and evening. The environment is fun and full of energy, and allows employees to develop new skills and relationships within the workplace."
good,Great loyal customers and friendily employees.
good,"Starbucks is a friendly, fun, and fast-paced environment. They look after their partners by providing health, vision, 401K, and stock benefits for even their part-time employees."
good,"Starbucks was a good company to work for. It is very busy and theres always alot going on, so you have to pay close attention to your assigned tasks. Also, this job offers a lot of benefits throughout the company."
good,"This job has taught me so much about customer service, culture, and all the types of people that are out there in this world. The company always tries to accommodate all the partners. My managers are like my friends, but they always up hold professionalism. This has been the longest job I have had because I have enjoyed working for this company. They give a lot back to their employees."
good,Great company for low to mid level employees. Store management staff is usually fantastic and will work hard to train and keep its partners happy.
good,"planning team is smart, effective and goal driven."
good,"Always cover yourself...recap and/or ALL important communications in an email to your DM and cc yourself. Print the email for your own records. Especially, when a inexperienced outside hire ASM...watch their time & attendance closely."
good,"I loved Starbucks company values. I think it's amazing they offer to pay for college if that is applicable in your situation. Amazing. I also think the company does a great job at keeping you informed of changes and new promotions, etc."
good,"PERSONALLY, i loved working at starbucks. when i was there i obviously had lots of emotions just from being on the front end of the service industry.  (Its never easy) at Starbucks i dealt with alot of bad managers (we went through 3 in the two years i was there) super high turn overrate but i pretty passionately believe that that might've just been my store. the co workers i had there i will forever love, met my best friend in the world there. communicating with partner resources is super super easy but getting help directly from your district manager is a LOST CAUSE. (seriously getting your regional managers help is also just as useless) if you have a problem with starbucks STAND. YOUR. GROUND. hold them accountable to the type of workplace they try to foster."
good,I met a lot of very motivated people and enjoyed learning to make drinks and connecting with customers. My managers were always understanding of my schedule.
good,"Good pay, flexible scheduling, plenty of growth opportunities, good HR, lots of corporate BS to learn from and grow, really simple plug and play job format."
good,"They are very laid back. And by very I mean VERY. It could be seen as a good thing or a bad thing. When I first started training, no one really knew when they were training me and there wasn't any formal training. I was just kind of pushed into things, but that made me learn faster. Now that I've been working for about a month, I would rate it a 4 out of five. But my first week would be a 2 out of five."
good,"Overall is a great job to work for, lots of wiggle room for flexibility in your schedule if you are attending school. The job is difficult within the first two weeks, but once you are caught on to recipes etc. the job is fairly easy. Seems to have a lot of management issues however, as there seems to be a constant change in General and District Managers, making it difficult to identify the company's goals and how to improve for those employees who seem to struggle. Great benefits and very friendly coworkers and work environment, however."
good,"I was able to finish school, and have a part time while I was working on a career path. It a good first job after high school while figuring out life."
good,Starbucks is as welcoming a place to work as it is for our regulars. Great benefits and provides excellent resume material beyond customer service. Highly recommend.
good,I would recommend working at Starbucks to anyone. They offer good benefits and can accommodate well for work/life balance. It can be very fast paced but the time goes by quite quickly.
good,"Workplace culture needs work, lots of drama between coworkers at various locations. Customers are generally more courteous than other establishments. Took a long time to figure out the drink recipes and determine how to order food and how much to order. Unrealistic expectations for balancing food waste percentages and product availability."
good,"I love this company. I wouldn't stay with them 5+ years! There are wonderful benefits and the partners are amazing, but it's work. Not work for the weak."
good,"Most stores are focused on drive-thru performance. You'll have one person taking orders in the lobby and helping with drinks, one person only doing drive-thru, and one or two people making the drinks on bar.  Usually the store will get ready to open with two people, gain a couple more to open, exchange a couple for lunch, lose one until late, and close with two employees. The environment is fun but if their are too many customers at inconvenient times can be stressful."
good,Would not recommend job if you are not a people person. Very fast paced. Chill environment. The job is perfect for anyone in school and trying to work as well. They will usually fit with your schedule and also provide you great benefits.
good,Starbuck teaches a method they call sequencing. It teaches efficiency in time management and team work which can easily be achieved once good habits are formed.
good,"There’s a lot thing you can learn from starbucks , their benefits also good . You can interact with customer and also at the same time , you get to learn about your customer."
good,"Starbucks is such a wonderful company to work for. The job can be stressful at times especially with the rush of the drive thru and times that you need to focus on during peak. Other than that, it is a lot of fun. Everyone works together as a team. Your regulars are like family to you once you get to know them. The benefits are amazing. I would highly recommend Starbucks to anyone."
good,"My employment at Starbucks helped introduce me to a high stress work environment. I loved my coworkers they were all fantastic and very supportive, the atmosphere was very nice and relaxing and it was very enjoyable to develop relationships with the customers. The job was a bit overwhelming at times especially when on bar during the after work rush."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to meet new people and grow your passion for coffee. Flexible scheduling and the ability to accomplish goals outside of the workplace. Depending on the management, the experience can be rewarding and fun, or can be total garbage and the worst experience ever. Wish they paid more for how most customers treat you, but if you can let things roll off your back , its an easy job with great benefits."
good,"I love working at Starbucks... The pay is more than minimum wage but hours are limited at times making it hard to get a decent paycheck. The benefits are amazing free bags of coffee weekly, free online schooling, as well as free drinks while you're working. The management staff is great! They want you become a great barista so some will give you a little push to make sure you succeed."
good,This job is typically a 10-14 hour day. Working holidays is a must and is somewhat difficult to manage with having a family. Upper management is supportive at times. The hardest part of the job is being expected to work on your days off and come in to work if somebody calls off.
good,"Starbucks tries to achieve greatness by pushing their employees in the opposite direction. It is relatively a great place to work with lots of great benefits. On the surface level, Starbucks is trying to create a great place to come and visit. But to achieve this, they are pushing their employees to be non genuine robots; it's almost counter intuitive. There are better ways to achieve what Starbucks as a company is trying to do, which is creating a safe place for people. They just struggle with realizing the best ways to do this without pushing employees over the edge."
good,"Although it is less pay and stuff, you do get drinks and it can be pretty fun to work there. But it gets super busy, as it is on the college campus. So in that sense I wish they would pay us more, because normal Starbucks gets paid way more. The management is really nice though."
good,There are pros and cons to every job. They offer good benefits and depending on the store a flexible schedule. Some stores also have a higher customer flow which may make it hard to keep up if you are not prepared to work hard. It is very easy to transfer stores and you can also easily cover shifts at other stores for more hours.
good,"L entreprise est très orientée sur le client et ses employés. C est très valorisant et enrichissant. Les avantages sont nombreux dans cette entreprise ( assurance, reductions et autres) . Les evolutions de carrière sont faciles si on en démontre la volonté et le potentiel. Petit bémol, le salaire en bas d échelle, en tout cas en debut de carrière."
good,"You’ll be working hard, fast, and make mistakes. Most managers I have experienced have been very good about helping new employees  it’s a decent job  wear short sleeves"
good,Working at Starbucks has taught me how to have pride in my work and always strive to be my best. Having value in your work provides better service and a more friendly environment for both customers and employees.
good,Was fun at times but can be times where’s people was mean and management was so organized didn’t really care about there employees unless they needed something
good,"Not a career, but a fun job while in college. Excellent benefits, including health insurance, sick and vacation time for part time employees. Very physically demanding job."
good,Management is good I always got the time off i needed. They teach you everything and are very lenient if you can't do something. I liked the manager and my shifts but the other baristas often caused drama in the environment.
good,You should be self motivated and able to manage a lot at one time. It is an extremely fast pased environment and that can sometimes make it stressful. Not unlike any other job.
good,"active communication skill is needed in a such fast paced work environment. "
good,There is a lot of diversity and fun that comes out of working at starbucks. It can be stressful because of the high energy but it is manageable. The teamwork and social environment makes it a welcoming job as well as the flexibility with personal life
good,"fun job, management is designed to be great but some managers get away with slacking off. can not complain about the job other then the fact that when there is a call out, the entire team suffers. drowning in drinks to make, food to put in the oven, and lack of customer connections are being made."
good,Company with proven history and great company culture. Great support from the management up to certain level. Progression opportunities and partner scheme which after few years brings good  income.
good,"The hardest part of the job is that it is always changing.  Therefore, it is hard to get employees and customers onboard and stay loyal because of that.  Labour constraints are hard too, however recruiting great people is easy because it’s a great company to work for and the pool of applicants is always full."
good,If you have a passion for coffee and interacting with a diverse amount of customers its perfect. Where I worked in particular it was VERY busy so the day went quickly. If you're okay with pressure then working in Starbucks would be no problem.
good,The customers and your regulars make your day! And you do too by simply just making their drink and seeing them frequently. I like working here for the environment and people around me.
good,"Overall the environment is fast paced, productive, and innovative with its methods of presentation and marketing towards customers. There is a constant push to embody the values of the brand towards customers, with a strong attitude, attention to detail, time management, and responsibility for ones own actions--which are all valuable practices to maintain in a successful business environment."
good,"I really like my coworkers and my manger, customers were often difficult to deal with and work can be quite exhausting. I really enjoyed the benefits of being a partner."
good,"Customers can be really difficult sometimes as they feel personally victimized when their order doesn't go the way they want it. But, you get to spend a lot of time bonding with your team and more often than not, you leave the place with more friends and connections than when you first started."
good,I enjoyed working there and they offer great benefits. Great people to work with and you learn a lot of new things. My co workers were my favorite part of each day.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. The management looms out for the employees with good benefits. Depending on the position, the worl/ ife balance may be lacking."
good,"At Starbucks, I was able to get out in a work environment and an entire culture I did not even know existed. I was introduced to a whole new normal: coffee shop culture. I didn't know that there were people who frequently visited their local Starbucks, and I even grew to form relations with these people, remembering orders turned in to remembering names, remembering names led to learning about what they do for a living, which led to learning what they do outside of work, and I soon grew close to our customers. As for work, while it was very rigorous, it taught me a lot about how to really have a strong work ethic and how to overcome things that I thought I could never learn/never do. Overall, the experience that I had at Starbucks was amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who was interested."
good,"Management is good at the store level, but disconnected above that. The pay is low, but the benefits are pretty good. Overall, not a bad company to work for."
good,I love all of my employees and how inclusive everybody is with all the diversity that comes and goes through Starbucks. Everybody is helpful and makes work fun. Catching up with customers we havent seen in awhile or ones we see everyday is the best part of being at work.
good,"Starbucks has created a great culture within its employees. Salary is better in some states like California where as others are paid much less. Benefits are great of course, The partnership with Arizona State University is a nice opportunity. Overall a great company to work for. Not too great for advancement though."
good,"I don't really have complaints about the company itself, mostly complaints about certain stores. Depending on which Starbucks you work for, this should not be a job for beginners. Especially in big cities. it's easy to feel overwhelmed since its a high-stress job but having knowledge beforehand does really help."
good,"I have worked at 4 different locations but each of them were nothing less than amazing! The team bonding you get to experience is amazing! Some managers I had were not as wonderful as others but, you will have that no matter where you go. The benefits are amazing and not to mention the free drinks and food are always a perk!"
good,"Great way to learn about customer service, good benefits and from my experience great coworkers. Found a new love for coffee and making people’s days."
good,"lots of amazing people work here, great customers and excellent benefits"
good,"With some companies it’s easy to slide away from policies, but Starbucks is very strict in order to ensure all stores are the same. Make sure you know the rules, and follow them."
good,Positive work space with ample opportunity for learning and or growth. Great job while you are in school or seeking full time work. Flexible scheduling and option for full time hours or part time.
good,"This job definitely caters towards girls, but as a guy I can say it was a pretty fun experience. This job also gives you a lot of customer service experience."
good,working at Starbucks I can say it was an amazing experience meeting customers and growing with them. you learn peoples names and orders very fast which makes work a lot easier and fun!
good,It is a good pace to work for school students. There are a high demand for baristas since everyone revolves around coffee. They offer a lot of benefits including school assistance.
good,"Though they only hire 18 year olds Starbucks is a great place to start as a young adult. With free drinks, discounts, and tip money you can't go wrong"
good,"Very busy and physically demanding, excellent team members make the job easier and more fun. Well supported by the company with great benefits.  The most fun part about the job is meeting and interacting with customers, getting to know them."
good,"Lots to learn at first, but once you understand, it’s a great place to work. Finding long term staff can be tricky because of the learning curve. Some unrealistic expectations. Examples: drive thru times, budgeted scheduling hours"
good,In Starbucks a day of work goes very quick because you have too many things to do the team is very collaborative and team work is an emphasis of the company.
good,"The location i worked at was bitter sweet; The job, the employees and the experience was amazing and enjoyable but the management was not the best unfortunately. they had their minds a bit of everywhere and that messed up the experience for a lot of us."
good,"I loved this job. It required multi-tasking in a fast paced non stop environment. My unique skill set lent itself well to the managerial requirements and cleanliness standards that were so critical to the store management role. The staff became a team as it was necessary to anticipate each other's movements in order to streamline and expedite the order process. It became a dance of sorts. Unfortunately, during that season in my life the work/home life balance was not valued at the district level with in the company."
good,"Great place to work. Employee first focus. Good benefits, competitive pay. Internal growth opportunities become limited beyond Store Manager role. Overall, genuinely love working here."
good,"A typical day is somewhat stressful, between managing cleaning of the store and customers but overall I typically have a good day at work. Not only have I greatly increased my knowledge of coffee and the industry, but I have also learned how to communicate with people effectively and create a welcoming environment for customers. The management can vary between stores, but if your store manager is passionate about their job and their employees, then the whole environment of the store changes. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unpleasant people, whether that be customers or partners. The most enjoyable moments for me are those connections you make with the people around you. Lifelong friends have entered my life because of Starbucks."
good,"Fast paced environment. An actual book of standards a few hundred pages thick, but there is quite a bit of time to understand it. The training received is second to none, and your comprehension will only be tested in full at the conclusion of your training. Office politics are kept at a minimum, and you have an endless list of resources at you disposal. Stock plans, 401k, retirement, health insurance, and college assistance through ASU."
good,I worked at the starbucks in Ingles in Lincolnton. It was a great experience overall but had hiccups now and then. I have worked both morning and the afternoon. there were some shifts in management which caused a lot of changing with each new manager. I loved make connects with our regular customers and seeing them outside of work and being able to have a conversation with them. the hardest part I would say had to be the constant change in management.
good,I would get there at 4am and open the store. Good experience and I was got a free meal and drink a day. Free coffee bags per week as well. Management was really cool but the co-workers were always overwhelmed. I was at a high turn-over store. Hardest part of the job was acting alive at four in the morning.
good,"1.	Managed six to eight employees to ensure company service were executed for 150 -300 costumers per shift, and to ensure high volumes and/or events are resolved quickly to support costumers retention  "
good,"Great company for students or anyone without children who they need to provide stability for. Unfortunately, I left for a company with stable hours even though the pay was the same."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a good and bad experience. I have been employed at Starbucks for about 5 months now and I love it! The good part about working at Starbucks is you get to interact with the customers and build and develop a relationship with them individually. However, the only problem I seem to be running  into is the management at my store. Management at my store could be way better than its current state, however I have no complaints about the company what so ever!"
good,"ok job, have to be able to work fast under pressure. the benefits are very affordable. "
good,"Great company, Labor model is based on driving profitability, which makes it hard and sometimes stressful to do your job in a timely manner.  There is no such thing as perfect place but customers can be difficult and hourly turnover is high because many people do not realize how much it takes to be a barista.. things can be great or they can be real bad"
good,"The starbucks I worked at was a kiosk inside a grocery store, it was consistent and fulfilling work but we had a major complaint with one of the workers who didn't want to work. No matter what happened it was a if she wouldn't get fired and it dragged the team down as she wasn't participating. It was also very hard to replace a worker once they were gone because we only get so many hours and not just anyone could work in the kiosk."
good,What a great company to work for! Socially and environmentally friendly. Very diverse and inclusive. The worst part about working there is the parking :) The historic location is so fun. Lots of improvements being made to update the work areas. Lots of collab space. Happy people :)
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consisted of greeting customers, handling cash, cleaning consistently, and making beverages. I learned quite a bit about portions and had the ability to advance my drink making speed skills. Management was great for the most part, lack of communication between some of the shift supervisors however. Hardest part of the job was getting used to the hours but the early morning shifts gave myself a lot of free time during the afternoon/night which would also be my favorite part of the job."
good,"Fast paced, high turnover, sincere partners. I love Starbucks, but I’m looking to get my sleep schedule and fitness routine back after having no set schedule, including opening in the mornings as early as 04:30."
good,"My manager values his supervisors and baristas. I feel heard, included, and accepted. I feel completely comfortable going to him or district staff about issues I may be having or new ideas I may have. "
good,"I enjoyed the job overall but higher management made it very difficult at times to work there and gave little recognition for good work. Fast paced and busy environment which can be difficult,but the job is never boring. You can build relationships with friendly regulars which is nice."
good,"I learned how to deal and communicate with customers. I had lots of fun making drinks for customers and also helping individuals with drinks. the work environment was definitely a good experience, especially working in a fast paced environment that helped my skills."
good,"The company as a whole is a good company to work for. However, they have so many new products the preparation work for these items is over-loading employees with work. The key to a good store is largely the store manager. My first male store manager was the absolute best store manager. No, it wasn't because he was fun and cool and easy-going. He ran a tight ship, but he was just fair and knew what he was doing. My last female store manager was the worst. She was so rigid and micromanaging that she has caused so many to leave while bringing down the entire mood, attitude of the employees. It wasn't even pleasant on a minimal level anymore.  Retaining employees for her is like holding a bag of water with holes in it."
good,"Working in the customer service/food industry can be challenging at times- especially when it comes to customers who are not in the best mood. With a team that supports you and a manager that has your back, the daily operations and work-life becomes very easy and fun."
good,I've been employed by Starbucks for over 2 years and have loved it. I've been at 3 different locations and each manager has the same consistency. I learned the best customer service skills there as well as my ability to multitask and be efficient. There is a high turnover rate for highschool students and beginning college students but management is almost always on top of it. The hardest part is waking up so early and I wish they compensated employees who wake up early and stay late to accommodate the business.
good,"It is a good job that has very flexible hours.  Other employees are usually nice when helping you and to customers, but it really depends on the store and employees and manager. Sometimes they are good, and sometimes not."
good,"While the management is usually iffy, district managers always provide help if needed and make you feel very safe and heard. Other then that, great job"
good,Sirve para alguien que quiera estudiar y trabajar..
good,"I love working here. It has been one of the best experiences so far! I get hours, management is there when I or anyone needs them, and we are treated as equal. It can get extremely stressful during peak hours or busy days, but we all support each other. Good company"
good,"As is the case with most chains the environment is controlled by a series of standards. The degree to which they are enforced, however, has a great deal of variance between locations. This variance also applies to the quality of the work and social environment. The main recommendation I would make to anyone applying is to first see if it is a location that they would go to as a customer."
good,"I loved my job at Starbucks, only reason I left was because I moved. They have an excellent training program, good products, popular drinks, and friendly work environment."
good,It was an ok job for the moment while I was in school. They were very flexible with my hours and allowed me to do school work at work if I needed to and understanding.
good,"Pros:"
good,"The people I've met while working at Starbucks are kind, inclusive and supportive. No doubt the job has its stresses and difficulties, but the coworkers I have attained really make it worthwhile. There's a lot to do on a day to day basis, and it can become overwhelming at times. I think I've been lucky to work with who I do to help me learn and get through these tasks. I think management can be a little overbearing, but I think it's just something to learn to deal with overtime as everyone else seems to be mostly okay with it. Management is also friendly and supportive, so I don't feel as if I'm failing or falling behind. The people who you work with and who manage are definitely a defining factor in your own performance, so like I stated earlier, I feel as if I am lucky to have been given these select people to be in my work life. And I don't feel as if this type of job is for everyone. It really is something you have to feel comfortable in doing."
good,"Enjoyed working here. The only real downside is pay is terrible. Mostly lovely customers and fun coworkers. Work gets done, but we always had fun doing it! The employee discounts can't be beat and you even receive benefits on part time. I will say that I was hired during peak season and was told there wouldn't be much time, if any, to train me, but I made due."
good,Respectful and supportive coworkers and a great place to meet all sorts of people and learn their stories! My time at Starbucks was one were I learned to appreciate the experience and the people in addition to my daily projects.
good,"Es una empresa donde trabaja en equipo con todo el grupo, reflejando la atención tanto con el público como con el equipo que lo conforma."
good,"Starbucks was an overall  work environment for me. I really enjoyed learning how to be a barista and an exceptional partner. The work was easy to learn, easy to retain, and my coworkers were supportive and fun to be around, making my experience there a fun one. Customers there were generally nice and understanding when things went wrong. I felt valued and appreciated there greatly. I miss my Starbucks family a lot!"
good,"Barista at Starbucks, hard work but a pretty good seasonal job. Reasonable  discounts on absolutely anything at any starbucks. Its fun making drinks, if you're on register you interact with a lot of friendly and attractive people."
good,"Co-workers were great, management was not. Most of the customers were friendly. The job was fast paced but fun once you got the hang of it. Takes time and practice to be efficient."
good,"Fast paced, good teamwork/coworker relations. Good training, trained to deal with a variety of situations. Excellent coffee culture, always more to learn."
good,"Recently, the company has pushed to reduce the amount of labor each store is allowed to use. Meaning that the employees are losing their hours and they're always short-staffed. Employees are stressed and feel frustrated constantly. Other than that, it's a fun place to work when you aren't stressed with a million tasks on your mind while dealing with a line of customers and only three or four employees at a time (if you're lucky.)"
good,Really great benefits. Good job to have as a stepping stone. The most important thing that makes a Starbucks store great is the manager and the way they treat their partners.
good,"I've worked for Starbucks for nearly 10 years. Like any job, the management usually is hit or miss, but the actual job is rewarded fairly. The rumours are true: they really do give things to employees (stocks, awards, coffee, etc.), but it's really just to cut salary costs. If you're looking for a fairly compensated job, this isn't it. You may not be able to pay your rent, but you'll never run out of coffee."
good,"My manager was very accommodating. The overall experience was good, I needed health insurance and I love coffee so I applied for the job. The benefits Starbucks offers are excellent."
good,"The job depends on your store and how well staffed it is. Amazing benefits, need to grow thick skin for the rude customers. A fairly easy job and can climb up in the company."
good,"Starbucks is a company who has already based themselves on being a People-focused company in the coffee business.  There is a culture of respect and collaboration.  "
good,"Overall, I would say I enjoyed working at starbucks. Although it can be fast paced and stressful, there's a strong sense of teamwork that makes everything fun and possible. "
good,"Starbucks is very dynamic, you will have a chance to meet up with highly interesting people, a good place to start off as a student as a base to learn to connect with people"
good,They are very open minded. Its fun to work there and interract with costomers some tasks are tedious. Somtimes it gets overwhelming. Barristas love to gossip.
good,Çalışma ortamı olarak çok iyi olup ama yapılan işle alınan maaş maalesef yeterli değil.
good,"Good for young people, students, if you're smart enough they can make you a shift supervisor within 3-6 months, which means ~£1.50 more per hour."
good,"Management is good, and the schedule is very flexible. Great first job and the benefits are also really good. Shifts go by quick because it is usually always fairly busy."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work for. It was very physical work but the management and fellow employees were great."
good,"This job wouldn't be considered easy, at least by me. I can definitely remember moments of high stress happening often. There isn't much anyone can do to change that. Albeit, you aren't alone. You have your entire store with you and weathering these rough times with others creates strong bonds. I know the company as a whole is all about the customer, but for baristas; I feel it's all about your fellow partners."
good,"I really liked the job and regulars that came in.  The only problem was when I became a friend and it backfired.  I got used and then targeted hard and the managers let it happen.  I told them it was going to happen before it did, and they didn't listen to me at all."
good,"Fast-paced, energetic and lively workplace. Collaborative environment, friendly team. Punctuality is imperative. Management are supportive of their team ad passionate about the business."
good,Great partners and workplace culture! As a DACA recipient it's amazing I can obtain so many benefits from this company as I work and go to school studying Computer Science.
good,Ive work at a very busy location and i can tell you that it is alot of work. That isnt a bad thing as time will fly by very quickly well serving the tenants their daily cup. However their will be time where their isnt enough people working and we get slam with rarely anyone having the paitents to wait as their about to miss their very important meeting. Thats when you can be belittle without that much of a care from the tenants. Although the crew is what makes working here more tolerable as no one is trying to one up each other and we all understand how hard we must work.
good,Great culture which cares about employees;  However the company would go out of its way to care about public perception and literally let customers steal from them.  At some point watching this daily became frustrating and lead to the resentment of watching peoples sense of entitlement.
good,It was a wonderful experience to work over there. Nice cleaning job.  Loved cleaning in a wonder manner. Wish I would get a nice job for my future benefits.  Thx
good,If you have a good team to work with the job is really fun. You often rotate positions which makes the day go by faster because you aren't always doing the same thing all day. Dealing with customers can be difficult but for the most part it is a nice job.
good,"On your feet all day and long hours, though you can work shorter shifts. Flexible schedule, 30% discount, free drinks, and one free meal during shift."
good,"Al ser un trabajo de atención al cliente, los jefes están en constante estrés..lo cual lo refleja en la hora de trabajo, sin embargo es un lugar donde puedes conocer personas que se vuelven parte de tu vida"
good,"Starbucks is a very good company to work for, so many benefits and support. Gives you an opportunity to improve your communication and connection skills with others partners/customers. Definitely learned how to multi-task and time management"
good,"Pay isn't amazing but the comradery and benefits of working here is amazing. Customers can be a pain sometimes, but customers are like that everywhere. Like most places good management can make the job amazing but bad management can make the job a living nightmare. I've been at two stores, my most recent having good management. It makes a world of a difference."
good,"It’s a very stressful job, and I do not get many hours and the management is horrible at my location. The employees and customers are amazing. I think I need to find a new job that will fit correctly for me."
good,"Starbucks is a good job for high school and college students. Flexible hours, good pay, weekly tip out and, decent benefits. Each store is different so culture and management really varies on a store by store basis. I love the coworkers and my manager, I just want more hours but it is hard when hours get cut due to revenue."
good,"The team at the location I usually worked at (home location) was fun to work with and helpful to each other when needed.  Management was understanding of emergencies and did their best to schedule my hours as I wanted.  Our regulars were sweet and tolerant of new employees.  I enjoyed working with young people, learning the latest trends from them.  :)"
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun, but it was different and new from my experience of volunteering in my church's coffee shop. I learned how to make a lot more drinks, and how to operate the drive thru. I was able to work faster and more efficiently because of my experience with Starbucks."
good,Starbucks is one of those jobs I will never forget the atmosphere is always nice there culture to help the community is awesome. I got the job when i was barley 18 years old and it saved me it provided great benefits and good pay for the time being.
good,"The location I worked at was marvelous. I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing my regular customers when I worked. My coworkers were outstanding. When I assisted in other locations, the atmosphere of the cafe was different than my home cafe. It really depends on which location you work at."
good,"Great place to work. Low pay partially made up for by great benefits, especially the free coffee! I loved working for Starbucks. The only thing they need to fix is, paying someone more with years of related experience in other companies. It takes quite a while working within the company to build up to a livable wage. Even if you've worked years or decades somewhere else, they still start you off at a low pay rate."
good,"Its a great company with great benefits, you get treated like a partner/family. good hours not so much great pay. its fast paced so work your legs and feet."
good,"it was a fun place to work at, very fast paced especially in the morning when people are getting ready to go to work. Making drinks for people and just watching them enjoy what you just have made for them feels great."
good,"meeting new people daily and building "
good,"good place to work with great people, easy to learn the job and treated fairly at the work place. enjoyed going to work every day and the pay wasnt too bad, although it could be more."
good,Good first job for everyone. The training is good and the job is flexible which makes it great for students who want to work part-time. There is free coffee and food sometimes at the end of the shift. Customers can be nice and some are rude but that's fine its part of customer service. I learned a lot about how to make hot beverages and how to be a barista. Its a very fast-paced environment during busy hours which is the only challenging part. Good coworkers and it feels like family.
good,I started with Starbucks in High School and continued with them through Undergrad and Graduate degrees. They were flexible with the demands of my academic schedule and provided what I needed out of a job at the time.
good,"the training was very thorough and the team was awesome. I think this is a really good place to work if you are a high energy, fast paced, quick learner, and have overall good mobility and endurance. In my situation I think my manager had a hard time accommodating for my disability, which really wasn’t suitable for the work environment. But management did a poor job at communicating with me."
good,"Fun place, the rush never ends. Meet different people daily, learning how to prepare new drinks is interesting and beneficial. I enjoyed that part a lot."
good,Starbucks was my first actual team working job and I am grateful for the working experience. I was always reliable and have never been late to work and gave it my all in the workplace. Our customers were our number one priority and even in the field will continue to be.
good,Great people to work with and they have great benefits. It’s a great job to have if you don’t have many bills to pay the customers and management are great.
good,Great structure and culture focused.  Able to build relationships with customers to establish rapport.  There was internal growth in the company that i was able to take advantage of along with a great benefits package.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks could be a mix between extremely busy early morning, mid tempo during mid morning and then back to high intensity by noon. If you're working with seasoned baristas the day is a lot more bearable however with the constant pressure from our management at the time it made it difficult for the team to maintain morale. The hardest part of the job was having to work alongside baristas who lacked work ethic or decorum when it came to dealing with unruly customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to create a pleasant experience for both new customers and our regulars."
good,"Busy, fast-paced, high-speed days. Speed of service is very important and measured every half hour and each store has specific goals for drive-thru times. PT benefits were really nice for me as a student."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work if you can handle multiple tasks at once, and work well with your co-workers. Training and learning everything about the job is a long and hard process, but once you get the hang of it, you will have it for a while. The benefits are pretty great, but the pay usually isn't the best, depending on what state you are working in."
good,"As a previous management staff in Starbucks and working with the team for more than 8 years, i have find a lot of good experience in it and i have learned a lot of managerial skills level."
good,"It is a wonderful place to work, but ability to move up within the company is hindered by their promotion process. You receive great perks in the form of coffee and if you work enough hours they also have wonderful benefits."
good,Meilleurs place pour grandir. Cocus sur le développement
good,"Though the store is usually packed in the morning with a line of at least 15 people at all times, the managers make sure to make you feel welcomed and ready. Without such nice, kind, and patient managers it would be an impossible place to work with how hectic it is but the managers are blessed!"
good,"I worked at Starbucks for three almost four years. I started my senior year of high school and I’ll admit it was a great job. I loved my customers and my co-workers were so diverse and entertaining. The only cons were I stayed at being paid $9 until hitting co-managed position. I advise anyone who applies to be aware you will not move up quickly and that’s okay. I was energetic, reliable and some companies just like to keep management small. I"
good,"There are a lot of perks for working here. They give you Starbucks stock and give you the opportunity to buy extra at a discounted rate. Plus tuition reimbursement, paid vacation time, and médica benefits."
good,"Review summary sums its up. Colleagues were really chill and fun, management got questionable and it was always give and take. Work-life balance was difficult."
good,"friendly environment great company to work your way up. every day was busy at beaconsfield, days went quick. "
good,"In Spain, Grupo VIPS is the master franchised of Strbx. Their culture and policies were not only bad but opposite to those of Strbx, yet, I acknowledge that is a good place to work if you are young. It teaches you a great deal of things as well as discipline."
good,"I would come in at 4 am and open the store. we would have regulars and it was fun. The drive though window was my favorite part, and We were the fastest"
good,"Worked here for nearly a year as a batista. LOVED making coffee and had some amazing customers who genuinely made my day. Finished late a few times when it was busy, can be stressful especially over summer holidays and Christmas"
good,"If you are going to school or something this would be a good job, they can work with your schedule, really nice people they are very welcoming, and good experience!"
good,"My overall impression of Starbucks as a place to work is a positive one. Job duties are clear and well organized, emphasis it placed on having fun and creating a great place for customers, and there are lots of good benefits like free food and drink, stock options, and more."
good,"I worked for Teavana in the Deerbrook Mall in Humble, Texas. It was my first retail job and I learned I really enjoy sales. Eventually life took me to other opportunities, but I will always appreciate and remember positively my experience there."
good,"Mornings and can get extremely busy, and customers expect quality drinks in a timely manner, so pressure can run high, but the customers are usually pretty understanding during peak hours... but it can be exhausting.  Good thing is the emeployee's are very supportive of each other. The hardest part is initially learning all the drink recepes and exceptions to the rules, but once you have the basics down, the preparation of drinks becomes easier and the process and flow fall into place."
good,Ambiente di lavoro stimolante dove si può inparare molto. Per quanto mi riguarda ho trovato dei colleghi fantastici. L' unica pecca è che i turni ti vengono comunicati con pochissimo anticipo.
good,"A typical day at work is a very busy morning, during the day it starts to slow down and become more steady and easier to do more things in the workplace."
good,"A typical day at work is busy but productive. I learned that Starbucks drinks are expensive because of the process it takes to make coffee beans. My manager was great! He made sure to voice everyone's ideas. Whenever we had a difficult time with something, we could text him, and he was there to help. Starbucks, in general, is outgoing, but when it is busy, it can get hectic. The hardest part about the job is that when one order is messed up, it feels like it messes up the whole system. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is the bond coworkers can form."
good,"The Starbucks I previously worked at was a great time. Sure there was always something to clean, but the work was simple enough and my co-workers were fun to work with"
good,"There are four positions to work in as a barista, customer service, bar, drive thru, and front. On bar you are making drinks. On customer service you mainly clean and stock. On front you take orders for the customers that come inside the store and help where needed. On drive thru you take orders for the customers that go through the drive thru."
good,Working in Starbucks is a great experience and well worth the pay. You will get to try a lot of new things and meet new amazing people. Rarely ever a bad day at Starbucks.
good,"It can feel overwhelming in the beginning, especially with its fast pace and extensive drink menu. However, once you realize that there are really only 4 drinks with different combinations of ingredients, and most of your customers are going to be your regulars, you'll find the rhythm that works best for you. Great job if you need extra money, or if it's your first job."
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for, however this is a temporary job. It is damaging to stay at this company longer than 3 years, beware. Starbucks is one of those places where the workers are either there for college, or they don’t have any plans for the rest of their life. This job does something to you, the customer experience is really up and down. Many customers are nice but every now and then you get someone that will throw a drink at you or leave feces all over the walls in the bathroom. Be careful which location you choose, but Starbucks as a company is really great, the benefits are fantastic."
good,"Overall, Starbucks was an amazing short term job. Starbucks provided great benefits, great working atmosphere, and great shift flexibility. On top of that had a relaxed and fun management."
good,"I loved being a barista, I think there is an age gap though."
good,"Really enjoyed working there , was there more than 2 years  and loved the actual coffee and making drinks, my brother encouraged me to work there as he was a shift manager also. Very fast paced which made the time go by daily, enjoyed getting to know customers learned a lot skills to help me in my future jobs."
good,I found that an employees journey at Starbucks is largely dependent on their manager.  Most managers are great and give you excellent training and exceptional opportunities for advancement.
good,"Each employee has the opportunity to work every type of station each location has to offer. Gave great flexibility for availability, and management handled issues in a timely manner."
good,Working at Starbucks you found a family outside of your own with room for personal development as well as upward mobility. The most enjoyable part was meeting regulars and getting to know them.
good,Was a fun place to work.  Co workers were very helpful.  You got to drink all the beverages that you wanted.  The hardest part for me was making the drinks but it came with time and practice.
good,"Starting my day off at work whether it be opening, mid day or closing. i start off with a checklist to which i prioritize what needs to be done throughout the store. Checking each temperature in each fridge, doing the daily order or submitting the inventory count. Checking for expired food and tracking food waste. During my time with Starbucks i have developed from baristas within one year and supervisor for 6 years. The culture can be very hectic at times and efficient in most. Hardest part of the job is just maintaining a clean environment at times it can be to busy with not enough bodies on the floor to maintain whats going on outside. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing and learning knew ways to make the experience better. Helping other partners develop in their role as well. Learning more about coffee and creating that customer experience."
good,"Not the worst job in the world , the people there is what makes it better. When you have been there for too long that’s when it gets a little tiring        .."
good,"While not hired by Starbucks proper, the job gave us a great deal of trust and latitude in handling the kiosk and new trainees. Hours were convenient and management was supportive."
good,"I enjoy being a barista and working with coffee which is probably why I worked there for 4 years, but it is stressful with low pay. Tough work depending on the location you work at. Offers many benefits for part-time employees, as well as discounts and mark-outs."
good,"if your are looking for a consistent work schedule it will not work. it worked for me during the summer, but during school hours store management did not cooperate."
good,Provides detail-oriented team leadership focused on flawless and efficient customer service. Pushing people to reach their highest potential and new skills in growing a positive environment through teamwork.
good,"Positive work culture overall, with an emphasis on product quality and upbeat customer service. They highly value good employees who are able to provide quality beverages as well as a cheerful manner to customers."
good,Amazing benefits for employees but a lot of people burn out quickly due to the large volume of requests. Personally I enjoy my partners and most of the regulars but we get people who make it very clear they don't like us but they come in every day.
good,Very busy location always on the move and doing three things at once. The co-workers and management team are unbelievably amazing and really care about their team.
good,"Starbucks helped me through my first two years of college and I still frequent my old workplace when I need to take some work home with me. The company compensates you well and expects your best performance in return - a fair trade for a 20-something just starting out in the world. That being said, like most jobs of its caliber, it's not meant to last. Advancement is a little more political than in other companies in the industry and the range of jobs available are few and far between. Their hours also are not as flexible as they seem. Still, two free coffees and a free lunch on your work days is hard to beat if you're a poor college student."
good,Very demanding role but very rewarding if you are willing to put in the effort. Great salary and benefits. Would highly recommend as a great place to work.
good,I felt like I was very overworked and underpaid for everything that was required of me to do. We may get amazing benefits but the company itself doesn't respect their employees
good,"The hardest part of the job is managing a shift that is understaffed. As a leader, it is important to always be positive and perform to standard all my responsibilities. When there are not enough partners on the floor, there is a domino effect of issues."
good,"Only worked here for one summer in college, but I enjoyed the work. I learned how to make drinks quickly, but had a harder time picking up the cash register. We had an older system where you had to write on the cups, and it was hard to memorize everything and also enter it into the computer. Eventually got the hang of it. Very fast paced, but the day just goes by faster! HORRIBLE CUSTOMERS at my location, but loved my team and had a good time overall."
good,It is consistently busy. I've learn many things from making lattes to time and stress management. A majority of people I work with are cheerful and hardworking! The most enjoyable parts are being able to make specialized drinks and being able to (pretty much required) connect to your customer. Hardest part is maintaining cleanliness with consistent business.
good,"I honestly loved working for this company, the only real reason I didn't feel 100% comfortable there was because of the gossip and cliches that end up forming."
good,"Working at Starbucks for 3+ years has taught me so much about customer service and how just a small cup of coffee can change a customer's perspective of the day. I've learned how to be confident in connecting with customers and make better connections with my fellow employees. The thing I enjoyed most about working at Starbucks was the ""team"" aspect of the company where it felt like you were part of a team rather than just individuals just clocking in for another day of work. Though it does get stressful very quickly and the overwhelming amount of customers can be a bit daunting; I was taught from my pervious store manager that people are there just for coffee and to not stress over coffee. I quickly applied this and having a positive attitude sure contributed to a better experience for the customer and myself."
good,They worked with my schedule so that I could go to school and volunteer outside of work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks as my colleagues were amazing and so was my manager. She allowed me to work the hours I wanted, so I was able to have a great work/school life. I learned a lot of new things and gained many new skills and a lot of experience. It is a very fast paced environment, with a lot going on constantly, however I found this very enjoyable. The main issue I had was the pay, as I was 16 when I first started, it meant the pay I earned was very low."
good,"I built such amazing relationships with customers and employees over my three year course at Starbucks. The work environment can be stressful, due to large volumes of customers and inadequate staffing. If this job paid more, i would go back in a heartbeat. Would recommend to anyone that wants a fast-paced, fun, social job."
good,The only downside was the pay really. Every other aspect of the job is incomparable to many other part-time/full-time retail jobs out there. The company is very supportive of individual growth as well as Corporate Social Responsibility.
good,Just was somewhat difficult to get the hang of. Very fast paced work environment. Friendly staff and management. Company has excellent benefits and financial opportunities.
good,"The job itself is fun and the benefits are amazing, but they require a lot for a little pay. And the management and do basically nothing to help, not that they would if they could. Great for younger people, but not a longterm ideal."
good,people mostly nice but managers over-worked. Sales constantly pushed but under the  facade of the company caring about its employees. i dont know if any store managers arent racing to get out of the cafes and into upper management
good,"I really enjoyed working at MH Alshaya Starbucks, got to learn a ton of skills while managing large volume of sales and number of staffs.It has been quite a ride with the team, it was always full of energy and fun to work on floor."
good,"This is a very busy job, almost regardless of location (I worked at four separate locations throughout my career), especially for supervisors. There are a lot of various tasks that must be completed throughout the day, such as money handling, cleaning, partner development, etc., while delivering great customer service to guests."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks was making new friendships with the customers and customizing your own drinks. Also, learning how to make all the drinks can sometimes be overwhelming but interesting as well."
good,"Working at Starbucks definitely taught me how to work quickly and efficiently,  always keeping the customers happiness top priority. The people I worked with are fun and outgoing and were great teachers when "
good,"Honestly working at Starbucks was great. I was the supervisor and they hired a lot of teens and you’re gonna have to deal with the emotions and attitudes they bring. But it was still go. "
good,"Overall Starbucks was a great place to work. They really try to make sure their baristas are as knowledgeable as possible and encourage people to try their coffees and offer a weekly bag of beans. "
good,"A great working environment with great people, could be very busy and high paced at times but all over all worth. Work benefits such as 401k and health insurance."
good,Starbucks is an amazing company with strong values and who upholds their mission statement. I have worked for 6 Starbucks as a result of traveling through the United States. Unfortunately some of the stores I worked at were managed by individuals who did not believe in this mission statement. These money hungry individuals cared only for themselves and harmed whoever they needed to to look good in front of the regional managers. These very few stores fall through the cracks of the company and they are the reason why I eventually left. Overall it is an amazing company and if I had the chance to work at one of my favorite stores again I would in a minute.
good,"Great company to work with along with co-workers. Awesome perks and discounts, and health benefits. Learned quickly about safety rules and procedures, very abdomen on safety."
good,I liked working at Starbucks things just didn’t work out. I don’t mind doing hard work or putting in extra work. I like meeting people and assisting them in there daily things they may need help with
good,Fast work pace and flexible hours. I was working on a college campus so there was always customers and things to be done. I would work here again and would recommend it for others
good,"The overall atmosphere of working at a Starbucks store is friendly, they give you room to grow as well as opportunities to move up within the company. One huge positive is their transferring system - you can transfer to any store in any state if you need to move. Starbucks is also a good first job, as it gives great experience in high-volume, fast-paced environments."
good,Starbucks is known to be a place that is to welcome customers and also appreciate the employees but since it is a high paced placed and really more business than anything--it is pretty underwhelming to see the reality. Employees are not given the opportunity to grow and end up having to jump through hoops to get prompted. Communication is something that really lacks as a company for the Baristas and also professionalism.
good,"I worked with a nice group of people. Everybody was helpful and we all got the job done. Everyone was supportive and helped during training, and made me feel really welcome."
good,"Great environment, organisation needs to improve a bit, as we were most likely short stuff and required to work longer hours or more intensively. The rota was well spread, in order to have a decent work/life balance."
good,I enjoyed workin at Starbucks it was fast pace and I enjoyed most employees. Clean work environment and strict food safety practices. Easy transportation.
good,I enjoyed the time I worked at Starbucks and it was a great experience to meet others my age who were close to growing a connection with each other and with the customers.
good,"Time management is key at Starbucks! You are working very fast-paced and trying to complete multiple tasks at the same time! For someone like me, I loved it!"
good,"A typical day at work is comprised of making great connections with customers as the order is both received and crafted. I've gained the knowledge that will help me memorize things in my future."
good,"It is a pretty good company to work for, their benefits are actually very good compared to any other minimum work place. But it require a lot of talking and connecting with customers which can be mentally exhausting, and you have to be able to multitask and move fast."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my experience with Starbucks. It was fun and taught me how to properly deal with difficult customers and provide excellent service. However, there was no consistency in the scheduling that was provided and your availability was not accounted for."
good,Starbucks is a fast paced environment.  There is plenty of support and friendly people that work there.  You will always be busy and encounter some difficult customers but it was a great learning experience about the  company in general.
good,I learned a lot about customer connections and quality beverage craftsmanship. Management was not good. I was mainly put on register and was not assigned to other roles. I could not practice or get better at other roles because I only had one shift a week. I asked for more shifts and my request was denied. Management was not connecting with its baristas. I have never had an actual conversation with my manager.
good,"Has amazing benefits, not that great base pay though. But if you're in there for the other stuff I'm sure you'll look past it. Can be slow, can be fast paced. Definitely a cool work culture"
good,"Starbucks has good benefits and the atmosphere is nice. Management was only okay and could be lazy (where I was at least). At busy locations, it can be very tiring due to the fast-paced environment and rushing to get each customer's order taken care of. At times like that, it felt no different than just being a fast-food worker. It's a fine company to work for, but being a barista really isn't ideal as a long-term job or career in my opinion. I absolutely love coffee and was very good at my job, but doing it for 3 and a half years was plenty for me."
good,"A very fast-paced job that can be stressful for not quite enough pay. Discounts and benefits are awesome, though! Medical, dental, and free college through ASU are great plusses!"
good,I love my job its the best one I've had yet I just dont feel I get paid enough for how much work I put in. My coworkers around me are great I love all my customers I would just like to be paid a bit more with my pay I can bearly get by
good,"You can sing the chorus to your favorite 90s pop song while preparing a latte for a customer whom you will probably know by name and discover what their weekend plans are going to be.  The shift manager or manager will be singing along beside you as they fill the ice bin or brew a fresh batch of coffee.  "
good,The overall experience working at Starbucks was very good. Many opportunities with Great partnership amongst the employees and a very good work environment.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Starbucks. It was part time and they could accommodate my schedule with kids. Hourly pay is very poor and tips are not good, but the benefits are good and that is why most people work there."
good,"Working for Starbucks Company I learned how to drive myself to reach high goals. Learned how to coach, teach, train, and be organized. Starbucks taught me how to prioritize, to be a team leader , about sales , inventory , how to feel confident in what I do."
good,A really fast paced work environment but at the same time its relaxed and fun for most. As in the customer and the barista alike. The job isn't hard to learn either.
good,Loved the routines loved the vibe loved it all  really do love coffee and it's felt goof to be the one to make their day with a cup of joe. Good feeling brought on lot of good days. The management wasn't the best. She liked to overwork baristas and not preform manager duties like report food safety hazards wouldn't want to bothered with cleanliness issues or employee cleanliness issues.
good,"I learned to work in a fast paced environment and be a team player but it was stressful at times when we would have a rush. Also my boss was not very on top of it and that wore the whole team down in an unnecessary way. Overall, great high school job."
good,very easy and quite enjoyable. I just didn't get enough hours and the attitudes of some of my coworkers really ruined it for me. The job it's self was pleasant.
good,"the customers are less than satisfactory half the time"
good,I have learned how to manage and oversee multiple employees at the same time while reading their skill set and pushing them to be their best selves. Morning peak is the busiest and you always have to have a game plan as the shift supervisor.
good,Working at Starbucks is a Fun and Fast-Paced Environment. They are busy frequently and often get hit with long rushed. The baristas are laid back and easy to work with and the customers make the atmosphere.
good,Starbucks has made me mature a lot more and understand customers more standing on the other side. Since working there i have mastered how to communicate with customers who have become irate.
good,"Management is strong. Managers and employees care about the satisfaction of customers while maintaining a fun, friendly, and respectful environment. Hours are reasonable and respectable-  not working the entire day. Making drinks is fun, and the work load isn’t tough, but it is fast-paced. Only downside is the pay. For the amount of moving, lifting, and physical work the job demands, making $8/hr wasn’t nearly enough"
good,"working at Starbucks  has taught me a lot. even though i used to work at a different coffee shop beforehand, working at Starbucks has still helped me understand all the proper procedures and ensured that i perfect my techniques."
good,Working at Starbucks was a fun experience. I met tons of great people and was challenged in many ways while working there. I was able to learn a lot about being able to supervise a crew of 10 or more people while interacting with customers
good,"Most of the time it's fun, but can get stressfull. Great people and you meet someone new everyday. Hours are random, but benefits are really great. Advancing to a Shift lead is there, but beyond that it can be hard."
good,It is very challenging but it will harness your time management skills and customer service which are key to other jobs in the future. This will also help you learn teamwork
good,"Great place to start out. They offer so many things from college credits, benefits and obviously, FREE coffee. Lots of perks working for starbucks. Its always great to work for a company that helps their employees advance. If you keep postive and busy, they advance you quickly. The pay is decent too with tio sharing on top of hourly  wage. I recomend  working here. I loved it and would go back."
good,"It was a great start for me considering the fact that it was my first job. I learned a lot about the company and its product. This job helped me improve my skills such as with my customer service, working well under pressure, taking initiative and working well independently and also working well as a team."
good,"At the time of finding the job at Starbucks I was looking for a job I could really enjoy and learn new things. While I worked there I found a passion for coffee that I never really knew was there and from there I moved onto my current job as a Barista at Castle Perk Espresso. As much as I have loved working in coffee I feel it is time for me to move on and try something new where I will be able to move up over time and try different things I have yet been able to explore. Working at Starbucks and Castle Perk Espresso has helped me with many things I can take to my next job; customer interactions, my interpersonal skills, as well has problem solving and working as a productive team member. Being at a fast paced job it can be difficult to keep that happy demeanor you are suppose to have and I think that would be the hardest part of the job for me, but there is always a sense of accomplishment once you finish a rush and realize you can do it. With that being said I cannot wait to move on and find something else I am passionate about."
good,Starbucks is a fast pace and rewarding job for those that are willing to do the work. People can interpet the idea and philosophy of Starbucks but the reality is that they are there to make money and we are the people who do it. Coffee culture is heavily dependent on your store and the staff working. Many times the people you work with become closer than coworkers but again that relies heavily if you're want to add to the atmosphere
good,"Time management is crucial to success, as well as always being prepared for a rush. Easy and helpful to build a rapport with regular customers. You need to know the products to give a good background and information when customers come to you with questions. Expect crazy things."
good,Starbucks is a very fast-paced job but that helps with making the day past by faster. Most workers are college students so the work environment is pretty lively. I would say this is a pretty decent first job.
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers, and meeting new customers. The work was usually a good, steady pace that wasn't too stressful. Depending on which shift I worked, I would stock the cabinets and shelves, and take customers orders. It got harder during the holiday seasons."
good,"I honestly love my job because the benefits are great and in-store management (at least mine) really cares and does the best that they can with what they are given. The worst is upper management from corporate. They constantly cut hours and expect us to do more with less time and people. It's unrealistic and causing a ton of stress and turn-over. Over the time I have been here, it has gone from a ""we love our partners and customers"" vibe to a ""we only care about customers and numbers"" vibe. Other than that I have made lasting friendships with my team and with customers which I would not give up for anything. The culture is great in Starbucks. "
good,"Starbucks is a good company. You meet new people. You learn to make all the drinks you once was going in buying which is actually fun once you get the hang of it. My work experience was good beside my shift that I had an issue with, in which I took care of in the proper manner."
good,"It's a good fun work atmosphere the majority of the time. There is usually a good work life balance due to the hours of operation. I work opening shifts normally but have worked all parts of the day there. Labor is usually stretched around bare minimum so if we get unexpected rushes it can be busy, hectic, and stressful. I am also a trainer so I get to enjoy training new partners and engaging with the team about new standards and updates. When customers are nice it's a very good day but sometimes people are just having a bad day and they take it out on us. You can go wrong with management but I've worked at around 20 stores and I would say the majority of shift leads and store managers are fantastic so it outweighs the bad seeds. There's a lot to learn on this job and there is always something to do to keep busy. If that's not your thing then you won't like working here. The free coffee is a great perk and the College Program too. The pay could be much better. Most days it feels like I'm stuck doing the work of two to three people and have to constantly move at lightening speed. I leave work exhausted pretty much every day. But I still make less than a livable wage and have had to have a second job or someone else to share bill responsibility with. It's a great job to milk for the benefits, a lot of people do that. To get benefits you only have to work and average of 20 hours so it's a great second job especially with the scheduling flexibility. The pay is also different based on area. In Arizona it was state minimum at $11.50 when I moved, and in Texas it is $10 where I am."
good,"In my opinion, working at Starbucks has allowed me to save money up and meet some nice people but at the end of the day you do work with food and there are some annoying customers out there and unless you like people you won’t enjoy staying there."
good,Working at Starbucks I made great relations with coworkers and relations with clients. Very busy on a day to day basis. Management was fair and understanding. Learned very valuable skills here.
good,It was fun working at the starbucks. Customers and co-workers are very friendly. I had chance to be a part of the Starbucks family.  Learning about the companies way and process of working and all. A very good experience that I got learn new and more business related stuffs.
good,"You will stay at the same wage no matter how long you work here unless you become a shift lead and the increase isn't much more, but ten times the work load. There is no room for advancing within the company."
good,"The company has its moments with high demand and rude customers like any other retail job, but overall takes care of its employees. In most locations the coworkers are nice and they're what get you through the day. Th company offers benefits such as, health insurance, dental insurance, subsidized online college through ASU, and matching 401k."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks excellent benefits company fair good environment they are very good with accommodations you meet 80% friendly people great place to network
good,"As a barista, you're job depends on getting drinks out and treating the customers with all respect. This means you are dependent on a good manager and good coworkers to perform and stay happy on the job."
good,The people that I worked were very friendly and made me feel comfortable without it being forced. They made sure to help me out with any questions i had. The workplace is heavily dependent on teamwork.
good,Starbucks is a company that really cares about its employees. The shifts varied and they were very lenient on everyones availability. They teach you everything that you need to know about working with their products. The management is very friendly and only wants us to succeed. Loved working there for the past 3 years.
good,This was a very busy café with a drive-thru. This was a very demanding job at times and required you to think quickly and act quickly so as to ensure customers had a positive experience.
good,Mangment was wonderful at first till there was a switch. Fun day at work with co workers . Balanced of slow and fast days. Low pay but felixble schedule depending on your co-workers.
good,Working in the Liverpool guild starbucks was very decent with little cons and mostly pros to working in that environment. the hours were good and the shifts busy to keep you well engaged.
good,"fun workplace, very productive and scheduled, as well as very informative and easy to follow steps for each drink needed to make. Coworkers were very fun to work with, and hardly ever had an issue with anyone."
good,It's a fast paced environment. You get to meet a lot of different people. Conversation with customers are always interesting. The schedule can be flexible if needed.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working there very much. However, I was not happy with the early work hours, and limited weekly hours assigned, I wanted to work more hours. My boss and coworkers were very fun to work with and I was happy assisting the customers and helping them make their day."
good,"The workers are really helpful and everyone contributes to help each other. In busy days we would still laugh and joke around which keeps the workplace really fun to work at, and be at as well."
good,"Really great environment, just hard to grow in the company. Also just looking for a higher paying job. People are awesome, mainly want to move companies for relocation."
good,"Not a bad place to start out and earn some money. The hours are not bad either. Customers, especially at the mall, can be a little difficult at times but overall a great experience."
good,"We do what is expected of us and we never complain what the boss orders us to do. This job requires a lot of customer service. Basically if you go into this with insecurity, you'll leave with insecurity and if you go into this with confidence, you'll leave with confidence. This job is either naturally easy for some or straight up difficult. Starbucks requires consistency by cleaning the equipment regularly, stocking the shelves at night and in the morning to help out team members and being able to multitask whenever a customer suddenly comes up to the register."
good,"s a Supervisor, I am responsible in ensuring that all my co-employees/baristas are doing their job by ensuring all customers are having a good experience. I am also coaching them on how to make perfect beverages by applying all the standard procedures. I also make sure that they have a positive attitude towards their work and I always provide help whenever they needed. Being a supervisor is not just supervising your staffs but also coaching and leading them in the right path/way by standards. It is not just a title it is a responsibility and an attitude."
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced because I work at a drive thru/cafe store. I never stay in the same role for my whole shift which I like because it's nice to switch up roles. I've learned how to complete tasks in a quick and efficient way with ease, as well as maintain communication with customers, other partners and managers alike. The hardest part of the job is when you have to correct a problem made by a customer as if you were in the wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with partners who genuinely care about you and have your back; who you're also able to learn from and are create a channel of open communication."
good,Good place to work but long hours. Very busy location.
good,"I worked there for 10 years it's a great company "
good,Great company as a whole. Wish there were more opportunities for advancement and development. Either way it is worth putting in the time to further your education with their tuition reimbursement program.
good,"Its pretty busy on most days, and you really get to know the customers on a day to day basis. As long as you stay ahead of the rush(which can last anywhere from 1 to 4 hours), its not a bad job."
good,Working for Starbucks was a great experience. I had really nice coworkers and managers. There were times where it got really busy but overall the team effort made it a much better job.
good,"There is a lot of good team work and communication involved in my location. "
good,"A typical day of work at Starbucks is always a unique and memorable experience. Whether that experience is a positive one or an absolute nightmare depends entirely on your location and management. When under proper management handling a peak-rush is a breeze, supervisors and baristas are well trained and well staffed. The store remains in good repair, and daily tasks are completed in a timely and effective manner. There's opening, mids, and closing, each one having respective duties expected of them that vary from store to store. A typical day for an opener is waking up at 3 am to get ready for work, and on the flip side that's probably about the time that the closer who prepared the store for them is falling asleep. A typical day is dramatically different from partner to partner - but consists of the same basic tasks: prep, create, and clean. The creation can either be a tasty cup of coffee or a beautiful connection with a customer."
good,I really enjoyed working at Starbucks.  It was a fun job to have for the summer and I enjoyed meeting the customers and employees.  I also enjoyed learning to make drinks.
good,Playing in a band it's been tough to keep work with being on tour so often. Starbucks did a good job of being there for me when I got home. The benefits for part time employees are great.
good,Works with school schedule. Great work environment. Starbucks was able to work around my busy schedule and was still able to get great hours. Overall a fun place to work.
good,I benefited a lot from working here. I became a barista and barista trainer in a matter of time. I overall love working here. I’ve learned a lot being in a military base. I’ve met a lot of new people and love all of my regular customers.
good,Starbucks requires an immense amount of customer interaction daily. Learning how to handle tough or difficult customer service interaction have taught me to be a strong leader and allowed me to gain great customer service skills that I can use in any job situation. This was one of the hardest parts of the job but it was also the most enjoyable because it helped me to become a better employee and overall person.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun, really quick, and you’ll meet a lot of interesting people. You’ll also learn new things you’ll love suck as the different type of drinks."
good,"The job itself is great, though customers can sometimes be... well what you'd expect them to be anywhere. A typical day at work for a barista just means showing up and typically working one position (sometimes switching to cover breaks), interacting with customers, and a specific list of cleaning tasks that changes depending on your position. Management is key here though, and if a store doesn't have strong leadership there then expect to have issues. Sometimes that means not getting your schedule until the week of, not having enough product to sell due to inaccurate ordering, or having a more difficult time cleaning due to previous cleaning not being completed. Overall my most difficult experience at my store was my manager and shift managers, with both personal and work related issues that made it hard to work with them. However, without management issues the job is really fun. Once you get good at making drinks/food/running a register you can have a lot of fun, and I'd say 94% of the customers are extremely pleasant. Your coworkers will also make your experience more fun, as talking with them helps the time pass."
good,"For the short time i worked at starbucks, the energy that filled the store was great, the guests that came to get their drinks were cool. Of course you would get one or two people that were... But other than that, a great place to work."
good,Starbucks beverage crafting and other roles are fairly simple to learn and adjust to. The most challenging area of the job is learning how to handle a large and consistent workload from a high volume of traffic (customers). The environment is definitely nonstop as there is always a task to be performed at all times.
good,"It is a fun place to work but you may need really thick skin. its not so much for Starbucks but working with the customers. You have people to help you all the time, although you might want to make sure you learn everything and ask questions because theyll throw you into the shark pool quickly."
good,"The starbucks I worked at had a drive thru, as well as a large and constantly busy cafe. The people I worked with were beyond amazing, and are truly what made my time there so enjoyable and worth it. This job will burn you out very quickly if you don't make it a priority to have a good balance between work and personal life/self care. As long as you take care of yourself and remember that the job gets easier as you continue working at it, you'll be fine."
good,Requires a lot of work! but is a great place to better your skills! If you need to work on bettering yourself socially this job will do it! Also helps you train your memory with all the different beverages!
good,"I felt like i grew a lot with this company. I learned what customer service is and what it takes in order to really fulfill that job title. I personally, liked starbucks i left because of the management that we gained at our store."
good,Fun and fast-paced job. Encourages personal interactions with customers. Great fun getting to know the make up of the community. Great sense of team work to complete daily tasks.
good,"Really enjoy how they trained me. Very flexible schedule, perfect il you want another job, or study at the same time. "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would involve preparing for breakfast, lunch, and dinner rushes. Make sure everything is stocked ranging from; cups, lids, straws, syrups, coffee beans, teas, paper towels, bathroom accessories, etc."
good,"It was usually busy. It was fun. being on bar is alot of fun but at the same time it can be stressful during rushes if you are not prepared or can't handle stress well. The store itself can be very needy. I find that because of that, alot of your time and effort is demanded which I find to be unfair. Because for most of us, this isn't a career job, and most of the time you are a student working there to make ends meet. So I found that it demanded too much. QASA is stressful, they need to chill. But to be honest in comparison to other customer service or food industry jobs that demand just as much, Starbucks is far better because they value their employees and there are great benefits such as free coffee beans, free drinks while working, good discounts and health benefits depending on how much you work."
good,Starbucks is a good job with advancement opportunities and the benefits are great. It can be a little stressful but if you are willing to work with your manager they can help accommodate with your schedule.
good,"Starbucks is great company with many opportunities "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. You meet alot of people, great people for the most part. But the pay isnt worth it. But you do receive great benefits, 401K, free college program."
good,"Being a Starbucks employee has its ups and downs. If you are people's person, you'll enjoy it for the most part. It is a great job for college students, or if you like the culture and coffee has a potential for a good career."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you can be actively working on something and handle the pressure when it comes to complicating customers or just really big orders that put you behind. Everything is normally planned out when you get on your shift and management is great! Dont get me started on the amazing benefits man, you literally get free online college, free lunch, 30% discount on everything in the store, 401k plan, stocks, and healthcare!"
good,"Starbucks is a very fast-paced and sometimes stressful environment, but making connections with customers and coworkers alike reiterates the idea that there is a story with every cup."
good,During peak and in the morning the workload is distributed evenly but once you get towards mid-day/ closing you will have to learn how to multi task. Once you get the hang of it its not too bad.
good,"I learned customer service "
good,Great company if you have the right leader.  Has become more corporate focused leading away from the missions and values of the core company.  Work life balance does not exist as much as it is emphasized
good,"This was great college level job. It allowed me experience to grow into a more patient customer service representative. The management I worked under were amazing and, although full of young child drama, the team was great too!"
good,Fast paced. Great if you want to stay moving. Customer service is essential. Great benefits and a great way to meet amazing people! You'll definitely grow.
good,I worked there for a few years during the summer while I was going to college. I learned how to multi-task and how to have great customer service which has helped me so much in the future.
good,"I enjoyed the job co workers could be. Nicer "
good,"Working at Starbucks exposes you to many different people, these people include simple people when it comes to how they like their coffee while others are more complex. The environment can some days be extremely busy while others are slower. If an employee calls out and we don’t have anyone to cover that employees shift it can become a stressful day of work."
good,"Loved my team, loved my manager. This was an incredible place for me to grow! This place helped me find out who I was and what I wanted. This is a company that is really invested in the community!"
good,It's definitely easy to maintain a work/life balance. And the people you work with can be a lot of fun. But the pay isn't great and they are slow to move people forward within the company. Benefits are pretty good for a retail job though.
good,"The store i worked at was in the Turnpike an it was 24 hrs, i worked the 3rd shift. It was pretty easy, just have to pay attention. The stock, clean up an prep was all normal things done at a job place so that was easy as well. The most difficult task was trying to make the drinks as perfect as possible. Picture perfect drinks."
good,Starbucks is very competitive but the environment is soothing and relaxing to its customers and employees. A day on the duty may be stressful and fast paced. Need to have great memorization skills and control of your emotions.
good,"A typical day as a Starbucks shift manager would include opening the store or closing the store. During an opening shift you are responsible for counting the tills as well as put away and place the inventory order. In addition, you are responsible for designating breaks for baristas."
good,"If you are the type of person who is happy to be alive every day and  can take that attitude into work with you then this is the job for you. Starbucks is a culture of uplifting attitudes, comfort and understanding. This is a very social job so be prepared to care about every customer that walks through the door. Your job is to make everyones life easier. That means stocking everything for your team members before leaving a shift. That also means the customer is always right. Be willing to admit your mistakes because everyone makes mistakes at work. Own your flaws and vow to improve always. "
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, however it all depends on outside forces if that job is fun or not, the district managers have the ability to change something at a moments notice or lack the ability to communicate effectively it seems which can put the baristas on the spot especially with social media now days, when it comes to the availability, prices, or information regarding a product."
good,it was good had good pay and i enjoyed working the my fellow baristas.  the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers.  I learned time management.
good,"Otima empresa para aprender, crescimento graduativo e inspirador. Pessoas incríveis em todos lugares, faz jus a missão de nutrir o espírito humano. Precisar prestar mais atenção nos partners em todos os sentidos, muito trabalho para pouca gente."
good,"The pay was sub par but Starbucks proves that they care about their employees with ample benefits such as a 401k, stock plans, amazing health insurance and free tuition for online schooling."
good,"At face value it appears that becoming a barista at Starbucks is an easy job, that we just make coffee and go home. But, in reality, that couldn't be further from the truth. Yes, we make coffee and that is fun, but its also a lot of sweat and hard work."
good,The job is a lot of work for not a ton of pay. I really liked their mission and being able to interact with customers but didn't feel like was worth the money.
good,Some people take it too seriously and personally. at the end of the day its just coffee leave the drama customers bring at the door and it can be a super fun work environment
good,"As long as you work in a good store, the place can be great. It really is a nice company that treats employees well. They quickly move good people into higher positions."
good,Starbucks is a great for a first job. The benefits of Starbucks are extensive. The job generates a healthy sense of camaraderie between workers. The one negative about Starbucks is that sometimes the job can be extremely stressful.
good,a nice place to work . we are like family at starbucks and we get free drinks. the owner is very nice.  customers are friendly. employees stay as it is not very stressful
good,It's a great place to work if you're a student or looking for a few hours a week. They are flexible on hours and offer many benefits and perks. It gets quite demanding and rigorous and there tends to be a lot of pressure on the supervisors.
good,Fast-paced job that embraces the act of multi-tasking.  Fun job to have but very stressful during peak hours.  The hardest part of the job was waking up super early to commence my shift (5am shift).
good,"I worked at three different Starbucks stores. The first one had a communicative manager who hired responsible employees, and we were always properly staffed, so a customer rush wasn't a big deal. The second two were completely mismanaged. An employee was always 'sick' or didn't show up. We were expected to keep the store clean, create a customer connection, and make their drinks quickly and accurately. It wasn't doable with only 2 employees on the floor. Great benefits, though."
good,"While the job isn't exactly the most difficult job in the world, there are times when it's fairly demanding. Rushes are common and you often don't stop moving for hours and by the end your feet and neck hurt. But the culture of Starbucks is what has made me stay since I was first hired. My co-workers are great people and make the job feel like less of a job. My manager and other supervisors are great as well and there isn't a day where you aren't happy to be working with one of them. The main downfall would be that sometimes you aren't given enough hours to make ends meet, especially if you're living in a city like New York, so having a second job might be something you need to do. Overall, I'm very happy with my experience at Starbucks"
good,As a barista the job is fine. Regulars are great and the work is repetitive but fun. Getting into management via shift work is not so fun. Management can be a headache and the pay(although better than minimum wage) isn't great. The company doesn't take your experience into consideration and even with years of working for them you still won't make much. The breaks are also extremely short for a job that has you on your feet for the entire shift. The benefits are the best part of the job followed by the free drinks and single food item during your shift.
good,This position was an excellent option for short-term employment and being a student. I would not recommend working here for more than two years unless you pursue supervisory or management positions.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you need benefits. I was able to work my way from barista to Coffee Master to Shift Supervisor. The best part of the job are the customers. The Worst part is keeping up with demand.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. One definitely, needs to be able to follow directions and memorize recipes. One should also be able to learn how others work for a smooth work day."
good,"During these three years they have paid for my college tuition at ASU. I earned my degree, started a 401k, and had benefit all while working part time. Growth: become a trainer, shift supervisor, assistant store manager, and even further if you wish."
good,"In my opinion, this job was great but the management at the location was poor. Had management been more attentive i would have not left. Other than that the co-workers were nice and the experience i gained well be useful in the future"
good,"muy buen ambiente laboral, generas muchos lazos y el crecimiento depende de tu desempeño."
good,"working at starbucks is overall an amazing experience, however, like most jobs, the power favours management. on another note its a company that goes above the minimum requirements for their employees."
good,"Overall I think Starbucks is a great company that places importance on customers, sustainability, and great products. Also it's great they give the opportunity for people to work their way up and to also get their schooling paid for through specific programs. I however was working here after graduation and just needed a temporary job before going abroad for a year so I didn't use that benefit. I think, like anywhere else, the job satisfaction comes down to the management... It's a great opportunity for people who maybe didn't necessarily get a college degree, but they can work their way up to managing positions but sometimes people who don't exactly have great leadership skills work their way up and can create a pretty stressful and unwelcoming workplace environment. The best part is working with customers and a team that works together as a collective, the worst is when your managers aren't the greatest at constructive criticism or communicating in a professional or helpful manner and makes other people feel uncomfortable when watching them disagree with other ""partners"". Also I felt like I had pretty unfair scheduling, before I started I was told that weekend shifts were rotated and I had maybe 2 saturdays off in a 8 month period... But then again that might come down to management again doing the schedules."
good,"My typical day at work can be from making drinks and talking to customers that come in, to sanitizing all the things we use each day such as tongs, pitchers, etc. From what I learned from day one is to be more confident in myself working for Starbucks; to not be afraid to speak up for myself, others I work with or even customers. I also enjoy our regular customers that come in and we have great conversations! I feel that the hardest part of the job is when you know being positive is #1, but it can be hard when you are going through your own stresses either at work or outside of work. But, I do find with my awesome coworkers I feel happier. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make friends and connections with my coworkers and our customers!"
good,"I have worked here for 2 years and was promoted to supervisor within 1 year of being there so there are definitely opportunities for advancement. They also train you to be a store manager if you wish. They fully pay for your college,  not to mention the 500$ of stock you get every year and all of the other benefits like free spotify and discounts at almost every company just for working at Starbucks. "
good,"Starbucks was a pretty easy place to work, but the management needs work. There was little room for advancement in the company, aside from Shift Supervisor. After being promised for over a year that I would be able to take Coffee Master classes and train to be an ASM, it never happened, so I found a different job."
good,If your looking to advance then really try to do it quickly and talk to your manager about being promoted. Liked working here but I feel like I've reached my peak.
good,"While working at Starbucks, I was able to further my relational skills. It was very flexible with me going to school and having a social life. An amazing environment to work in."
good,"Great people, great experience, very creative place to work, management works with you. Dealing with hard customers can cause an issue but if you have great customer experience you’ll be fine"
good,Un buen lugar par comenzar a desarrollar tus habilidades laborales.
good,"Not a bad place to work, customer service wise. The staff was nice, and the company provided solid benefits for people working part time. Management varied between locations, though, so some managers were more fair than others."
good,"I genuinly loved working at Starbucks at the first store I worked out. It was fantastic, had amazing co-workers, a boss that was understanding of life situations. Amazing training program and help you get comfortable with everything and are all open for any questions."
good,"Worked here while I was a graduate student at the University of Washington, and it was a fun place to work. The co-workers I had were long-time partners and taught me the ropes really well and my manager was fair and stern at the same time. I definitely recommend working for Starbucks at some point in your life for a fun part-time job."
good,"The Starbucks I work has a fun environment with pretty cool and understanding managers. My Starbucks isn’t corporate; it’s a campus Starbucks but they hire non-students. The pay is nice, but I don’t think it’s enough to live off, and becoming a manager only gets you an extra dollar or 2. The only bad thing I could say is the managers should do a better job of training. You can’t complain if you never properly taught someone how to complete a task. But some managers really do try their best."
good,"Working at Starbucks was the best part-time job I've held. I worked at a great location, everyone I worked with was very friendly, the job perks are excellent -- and there's always room for advancement. After less than a year, I was promoted to a barista trainer, and there were talks of being promoted to a supervisor. The only reason I left was because I was moving. The only issues are the hours can be unreliable. They aren't overly steady and you have to have a flexible schedule -- there's plenty of opportunity to pick up/switch shifts though to help you hours."
good,Starbucks is a fast paced environment that requires fast speed of service and great customer service skills. Employees are held accountable to remembering all beverages and complying with Starbucks standards and cash handling processes.
good,"great work life balance.  liked working with customers and assisting with their needs. enjoyed making coffees and learning new recipe."
good,"Starbucks has allowed me to work better under pressure since a lot of customers come through each day. It has evolved my teamwork skills since it is needed in order to make the store run smoothly. My experience there also taught me how to talk with customers and deal with any issues that may have happened. "
good,"Es un buen trabajo, ofrecen buen sueldo y dan oportunidad de estudiar. Flexibilidad con los horarios y constantes capacitaciones para crecimiento laboral."
good,most enjoyable part of the job was making peoples day and seeing the smile on their face when they come in to the store and receive the perfect cup of coffee
good,"I’ve been at Starbucks for a little over 2 years now. I worked at a license store before hand so I knew my way around a bar, but the managing style of my superiors was different to say the least. With that being said it seems like I had more freedom as a regular barista, they embraced my individuality when I was on the lowest tier, but as I got promoted things started to change. I’m not one to shirk responsibility, it’s expected when given a promotion, but if you’ve been finding innovative ways to do things already why can you not continue to do what got you promoted in the first place. This is the only problem I’ve encountered while working here if you move up you have less room to be yourself they tell you to innovate around the core but they really mean conform."
good,"A typical day at my location encompasses laughs, a healthy amount of stress as well as satisfaction. I have learned that the customer comes first, that sacrifice is needed in order to succeed. Although we have recently come under new, unsophisticated management, the partner dealings have been rather civil and well handled. The hardest part of the job must be dealing with an unsatisfied customer, as I do my best each and every shift to uphold Starbucks' level of quality in each means of service. The most enjoyable part is the connections made to customers and seeing them enlighten as soon as they come into the store."
good,The time I spent at Teavana and Starbucks was great. Starbucks really cares about their partners and trying to make it better for them and clients. They listening to your feedbacks. I got lucky and got not a team but a second family. where everyone is watching each others back. Easy working and having fun.
good,"Fun workplace, only problems were management didn't make an effort to accomodate my schedule for schooling. You also would get some bad customers occasionally, but everywhere does. Coworkers were always fun to work with, it was a very good environment and everyone generally liked eachother."
good,Learning to work efficiently in fast paced environment while maintaining positive attitude and customer support.  Overall great experience with my coworkers and the customer base at Sobeys Head Office
good,"As much as I loved working at Starbucks, my management team loved to play favorites and weren’t too subtle about it. They openly discussed who they “liked” and who they didn’t. Horrible but lessons learned daily."
good,"The environment is very fast paced, which allows employees to find a flow in their work.  Co-workers are very fun to work with, and provide help when needed."
good,"Working at a Starbucks coffeeshop can vary drastically depending on the location and management. The store at which I am currently employed is one located in a shopping center that specifically caters to affluent individuals and is situated just north of a large university, so it's not unusual for there to be a high volume of customers in the store at any given time. It is because of this that working there can be somewhat to very stressful and exigent of the staff to be as efficient and quick on their feet as possible. Nevertheless, I am fortunate to work under competent and conscientious managers that strive to make the jobs of those whom they manage to be as enjoyable and stress-free as possible. "
good,I'm very shy so that was something i struggled with a lot but when your co workers are nice and understanding it get easier. I was in HS when i worked(graduated now) so only worked for about 4 hours and maybe got about 18 hrs per week. some days i was only scheduled to work for 2 days out of entire week. Management was cool. It did get stressful at times and did have encounter a lot of rude customers but at the end of the day you get free coffee so i can't complain too much. I had to leave because my anxiety got the best of me but i would consider going back if the pay was just higher
good,"I barista'd my way through nursing school. I needed somewhere that offered health insurance to part time employees and Starbucks is basically the only place that does that. It is fast-paced and there is a lot to remember, but it gets easier. Can be frustrating sometimes because policy can change at the drop of a hat. One day they teach you a new way of doing something, then a week later change it. Teamwork and management is highly dependent on which location you work at. Mine was full of girls at each other's throats constantly. Manager was very nice but plays favorites and is a conflict avoider, does not discipline when necessary. I was there the bare minimum I needed to be to get through school and took off. Do not make this a career; pursue an actual career while here. Don't end up like some of the employees working there for 15 years!"
good,"Be ready to do the work of 3. Great healthcare options, which is great since you are overworked. Great job if you are in school due to the flexible schedule. Average pay is no more than min wage"
good,"Starbucks is a friendly environment that allows you to connect to customers on a daily basis.  You get what you put in, and I definitely learned a lot, because I put in a lot."
good,"A typical day on the job is mostly about product placement. We love to come up with creative ways to place what we sell in store, like (e.g. coffee cups, the barista choice of coffee grounds and etc...)"
good,"If you enjoy customer service, this company can be fun to work for because they value partners being authentic and building community within their stores. Management makes a huge impact and not all of them are as community focused in their leadership. The work is physically demanding and fast paced but the routines make it manageable."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, face paced, loving and open minded work place. It's a great place to get your foot into the corporate world while maintaining a laid back environment. Earning all benefits as a part time employee (minimum of 20 hours per week) can be a crucial and life saving aspect of the job, and it was for me. They also provide free online bachelors Programs through ASU as to help all partners work toward a better future and a better life."
good,"Starbucks is a fine place to work for. However, there is a lot of flux between stores. A good manager is hard to come by. I got lucky in my situation but most stores that I have covered at have managers that are either a little too relaxed or don't really care. Sometimes the work environment can feel clique-y. That's also something you need to be mindful of. The benefits are sweet if you're able to take advantage of them. I wasn't able to in the time I've been with the company because the health care folks had some issues with my address internally. Starbucks offers stock to their employees and that is absolutely wonderful in my opinion, you just have to be an employee for a year. "
good,Good place to work for an entry level job.  They need provide health insurance for my family working 20 hours per week. Good work peers and good management overall.
good,I enjoyed working here and loved my coworkers. It was fast paced and fun. I needed more hours and higher pay to support my needs and interests so I found a different job.
good,fast paced and comfortable work envirement with good management.Great team members and the training went well because I never felt rushed into anything.The  store was organized and well kept.Customers who visit often where very kind and I enjoyed making there mornings a little more happier.
good,"I only worked at starbucks for a little while but the time I did spend there was fun. It was fast paced so your days went by fast, management was nice, and you end up getting close to the people you work with."
good,"Working for Starbucks is definitely not something I would keep as a career. However, the Starbucks environment allows for growth within the workplace related to the job itself and to outside situations. The relationships, connections, and experiences I've had since working for Starbucks will help me both in my professional as well as my personal life in the future."
good,"It’s been  A fun time with Starbucks. I’ve gotten to know of a lot of really cool people and regulars! It’s just time for me to move on to somewhere I can stay longer,  and possibly advance at."
good,Working for starbucks is great for someone who is getting their first job. I would recommend someone who is in school to work here because of the benefits that they have to offer.
good,"The company I worked for no longer exists. I enjoyed my time while I was there, but decided to leave. They have evolved into something else and it was not my cup of tea. They still have a strong sense of social responsibility."
good,"Overall, the days went by extremely fast. You barely get a moment to stop and eat a lunch. The staff is typically a close knit family with little to no drama. I learned a lot of cool tricks and recipes, as well as how to multi task in a stressful environment"
good,"I've worked for this company at multiple locations going on over five years now. The company itself is great and the partners are wonderful, however the clientele will make the workplace miserable."
good,"I worked at two separate stores and volunteered at countless others, the hours and job itself was great, however some of the extremely busy stores are very high stress and tend to have a high turnover, meaning you end up coaching a lot of the newcomers, which can be frustrating at times if you are slammed. I highly enjoyed the slower stores, but felt that there were some stores weren't paying me enough for how fast-paced they were and how much was expected of me, as well as the extremely high anxiety level they gave me. In the end, I felt that I was better suited at a different job."
good,"I had a lot of fun working there, it’s a good environment. I loved my other co workers! They did a good job with pay, and I got the hours I wanted and more."
good,"Overall love the company, my first job, but could get compensated more. Spend a lot of time and over time making the company great only to make minimum wage and still stress off of money. Great benefits. Love management. You meet a lot of great people."
good,"it was a fun and positive work environment. alot of good training on the company and their product. The particular location i was at, stayed busy so time went by fast but with a good supportive time, rushes were never overwhelming."
good,It was really fast paced but you got to know your costumers. They really made the day better. The hardest part of the job is keeping your kiosk clean and remembering every drink you have to make.
good,Good place to work fast paced great people they promote internally time off is easy if you get someone to cover your shift they help you get to know your coffee and have great training programs
good,"My job entails executing all aspects of store operations. I evaluate  the scheduled partners, deploy and delegate tasks so that we can create and maintain the Starbucks experience for our customers. "
good,Overall great experience and first job. My coworkers were always amazing and easy to work with. Tips are a great plus depending on your store’s location!
good,"My issue was not with the company, but with management. I asked to work part time because I had another job, but the manager insisted on working me full-time hours as a part-time employee. The manager was hardly around when needed, and did not support her staff when needed. I ultimately left because I was absolutely exhausted, and could no longer work so much for so little pay. My time is worth more that that. "
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced environment, working early in the morning at first pretty challenging but it actually better to work in the morning then evening because time passed fast because its usually busy in the morning. Working in the morning can be challenging because you have to organize shipments, do the pull and thaw for the evening, also order for the day after tomorrow and lastly giving out breaks in between peak hours and managing the floor. Starbucks is just like family, we are cant be intact if we dont work together as a team. The most irritating things i gone through it has to be the management team, when you sub for the other store and see how others store manager treated their partners, it just sad. Seeing them got the least help from the upper level, but you can't do anything for them its just heart breaking."
good,"Best place to work as a student, great colleagues  and getting to improve your communication and sales skills. Getting an idea of how big companies work."
good,Starbucks offers many opportunities for growth. They are willing to work with you and make sure you have the schedule you need. They offer many benefits tot heir partners and I think that helps a lot.
good,"The biggest challenges are working with inexperienced baristas (but they have to learn sometime), being down a person without having a replacement (stuff happens), being busier than projected (didn't know that school bus was going to show up), and equipment breaking unexpectedly (again, stuff happens). Other than that, most of the customers are great or at least not terrible, same with the coworkers, it is an interesting challenge, and it's nice to stay busy."
good,"Starbucks was a very good job for me. I got more than enough hours, and good tips. I enjoyed the people i worked with. It was sometimes very busy but i liked the fast pace of it."
good,I’ve worked at 4 different jobs before Starbucks and I must say this is my favorite job by far! Only thing that sucks is the pay :( It’s a good side job.
good,"Starbucks can either drain out your life force, or it can be a fantastic job."
good,Fun and face paced. Opening can be hard and customers aren’t always nice. Discounts and benefits are nice and you get a regular raise in the company along with stocks
good,"My time at Starbucks was enjoyable, it was hard work as well, but the people I worked with were 9/10 amazing, Facebook page ""Take my shift"" allowed me a way to have a shift covered in an emergency and take more shifts when I was needing more money."
good,"working at starbucks was fun and exciting, the environment and the people i worked with always had amazing energy and even though it got busy at times it was still a great place to be"
good,"SBX was good overall, but the stressful environment gets to you after a while. There is barely any down time and the management isn't the greatest either. The perks are free food."
good,Great benefits. Provides well for the employees.  Get all your benefits just working part time.  Flexible for people going to school or have other obligations.  Not a career job though.
good,Workplace culture is the number one priority of starbucks. Working at Starbucks you should expect to strive to create best moments for every customer and partner
good,"Starbucks is a very loving workplace, demanding extreme amounts of effort and focus. Rush hour is incredibly busy, and demands alot out of every on-site staff member."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. The high demand kept me busy, focused and engaged. The customers were absolutely lovely and I built friendships with people I will never forget. I hated working drive thru for obvious reasons. But overall, a great part time job to keep you busy."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for younger people. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a career for anyone who is 25 years or older, but while I was going through school it was a good supplemental income."
good,Very fast paced and always busy. Always have to be ready for the morning rush and have to be willing to talk to customers and you have to have a lot of patience
good,"A typical day at Starbucks. Greeted customers, handled the cashier, and made a variety of different drinks. There other duties as well, keeping the espresso machines for example running meant cleansing them constantly. A lot of customers would order the same drink everyday, that required memorizing what their regular drink was.  There were several promotions, be ready for long lines and a fast-paced work environment."
good,"College Achievement Plan, the company offers for Arizona State University is an excellent program they offer.  Partner benefit is pretty good compares to other companies. We get a discount on our purchase at Starbucks. The company has health insurance for part-time partners too."
good,"Starbucks was a good place to work. I wish the opportunity was there for me, but working for that company was not what I wanted for my life. The reason I left was because I did not think the manager was going to promote me and I wanted to try a different opportunity."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. I unfortunately had  location that had a manager and staff that created a toxic environment to work in, but I appreciated the discounts and the experience it provided for me."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for almost two years and I truly enjoyed my time there. I would have stayed longer if it had given more pay. I was getting married though and beginning to start a family so I needed better. There isn't much opportunity to grow in the company either, after you become shift supervisor (with not much of a raise) you don't have anywhere else to go unless its corporate"
good,Great place to work. Enjoyed making connections with the customers. Enjoy seeing the regulars come in everyday. Get free beverages when you worked and got tips every week.
good,Great company to work for the customers are the one thing that i miss the most about Starbucks. The friendships that are made are life long. One day I hope to be able to return with the knowledge that I have gained working elsewhere.
good,I worked with students just like me at the time and the environment was very lighthearted and fun. Got to meet lots of great and loyal customers and learn the ins and outs of working as a Barista
good,"depending on the location, Starbucks is a great company to work for. flexible hours, opportunities with college and higher positions. also very good health benefits!"
good,"Typical day at work starts with getting coffee before your shift which usually enhances your customer service which may not be bad to begin with. You deal with your biggest rush of people around 7a-9a because that's usually when the typical workday for everyone starts. You can expect a very fast-paced workflow to the point you feel like a machine yourself. You will get to know the names of about 2-300 people on a first name basis if they're regulars. I have learned to set my pride aside when the customer insists on getting something free. I learned to not project the slightest bit of anger because it almost always promotes an angry response back. When I began at Starbucks I couldn't help but to get slightly angry when people spoke to me a certain way. I then realized that if you treat people kindly no matter what, sometimes they'll come back and apologize for the way they spoke to you which is usually because of something else going on in their life. Many people, despite how they're dressed when they walk in, have tremendous capabilities and/or capacities to love even the baristas behind the counter. Many of our regular customers bring us gifts around Christmas, or food to make sure we're happy at work. You never know who could help you out in life, I met someone who could very well make my dream of being a professional music producer come true. Treat everyone with respect because sooner or later it will come around."
good,"Working as a barista is fantastic! I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a flexible schedule. They have great benefits and it's a wonderful way to feed your coffee habits!"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you love a fast-paced, high energy work environment. There are predictable rushes in the early morning, after school/lunch time, and after normal work hours that make planning your day easy."
good,It was a means to an end. Your coworkers make the job experience good or bad. I was cool with everyone so it was okay. I had some great coworkers and I had some awful ones.
good,"Great attitude of majority of employees, but a few experiences with coworkers of multiple locations left me desiring more. The advancement is up to the individual as far as crafting drinks fast and accurate, but the advancement of position is rather lacking."
good,Fast paced environment a lot of different recipes and flavors to remember but once you master it it’s jot so bad. Have to be a friendly person to work here
good,I loved working for Starbucks when I was just a barista or shift supervior.  Once I started working my way up into store management things went downhill due to lack of leadership from district management
good,Starbucks is very laid back and respects you as a partner. Although it can be busy and stressful and laid back and chill. Good job if you're in school.
good,"it's a nice place to work, great drinks too.I liked my manager a lot, he definitely made things a little easier when they would get stressful. Loved my coworkers as well."
good,"This is a good job for part time students. It definitely doesn’t pay the bills as a full time job— most of my coworkers had other jobs as well. Once my original manager left, the store declined in all fields."
good,this is a good jon . I like to work whit the client and is realy amazing. if you want to try someting whit coffe is the job for that. PLUS  the manger ios so cool you need to take a chance
good,"Working at starbucks you will meet new people everyday, some customers will be regulars. i learned that working at starbucks is very diversity, and also learning people. Its a face paced working environment, the hardest part is learning new drinks but you'll eventually get the hang of it. You'll love it."
good,"Starbucks est une bonne expérience, il y a beaucoup à apprendre, on peut découvrir beaucoup de choses intéressantes sur le café,la connexion avec le client, le travail d'équipe, les opportunités de développement..."
good,"Starbucks is an absolutely amazing company to work for.  They have great benefits for part time employees and a good pay rate for partners.  The only issue I have is the managers are inconsistent.  you will have some that are great and following the company standards, and there are some that do not meet these standards.  Overall, I have enjoyed my time with the company and have had a lot of personal development within it's walls.  I am now ready to move on with my career and keep striving to make every moment right."
good,"Whilst working at Starbucks, one may encounter the diverse faces of their community, and exchange pleasantries with one’s constituents on a regular basis. In addition, one may develop a secondary understanding of café culture throughout the world, as well as it's adjacent industries. Management may be quick to spot talents within the work staff and provide opportunities for personal and career growth."
good,"Can be great but really depends on good management, a poor manager can make working here very difficult. I had a great manager, really made working for Starbucks an enjoyable experience."
good,"The job puts you in a social setting, youre always around people. You're very busy always making drinks, doing the same thing over and over. The glam of working in a coffee shop quickly ends when you realize the prices are inflated but the wage doesn't even come close to matching it."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the expression on my customer's faces when satisfied with their drinks/ and or food. I learned many important skills while working at Starbucks including time management, stress management, customer service skills and how to work under pressure and in a fast-paced/ competitive environment."
good,"Starbucks is a very faced paced place to work. If you have never worked in retail and enjoy being part of a team and working hard, it is a good place to start. The partners are friendly and willing to help at any time. Working in a drive-thru store can be very difficult, and may cause some stress, but with great partners, you are able to make it through a rough day. "
good,"I loved working here because of my Starbucks Partners. I learned how to work in a fast-paced environment and learned from mistakes. The hardest part of the job was memorizing all the recipes, but over time it just became repetition so it got easier."
good,"A typical day for me would be guest interaction, cash handling and inventory counts, partner training and coaching. "
good,"The scheduling is very flexible and works around school or other obligations. Customers are typically very pleasant and co-workers too. Management at my specific store was not the best. We had one get fired and the replacement wasn't much better. I know friends at other stores loved their managers so I guess I just had bad luck. Benefits are incredible. Free drinks before, during, and after your shift, or 30% off when you're not scheduled. 30% off all merchandise, beans, and coffee makers. You get a free pound of coffee a week as well as tips on a weekly basis which are done by a pool. 401k has great matching."
good,"You get the hours you ask for, great work atmosphere, caring people to work with. You get to know your customers very well. the benefits of eb=ven being a parttime employee are great!"
good,This is a fast paced environment that requires you to multitask and communicate.  Positions are flexible and they allow you to learn different skill sets.
good,"-high standards of customer service"
good,I have no ill or bad ties with Starbucks. But the pay and the amount of hours takes a toll on you. It’s sad to be yelled at at 5am for a cup of coffee. Dont get me wrong I love my job at Starbucks. But I’m working nearly over time for minimum wage and its not worth my health to work too hard for 9 bucks an hour.
good,"Relaxt werksfeer, relaxte en leuke collega's, leuke gasten en veel informatie en kennis die je opdoet over koffie."
good,Good place to work to learn about coffee. Customer service novices can learn a great deal working at Starbucks. Highly recommend for a first job or those looking to quickly advance into management.
good,The atmosphere working here is great. It is truly like a family and I have met some really great people. It's a fantastic job for a student or someone looking for something part time.
good,"Great spot to  work at, but I was only there for about a week to help do the mailing but this was temp work only. Unfortunately I was not called back."
good,"Journée variés,clientèle également, équipe jeunes et dynamiques ce fût très plaisant..mais le gérant et moi on ne voyait pas dans la même direction,nous n'avions pas les mêmes priorités."
good,Working at Starbucks is rewarding as you get to help customers and perform visual merchandising skills as you also make drinks. I enjoyed my time there. It was very fulfilling.
good,I loved my co workers and dedicated regulars. I typical day included lots of smiles and hard work. I learned that your coworkers can be your family and your work can be a second home. The hardest part was the strict attendance policy. I enjoyed crafting beverages the most.
good,"In all honesty, my time working there was a lot of fun. I loved the people i worked with and how quick paced the job was, but i had to leave to focus on school. Otherwise, I would've stayed for a while."
good,Starbucks was the perfect Job to provide benefits and paid time off for a young mom wanting the ability to earn money in the evenings so I could stay at home with my kids. It was also perfect for college.
good,This is a great first job. Training was easy and enjoyable. Managers try to work with your school schedule. Working Thanksgiving and Christmas is optional (based on volunteers). It's hard to get days you've requested off a lot of time because of staffing issues. It can get hectic and customers can get out of line.
good,"Over all a good place to work, the health benefits are one of the best i've seen in any company. training and advancement are always available with the proper work."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to start your career, but I would not recommend it for the long term.  You start off the day by setting up the store. You put the pastries on the display shelf, and on the pastry cart, move the breakfast sandwiches from the freezer to the small fridge, make coffee for the customers, etc.  Once you finish that, the rush begins in the morning and you make food and beverages for the customers (this is the busiest part of the day).  When the crowd slows down you are doing something else to make the store better.  Such as take out garbage, wiping tables, or refilling creamers.  As the day draws to a close, you start to mop the floors,  check milks, count money, etc. The work place culture is fast paced (some are faster than others),  and you are always on your feet except for breaks.  The workplace culture all depends on the store, but in general people are friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of the job, in my opinion are the hours and the fact that you have to make multiple drinks in a short period of time (especially if you are shorthanded).  I found the employees and the benefits  the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"working at Starbucks everyday was very nice. Every shift is like satisfying specially when you see your customers satisfied on service you offer. I have learned many things in my work on Starbucks, one of the most important for me was the in-depth knowledge about the coffee and the company. The management and other staffs are working together in may ways to achieve every goals of the store specially its performance, on sales and on how we work to have a very good experience for our customers. The hardest part of the job might be the rush hours where in those times, many people are coming at the store so the production were having some challenges, which leads to the next part where the enjoyable part of the job is that when we overcome those challenges and make it to success, is the most satisfying part of the job."
good,Clean great company. Treats employees and customers well. They tend to spoil customers however and let them get away with a lot. Other than that they treat employees fairly and benefits are good
good,work place culture definitely depends on where you are located and how your manager runs the store. it can be completely stressful or relaxing. I would typically recommend college/high school students who need a first time job.
good,Great working enviroment. When helping customers the Job can become very fast paced. I love how Starbucks would allow me to call other corporate Starbucks employees to cover shifts in case of emergencies.
good,"Have always enjoyed my time with the Siren! Sure it get's a little hetic around the holidays, as any other retail job entails...but it's really worth it. It worked for me in order to finish college while trying to live comfortably and not under much stress. Free coffee is always a plus!"
good,"El ambiente laboral es excelente, alcanza los altos estandares de eficacia y excelencia, sin embargo, al llenarse y tener mucha gente, lo hace tambien un trabajo estresante. La exigencia laboral y el estres no se equipara con la remuneración recibida, que es muy poca."
good,"If you don't do well with stressful or extremely busy places I would not recommend working there. With at being said it is a fun place to work, partners are enjoyable and work well with each other. Also the benefits are pretty good"
good,Worked 12-16 hours a week. Scheduling was super flexible which was great because I was also taking 15 credit-hours. The company has awesome benefits that are unmatched for minimum-wage jobs elsewhere. Awesome place to work if you're going to school.
good,"I really loved working for Starbucks, it was a great experience! Looks really good on your resume. I made some great friends, and worked really well with everyone!"
good,"Starbucks has made me love and hate and love my job again. Personally, my development was swift and quick. I felt very valued as a partner 90 percent of the time."
good,"es un ambiente agradable pero es poco pesado, no solo es la preparación del café también te encargas de la limpieza del lugar."
good,Great job to have a work and school balance. Free drinks and food during shifts. Free coffee every week. Paid time off after working a year with the company.
good,Great place to work ! This company provides workers with the opportunity to return to school by working with your schedule. This company definitely requires employees to work at a fast paced. Also if you are looking for management opportunities this is the company to start .
good,"Provided amazing benefits at 20 hours a week.  Job itself is not very fulfilling. I enjoyed working in medical/dental much more, but benefits were either not available or very minimal."
good,"Like first job wher you are beginning is very nice because the help you a lot and also they teach you a lot about customers service, yes is very nice experience."
good,My time at Starbucks was both stressful yet enjoyable as I learned more about coffee and the difference between each beans and roast. They have great employees that are both fun to work with and also hard workers that were all punctual and professional. I'd recommend anyone to work there as they have the great benefits and stock options that can help you out.
good,"This job is all about the customer service. Typical day, brew coffees/tea. Clean work area when the pace is slow. Deliver beverages and food in a timely manner. Hardest part is memorizing all of the drinks. The most enjoyable part is meeting all the people you serve, sometimes you can run into some very interesting people."
good,"If management is okay then you will have a pleasant time. If management is bad your experience at a store is going to be horrendous. The compensation you get for daily work is more than ample. Starbucks also covers your college payments through the College Achievement Plan (C.A.P.) if you are enrolled in Arizona State University Online. Work environment can be extremely stressful and customers can treat you like a sub-human sometimes. Co-workers are usually extremely friendly and the working environment can be wonderful if you have a store that knows it's culture, customers, and goals."
good,Very fun and trendy environment. Lots of drinks to remember but an easy job. Customers can be a little manic with secret menu iteams but aside from those drinks well be easy to get down.
good,"Working as a barista was a great go between for me during college. Compared to typical food service or retail, the store culture was welcoming and had high standards for cleanliness and the customer's experience. "
good,"I loved my time at Starbucks, it was fun and a very friendly workplace. I met and worked with some of the most positive people I have ever met. Overall a very awesome place to work with very good benefits."
good,"Worked at Starbucks throughout college, loved it! Pretty flexible with your schedule although I wish they paid more. After five years and in a management position I was still only making $10/hour"
good,I was able to adjust my schedule when needed and the job was easy to manage.  No real hard part to the job.  It was nice to see regulars and chat with customers
good,"I love working at Starbucks. While the demands are extremely high, and the customers aren't always the most friendly, the culture with my coworkers is amazing. Just wish they paid in line with what they require of their baristas."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I adapted quickly and had a team I enjoyed who was there to help me learn and grow. I've learned that it really is all about you location and management. Sometimes the hours suck. Starbucks pays better than most companies these days but with bad hours it's tough sometimes. Overall I'd recommend it as a first job. Just leave when you're ready otherwise this place will get to you, but that's with any job."
good,"a great place to work, fast-paced environment and easily irritable customers but definitely a great experience. The job paid over $10.00 and it felt like a dollar more an hour with the amount of tips."
good,"People are passionate and caring. Customers make your day and there is always something to do to keep you busy. Comp&Benefits are great for retail company, very supportive culture and I met the best people."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, just difficult to afford living as well as other expenses only working at starbucks. Collaborative team work, fun and fast paced environment."
good,In the training days learning about culture on a Starbucks work day I gather together a sample cup of brewed pike along with a vanilla bean scone to study the taste of culture brewed coffee beans. The taste was sweetness in my mouth and the taste of culture shock. All the work having to collect the coffee beans through out the years.
good,"I was able to clock in, clock out, get paid, and leave, but I still enjoyed the job. The manager was amazing and made working for a corporation still feel worth it."
good,"At a popular coffeeshop like Starbucks you'll see many everyday regulars. It is nice to see familiar faces. You begin to form a relationship with your customers and it almost seems like you are friends by the end of the month because you see them everyday. You will also see many unfamiliar faces. The location I worked at was very close to a skytrain station, so many transit users would come in. Pretty much any type of person will walk into Starbucks because everyone know what it is and so many people need their coffee. You will have to communicate with all these people, which can be a challenge sometimes. However, we like challenge because it helps us grow. "
good,"Starbucks offers many benefits other than their pay rate. They also offer tuition reimbursement, stock, 401K, vacation and sick pay, insurance at an amazing rate, free food and drink while on shift, a free pound of coffee weekly, excellent work/life balance..."
good,In the first was good. After the management was always about the money. The hours dropped from 38 to 20 hours per week which means I couldn't keep my insurance. The last store that I was the baristas was not trained properly and the manager was never at the store. Beside doing my job as a shift supervisor I had to do the barista and my managers job. I got very stressful and the schedule was bad
good,"The experience for Starbucks can vary depending on the store that you are working at. In my experience, the interaction with the customers was not worth the compensation I was given. Corporate has taught their customers that it is okay to fight against policies in order to get what they want, and when a barista tries to uphold policies they are met with little support."
good,"Every day was different. Could be non-stop just go! go! go! or it could be chill enough to where you have enough down time to do the little tasks like making mocha or grinding coffee or even changing out the pastry cases. It all just depends on the day! Regardless, it's a very stressful, yet fun and fulfilling job to have."
good,"The people you work with are from all walks of life. Sometimes, it gets hectic during rush but the job is what you make of it and what attitude you walk in with. Being on register and being talkative has its perks, I networked a lot through Starbucks since my university's faculty walked in as regulars. I gained some good opportunities through Starbucks. Also, benefits are great."
good,"good work balance with the remainder of life needs.  I was able to work at starbucks, care for a child, go to school part time and complete an internship.  Great benefits including medical insurance, 401k and even stocks"
good,"Starbucks itself is a great company with awesome pay and even better benefits. However, there are some deeper rooted issues with leadership, time management, hours, and high turnover rate.  I loved working with people with the same position as me, but some managers have treated other baristas and I unfairly, have called to ask us to work on our days off, or won't let us go home when we are actually sick (a violation of health codes).  Aside from these issues, Starbucks was a great company to work with lasting friendships and room to grow, if wanted."
good,"I've worked a variety of customer service and food service jobs. Working at Starbucks, however, has been the best I've worked so far. "
good,I felt as if my experience was positive. It gave me the necessary customer service skills I need for the future. The employees and customers made the job exciting every day
good,I work at Starbucks inside of Safeway. I absolutely love working for Starbucks but I can’t stand how much Safeway controls us. They take all of our hours and we don’t get the regular dress code that corporate Starbucks does.
good,over all a really fun place top work. the staff and positive environment set really can make or break the job. enjoyed connecting with customers and being able to provide quality service.
good,"a typical work day includes making drinks, taking orders, working cash and cleaning up. things have changed but management was okay, the employees were pretty nice. over all fun place"
good,"Excelentes prestaciones."
good,Working for Starbucks was a great experience due to the fast pace environment. Our district always had daily competitions on who was the best store in both service records for drive thru or highest sales during peak hours. There was always something to learn whether it was a name and face of a new regular customer or a new technique in making someone's drink.
good,"I have enjoyed making friends with my coworkers and customers, although the pay does not make up for the stress of working during a 3 or 4 hour rush, along with the tediousness, responsibility, and stress of working full-time."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced with slower intervals. The people who work there are very friendly and make the job worthwhile. The hardest part of the job is balancing customer support in times of rush.
good,"Starbucks as a company is a great company to work for. It has a lot of benefits including medical, and paid first time bachelors through a highly accredited school, ASU. The work can be demanding but is worth it in the end. They are very flexible with the hours so you do have time for life or other things. Overall it is a great experience working here."
good,"Depending on the store you work at, it can be a very busy place to work. I have always had a good relationship with my coworkers and overall it is a very fun place to work. Management varies in quality depending on the store. I have had some great managers and some very poor ones as well. Very flexible schedule so if you need specific hours to work around school or a second job it's perfect."
good,This was agreat place to work at I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a job. I just personally had bad experience in my store with management. My manager telling me to quit school if I wanted more hours and falsy accused for racism. So I left to pursue my career somewhere else where I was actually appreciated. But if this position is definitely worth trying especially if youre still in college and you can grow quickly from it. Depending in what store youre in and if management doesnt have favorites.
good,"Very political environment, good talent usually leave for better opportunities and/or advancements within 1-3 years."
good,I got this job because I had a friend in management  and it taught me a lot that I can carry with me through every job I have had. I had a great experience and considered many of my coworkers like family by the time I left.
good,"I was only as starbucks part-time and it was an enjoyable in-between job . I amsure that there were many places to advance, but I was not able to  experience that."
good,I really enjoyed the intelligent and passionate people I met in Starbucks.  Synergies are created when we all met with one goal in mind and it is to make Starbucks a great company.
good,"The hardest part about the job was that it was mentally and physically exhausting. Very demanding of my schedule as well, i didn't have a uniform schedule- random shifts"
good,"Very fun, laid-back work environment. Always kept very clean and organized. They spent a good amount of time training me before I was ever left alone. Always fast paced so time flew by!"
good,"Starbucks is a pretty good company for work for, if you don't need to support yourself. The pay is not great, but the benefits are wonderful. I would keep working 20 hrs a week to get the good health care and free coffee."
good,Quick paced environment and essential skills to being a conducive part of any work place. Support coworkers and light hearted interactions in a high stress situation. Very understanding concerning current students and the time constraints within their schedules.
good,a typical day at work . stocking taking the trash out cleaning up spills of any kind. I learned how to work really fast and also work the register.the hardest part of the job is making drinks.
good,"Being a part-time Barista. I developed my communication skills when it comes in talking with the client. Not just my communication skills but being in an organization that you've enjoyed, you can also developed your adaptability, creativity, social skills and work as a team."
good,"I'll start by saying Starbucks is a great company to work for in terms of benefits and accommodation. The Employee Assistance Program can help connect you with mental-health and housing support services if need be and, in my experience, was very helpful."
good,"A typical day would be busy, challenging, but always interactive. I would have control of the floor and my fellow associates' positions on the floor. I would provide maximum efficiency with the tools I would be given."
good,Schedules are all over the place and most of my coworkers are gossipy teenage girls which can work on the nerves pretty quickly.  The managers are good people who genuinely care and it pays well you could say... it's a job.
good,"Gave me a platform to learn about leading, coaching, and training, lots of opportunity to move up by working hard and developing as a team.I enjoyed it, but the pay was not great, however they give scholarships to students who work."
good,"as long as you don't let negative energy from customers or coworkers get to you, it's a great job. they need to do something about the dishwashing sanitizer. what it does to our hands is unsafe."
good,"I have learnt how to help customers to take an order"
good,"It’s a good job to get into customer service, not something I want to stay with forever but they are flexible. If you’re nice to people the people are nice to you."
good,"Loved this job worked my way up from 8.50 to 10 dollars after 3 years. Then minimum wadges went up to ten and people who just started we’re starting making $10 with hardly any compensation for long time employees:"
good,"A typical day at work is starting by the bar, getting everyone's drink prepared. A lot of the customers knew who I was, and I knew exactly what drink they would drink every morning. The customers and I had a simple bond. They were the reason I wanted to come, get out of my bed and come to work everyday. The hardest part of the job was having to stand on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flow that my coworkers and I created. We worked as a team to get everyone what they needed, especially during the morning and afternoon rush. The workplace culture is an exciting place. You get to learn new things about Starbucks everyday."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. Great place to improve social skills in a professional manner. Starbucks allowed me to network with people I otherwise would have rarely came into contact with. Would recommend to high school students or people who need a part time job. Benefits are awesome but hourly compensation is low. I worked with great people, had the best store manager who cared about her role and her employees. Every ""higher up"" corporate robot I've met through Starbucks suuuuucks though. And moving up is strictly who you know not what you know"
good,"I had two different experiences while at Starbucks. One was fantastic and one was awful. For me, it came down to our group managers. During the positive experience, our manager was a strong leader and gave clear guidelines and expectations. Plus she made it a fun and collaborative work environment. "
good,"The hours are flexible and I have learned a lot about time management, inventory and quality control through Starbucks. The healthcare and other benefits are great to other comparable businesses. There's free drinks, bags of coffee and a free meal during your shift! However, the Starbucks experience relies heavily on your manager. Despite, favoritism Starbucks is a fun and enjoyable place to work if you are there during rush hours. The rush is exhilarating. Unfortunately, if you aren't super friendly with your store manager, you're out of luck. For example, one of our supervisors were caught stealing tips but didn't get punished due to being a favorite. You may also be stuck with hours that are super slow and extremely boring. You'll be stuck looking at the clock wishing the time would go faster."
good,"I would have stayed working for Starbucks has the pay been better! I really loved working with the public in this way and after a short period of time, I was given an opportunity to become supervisor there. It was a rewarding experience I just wish that they paid a living wage rather than minimum wage."
good,"Very fast paced and structured. You get out what you put in with this company, the opportunities are thee but you need to stay on top of it and be dedicated to the work."
good,Starbucks provides a great culture to their partners! You get to learn more in depth about coffee through coffee tastings. Other partners are very encouraging and positive.
good,"El ambiente es muy bueno"
good,Starbucks is a Fastpaced environment where if you are not quick to think or listen you will get swallowed up by the pressure. It's a Great environment when you have good friends to work around. The management can be stressful at times and the customers are stressful. I would recommend it to friend however because it is a good college job and first job and it is a good balanced career for those needing an extra side money.
good,"good benefits, tuition reimbursement, free spotify premium account, drink & food discounts.. pretty cool job except the people who buy this stuff are snotty and rude... also starbucks policy lets people walk all over their baristas."
good,"En arbetsdag startade alltid med att gå igenom butiken och kolla vad som behövs fyllas på, vilka mål vi hade kvar för dagen att göra och såg till satt allting skulle såg bra ut för att göra ditt arbetspass så effektivt och bra som möjligt. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. Learned more about myself and ability to work under pressure. Learning different systems, protocols and maintaining calm customer service each day. I am grateful for my time at Starbucks."
good,Great part-time job to work while going to school or pursing other interests.  For the most part if you are someone who is really interested in business or at least working your way up to a manger position Starbucks is really good at developing its partners.
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar si no tienes obligaciones escolares o familiares.
good,"Starbucks is a great job for anyone who is in school, living with parents or on their own. they offer great benefits. The school program they offer is pretty nice but it's not really for anyone who is slammed with bills every month. They take 20 hours every paycheck so if you're living on your own it's almost impossible to afford it. However they do reimburse you in full if you pass your classes with a C or higher, so in a way it is free like they promised. The experience differs from each store, I've covered shifts at different locations and i can tell you that not every one is super friendly and welcoming. You get a free coffee mark-out each week and a discount at any location. Plus free drinks and a food item every shift!"
good,"Worked with a strong flexible team to achieve optimal customer service."
good,"it's a fun job for sure, especially at the start. it all depends on management, types of customers and your propensity to handle pressure/stress. if you're at a store that isn't constantly busy and the customers aren't excessively rude, you'll have a great time! definitely one of the best places to work at in the food/beverage industry."
good,a fun fast paced working environment. You will grow relationships with coworkers and regulars you will make about 3 or more drinks at one on high demands very enjoyable place. plus you're always first to try a new drink
good,Great company to work for if college student. Or looking to pursue  a degree. Starbucks pays for first bachelors from ASU online but will also reimburse partially for classes completed at other universities.
good,"Starbucks's really has the welfare of their partners in mind, which I really appreciate. With that being said, a typical day was usually pretty stressful. Starbucks' standards were admirable but sometimes seemed a bit unrealistic. We were to be 100% in giving customers a great experience, give them quality beverages, but still be as fast as we can, while keeping the store as clean as possible. These standards would be easier to accomplish if there was adequate staffing, but that usually was not the case. "
good,"Working as a team at Starbucks was quite fun, There was never any downtime due to the excessive amount of customers, but it made the day proceed fairly quick. Was a great temporary job while i was in school, but I wouldn't want to work there full time."
good,A typical day at Starbucks requires you to be fast pace and to always make sure things are filled and socked and done the right way. The most enjoyable part is getting free drinks but the worst part is not being able to accept tips because we are under Target.
good,"Honestly it all depends on what store you are a part of, for the most part the company had undergone an extremely large shift in new hires over the years which has begun to dilute the culture and experience I felt when I was first hired. Not trying to bash on the company but there has been a large decline in partner morale again, due to hours being cut and expected numbers increasing exponentially. Overall if you have a good manager (seem hard to come by now-a-days) you should be in a good boat."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Fast moving, always speaking to a customer. coworkers are pretty nice and supportive if you need help. keep you motivated, and plays good music."
good,"I didn't work in an independent Starbucks store, I worked in a kiosk located inside a Vons. There were no tips, no teamwork and management didn't care much for the employees. I would have loved to work at a real store where I could've grown and improved because I enjoyed the culture of Starbucks. I never drank coffee until I worked there, and it felt nice to be apart of everyone's daily routine to start their day."
good,"starbucks is a very good place to work "
good,"I would recommend as a first job, gives you great insight on things. It can be very nerve wracking with drive thru and not a ton of help but everyone gets together and finds way to have things run smoothly."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work as a part time job or just in college until you finish your schooling. I was paid okay but didn't think it was a great living wage.
good,"My co-workers were amazing. My boss was amazing. Upper management often forget about the customer and partner experiences and focus more on numbers. This pressure creates unnecessary stress on partners that lessens the customer experience."
good,"Flexible hours, free coffee while working. Great place to work. There are days that challenging with rude customers, but generally a good place to work."
good,"The best part of working for Starbucks are the people you work with.  I have worked with in the vast majority good and decent people.  I learned a good workplace translates into good service to customers and good service for the company.  I have worked for Starbucks in many stores and my managers have been great - helping you learn your job and giving good direction for work flow.  A day is typically customer focused early and slowly changes to a task focus towards the end of the day.  There really isn't much hard at the position - just learn your skills and remember to treat oneself, peers and customers with respect and honest  and good emotion."
good,"All in all, Starbucks is not a bad company to work for. The benefits are great, and who wouldn't love free caffeine all day? Working for Starbucks taught me valuable skills that I can use both in life and in any future profession. Perhaps it was just my store in particular, but the relationship between baristas and the District Manager was often strained due to miscommunication and apparent lack of interest from corporate. In addition, the drama between baristas was often reminiscent of high school feuds and gossip."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced. Dealing with rude customers. The workplace is filthy, hardest part is getting up at 4a.m. Seeing smiles on people."
good,This job was very flexible in terms of hours so it was a great part-time job for my undergraduate studies. The hours can be long and the environment can be stressful but the workplace culture is very relaxed and generally easy-going. It is very hard to get promoted and there is a high turnover rate but at the same time almost no one ever gets fired. The worst that can happen is that your hours get reduced. The salary and benefits is pretty good considering this is an entry-level position.
good,"I loved Starbucks! I made friends for life and our benefits are beyond amazing! Our Partner Number could be used for discounts in any store nationwide (not in the ones in Target though). However, I had to leave since my store was going through a mid-life crisis and I felt that I could offer my services elsewhere. If you work here, you will like it; if not love it!"
good,"being a barista is not just making coffee for the customer, it's also about learning from the customer as you talk and make friends to them so they can feel welcome every time they come to the store."
good,"I've been with Starbucks over 4 years and they've taken very good care of me as an employee. Within these last few years its given me the opportunity to grow in character, be secure in my benefits medically, meet incredible people and even transfer to work in another state. Besides the fact that the company makes it too difficult to promote within, I highly recommend Starbucks as a trustworthy source of employment."
good,Working there is a life chance to show you the other side of something that may help you no matter what problems. I learn how to be fast with drinks while making sure it was at its best quality. The management was amazing while starting there it fell off as i worked my way into the company. The hardest part was the lack of enough people at times when we need more barista near us during holiday rush etc.. The best part was the team and shift leader we would have in store.
good,"There's days that I love working for this company and other days I feel likest's not worth the emotional and physical toll. I will say that the store I work at is in the top 5 busiest in the state, and its normal for us to have a 40 plus customer half hour, but although this is normal the stress never seems to end. "
good,"Starbucks changed a lot over the 10 years I worked there. However, I was able to take away infinite experience in many areas that I know I will utilize immensely in the future."
good,"At Starbucks I learned how to work well under pressure. I love fast-pace environments and this was it. It is always busy. I learned how to multi-task in so many ways because of it. Management depends on what store you go to. Not all managers are the same. They all have different attitudes, but they are pretty strict. Values and missions were followed and reinforced. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the store clean, but it is manageable if you have the right employees. The part that I enjoyed the most was serving customers and making drinks."
good,"It takes awhile to learn everything and get used to the rushes. It is not very diverse. It does not take much to move up to a ""shift"" or a manager. Hours are pretty predictable and flexible."
good,"Starbucks has thought me more than anywhere i have worked, they touchy me art, people, coffee, and how to love what you do and one another. I thank Starbucks very much for everything I have learned"
good,"It's hard to find a place to hangout with friends in a calm environment but Starbucks is the place along with the free WIFI. I really like how sometimes we can control the moods of our customers, for example when a customer comes in one afternoon with a horrid mood most of the time it's possible to watch them leave with a much greater mood."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to gain customer service experience. Althought it can get stressfull, at Starbucks you have the oppourtunity to meet, connect, and work  with many different people. Along with the the great atmosohere it is usually very flexible with scheduling, the benefits are great, and you have the oppourtunuty to grow within the company."
good,"Starbucks has great values overall as a company. It can be a fun place to work at, but it can be overwhelming at times.I feel that people in higher positions should be compensated more for the work that we do."
good,"One of the biggest things that Starbucks has given me is the ability to have a relationship with the community I live in. I see people on the street, in my store, and in my neighborhood that give me a nod and a smile just because I have spent so much time serving them. It's a great feeling to have that grow and grow over time."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is building relations with customers while watching them and there family grow. Making the hardest part of the job loosing regulars who you've grown a connection through.
good,"As a supervisor, I would lead my team through peak hours of the day while creating a comfortable for customers to enjoy. During my time at Starbucks, I learned the importance of teamwork and communication. I contributed to a respectful work place environment and culture. I did this by creating an ambience with music, as well as, providing and maintaining a clean work space for both my team and customers. The hardest part of the job was  partner absences and unscheduled call out that I would responsible for, in terms of, finding coverage or staying longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I built with customers and co-workers over my tenure there."
good,The people i work with are the reason i still show up. they keep the work environment fun and that is what brings in the customers. The customer are also a joy to service and talk to everyday I have made some good friends.
good,"The biggest thing to get used to is the physical labor. Otherwise, if you have a great team, great things can happen. My training manager wasn't the most qualified for her position, but that can happen anywhere."
good,"Company is an awesome place to work for however management needs some work, better hours, training can be improved on, also managers who don’t have any food experience needs to be even trained harder"
good,It's a fun place to work for. The company wants to provide for their customers so much that they often forget about their employees. Under-staffing leads to long wait time do to a large volume of customers.
good,"Love my partners, like a second family to me. Love the customers and the people I get to meet on a regular basis. Love the different opportunity I get to explore different types of coffee and other Starbucks products."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of being on the go throughout most of the day. There was not much time for boredom. The tasks and main part of the job; making and serving drinks and pastries, was very fun and a good skill to learn."
good,Must be able to multi-task. I did work in a Starbucks that was located inside of a Target. No tips are allowed but you do develop a relationship with regular guests and overall get to work in a fun environment with your fellow co workers.
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits; medical, dental, vision, 401K retirement plan, stock options. They offer a flexible schedule that fits your needs. You may pick up shifts at other Starbucks locations. Company has very high standards and expectations.  The working environment may be stressful at times especially if someone doesn't show up to work."
good,"Great place to hone skills in customer service, loved the job. Personally  had an amazing crew day and night."
good,"great company with great benefits, extremely inclusive and diverse for the most part. great place to work for those balancing working and going to school as schedules are flexible"
good,I enjoyed working in the store. I loved learning about my job to become a better barista but my store's employees and couple of managers made it difficult to work. There was some corruption and favoritism within the staff.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a fun experience. It is very busy so you have to be able to manage large amount of orders, multi task during rush hours and maintain a happy smile throughout the day. Although it was stressful at times i really enjoyed the experience."
good,"I enjoyed working at star bucks the customers are very friendly and generous with the tips "
good,"Starbucks has been a nice place to work for the most part-During my time here I have seen 2 Managers. The first manager was the one that hired me. When he decided to leave he stopped caring about the job and the partners, plus he let everything go so there was no more organization. Just now the new manager is taking over and I have seen a drastic improvement. I just hope it continues."
good,"Collaboration is the key to working at Starbucks. If you come from a shove to climb environment, this environment will be a huge challenge. Consensus and communication are needed to get support for any ideas to get legs."
good,"Starbucks is a welcoming location to visit on daily basis. Working at Starbucks brings you new experience with people from around the world. The best prt about working with Starbucks is know you are in charge of making the drink that will satisfy the customer for the rest of the day. Management was great, she was very patient and welcoming would love to have a boss like her again."
good,"As the Summary states. Some managers can render the job unbearable and bestow all of the actual labor on you as your shift supervisor ""counts milk gallons"" all night or it can be a dream boat where everyone does their station well and cooperates. There typically is no in between."
good,You get to know your partners well and become close with them. Usually a fun environment to be in. Hard workers and people with great customer service skills.
good,"Fun place to work and good company culture. Training was great, but that always depends on the manager. It was really chill. I had a good time working there while I was a student. It takes some time to move up though"
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for.   There is a little bit of a turnover rate if the people are not prepared to stay with a company for at least a few months.  I promised to stay a year at least so I can build on more experience to continue with school and other factors of life.
good,"For a college student Starbucks is a good job; flexible hours, short shifts for morning or night, good pay. The hardest part about eh job is living up to the expectations of the manager. Every manager for every Starbucks is different- the one I worked for had very very high expectations and I feel that he pushes us a little more than needed. "
good,"You either sink or swim. Learn how to work under pressure efficiently. When job is performed correctly by all employees, you'll have a pretty smooth shift. There isn't really any slowing down, you are constantly moving. Creating a beverage to perfection for regular customers was something I challenged myself with and enjoyed. There is a high demand for customer satisfaction, so even if the book says otherwise, ""the customer is always right."" This is a fantastic beginner job for someone who has never worked. You work as a team, including the manager. We all did the same work together. Great benefits, but too often it would be busy and did not have reliable employees. I did also enjoy the opportunity to sit down and really learn about the quality products we carried to better improve our knowledge to drive sales to our customers. They also provide an education program. I personally am not sure I would go back to the company at this current time in my life due to the pay rate, but if someone needs something to just unbore themselves or bring in some extra income, this would be a good option. Wide variety of hours provided and you also have and are encouraged to pick up shifts at other stores within your district."
good,Can build good teamwork when work in starbucks.co worker really nice.nice working environtment.staff benefit provided is good for someone who just want to start work.
good,Was a good place to work at. Keeps you on your feet and feeling excited to work. Is a good source of steady income. The benefits helped me when I didn’t have another choice for insurance. The only thing I didn’t necessarily like was the way the say they pay for your college at ASU because you have to pay your tuition upfront before they reimburse you.
good,work is a little harder than any outside the air port Starbucks cause it very fast based and there is usually not enough people to work that  makes it harder for us to do all the work.
good,"is been a very positive job, the collegue and the environment was very nice and friendly, I don't regret any moment i have been there, the hardest part was just dealing with many customer concerns because everyone is different and my aim was to get the customer happy."
good,I loved the people that I worked with.  After a short time I really fell into the expected performance level of a Starbucks barista.  The problem I had was scheduling.  I ended up working nights and weekend mornings.  It was very difficult to have any sort of social life and I was unable to find another job to fill my available time.
good,"The benefits of this job are amazing, compared to the current stress levels. Underpaid and understaffed. I loved making beverages though. My coworkers are like a family."
good,its a great company to work for; but things you do always go unrecognized or unappreciated. a regular work day at Starbucks for me as a barista would basically be carrying the load on my shoulder; while still getting the same pay as the other baristas. whom pretty much does nothing.
good,"• Greets all customers with fast, friendly, personalized service and develops a rapport with customers by learning their names, favorite drinks and food items."
good,Work life balance was great at starbucks. They work well if you have odd schedule requirements and will do what they can to give you the hours that you need.
good,"I had worked in food service for nearly ten years before I worked at Starbucks and this was the only company to offer health benefits. I liked working there but, at the end of the day, it was still food service and I was ready to move on to something else."
good,Had fun there just didn't get along with one of the new hires. It was a nice paced environment with great people around. I can see myself going back to work for Starbucks if there is one in the surrounding areas.
good,Working at Starbucks while in college taught me how to manage my time between work and school. The work environment was welcoming and encouraged growth. The management was supportive for the employees and worked with the busy student schedules.
good,"Open store, prep store to be prepared for morning rush and prep for afternoon crew. Follow all guidelines and request made from management. Always give 100 percent customer satisfaction."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced, friendly environment. You get to know your customers and your coworkers really well. You also get a lot of free coffee to drink."
good,Fast paced environment. It can be stressful some days with peak and rush. Coworkers are friendly for the most part. Pay is a little bit but not a lot over minimum wage.
good,My career at Starbucks has been a blast! Working here helped build a lot of character for me. It also helped me mature to become the person I am today. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be our customer interactions. Bringing smiles to the faces of our customers helps not only brighten up their days but also mines. The hardest part of the job would probably have to be our midday rushes or when we are understaffed and more work is put on the shoulders of whoever is working that day.
good,"This job gave me perspective and makes you realize how a cup of coffee can change someone's day. Keep an open mind and always give customers the benefit of the doubt"
good,very flexible hours nice people great if second job is needed to make ends meet could increase the pay at least a couple more dollars but over all very flexible and understanding corporation
good,"A typical day was intermittent between extremely fast paced and high pressure during the busier times, and slower detail oriented cleaning and stocking tasks during the moments the store was empty. The hardest part of the job was maintaining composure under pressure during those particularly  busy times, because if you started making mistakes in one area then the rest of the floor would have to deal with backlog that would result from it. I learned to multitask especially well from my position here, but it also taught me how to rely on my team and trust that they would be able to complete their own tasks without my interference."
good,"I loved seeing repeat customers. You get to know their orders and become acquaintances. I learned a lot about coffee that I use at home and share with friends. I enjoyed making friends with coworkers and having store outings to celebrate our progress as a team. The hardest part was how physical it was, which is why I had to quit. The most enjoyable part was being the bright part of people's day by giving them their coffee or food!"
good,"- friendly environment "
good,"Lo mejor de este trabajo fue conocer a un equipo joven y dinámico, en el cual fue fácil trabajar y desenvolverse. Aprendí mucho sobre el producto que vendía, fue toda una experiencia. Lo que más me gusto es el ambiente laboral que había."
good,At my time at Starbucks I had a thrilling time learning about crafting coffee and filling the demand of the fast paced work style. I enjoyed the fast paced environment but ultimately I am just looking for something else.
good,Enjoyed the experience. Fast paced work environment.  Loved making drinks and interacting with customers. I would love to work their again. everyone was so nice.
good,One of the main reasons for working at Starbucks is the benefits. To gain full benefits you only have to work 20 hours a week which is a huge bonus. The job can either be fun or horrible it really depends on if you like the store you work in or not. If you are with good people and the store is set up properly it can be a lot of fun. If not it is just tedious work for not a lot of pay.
good,Young and ambitious or old and relaxed Starbucks is a company for all. It was a good run but unfortunately I had to say good bye to one of my favorite jobs.
good,"A fun and interesting place of work, constant new challenges and a lovely team. Workplace training provided to help with advancement within the company."
good,"Fantastic company to work for.  They are flexible, accepting of all people, and do a great job of inclusiveness.  However, the management needs some work as there are never enough people on the floor for the work load and then the baristas were blamed when something went wrong."
good,"I've been working here for about 2 years so far and I have to say that I truly love working here. It's tiring for sure, the pay could definitely be higher, and sometimes management seems like they could use better training. But I feel like this could be said about any job anywhere. So...I'll focus on the positives."
good,"Starbucks is flexible with schedules during school semesters as long as there is a fair warning given. Even being a barista is very physically demanding and you must be willing to keep busy. Every position's main concern is customers, then teamwork. Must be willing to work with others. Most of all, be capable of smiling even when you don't want to!"
good,"A typical day at the Starbucks stores I worked in included being understaffed, consistently out of needed products and non stop costumers. However, learning to work in this hectic environment helped me develop my problem solving skills as well as how to multi task on each shift with the help of my coworkers. Over all it was very much a sink or swim environment that taught me how to swim."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. They offered many perks and the teams were enjoyable to work with. You are always moving around (cleaning, customer interaction, food and drink preparation), so you never get bored. The hardest part of the job was the cash/safe handling (it wasn't really HARD, but it can induce anxiety) and having to work so fast. Overall, it is a great company to work for, however, you will not earn a lot unless you are a store manager or higher. Great experience to have though!"
good,"Consistently fast-paced work environment that requires very skilled management and division of labor to operate efficiently and enthusiastically. Other than that, a wonderful community of people to work with."
good,"Constantly busy with providing great customer services, managements was always willing to help promote within the company. The most enjoyable part was all the great employees striving for customer satisfaction."
good,"I worked at the Starbucks inside of frys and it was a steady pace mostly slow. You get Thorough training and 40 to 50 hours a week but they are usually  under staffed almost always and the leads they depend, you get great ones and then you get bad ones."
good,Honestly a solid place to work at. Always busy especially during the holidays. Staff shortages due to labor sometimes making working here hard but overall good place to be at. Not the easier place to work at due to all the multitasking that’s is required of you
good,High stress environment. It was difficult to work there considering I worked at one at a travel plaza and it was extremely understaffed. I go to other Starbucks and they seem to have the right amount of employees but not us. I did receive tuition reimbursement from school so that was nice.
good,"It was ok,  very disorganised and didn’t get information about shifts or anything till last minute. Loved the people I worked with. "
good,"Starbucks at Tampa General Hospital was a great place to work at while I was in school. Due to the fact that it was a Starbucks in Tampa General, there was not much room for growth. Tampa General did offer great benefits and we received meal cards to pay for our food on our breaks."
good,Fun fast paced environment. If you're in a good location you will be busy nonstop your entire shift which makes it fly by. Early hours are worth it. You get to know your customers and get a lot of regulars. Learning the bar is difficult but fun! Low pay compared to most places now a days but who knows that may change.
good,Please keep in mind this Starbucks was a franchise inside and operated by a supermarket I worked at. I only worked there 10-12 hours a week to make extra money.
good,one of the best jobs that i have ever had. loved dealing with the customers that would come in for coffee and treats. dealing with the people everyday was the best part of the whole day.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would be ringing up customers, providing their needs like drinks and pastry in a quick manner. Also creating a connection with customers from the minute they walk in till they walk out. "
good,"A typical day of work is both fast-paced and chill. We usually have a couple rushes of people a day for a couple of hours with time to restock and clean in between."
good,Working for Starbucks has been an amazing experience. The benefits are impeccable and there is a great atmosphere. The hardest part of the job has been dealing with labor issues. I've always gotten along with upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with different regulars and new-coming customers and being able to share my knowledge of the job and/or menu.
good,"I have worked with Starbucks for 2 years now, and the culture of the entire company has shifted. The principle of the company remains-- ""we want to be the third place...a place for people to come, a home away from home"". But amidst the competition, Starbucks has been focused on drive-thru times, created even more complicated drinks (that often fail or purposefully only last for 3 weeks but baristas are asked 2 years later if it is available---there's no communication to the customer base), and raised prices slowly. While all of this is happening, the baristas are getting the brunt of angry customers [did the price go up AGAIN? Well WHY don't you have that anymore?], and stressing over making a 6-step Frappuccino while trying to maintain a 40 second drive thru time. Baristas have been blamed for the ""downfall"" and the ""overall negative reputation"" that Starbucks has encountered over the past year--- never mind the never-ending increase in job duties, the ever-changing standard, and the ""always right"" consumer. These take a toll and it is up to management to check on their workers. If you have a bad manager, the turnover is much higher."
good,This is a great company to learn how to work with others. The company encourages growth and provides many leadership opportunities. There are also many tools to self teach provided on their PartnerHub. This company really wants you to grow with them and encourages loyalty with the company through several health benefits and stock options.
good,"-flexible scheduling "
good,"There will always be something to do all day long. No matter what you are assigned to do, there is always an opportunity to do more and learn more. Once you get the basics covered the pace for you will pick up greatly and your day will be filled with new aspects of your job."
good,"working at starbucks was fun, I enjoyed the fast paced environment and my fellow workers, however the advancement process is complicated, its not based off of seniority or if you excel and go above and beyond at your job. They have a set process of completing certain tasks then applying to HQ for the advancement which is rarely given when it should be. also most of their benefits don't start till either at least 6 months of employment but majority start after 1 yr of working and the benefits and pay are not equivalent to how much work we do as even a barista. Their policies also contradict one another, they say they will give a warning for the first offense then termination if they see the warning is not being followed by the employee but yet they say they have a no tolerance policy too, so its very misleading. Training is also not conclusive to working, I had 2 weeks of training then was put onto the floor when training is supposed to last a month. with saying that not all the materials were there either for my training and my trainer left 2 weeks after training me and I was not told from the get go about policies, rules, and expectations. I slaved there from the get go, I was the go to person to ask about covering someones shift or getting more hours and it did not benefit me at all, I worked 12 days straight over 10 hours a day and at multiple locations around north county and on my first day off i was asked to come in and if i did i would have worked 17 days straight, then about a week later i was let go and everything i did and my circumstances outside of work were not"
good,this is the best job for those who wants to gain experience about customer interaction and to gain confidence in yourself. a good place to work especially for those beginners.
good,"My location was extremely small and busy, which provided for a stressful environment, I had covered at others though where the atmosphere was relaxed and inviting.  Pay is generally good but could always be better, they provide raises often though.  Payroll is a struggle like every retail company and it often felt like we were one person short of success."
good,"Starbucks is probably on the better end of customer service jobs. They have high standards for store performance and promote good teamwork. While management style and competence can vary from store to store, which definitely impacts morale, I always felt supported by a great team."
good,Buen trabajo para estudiantes o jovenes que quieren trabajar medio tiempo.
good,"Great time working there, would definitely recommend for students only. Full time positions were not available when i was working there so it was better for students"
good,"A typical day in being a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks would be coming in to open the store and get everything all set up for daily business. Doing the order for supplies for the store, counting the cash in the drawers and so on. In my experience with upper management it seemed like there was a lot of fraternization where those who were below the store manager would never have their voices heard about certain things or issues that were being presented. In my store that I was a the culture was not the best. It seemed very toxic and a lot of people would try to throw others under the bus in order to further themselves. There was no real hard part about the job it was fairly simple as long as you were taught how to do things properly. The most enjoyable part of the job was a few of my coworkers that I had are still friends of mine now."
good,The management works well with your schedule and makes sure you're well adjusted. Everybody works together and helps when needed. The regular customers that come in bring the company to life and make it all worth it.
good,Like working for this company. There is a lack of support for advancement beyond manager.Expectation to be perfect with the lack of up to date technology
good,"I feel like working for Starbucks it helped me with almost every job after it. I am now able to always multitask, give great customer service. I can easily work in a fast pace evnvironment. I enjoyed it and I'll do it again if I can."
good,"Working at Starbucks can vary dramatically based on the store that you are working at and the store manager in charge of scheduling. Overall a fast-paced job that can be very stressful or fun, depending on location and the day."
good,I experienced bullying from one of the shift managers and I asked for more training the lead manager said it would cost too much for her to have an extra trainer.  I did not get espresso bar time and I barely learned drinks because I only had about 4 hours worth of training. The shift manager would specifically pick on me and try to get me in trouble and I didn't do anything according to the other manager .She also was very snoody.  I would never work there again but maybe another location.
good,"We wil call each other as a partner, It is warm for us working here because we as a family . And this company was doing quite well on the benefit, we can have our partner drink, we can have some discount on the merchandise."
good,"This job can be stressful and the location is surprisingly busy, but the staff and management are very friendly and supportive, a great bunch to work with."
good,Really fun place to work. Salary is not enough for everything you do. I believe people who open should get paid alot more than just $10. I never worked an openiing shift but  a lot of my ex-coworkers complained alot about that being their number one problem. We always had an issue with finding someone to open.
good,"- Coffee and tea making recipe"
good,"The Tips helped with college semesters. Great benefits. Friendly co workers. Flexible schedule. Very fast paced, great college benefits know. Apron was provided"
good,"Fast pace environment"
good,It was a very exhausting job as we were a very high traffic cafe/drive thru. Time passed quickly because we were very busy. Partners calling in sick made it very difficult.
good,Working at Starbucks can be stressful. You are on your feet your entire shift and constantly moving around. Working here has definitely pulled me out of my shell because communication with your partners and the customers is the key to a smooth play.
good,"When you live in a dorm and need a part-time job with a relaxed dress code where you can be you, Starbucks is the place. You also will receive tips every week that will help you between checks."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Great benefits, great people, flexible hours. job advancement, friendly customer, great vibes, free drinks, discounts."
good,"A typical day at work was opening up the store and seeing everyones tired faces but me making them happy with a cup of coffee/drink. I learned how to deal with the public, also learned how to make different types of coffee/drinks. Management was pretty easy but just trying to get all your very young employees to actually work was a little more difficult especially since i was young myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was how relaxing it felt to actually come to work and it was a pretty peaceful enviroment."
good,I learned a lot from Starbucks. There's a lot of routines and multitasking. If you love people you'll love this job. Management could have been better. Pay could have been better. Overall not many complaints
good,Loved working for Starbucks.  Disliked the politics involved with promotion opportunities.  The benefits were great.  The pay was very poor unless you were in management.
good,"Being A deaf Partner has it challenges, one of them being not having the manager actual understand Deaf culture, how different we interact with customers than other partners does, how we have conversations with customers."
good,"Sometimes it would be stressful, and other times it was fun. Overall, I gained a lot of experience in the customer service industry. My manager changed so often, I had a good manager and a bad manager at one point."
good,Good company for upper part time workers who get around 25-30 hours anything above that gets a little crazy and super stressful. They come out with way to many new things and don’t set up their employees to succeed. They keep adding new things and never take any old stuff away therefore crowding the store and making it impossible to organize and keep inventory
good,"I love my job. I do. However, the pay is hardly enough to cover even the basic of needs when living on your own. Therefore, a second job is almost mandatory."
good,"to be a barista you really need to have a strong work ethic, and a positive mind set. customers can come at you really rude but you have to know how to handle it and keep them happy , great customer serivce ."
good,"Worked with some great people which made the fast pace work for all of us,able to make own schedule with flexibility. The company offers a free degree through ASU."
good,"Starbucks encourages a strong teamwork environment and for the most part, partners do have and build upon a solid foundation for teamwork. Starbucks also truly values their Customer's experience at each store."
good,The baristas and mangers are fun to be around as they make each day light. It can be difficult to work with the public but for the most part the customers are pretty cool as well.
good,"starbucks is a fast paced and exciting environment. there is always something to do and everyday brings new challenges, new opportunities, new lessons and new friends. you have a strong team around you at all times and everyone is ready to jump in to help whenever, whatever."
good,I worked at a Starbucks inside a Tom Thumb so it  was usually pretty slow but here and there we would get a rush. Its a fun work environment and all my coworkers were kind people. The hardest at first was tying to memorize all the drinks vut after awhile you get it down and also dealing with rude customers but thats anywhere if you work customer service.
good,"The best part is the people that you get to work with and the customers that you get to meet. I have met lifelong friends from both sides of the counter. If you enjoy people, this job is for you! it was one of the best jobs I ever had. Yes, there were hard days sometimes, but the good days definitely out weighed the bad."
good,"Working here is fast paced but the training methods are very detailed and precise, which will help a lot when working in this setting. I worked at the Target Starbucks so its a bit different, I worked mostly by myself which sometimes was fine if it was slow but being busy and alone can be very hard. the corporate Starbucks are better from my understanding. Managers came and went but my last one was very hard working and dedicated. Cool thing about working here is all the people you will meet and get to know. That's how I got my next job is by meeting the manager at Starbucks and having conversation."
good,"I worked at Starbucks in Edmonton, Alberta for over years. I've learned how to make coffee at the first step and then memorized quickly. I remember when I was age of 20, Starbucks was my first job. Those were flexible about my hours and it was easy to hire people to shift."
good,"Very Corporate, "
good,"There's a long list of the unethical decisions my managers made at my and other barista's expenses while I was working for the company, and my attempts to climb the chain of command to have the issues addressed were not only dismissed, but used against me to paint me as insubordinate when I tried to reapply to a different location. Insubordination for calling a manager on their wrong-doings to their superior, after discussing the issue with them first and giving them a 30 day benefit of the doubt to change. Ethical is not an adjective I would use to describe the Starbucks I worked for."
good,"A normal work day would have slower times and peak hours. During the slow time you're still rushing around trying to prepare for peak or get caught up after peak. There is literally always something to do. This job is go-go-go all day long, which is good or bad depending on you. It was a fun job while I had it, though I don't believe Baristas are paid enough. I truly believe this is more than a minimum wage job, I think about $12 an hour would be fair, especially given Salem's cost of living. There is room for advancing to a Shift Supervisor at which point you're almost guaranteed 35-40 hours per week, unlike the approx 24 you get as a barista, and the pay is about $3/hour more (min wage right now is 10.25). You have paid sick leave that you accrue until 60 hours--depending on how long you've been there, it increases with time--a matching 401(k) up to 5%, and stock options. Higher level employees are given paid vacation. The hardest part of the job is having customers yell at you or complain about or to you about the service, price of coffee, wait times, blah blah. You stand there and take it, no matter how awful they are. The nicest part of the job is its flexibility. If you're a student, this is wonderful. Oh, tips are shared and paid out once a week. It's a miniature pay day. Oh and pay day is twice a month."
good,I am currently working at a location for starbucks and I am very happy with the management and employees. I transferred from another state and everyone was very welcoming and nice. I have learned many drinks and how to keep the customers happy. The enjoyable part of my job is getting to know all my regulars that come through everyday.
good,"Most customers are nice, coworkers are great, but management could use some work. They work with your schedule and are flexible, but it is clear management does not care about the employees."
good,"This job is a great place for an entry level job. It has many opportunities for upwards mobility, and the pay is good in comparison to other jobs. The benefits you receive are rivaled by none in similar fields, and over all you gain a lot of experience working here. I happened to be at one of the highest volume stores in my district, so it is fast paced and stressful.  That fast pace allows you to gain skills in customer service, making quick decisions and learning how to back those decisions, and having patience for both coworkers and the business at hand."
good,"Could use with more employees, better pay, actual break times (sometimes given a 10 minute break, lunches are only 30 minutes), could do with more shift managers."
good,Great for students. Paid tuition and health care. Flexible hours and job security with a easy transfer system in place. Atmosphere in work place is always welcoming.
good,"Always a fun environment to be in. Kind of a thank less job, but we did it for the environment and fun of it! Most shops have their regulars and it is fun to have those repeat clients."
good,"Starbucks leaves little room for advancement, the compensation is very minimal, and the benefits are not all they are cracked up to be. However, working at Starbucks was a great experience for me. I learned about working in a team setting, everyone treats each other like family, and I gained more customer service experience than I have in any other role. It is a fun job, not a career."
good,"Learn social skills and customer relations, multi-tasking, register skills, personable interactions "
good,"Like all customer service jobs, Starbucks can be frustrating, but I thoroughly enjoy my job. Every store is different, though. I’d recommend you sit at the location you intend to work for for a couple of hours and watch how the employees and managers interact before seeking employment with that location. Every store has its own problems, but some are easier to deal with than others, that’s what you should be looking for."
good,"The job is often hectic, and it can take months to really begin to feel comfortable in what you do. Provided enough labor is given to anyone's given store, you'll probably find yourself working with friends you intend on keeping forever!"
good,A typical day at Starbucks means doing many different jobs. I could be interacting with people at the register or cleaning the floors or taking inventory or making drinks all in the same day. The hardest part of the job is balancing the work with human connection and making those connections solid. What I like about my job is the connection I get with my coworkers and customers.
good,"Great place for upbeat people, you can easily bring in regulars with the right attitude. You can get several breaks in an 8 hour shift, plus lunch markouts. The discounts are pretty neat too."
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun in the mornings before 11am when the store was steady paced and the floor fully staffed. But after 11am the early shift would leave but no one would be in to replace the lost staff until 3 or 4 so it would be a mess, chaotic and exhausting. Amazing benefits, but when asked why there were no work based raises it was ""because we have such amazing benefits"" like no I need to pay my bills, Debra lol. I had a great manager and great coworkers some that have stuck around long after leaving. Including my manager-now district manager I still meet up with! "
good,It is important to work fast and listen to the customer. Delivering a good customer service its going to make the customer feel welcomed. Diversity is one of the strengths of the company.
good,Working in this company taught me how to work as a team member in a fast paced environment. I also learned how to provide very good customer service .
good,"It's always very busy, not much support from your own team,and very stressful and high-paced overall. If you work good under pressure and in a fast-paced environment, then Starbucks is for you."
good,"To be honest, the whole starbucks overly-niceness is borderline stepford wives-ish for the more fast-paced people, but if you look at the entirety of the picture, a smile while handed your wake-up beverage from a knowledgeable staff may have more effects on the outcome of our day’s than we would give it credit for. It definitely has proven that it is something this world could not live without, considering the rate of growth of the company as a whole. After undergoing their training, I see how this kind of customer-first culture is meshed repeatedly in the modules. And though overly simplified to the point of annoyance at times, seeing that this is the soul of a huge company sheds light on why it has attracted and maintained those “partners” who provide the same quirkiness that would normalize the weirdest drink requests. My highest respect for creating connections through realizing individualities."
good,"A typical day at work can become stressful, but manageable. I learned that providing a positive working environment for everyone, such as partners and customers, increases productivity, accuracy, and beneficial feedback. Management becomes inconsistent when it comes to training their partners. Not all partners, whether they are new hires or partners that have worked for a year or more, have the knowledge of basic training that new hires  are required to complete. Some partners have a difficult time breaking old habits that are not up to Starbucks standards. Workplace culture revolves around teamwork. Without teamwork, tasks become more difficult to achieve, due to stress levels and workload. The hardest part of the job is achieving satisfaction. Whether satisfaction is achieved with the customers, partners, or self. The most enjoyable part of the job is the day-to-day interactions with the customers and partners. Overall, Starbucks receives four stars because the company has taught me more than I could hope for but, the stressors that rose could have been avoided with consistent management on knowledge and performance, throughout the company."
good,"A typical work day was pretty much the same, make drinks, prep food, clean, customer service, etc. I learned a lot about coffee, food pairing, working quickly but efficiently, and customer service. Managment isn't the best because they're not very understanding and will make their employees carry their load if you let them. The culture is great there are lots of opportunities and benefits. The hardest part of the job is working holidays and training. The most enjoyable part is getting to know people and making/serving coffee (oh, and the discounts and free meal/shift)!"
good,Starbucks needs to go back to when it paid out 20-25% labor cost instead of 16-17%. It's wearing down the staff too fast and it doesn't allow for the kind of culture is has provided in the past and could be again.
good,Can be fun and exciting. Also can be stressful and unrewarding. Great balance for those needing a schedule to work for you. Pay is better than most fast food.
good,"A empresa preza, desde o início, um bom treinamento para os funcionários se sentirem bem no ambiente de trabalho, aumentando e mantendo a auto estima sempre que possível e buscando evoluir sempre."
good,"Trabajo para estudiantes es buen empleo aprendes a valorar cada momento en la empresa, hacuendo de cada momento algo especial"
good,I didn't work for the main company Starbucks. I worked for Starbucks inside target so some of it is different than a free standing. Overall I liked being a barista. The only downside was the management of target. They sort of treat you like you aren't part of the store.
good,"Starbucks really has its moments of memorable experiences good and bad, but they can truly help shape you as a person in any workforce. If you work well in a team then you'll work well here. Your growth depends on how well you respond to your team and to your customers. It is fun to be a barista and to want to perfect a craft. Not a lot of opportunities come like this. Some take being a barista as a hobby but it is definitely a profession and demands the eye of attention to make quality beverages. The job itself is relatively easy but its subjective to what a barista is capable of. Large quantities of people can throw off a baristas rhythm but so can one slightly complicated order in an empty room."
good,"the job is very face paced and can be a little stressful at times. you need to be good with people and handling all kinds of customers. The job itself can get a little boring, but your regulars and your coworkers can make the job worthwhile."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is being on your feet all day, constantly doing something, working through those long lines during rush hours that come and go, which makes the day go by fast. I enjoyed the people I've worked with and enjoyed learning how to make different drinks. The hardest part of the job was learning the flow and how to remember what all goes into the different drinks, but that comes with time and practice. Overall, this is definitely a fun place to work at!"
good,"I only worked there for a few months, but it was a cool work environment while I was there. Intending to apply again in the near future. I have nothing else to say about it really."
good,"Enjoyed the job, however, they had a trend of promising promotions only to hire outside the company instead. Dissapointing. Many people work at Starbucks because of their love for the culture, so it would be better to see more organic growth."
good,"I love working for Starbucks, they have great company policies, but I will say it is hard to advance beyond your starting position unless it is absolutely necessary for the company to promote from within. A wonderful place to learn how to be excellent at customer service, and the benefits are unlike any other."
good,Ich habe sehr gerne für Starbucks gearbeitet ...Jeder Zeit Wieder :-)
good,"Working at Starbucks has been fantastic as this was a job I felt comfortable and confident in. The store itself faces little conflicts here and there, but nothing that the manager or workers can not fix. The hardest part of the job would be the opening shifts, but with enough practice, one can handle being a barista just fine. One thing about this place is the fast-paced work environment it is known for. It was difficult to transition to, but not impossible, within time and patience co-workers, it became easy to become comfortable with the environment."
good,"Typical work day is fairly busy. More so in the Morning/early afternoon. I learned a lot about coffee and related items. Management was great. However, I did not feel that there was much room for growth."
good,"A typical day at work was exciting and always went by quickly often with bumps in the road but we had a really good team that worked well together. I learned how to make almost all of the drinks, how to have even better customer service than I had before, how to work quickly and pretty fast while still being efficient, etc. My manager and the shift leads were always great, and went the extra mile to help me out when I first started, they always supported me and saw the potential I had so they were patient with me. Customers tended to get pretty mad if I couldn't hear them because it was too loud, or didn't help them quickly enough so that was probably the hardest part of the job. I think the most enjoyable part was the crew I got to work with, we all worked really well together, everyone worked extremely hard and helped the others if someone got behind or needed to catch up on their work."
good,I really enjoyed my time at starbucks because they were very flexible with my schedule as a college student. I was working 20-30 hours a week and a full time student. It helped me make the money I needed for school.
good,"Typical opening shift, set up all the coffees and pastry case. Interact with the customers and make coffee or preparing the food. Hardest part is when the customer does not appreciate how fast you have to go to make their drinks."
good,I very much enjoyed the atmosphere at every starbucks i worked for although I chose to leave because I could not afford a single bedroom apartment for $10.50/hr.
good,"lack of training "
good,"Store managers will make or break your experience in this company. I had worked with some wonderful leaders, but also FOR some  manipulative... not pleasant individuals. It’s hit or miss, just trust your gut and know that you CAN transfer out to a different store as long as you are in good standing."
good,"I love the job itself; making the drinks and preparing the pastries. Communicating and getting to know your customers was very interesting and fun; however, at the store I worked in management was not organized and there was a lot of favoritism as far as which employees get more hours. The easiest part i believe was learning the recipes for all the different beverages. The hardest part was getting management to address situations that arise in a proper manner if at all."
good,"Follow Routine Consitantly. Connect with Customers. "
good,"The Starbucks I worked at had a high turnover rate due tohiring students from the university down the street. They were super great about accommodating school schedules but were also very understaffed so they were always trying to get more experienced staff to come in more often. Lots of good benefits though, such as free drinks every shift and a free pound of coffee every week. Also, they did provide benefits to people who worked more than 20 hours a week and then provided counselling and other smaller benefits to employees who worked less than 20 hours. It can be a very high paced, stressful job, especially if other staff aren't trained well, but, overall, a positive experience."
good,"This was a great job for a high schooler because I could work part-time during the school year, and I was paid much better than I would be at other places."
good,"Coffee and Customers are everything. Cool discounts on coffee and beverages. Culture is chill. Hardest part is when you get a rush of people and you have to hustle, customers can be quite picky about their coffee"
good,"Working one to one to maintain the well known Starbucks brand was both wonderful, but sometimes incredibly busy. Never a moment twiddling thumbs. There are many loyal customers to every store and being friendly will always guarantee a smile back."
good,"Starbucks was a fast paced experience most days. Whenever there is a rush you need to be all on and focused, but when the rush slows and you have a minute to catch your breath, it is a fun time with good people. They take pride in the quality of their drinks, and when you know that you have made a good quality drink, you feel that pride. All in all a good place to work!"
good,"A typical day at work for me involves working with an amazing team of baristas, it is a very fast paced environment so communication is a must. Once you have a team of people who are on the same page the day runs smoothly. It is important to have strong leadership in the store as I have seen both the good and the bad. Starbucks is committed to creating a great environment for both the customers and the partners, very inclusive and supportive. The hardest part of the job is the execution of duties, I find at times there is a lot of pressure from upper management to perform at an elevated standard. It is difficult if you are not someone who excels in environments with a lot of pressure but I enjoy a challenge so it has actually kept me really involved in the company and looking forward to doing better than yesterday everyday I go to work. As a barista the hours are less than desirable but there is more security as a shift supervisor. However there are times where you may be scheduled outside of your availability or your manager may contact you outside of work or require you to be available for business related issues on social media."
good,It was a good job. I liked it.  I am still friends with many of my coworkers.  I liked it.  It was a good job.  I liked it.  I worked in college.  Free drinks there!
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. They paid really well for Management compared to a lot of retail stores. Working here taught me a lot about managing a business, budgets, profit and loss statements, and managing people."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Starbucks. I have learned a lot about people and how to treat others. I have learned how to deal with different situations, good or bad."
good,Good place for good benefits and developing skills in life and at work. Most stores run ethically however once in a while you’ll have a rogue manager doing as he or she pleases and creates a poor work environment.
good,"Career advancement is possible and starting pay is rising rapidly. Raises every year, benefit opportunities yearly, friendly staff, discounts. Flexible scheduling."
good,Was a part time partner while in college. I enjoyed my time with the company as a whole. The job was enjoyable and my coworkers were great. My only complaint was our store manager was awful. We had regular staffing issues a d she loved gossip and drama. Having said that Starbucks did remove her from her position after I had left.
good,Could use work on seeing who is better for the job. Other than that it was a great place to work for me. I work there for more than 6 years and I had a blast most of my time there.
good,Room for career advancement and same job no matter what store or state you transfer to. Great benefits and college reimbursement. Tips are around 1 dollar per hour
good,"Very fast paced, can be very stressful at times. Feels like there is no upward mobility in terms of career progression. Discounts and benefits were good, and management was decent, and was definitely very focused on customer support and satisfaction."
good,"good atomsphere , love the regulars, great benifits , if you can get the hours good pay . great timers to be had if you get a good management staff!!!"
good,"This is a really fun job if you like the work environment. My first store was great, I loved it, I would work 40 hours a week and it was a fantastic job. My second store, I did not like the manager and the employees were fine but not good enough to make me want to stay."
good,"This job got me through college. Laid back management, really focuses on customer service."
good,"Flexible scheduling, short shifts. I was fortunate to have nice coworkers and managers. Pay was very low, but if you take advantage of all the benefits they offer, it might be worth it. Dealing with Starbucks customers is a whole nother task in and of itself..."
good,Quick paced pretty much all day except for the noon to around 2pm window. I learned better customer service. I can't really complain about management but I suppose its never really perfect. There were a few issues here an there bu nothing major.
good,"Each store is different and my store had a manager who managed two stores. She was not good at her job, but that gave us the opportunity to do what we wanted in a stress free environment when we weren't short staffed during peak hours. Benefits were cool and pay was decent. overall pick a store that has friendly people since you see them all the time. Starbucks hires and promotes personality and not hard workers."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, they are very friendly, training is top notch. The benefits are amazing for anyone in school or starting out, however the hourly pay just isn't enough to live on."
good,My days were very routine because I was a closing supervisor. I learned how to pull through many different stressful situations but managed to still have fun with both my partners and customers. I would say the hard part is that not everyone you work with has the same work ethic. I very much enjoyed making connections with my customers and learning about one another.
good,"I worked for Children's Hospital Starbucks. It was a okay job, with great benefits. There was also room to advance to other areas of the hospital. It was a rewarding experience at times."
good,"Very hard to adjust to at first, but once you get down each work station and can flex with the team you have, gets a lot easier. Can be pretty fun with the right group of people, or slightly stressful on off days. If your not a people-person, probably not a job for you. Always remember to smile and have fun :)"
good,"Starbucks is a stepping stone, for kids trying to get through college. There's a fast pace, and depending on your team, a good shift. It's easy work, making coffee."
good,Learned to take initiative in work situations.  Learned to be more comfortable with cleaning after the tools and foods that we used to prepare.  Comfortable and respectful colleague setting.
good,Starbucks was one of the best first work moves I could've made. They really love their employees and  in most stores and aim to nurture the human spirit .
good,"A typical day is putting the customer first, greeting them with a smile and helping them with their order and maybe a listening ear if they need to talk.  There are also all the other duties that need to be done in order to make that happen and that would depend on the position you are in at the time, Cafe, Drive Thru, Bar or Customer Support."
good,"My Starbucks team is like a second family to me. I enjoy talking with my regulars, both old and new. Joking with the baristas and other Shifts is always a fun way to pass the time, even during rushes."
good,"I absolutely LOVE this company, which is why it pains me to say that they do take advantage of their employees and work them to the absolute brim, continuously reminding them they are replaceable along the way."
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace and team camaraderie. Management was good at keeping an orderly and efficient work environment. Customer service was a priority, as was cleanliness."
good,"I have always enjoyed the team and community aspect, the only downfall can be rude customers. It also really depends on the specific location, some stores are just better to work at than others."
good,"Starbucks has been an amazing place to work while I was in school. It provided me with the opportunity to have a flexible schedule, and during hard times (medically) they went above and beyond to support me when I needed it."
good,my team was great and always went above and beyond to make the store was organized and customers were happy. if i ever needed a barista to work a little longer they stood without hesitation.
good,"Times are God, but sometimes we didnt have the cew to make the best times possible. And upper management doesnt see what has to be dealt with on daily basis. There are guest variables that drive time and service scores that are out of employee hands"
good,I have learned that you can have fun at work and that you can meet people from all walks of life. Starbucks provided so many opportunities to advance and better my skills as a barista.
good,"It is fun and interesting, met great people and learned new things. I also love my manager. I liked that they offer vacations, sick days, and health insurance."
good,Starbucks is a very positive and welcoming space and makes working there much more enjoyable. Generally shifts are very busy and fast paced. The hardest part of the job is definitely spelling names correctly.
good,I had a great time with the company however I don't think that I would want to work at the same store that I was at previously.  Management was cut-throat and terrible.  Different things that added up to staining my entire experience as a worker.  Great benefits and if you do move up then your doing well for yourself.
good,"Starbucks was a great experience for a part time job. I enjoyed working in the coffee shop, speaking with the regulars, and learning how to make all of the espresso drinks."
good,"Best place  to learn how to make a good coffee, friendly environment, a lot of options to stay and improve your skills. Good partners with good vibes."
good,"great for going to school, I don't know why  you're asking this-I have YEARS of other employment that you/re NOT asking about! Why don't you ask about some of the others?"
good,"It is nice meeting new people and getting to know regulars, you'll soon find yourself having your favorites or even becoming fairly close to a few and it all starts with getting to know their drink and their name. It is very fast paced especially when you work peak, which is when we have waves of people coming in to get their coffee or tea of the day, some days are better than others, but from my experience I have had very helpful coworkers who are incredible team players and quite innovative when necessary."
good,"Working in a kiosk was most likely the worst part about this job, being that you are confined in a tight space with a line literally across the mall. However, the shift supervisors and fellow baristas are always looking out for one another and helping each other as much as possible."
good,"A typical day you go in and the shift assigns you a position, sometimes it would change, most of the time that's what you do for your entire shift."
good,"If you like working somewhere were there is always something to do Starbucks is the perfect place! There is always something to do from handcrafting drinks, to restocking or simply helping a costumer find their perfect drink! the most enjoyable part is definitely hand crafting the drinks it makes working there go by fast because you're always inna hurry to get the drink out but also make sure it is there best drink of the day. However, this is also the hardest part about working at Starbucks. Memorizing the drinks and having to make them fasts that there shots don't sit for too long or so your customers aren't waiting in line for long makes the job a little stressful."
good,This Starbucks was my first job and I had so much fun there and learned a lot of skills. I wish licensed store were able to also have partner numbers.
good,"Starbucks was a fantastic first job that increased my skills in working in conjunction with other employees, a time-sensitive and a fast-paced environment."
good,"I actually really loved working at Starbucks. It was a vary fast paced environment which made the days go by fast. Hard work that made me feel fulfilled at the end of the day. I loved building customer relationships and working at the bar. This isn't a position I could imagine as a life long job though. It is hard work for little pay. The benefits are amazing, but don't help much if you can't pay your bills!"
good,"Short shifts are dope! Long shifts can get stressful! Customers are picky and you will hate the secret menu very much but coworkers make things fun! My manager was uptight about deep cleanings and sometimes I wanted to walk out of my shift but, honestly, he was one of the best people to work for. We had a great rating from QASA (Starbucks' inspectors) and were the example store for our district. Fun times!"
good,"It was a very busy place. If you cannot work under pressure, do not work here. Free drinks on the clock, free food item once per shift and a free item like coffee or tea weekly."
good,"A  typical day at Starbucks requires a barista to think fast, act quickly and make sure that each customer is satisfied with their orders by any means. Starbucks is a great introductory job for learning  good customer service, and  obtaining money handling skills. Starbucks has also taught me about how to quickly utilize my critical thinking skills to solve customer issues."
good,"It's a hard job with grumpy employees and customers alike, but if you need something that will take care of you for a year or so this is a good option. The health benefits and 401k were huge perks that almost made the 3:30am alarm clock worth it."
good,"Day at work either goes fast or slow depending on amount of customers. You'll learn how to multitask. Shift supervisors were cool, store manager was very by-the-book. Music can feel sleepy, but you get used to it."
good,Great fast paced environment that allows you to make some extra money and learn cool drinks all while having fun while doing your job. Loved my coworkers and got to meet all kinds of celebs. Ps some ppl dnt play about their drinks so make sure you listen and make it just how they want it.
good,Was a great blessing for me met many great people while learning new things about coffee culture. The experiences you'll have working for this company teaches you allot when transferring over to other professions of customer service hospitality.
good,"fast paced job, always moving and good pay. only thing is you are always working more than being at home. not so good if you have kids and a family you never really see them because your always working. they need better shifts or at least give 2 days off not just one especially when your working 12 hour shifts for 6 days. other than that its a good job I would go back just for the benefits and pay."
good,"starbucks is a very flexible work place, especially for those who are in school like I was. It has lots of advancement opportunities, and makes sure every employee is valued and heard."
good,Teaches you how to deal with unhappy people and work in stressful situations. I really enjoyed this job while I was still in school. I think it teaches great work ethic to employees.
good,"Work was fast paced, it never got boring. I learned how to work under stressful situations and still remain calm. The environment was very inviting and friendly."
good,"I felt working with Starbucks was a fantastic work experience to help develop my customer service skills and understanding of how many changes a company can constantly go through. My adaptability has increased and my patience with others, and myself has also grown. The most difficult situation of the job was management and getting shifts covered."
good,"The work is fast paced, and the hours are crazy, but other than that I have no major complaints. I am not planning on spending my life in the service industry so I had no intention of staying but it made a decent speed bump during college."
good,My time at Starbucks was well spent. difficult at times but overall there was good communication between managers and the store ran smoothly. upper management needed better communication and seemed to be spread thin between all their stores.
good,"Starbucks, at the retail level, fosters a workplace environment where collaboration and independence are key characteristics of the successful functionality of the day to day operations. Personal initiative to perform tasks along with a strong sense of urgency is required to contribute to the success in this environment."
good,I enjoyed working there. Its was fun most of the time but the pay was rather low and eventually led me to find another job. but the people who worked there were great. Sometimes there was alot of work but that can be said of any job.
good,"Starbucks overall is a great company and I would always recommend it, the only flaw is that most partners are not the nicest to each other. Sometimes it can become a toxic environment."
good,They offer opportunities for benefits working part time and promote their partners to develop while they are working there. You are required to have a personal development profile to determine what your strengths and weaknesses are. This helps build you as a partner and a future professional.
good,I liked my co workers and many of the regulars. Cash register and making drinks each have their own monotonous challenges but all in all are very easy to catch onto and enjoy.
good,Can be hard work dependant on store. More important who your working with. Get paid full adult wage under 18 plus benefits if in a company store. Late release rota hard to plan life.
good,"This was a great company to work for. The pay was fair, and the benefits far beyond with I would have expected. Its a fast passed and fun work environment"
good,"I learned a lot about coffee, and I was able to work in a fast-paced environment while providing excellent service. I met a wide variety of different people and it brought me life-long friends."
good,"A typical day at work, depending on the time of day consists of a consistent stream of customers. Therefore, while working as a barista, you receive little breaks in between rush periods. Ive learned how to work in a cohesive team, multitask, think on my feet,  proper customer service, problem solving, and how to make drinks of course."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service and how to multi task. My specific manager was a bit unpredictable and flighty, but she was replaced by someone more stable. They do create a safe environment for you to work. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult people and having to give in to their demands. And sometimes I would be scheduled the night shift and the morning shift the next day with just 8 hours in between. It was rewarding though making drinks for kind people."
good,"Fairly high volume, management was good, the hardest part of the job was the quick pace during high volume periods. the most enjoyable part was learning about the coffee."
good,if you like fast passe high energy and people you will like this job. i had a lot of fun. my co-works became my family and my customers became my friends. also very flexible hours.
good,"I started out as a part time barista for about 5 months before being promoted to a shift lead. The job was very fast paced, and could be overwhelming at times. But working with a great group of friends, and running on free coffee made it fun and worth it."
good,"- It is very fast-paced and requires adaptation to every situation"
good,starbucks is a fun interactive workplace that often gets busy but is always productive. teamwork is a big role becuase weall somehow rely on each other
good,"Es una plataforma para desarrollarte muchisimo, ya que los partners son muy amistosos y hacen un dia super ameno.."
good,"Sadly we were laid off, due to being a franchise chain under corporate guidance, a wonderful experience and absolutely loved my boss! She inspired me to do many management challenges down the road."
good,Starbucks was a good place to work. The staff were like my family. Regular customers were great. Was a very fair place to work. I would say finishing at 11pm and then starting at 6:15 the next morning was not good for morale at all.
good,Overall it was a nice job. It didn't pay as much as it could. However they do have really good benefits for part and full time employees. The dress code was very casual.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for anyone who enjoys customer interaction and learning something new. Lots of hard work and focus are needed to advance at a high level in Starbucks
good,"As a whole, Starbucks takes pretty good care of its employees. Smaller, day-to-day conditions vary at each location. It's easy to move up from barista to shift supervisor, but there is next to no advancement beyond that. Responsibilities handed to shift supervisors do not always match up to pay given."
good,Starbucks was a great place to be a store manager. I was able to work closely with my staff and help my staff develop the necessary skills to excel in customer service. They have a great training program and as stated is a fun environment to be a part of.
good,Starbucks was an experience i will carry with me for life. The team of people i worked with motivated and cultivated an atmosphere of success and enjoyment.
good,"It was honestly one of the best jobs I had, the training was superb and the culture was really exciting. I worked the early morning shift and it was very busy. The hardest part was learning all of the different drinks by memory. The most enjoyable part was watching everybody do their part and help each other to run a shift."
good,"Starbucks is great at providing nice benefit packages for employees and offers many perks. "
good,"While it is very hard for me to earn a living and pay my bills working for Starbucks, I find the work challenging in a good way, there is lots to learn and always room for growth within the company. It is very fast paced which I enjoy, and there is satisfaction in creating someone's drink for them."
good,"I enjoyed my time at my Starbucks location, I very much appreciated the fast-paced work environment and customer interaction, as well as my family of co-workers whom all helped out one another as much a possible."
good,Always be fast no matter what it is you are doing. The expresso dies so you always are moving quickly. I would come in and they would put me at one of 5 places and I had usually always been at hot bar. Basically you just have to be fast and do it in the right order or people get really upset also know you need to memorize 500 drinks.
good,Starbucks was a nice temporary job. It was a fast paced environment and a cool learning experience. I feel that it doesn't pay enough and I wouldn't want a career at a store. I'd rather work for corporate.
good,"Fun, temporary workplace. Not a great career spot. Perfect for University students. The atmosphere helps makes friends and the flexibility is great, but there's too many company politics that make a career and advancement past Store Manager difficult."
good,Amazing team to work with but very demanding shift patterns at times due to budget restrictions. This meant every member of staff was stretched to work beyond capacity regularly.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks involves various tasks, from cleaning or warming food to working register or making drinks. Chances are you'll do all of these throughout the day, and likely more. It's a fast paced environment where youll constantly improve your skills and meet a huge number of people for a few moments at a time. A well flowing day can feel like a huge accomplishment, but by the same token if the day is rocky it can cause a lot of issues and once the rhythm of the store is thrown off the rest of the day can feel like you're trying to catch up the entire time. Overall If you're confident you want to work hard in a fast paced environment starbucks can be a great place to work, although there's not a lot of chances for advancement beyond shift supervisor."
good,"No more information available - due to discretion, I do not wish disclose any more information about working for the company. My professional view remains positive"
good,"Flexible work schedule and hours, positions vary from part-time to full-time."
good,"Starting as a Barista and learning how to make a perfect latte, within a few months my hard work was acknowledged with a promotion to Shift Leader. I used my customer service savvy in combination with a friendly coaching approach to help my colleagues make every customer's day great while fulfilling the administrative and financial responsibilities that also come with the role."
good,come into work start brewing coffee set up displays restock inventory and continue the day replenishing stock. take customer orders at register and drive thru.
good,"Starbucks is very fun environment to work in. It is a very fast paced job that requires you to be on your toes. People at my Starbucks are very friendly and fun to work with, but there is a high employee turnover rate since it is in the middle of a college campus, so if you make friends you most likely will not work with them for very long."
good,"- encounter rude customers "
good,"you get to meet new people everyday and get a lot of usuals "
good,"Opening store requires one to make sure that all back ups are made for when morning rush begins, stocks what is needed such as breakfast sandwiches, cups, lids, condiments, milk crafts...etc. Learned that time management is a key role in operating a store of high volume customers. Overall, workplace has been fun for me when working with my fellow partners and yet at times we want to strangle each other. I always tend to leave my shift with communicating to my fellow partners how much I appreciate what they have done during a shift. Acknowledge that they did an amazing job on such a busy day overall. It shows empathy and appreciation for what they do and demonstrates that in the end we have one another to get us through the hard times. That is what makes working at Starbucks a fun atmosphere. We tend to remind each other that all we do is coffee. Yet that does not mean it is not a demanding job showing up to work on time and being ready to work non stop possibly for a couple of hours."
good,"The hardest part of working there for me is waking up at 3:30 am... after that, I'm in full routine and the morning rush helps make the day go by fast."
good,"Working at starbucks was stressful. When in a high paced environment in a high rated store it went by pretty quickly. Seeing the regular customers  made the days better, once they see your smiley face holding out their coffee, it makes your day, and their day better."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with colleagues and customers. A typical day at work can range from constantly busy to having some quiet moments in the store. Hardest part of the job would be handling unreasonable customers. Starbucks has good benefits for their staff. Managers tend to try to follow the availability you provide them with to ensure work/life balance.
good,"Starbucks is an amazing job. It can be stressful and isn't for everyone, but its extremely rewarding. A big role is fellow partners and management. A poor manager can make this job very miserable, but the right can make this job feel very rewarding."
good,"Great job if you have limited responsibilities and can afford lower-scale pay with good flexibility and amazing benefits (At only 20hrs a week)."
good,"If you want a normal, part-time job where you don't need to try particularly hard, you can still work at Starbucks no problem."
good,"All Starbucks employees (""partners"") can pick up shifts at other stores. I have worked at four different stores total, and I've worked multiple shifts at each store."
good,The job is really fast paced but starbucks is a great company to work for and the people i worked with were always kind and helpful. One hard thing about the job is trying to not get flustered when you get slammed with drinks. If you just stay relaxed and focused its easy to get through big rushes of people.
good,"Good benefits, fair pay, and now the ability to accumulate PTO and paid sick time. Periodic raises. Management is mostly communicative. Competition to advance is high. Company culture is diverse and you are encouraged to learn more about coffee and how the company sources/benefits the farms. Overall generally an enjoyable work experience. Company provides many opportunities and resources/tools for professional and self-growth, as well as how to operate a store. The work environment teaches you how to manage time, priorities, and stress."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks and discovered the potential to grow within the company."
good,"Good temporary job, very social and good money for what it is.  Worked with great people!  Manager was awesome, so were other young employees.  Regular customers were great too!"
good,Pretty decent place the vibe is good i had the pleasure of working on a campus *insert sarcasm* most students were jerks but a lot were cool. pay could be better and the Gm was pretty young and new so that was challenging but you learn a lot about coffee and get excellent coffee benefits like free ground coffee weekly or free drinks durning shifts ..that was my favorite lol in all its a pretty decent company.
good,"Tres bon environnement de travail, equipe dynamique."
good,"While working at Starbucks I got to really learn hands on what it is like to be in customer service. I got to learn the intensity of working the floor, drive thru and front register. All of that lead me to be the hard working and successful employee that I am today! I also got the opportunity to train other Baristas and earn a raise!"
good,"good job while in school , enjoyed the benefits , and the co workers  . Early mornings went by fast , the discount on coffee was worth it and amazing benefits"
good,I felt that its a good overall work place. The people can be very supportive when your really busy and struggling. There was somethings i felt like i shouldve been paid for that wasnt my responsibility. but at the end of the day it had to be done and someone had to do it.
good,"Starbucks employees are expected to be able to cross-train on creating hand-crafted beverages, handling cash and card at a register, handling food, taking customer orders on a Point of Sale system, taking orders over a drive-thru headset, and cleaning the entire store, all while upholding exemplary customer service. The workplace can be very fast-paced and often stressful, but you will never be bored. Starbucks partners are usually very open to creating strong bonds with their teammates, and rarely have a met a partner who wasn't passionate about their work in one way or another, whether it be connecting with co-workers and customers, making beverages, or keeping up with the cleanliness of the store, etc. The Starbucks workplace, in itself, is kind of like its own little community, where we're all supportive of each other, Starbucks also participates in many community projects and there are opportunities for volunteering."
good,I like to work here because the enviroment with customer and also with management team . Easy learn something new with them . Do something extraodinary with challenging enviroment .
good,great place to work as long as you have a great manager! easy to get involved with the company and the community. most enjoyable part about working for Starbucks is the customers who become like your family.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company and met great people. The hours are long but go by quickly because of how busy it gets. Great perks and compensation.
good,"Low hourly pay rates, but great skill development opportunities. Ability to learn basic management/operations and customer skills. Great benefits too."
good,"Good place to start and flexible with your hours , would recommend to anyone who wants something different than sitting around all day, they are very good with the workers and everyone is treated equally"
good,"I loved working there, it was in a target so it was a little different. I loved getting to try all the drinks and making honest recommendations. I liked actually creating the drinks for someone. It did get busy but when i was working with the right people we were able to get through the line super fast. must be able to multitask, learn quickly, be fast passed but also accurate and clean."
good,"My store was pretty awesome. I had lots of fun working there. My coworkers were all amazing, I made lots of friends during my time there. The environment was pleasing. A lot of our regular customers became good friends of mine and I still occasionally stop by to say hi to everyone. I would definitely recommend this job to a friend."
good,"Very good company when it is come to training, working hours, salary pay. Company has a very strong system in place & lot to learn for your own career. Highly recommended my company for beginners & other positions as they pay attractive salary for external recruitment."
good,"Working at Starbucks helped me to develop confidence and character. Multitasking is something I quickly mastered here. I learned to love helping people. I learned how to deal with tough ones too. I learned a lot about managing a business and handling inventory as well as finances. It is a great place to make connections and meet people. I loved taking initiative and coming up with new ideas, and the days certainly go by fast here."
good,"Starbucks is an environment that can be difficult to balance as most stores are open for about 16 hours. Due to this when people call off it can be felt when you opened at 4 a.m. and now have to cover a close. "
good,For a student in Highschool it was a very good first job.  I was able to gain many skills that will help me with future careers.  I enjoyed the experience I gained at this company but I do wish I was able to take a leave to go to school then come back on breaks and in the summer
good,"In the morning each person usually stays at their station, during the night it's more relaxed, crew members are put to more than one task to close the store."
good,Good job reliable hours. The company offers a lot of benefits to its employees such as stocks in the company itself. The location is well managed and staff morale is high.
good,Probably my favorite job even though it was one of the more stressful ones i really liked the fast work environment and dealing with most of the customers.
good,"My manager was great, but often times had lots of computer work to do and generally only worked the day shift while I worked nights. I rarely saw  them. I enjoyed my fellow co-workers with very few problems. Any conflicts were resolved face to face and professionally in a friendly manner. I handled cash, created deposits for the bank, balanced 4-8 cash drawers per night. Tracked inventory both manually and electronically and handled any ordering that needed to be done. Provided legendary customer service to people of all walks of life. The hardest part of my job was handling rowdy customers given the area I worked in. The most enjoyable was getting the chance to really connect with people over coffee. Who doesn't love coffee?"
good,Great company but don't get paid enough for the work load or stress also its hard to balance life without a set schedule. you can move up in the company fast but again I don't feel the compensation is accurate
good,"It's a good starting job, but if you're looking to make a career out of this company, you should be advancing up, not staying as a barista. If you're good with handling many drinks at once as well as long lines at times, then you'll be fine here. It's pretty much food service."
good,"Working at Starbucks was very enjoyable. The most enjoyable part about working here was the friendships I gained, not only with my coworkers but with our customers as well."
good,"Worked with awesome people. Each day was its own unique experience. When I worked there, the store didn't have a set manager. Other store managers would help occasionally. No leadership was a little tough."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me making drinks having great customer service, and providing a safe as well as clean store. I learned how to make relationships and connects with people that would come o Starbucks to the point of memorizing their regular drink they get everytime they come into the store. The management there could of been a little better there were people that would repeatedly not come into work causing the other employees to have to step up and work harder than they did before. The culture was great the workplace was inviting and was very connected with the customers and the employees. The hardest part of the job was the cleanliness of the store, there were so many rules and regulations of procedures we would have to do everyday. The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to talk to the customers and get to know who they are as people and make them feel like this workplace was like another home to them."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the work, the coworkers and customers I worked with at Starbucks. The only negative were the early morning hours. I had plenty of opportunity to move up if wanted."
good,"Café and coffee culture is a great place fir anyone starting out or just coming back to the work force. Once you learn you're role, work's a breeze! What's fun is the regulars who come in and the creative, unique people who come in."
good,"Very easy place to work, can be quite stressful when busy, but is overall quite enjoyable."
good,Fun job for when you just graduated or starting college. Hours are always there and who doesn't love coffee? Can get overwhelming at times and customers are stressful so patience is a MUST.
good,Didn't realize how many benefits you get as part time that a lot of other companies to give! It was nice to start a 401k and have the option for medical at only 20 hours a week
good,Starbucks is really great due to its diversity. Met people of all sorts. Starbucks also help create moments you will remember for the rest of your life.
good,"Overall, a great company to work for...stressful yet can be very fun and engaging at times. Sometimes shift supervisors are not properly trained, thus causing chaos at times. Understaffing is a problem during the holidays...great benefits and discounts."
good,"While I was there I was committed to Starbucks, whole heart.  I loved the company, I loved the people and I loved the product.  The leadership team was different then, however I think it still moved with forward momentum to keep pace with the times"
good,"My store - to say the least - is very unhappy like. Everyone works as if they hate their job and including the manager. No one seems happy, making it much more difficult for other employees starting to like their jobs."
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for as a temporary gig for me.  Some managers are better than others, and each store is very different from the next."
good,Great experience with plenty of room for growth in the company. great benefits. flexible schedule. Very good at pushing people to find their potential in a comfortable accepting environment.
good,"Great for high school students or young adult."
good,"Nice place to work, good culture and great corporate leadership.  There are alot of talented managers so moving up can take time if you are willing is a good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. The management was amazing and I felt that this job helped to shape some of my best work skills. The worst thing was obviously how some of the customers don't treat you like a human that deserves respect, but you learn to build a thick skin."
good,"Working for Starbucks was very excited at first. Managed to work my way up in a matter of a year. The Manager of the Business was very layed back about very important concerns in the team, more of a “that’s not important right now” type of concerned. Was always open to hearing out just never really took initiative. Loved my coworkers at times, there were some that just weren’t people friendly. Overall rating is a 3-4 out of 5. Great benefits and awesome CEO."
good,Great job to start off with if you have no prior work experience. hours are flexible for the most part. People are friendly and work is not that hard.
good,I worked at 2 different Starbucks stores and my experiences with both were good. The customers could be annoying at times but the staff was amazing. There was a lot of work to be done in a short amount of time with very few people but it was the same work every night so it was easy to figure out ways to do little shortcuts. I would work here again if the pay was better.
good,A typical day was fun and challenging. My coworkers were  professional and easy-going which made the job that much more exciting. My manager could've been better and anytime I had to work with her it wasn't as much fun.
good,"Overall I think Starbucks brings a positive culture in today's world, emphasizing acceptance of individuals and personal cultures and expanding to a philanthropic approach to local and world problems."
good,Manager at first was really sloppy and unorganized but wasn't there too long and new manager was much much better and the environment changed for the better.
good,"Fast paced environment. Constant flow of people. Personal and professional interactions with repeat customers. Built great knowledge of coffee: how to properly grind and store products. Being mostly a store opener, schedule opened up opportunity to have the rest of day to do other things. Even work a second night job. Coworkers were great to work with as a team."
good,Had very good fun working with Starbucks and learnt more than I could ever imagine. Management and other staff always very helpful however would not recommend as part time job as they are very keen to get (especially new staff) to do as many hours as possible and as I was still in school doing A-levels this unfortunately did not suit me.
good,"Overall, the company is a good place to work for with great benefits. Flexible hours are a definite attraction. However, individually, if a store's store manager lacks strong leadership skills, work life can be stressful and a little hectic, because everything trickles down."
good,"I worked for startbucks for 5 years in more than 20 stores and in the campacity of shift supervisor  up to a store manager. "
good,"Starbucks is a great first job and provides excellent work-life balance. For students, this is the ideal job as shifts can easily be scheduled around classes. "
good,"The hardest part about working at Starbucks is the early hours. Three to four days a week I work at 4:15 am. Maintaining a sleep schedule and social life can become a challenge. Other than that, your shifts fly by because you're generally very busy. Management is spotty and depends on the location."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. The company is doing great, inclusive things. I hated leaving, but felt uncomfortable about the actions of a coworker and after bringing it up with management at my store, it was put off with ""If you're so uncomfortable here, you can leave."" I chose to leave my job because the incidents were becoming more frequent and I didn't want to feel unsafe/replaceable any more. This review is only for my particular store though. I still adore the Starbucks company and I am a frequent customer. My review is only for the store that I worked at. I hope that they are able to work on their leadership."
good,"Starbucks was a good place to work at in my opinion.  There are some people who i worked with who were great, helpful and good overall employee's.  There were also some who i would say were not so good.  Some people were ""team player's"" and there were other's who weren't.  Overall a good place to work."
good,"A fast paced environment, hands on paid training. A very diverse place to work in. The highlights of working at Starbucks for both customers and employees i would say is during Frappuccino Happy Hour (A week in May or June) and during the Holiday season (October - December). The best part of working here is the consistent connections made with the customers. Greeting the customers by names and remembering their orders, makes such a huge impact in their trips at the store. It keeps them combing back knowing that they feel so important to us."
good,There are lots of opportunities with this company to advance and improve yourself if you are willing to work hard. The benefits are the reason to work for Starbucks.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fast paced. You need to be extremely detail oriented and care about the quality of the product you're giving to customers. A connection with the customer is a must. If you are a people person, you will do well in this position. You must be able to multitask and still produce a quality beverage."
good,the job was a fast paced in a very hectic environment with a lot of traffic the airport was always filled with people so there was no room to slack off and everyone loves their coffee
good,Most of the day is spent cleaning and helping customers. A little bit of cash handling when ringing up customers. Learning all of the drinks is not hard.
good,"Starbucks is a very good place to work.  Especially if you are a student.  The consideration and cooperation you receive as a student really relieves the amount of daily stress as I did not have to worry about juggling my schedule for work and school.  My only concern was the continuous changing of weekly hours.  "
good,Everyone knows of Starbucks and how much they dominate the coffee industry. It is a great job to start off and gain some experience in the customer service area.
good,"It is starbucks, its the best job you can get in the fast food industry... just dont be habitually late or you'll lose your job in a blink of your eye..."
good,"Hard work, patience and time management skills are essential. Creating a positive atmosphere and work environment is important. "
good,"A typical day at work, as a barista, is fun and busy. "
good,Love the company and Starbucks has always seemed to care about its employees with so many benefits for even those that just work 20 hrs. What I didn't like with the company is that most of the top management always seems to get lost in ego and the fact that they are store managers. Saying this I have met a couple Starbucks managers that exemplify what the company is trying to stand for completely. You can tell with those managers that they crave what the company is offering but there are a plenty who care more about self rather than the rest of the staff.
good,"Working with this company was fine until I had to switch my schedule due to other responsiblitlies and obligations I had. After I changed my schedule, the manager was not very agreeable with how many hours I needed to be working. The coworkers were all very upbeat and fun to be around. Every shift you could get or make yourself any drink you desired and always had one free Starbucks product that was marked off so it was free for you every week."
good,"Working there every one there was like family. Very high paste, and very stressful at times but it was always a fun. The regular customers knew everyone by name and would bring us fruit at times."
good,"Management doesn't know how to hire people. Turn over rates are extremely high. Doesn't matter how hard you work, everyone gets paid the same. Everyone gets the same raise, and hours aren't based off performance. If you are a shift lead, don't expect to get paid any better, and your life life is now theirs. Want a day off to do something? Better have a three week notice."
good,"Taught me good time management skills, how to handle money and communicate well with others. It provided me with opportunities for advancement with training and other positions."
good,Es tranquilo y buen ambiente laboral. Aprendi mucho de atencion a clientes y estandares de limpieza.
good,"Our mission is to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.  Starbucks is committed to doing business responsibly and conducting ourselves in ways that earn the trust and respect of our customers, partners and neighbors."
good,"Overall great company to work for, I was just disappointed when I got a transfer.  How no one informed me about the different in pay rate, that the city makes more than the suburban area."
good,"Starbucks, as we all know, is a corporate machine. They have good values, but ultimately believe in profits. As a consumer of their products, I will not deter anyone from entering employment with them. My only advice is that you remember it is only a temporary job that you're working at to one day do something greater and more suited to you as an individual."
good,"Pay should be the same at all locations."
good,"Depending on what time of day you work, there are different tasks to complete and a different pace. I love working in the morning because the rush makes work go by quickly."
good,"As a high school student, not bad for a first job. Started as a barista and in time, my manager had me in charge of the inventory. Learned so much and gained tons of customer service experience."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to be a part of. It is a fast paced job, but enjoyable. I love my partners, managers, and my customers. I have become true friends with my other partners, making it more than just a workplace. I have learnd a lot about coffee and personal connections, and am very proud of the craft that I have acquired here. The best thing as a barista is getting a particularly picky customer and being able to understand what they want and seeing the joy when you perfectly craft their beverage. Making someone's day with a simple cup of coffee is amazing. I would say one of the hardest parts of being a barista is that sometimes people want to have a bad day, and as a retail worker in general, you end up on the receiving end of that. However, the times I do get to see people really appreciate what I do makes it worth it. I couldn't ask for a better community to work in and be a part of."
good,"I really enjoy the atmosphere at Starbucks and the ability to achieve work/life balance here.  However, if you are looking for somewhere with opportunities for advancement, this may not be the place.  They are not very focused on promoting from within, so it becomes very monotonous and not very personally rewarding."
good,"I used to be the closing shift lead when i worked at this Starbucks Location. I preformed all the closing and cleaning duties that were required. I learned how to make beverages and learned how to train others. the management changed every year or every other year, we always had a new manager and made it stressful for everyone."
good,"Very fast paced, fun atmosphere. Working with a younger staff kept things interesting, but as a manager, there is not a lot of time to plan and manage the team."
good,Starbucks was a great place to work. Everyday going in I enjoyed working among customers with different ethnic backgrounds. I very much so enjoy working with customers and also working with co-workers.
good,work the register make drinks is a typical day you learn different types of coffee and how to craft several of starbuck famous drinks like frapicuinos and lattes
good,"Overall rating its not well Balanced user management was not given enough support "
good,"I definitely had a great time working at Starbucks back home for the summer, but the company was going through management changes and during that time of employment it was very hectic. Overall working experience was great! helped me work on my attitude in stressful settings."
good,"This position had daily deadlines, this could be challenging depending on the level of unemployment claims.  Being able to handle large volumes of confidential information, while maintaining internal customer service was the biggest 'get' from this position."
good,"After 15 years at Starbucks Corporate HQ, I can say that this is a wonderful place to learn about navigating the corporate enviornment.  The value of networking thru treating each other with respect and dignity and forming genuine human connections was tantamount. This was the best thing about Starbucks.  The hardest part was dealing with ambiguity thru unexpected challenges."
good,Starbucks is a great company. It is fast paced and fun once you get the hang of all the recipes and roles. My manager and others I have been under were really nice. They worked with my availability and school. The benefits are actually the best part along with making connections with regular customers that come into the store. The hardest part was sometimes the customers which is how it is at every customer service job.
good,"Depending on the store this can be very fast paced, but Starbucks is never a hard job. The hours can be rough, and the pay isn't great, but the discounts are awesome."
good,"The benefits is unbeatable. The pay was great. What lacks here is respect. Felt no value as well as gossip by higher management. There are individuals who are bullies, like down rite rude and not respectful of others and when you speak to management about it they try to brush it off even when the known individual has had a history of behaviors."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time as part of the Starbucks company. The work I was doing was something interesting to me, I liked working with my coworkers, and it was a good job to introduce me to both customer service and the food industry. Unfortunately, after relocating, I came to see that at the time I needed to put my education first and that was why I ultimately left the company. If I had been better able to manage the time on my own, I would have done everything I could to continue working there."
good,the manager quality is bad and the store usually has to understaff for money reasons making the workplace more stressful. there are a lot of young people hired who dont have the best work ethic
good,It is always a productive day at Starbucks. There is always something to do each and every day. And each day is different and there is always something for everyone to do
good,"although i only worked a starbucks for a short period of time, I learned a lot about coffee and recipes and found that I really enjoyed being a barista/ mixologist rather quickly.  I also liked how they provided paid tuition thru Arkansas State."
good,The best company i have had the pleasure to work for.They pay competitively and the benefits are not that bad. Fun environment to work and challenging work at that.
good,Travail inspirant et non routinier. le développement des employés est au centre des activités. Starbucks a du succès parce que les exigences sont très élevées. Très difficile de concillier travail et famille. L'esprit d'équipe est hors du commun.
good,"This was a great job for me when I was in high school. Surprisingly, it was more difficult to maintain a 20-25 hour work week in college than high school. The free pound of coffee a week and free drinks/food were enough to make me stay for 2 years. It teaches you how to balance a fast paced environment and to not take what people say personally."
good,It was fun and taught me a lot of lessons. I miss it sometimes. Upbeat and great culture. Mark outs. Benefits. Fun times and parties. Great food selection as well as drink selection.
good,"Fun place if you like to talk to people ! Very fast paced and customer oriented environment. The learning curve can be a little bit challenging at first but after getting over it , you'll feel like you can do anything!"
good,I loved interacting with all my customers regulars were my favorite. very fast paced never any down time loved it time would go by so fast. Manager was a little to touchy feely for my liking.
good,"Great job for someone who wants to go to any kind of CS or business / sales position. Challenge yourself not to only make good drinks but to bond and keep customers happy. It will pay off sooo well in future jobs. If you are there  just to have a job and not challenge yourself, this isn't opportunity for you ( you will be overworked).  In that case you can find easier jobs for same money- so dont waste time with Starbucks."
good,"People are very excited to hear youve worked at Starbucks before."
good,This was a part-time position for me and the majority of my experience was either as a opener on weekends or a closer during the week.  I learned the art of making different types of drinks and memorizing the orders of our regular customers.  Dealt with difficult people and moved on with a smile.  With this position I really enjoyed meeting new people every day.
good,good bennefits you make drinks you learn register you learn to do drive thru always good to know how to write on cups you learn the difference between different types of coffees you meet all sorts of type of people you get a 30% discount you get a free coffee markout a week
good,I absolutely liked working with my supervisor and other fellow employees. One employee who I worked with on a regular basis was always rude and started arguments with myself for no apparent reason.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks was fast paced and fun!"
good,"I loved this job when I first started, but it really depends on the team of people you are working with and how well you work together.  Since I switched stores, because of a promotion, I have been less trusting, and more paranoid about the way in which I do my work, then I have ever been at any job.  I was excited about the company, to begin with, but have since seen that it all depends on the store manager."
good,"Starbucks is a very professional workplace with friendly customers and great stock options. On an average day I would be in charge of handling money transactions, providing friendly customer service, and making drinks when necessary. I enjoyed the fact that Starbucks helped a lot of charities and offered volunteer options. The hardest part was making the drinks but I played to my strengths and provided great service to the customers. I learned how to handle situations in a more professional and friendly manner."
good,I was at starbucks for almost two years and the staff was one of the reasons I stayed. It was basically a second family and it was such a great job. You have your regular customers that you look forward to seeing everyday and it made it fun and inviting.
good,The work environment was fun and my fellow partners had a lot of enthusiasm. There was a recent switch in management and the store began to go down hill.
good,I love the fast paced work environment. Being able to learn in the moment helped me excel. Starbucks also has amazing health insurance and other benefits.
good,"Great  people to work with, made some life long friends. Management is different for every store, but communication is key. High volume, must be able to handle stress well."
good,"I love this job, but I was promised a promotion that I never received when a lot was depending on that promise. My son and I have been saving to move in btok our own home... and now we can't."
good,the starbucks i worked at was one of the slowest in the city. the store manager seemed to hire anybody who applied and most had horrible work ethic and were a no-call no-show at some point. never wrote people up so they kept getting away with it.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a good experience. I got along with all of my coworkers and supervisors. I learned that I liked staying busy while working and I'm a friendly, hardworking person."
good,"-Either worked as a cashier for the front or drive thru."
good,"I loved the setting, the regular customers, my shift leaders are awesome, my current manager is alright, but he is new to the position so we'll see how that goes. I like a fast paced environment and a coffee shop is exactly that, especially in the mornings. The hours are flexible so I can work around my class schedule and my other job. Overall a good working experience."
good,The team Were incredible to work with and we had a lot of regulars who made the day a lot of fun. I have kept in touch with a lot of both staff and customers who made my experience there perfect.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great way for me gain Customer Service experience. It was a very fast paced, enjoyable job. Had amazing coworkers, but poor management. Every Starbucks is different though."
good,"Depending on the manager, starbucks can be a fun place to work. I loved my coworkers and the customers usually tipped well. I love the food and drinks too!"
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun you get to make friends of the customers where you can engage a friendly conversation which does not end only at the store but beyond the store, you became friends. Starbucks taught me to be strengthen my core values and further enhaces those values such as taking personal pride. Creating an inviting atmosphere to my fellow workers. With that I am working but at the same time having fun and learning. Being at Starbucks I was taught how integrity is important never be blinded of what would compromise the values and culture of the company."
good,Great place to work as a college student.  This location specifically was well managed and had a lot of military customers.  They would often provide military deals and showed support to our veterans.
good,"I love working at Starbucks -- the company treats us wonderfully, and usually hires wonderful people, but as it goes with any food service job it all comes down to the environment of your store. You have wonderful regulars and then you have the not-so-great customers, for example, which can turn a good day at work into crying in the back room. Your store manager makes all the difference, as does your fellow partners. I love the people I work with, but there are always ups and downs. I love making drinks and making people happy, and I love the familiar environment Starbucks cultivates within its stores."
good,"Starbucks operates around ensuring that their customers have the most comfortable experience possible. As a partner you are asked to engage in conversation with all of your customers and sincerely and genuinely try as hard as possible to help make this 5 minute coffee run a highlight of their day. It is essential to have relationship building skills because they are not only necessary for customer interactions, but with fellow co workers as well. The fast paced environment makes it mandatory that partners trust each other because we rely on each other to keep the store smoothly flowing at all times."
good,"The hierarchy makes it hard to advance, but if you start early (as I did in college) it is a great place to work - and there may be opportunity for advancement, You do work your butt off, often very busy, lots of internal regulatory standards and cleaning required. But often good people. It is really a top down culture. If you manager is a downer, it will put a damper on the whole store."
good,Starbucks has poor management skills. Supervisor and shift lead are messy and ignorant. They sit in the back and do absolutely nothing but play on their phone. They also boss Baristas around while they're doing nothing.
good,"I learned life skills"
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks it was fast paced and fun. You got to meet new people and make friends with staff. I learned how to multitask while i was there and when it got very busy it can be hard.
good,"Starbucks is a great company that puts policies in place to benefit its partners. The work can become tedious and stressful if not managed properly, but the team element involved lowers the high stress scenarios. There are specialty stores that require more effort and energy but they don't represent the majority of the stores or experiences within."
good,"When I first started working for Starbucks I had a great store manager and we were fully staffed and were growing as team. Unfortunately, when that store manager left I have yet to have a manager that is equally as good or better. I know people who absolutely love working for Starbucks and that's because they have really great management. It is a customer service job so you have rude customers and you great customers, seeing some of my regulars can totally make my day! The benefits are good especially if you take advantage of the ASU program that is offered. The way Starbucks is setup it is a team effort and everyone has to know their first and secondary positions, if you don't it can greatly hinder your team and the service. It is fast paced and you are on your feet for majority of your shift."
good,"When the store becomes busy, everyone can become frustrated quickly, but realizing each person is there to help each other through the process. Although you may not hang out with your partners outside of working, taking time to get to know them during your shift helps to have a higher quality experience."
good,"Throughout the time I have been working at Starbucks I meet new people everyday. Some of them stick and make the most impactful connections that could make your day with one smile as they walk through the door. It is a great environment to make meaningful connections. "
good,the production at my work id very okay I have learnt so many thing example toralence customer service and working in a team . there fore I recommend it
good,"if you need a job with super flexible scheduling, starbucks is a good choice. I recommend it for anyone who is in college and doesn't have any major expenses."
good,"Starbucks is indeed a fun place to work, where you have an opportunity to interact with various people from various backgrounds, and learn to foster that type of connection that encourages to come back more often. You also have an opportunity to work with amazing, who educate you on what and what not to do during your shift, how you come, who genuinely do everything they can to set their fellow partners up for success. I think that the hardest part of the job is to deal with some customers, who give you a very hard time that could make your day a little, difficul. To offset, you still try to make the customer feel welcome, maybe with the help of your coworkers and your supervisors."
good,"Typical day at work for me was, walk in, clock in, and go to bar since that's where I know everyone could use a little help. Never got help when I was on bar. I was always drowning and the next person would just do their jobs and drinks and not worry about their fellow partner. Then during the hours of my shift, I would beg for a break from bar and just clean or help in a different area; drive thru, upfront, warming food.  Eventually I would get a break. Being so tired and not having enough energy I was drained and ready to go home."
good,"i have learned to be patient and attentive . i loved connecting with customers and also my coworkers , STARBUCKS  is a very loving and caring environment as well as a safe work place."
good,"If you enjoy being in a busy team based environment this is the job for you! You never stop moving working here, but you get free coffee every two hours to fuel your pace! Also free take home coffee every week and fun coworkers. Decent benefits..... scheduling hours...... its either feast or famine. Either we have too much staff and cant give enough hours to everyone, or too few and you have way too many hours. But well that's life!"
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. If everything were actually done the ""Starbucks Way"" everywhere, like in California, no one would ever want to leave. Sadly, in some areas of the country, like the East Coast,  things are very different with upper management and the culture is flimsy if not non existent."
good,"I love my job and have been with the company since I graduated High School, almost 5 years now. However, I do not get paid like a long term partner at all. The only thing that angers me with this job is how much I get paid. I absolutely have been in love with my job-- my favorite part is the customer interaction. I am the opener so I work very early in the morning which is what I love about this job since most jobs do not start at this time but also as the opener I have more duties than others."
good,This company offers about as much growth opportunity as you could hope for. They have a culture of treating people well both customers and employees are valued.
good,Working at Starbucks is like swimming in circles you can have fun seeing all your friends all day but its not giving much in return when it comes to advancement of payment.
good,"Overall working with Starbucks has been a learning, and mostly enjoyable experience. The job itself, is very enjoyable. I mostly work mornings, and I loved working with my morning crew, and seeing my morning regulars. I've learned patience, gratitude, kindness and responsibility.The crew were always laughing and enjoying their shifts, and even when someone wasn't having a good day, the job was still enjoyable. The greatest thing about the job was learning and getting to know my regulars, and the hardest was working with my manager. My manager and I had difficulties working with my school schedule, and understanding what was expected from each other in certain aspects of our duties on the floor. It had it's ups and downs, but was definitely my favorite job so far."
good,"You clock in at the time you're scheduled for and expect anything to happen in between those hours. Heads up, you might not be fully trained all the way through. You're expected to learn all recipes pretty quickly which in my honest opinion isn't the worst. Once you learn them, it's easy to make drinks. Beverage routine is important. Some managers have high expectations. Sometimes its because they want to grow or they want to pick on you. Management is weird here. Team is usually tight here. Beware of political talk or work relationships. Seen many terrible things happen because of taboo subject."
good,"After working for Starbucks for two years, there is a lot of responsibility required. For the amount of responsibility, Baristas may be underpaid, especially with the length of experience in the industry (8 years), I still made less then $10. "
good,"A positive work environment. Strong connections to our customers as well as to each other. While there are moments of stress and performance mistakes, there is a general sense of team unity and togetherness in helping to overcome the challenges of the day."
good,"Great benefits, great staff, fun work environment. This is the perfect job for anyone starting out. Very flexible with scheduling and your needs, lots of perks."
good,Was with the company for many years- flexible scheduling and a great team environment. The perks offered for a part time job were great. Stock option and tuition reimbursement.
good,Je leert er veel van en de mensen waarmee je werkt zijn zeer aangenaam.
good,"As easy as the job may seem, it is very stressful. The manager determines the overall atmosphere. Benefits are awesome and they offer a college degree program at ASU."
good,"I worked for starbucks for 2 and a half years, I was very fortunate to work with a team that was basically family to me. The reason I left is because of the crazy high standards the company has and how stressful the work environment can be."
good,"This job can be very enjoyable but it can also be very stressful. As a Shift Supervisor you do the same amount of work as a Barista, only it involves being a manager as well. Be prepared for for things to change really quickly but it is a great experience if you are up for a challenge."
good,It was very fast paced with stressful moments with long drive through lines and guests at the counter. There are some fun moments if you work with the right people.
good,"Amazing benefits but awful wages. Busy locations are incredably labour intensive. Coworkers that stay on the job past the first month are rare, high turn over."
good,"Starbucks is the perfect job for a high school or college student as the hours are extremely flexible, the benefits are great and it is a relaxed environment to work in. The pay is not preferred and raises/promotions are far a few. However, for a temporary position it is exceptional."
good,Would work here indefinitely if pay was better.  Management varies as well as stress level (depending on store location).  Benefits are killer and free coffee/Spotify is always a plus!
good,Starbucks is dedicated to training it's employee's properly in order to make the company standardized across it's hundreds of locations. It shows when they train you as it takes months to become comfortable with the job. The customers are a large scale of different kinds of people so it was never boring.
good,"Starbucks was amazing in terms of teaching good work ethic, I had amazing supervisors who were fair and firm  in their teaching process. I learned all my good work habits here, however I feel like the environment that the customers present can be toxic at times."
good,"Good company to work for, great advancement opportunities.. High-stress and quick-paced environment. Not the best hourly wage so if you're paying bills, get a second job."
good,"It's a hard place to work due to the hours of operation, opening at 430 AM closing at 930 PM.  But it is a great job if you're in a transitional part of your life. If you can handle quick paced, no time to breathe, always on the go then it is perfect for you."
good,"Starbucks is a company that is constantly evolving to stay relevant with the times. A store manager is expected to maintain store operations while staffing and training a strong team to support said operations. The culture, when all key players are in place, is incredibly fun and up-lifting. Starbucks is truly a company in the people industry, dealing in human connection versus just coffee."
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work. Very flexible but once you are store manager, work/life balance becomes nonexistent. Weekends are never off."
good,"Fun place to work, you gain lots of skills and it looks great on a resume. Great staff and great drinks. They are very ethical and promote workplace equality."
good,"Starbucks is an intense but prosperous business with a wonderful availability to connect with team members and guests.  The work done with Starbucks is a great job for people who love to stay busy, be challenged, and who are customer service strong."
good,"The job itself is fun and the shifts are flexible. Discounts are great, but some employees are too catty and immature for my taste, but employees varies at each location."
good,Starbucks is a fun work environment (most of the time) though retail positions always have their struggles. It's a great place to work while going through college since you get free coffee and you can opt into health care with as low as 20 hours worked per week
good,Great place to work if you are studying and want to find new friends. This workplace help you to find yourself and discover what you want to do in your life.
good,"Loved the free pound of coffee every week and the benefits are great. Some of the technologies are majorly outdated which affected my role often.  Loved the people I worked with, they were all amazing."
good,My review of working at Starbucks is every job have their stressful full moments but overall it's definitely a good company and is definitely help me start in my 401k
good,"Great first job, as long as you take it easy and don't stress about it-at the end of the day it's just coffee. It's a good experience to get into customer service, but also to better understand money and finances thanks to their partnership with Fidelity thru 401k, stocks, health ins, etc!"
good,"It's a good place to advance, however it depends on quick you advance and at times people are not prepared enough for their roles. However, the support is there if you need it if your team and management is there to support you through the difficulties."
good,"i liked the job, and I needed little in the way of adjustment for my role there. Just give the customers what they want, and get paid for it as well..."
good,"A typical day at starbucks features making drinks for people and doing your job to the best of your ability. Workplace flow lives and dies on the strength of coworkers, and excellent coworkers make the day amazing, regardless of what happens. Higher level management is dicey, you can have an excellent District Manager that makes good choices for your store, or you can have a bad one that makes the bigger picture at your particular store nightmarish. Store Manager can also make or break the flow of the store. "
good,"Opening shifts can be stressful and unless the store manager is great at writing schedules, you will often be understaffed. Despite this, you will still be required to meet the goals of a fully staffed store. The people you work with can become your family, but it is a very high stress job with little pay."
good,"I learned so quickly how i can advance. My skills are improving here, such as cash handling, speed of service and customer satisfaction. I'd say this is a great place to start!"
good,"Tough in the beginning to learn everything, but coworkers were very patient and helpful. Once you learn how to make the drinks and begin knowing customers and their orders, the job gets more relaxing and fun as well as easy."
good,"I would recommend Starbucks as a great starting job! It's been my first job while in high school for almost a year now, and for the most part it's nice. Depending on which location you work at, management can be great or a bit difficult, but it's quite flexible and my co workers and boss  are great people!"
good,It's ok it all depends on where you work is you will to compute and dealing with customers it a real good company to grow and work for but like I said it all depends on where you work
good,"Boa empresa para quem está disposto a aprender coisas novas, aprendi muito, e sou muito grato por tudo!"
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced environment that requires constant attention.  The benefits are good, and you feel cared for by the company.  The job can be stressful during a rush but if you can handle it, it is a lot of fun and makes the days go by quickly."
good,They value making a buck over taking care of their employees. Although that is the opposite culture they preach. It's not a horrible company to work for.
good,"Easy job, relaxed majority of time. Low pay, free drinks and food. The pay was minimum wage so it would be hard to live off of but can be a great job to have while in school."
good,"Exciting experience as well as a stressful work experience, will make many friends and create new and exciting drinks, the fun part is teaching other partners about coffee."
good,Fun working environment for anyone looking for a part time job. Management and pay were fair. Could be stressful at times depending on staff and store location
good,"As a barista you take orders, make the drinks, and clean the store. Throughout this I learned how to make lasting connection with customers and how to successful run a shift."
good,Working for Starbucks can be difficult in terms of having enough patience to re-make a drink five times because there isn't enough foam or too much foam on a drink even though you followed the recipe exactly. It is a busy place so you need to work as a team and stay positive.
good,"Everyday you see New faces and meet new people. It can get overwhelming and under pressure but you’ll be fine. Me personally love making drinks for customers my goal I set for myself is to learn faces an names there for I’ll remember there drink so I can be able to have drink in a timely manner. Always friendly vibes you’ll even have favorite customers who you actually connected with. Not to mention there benefits are Awesome Wanna go back to school, They’ll pay for it. Wanna go to the doctors, they have you covered iust  sign up fo there insurance. Wanna have a stock 401k plan for your future, Sigh up for your Fedietly.. Starbucks are always hiring Apply apply apply."
good,Working at Starbucks during my time there was a fast pace environment were you learned to provide quality beverages while creating great customer service. It was during this job where I was able to learn the importance of communication with co-workers and with customers. It was also during this time where I was able to meet and make lasting friends.
good,"It is such a great feeling when you have a great team to work with. Dealing with different customers on the day to day basis is the most enjoyable. You would never know what you are going to get with the customers. Its like a box of chocolate, you never know what you going to get."
good,Early morning starts everyday. Being on time is always to be expected. Good work environment amount the employees.  Overtime available. Can have long working hrs.
good,"Nice fun busy productive environment to work in. Like any other place it has its ups and downs, but i believe the positives outweigh the negatives in that work environment."
good,"Starbucks Barista Opens/Closes the day. Worked the Bar making all drinks. Worked Register/Counted til. Opening at 5 in the morning. Closed at 9, worked weekends"
good,Learn about all different kind of coffee in the world. the most enjoyable part of the job is created the best coffee for unpleasant customer - make them happy
good,Very good company to work for.  They have great benefits. The company at times tries to do too much at the same time creating multiple priorities which makes it difficult to manage.
good,"- workplace culture is great, learning ins and outs of starbucks food and drinks"
good,"The customers make me want to jab a steamwand into my eyeball, but my coworkers are dope. As usual, you're expected to always be happy, but the company allows customers to get away with too much. Causes them to throw hissy fits over little thing, or get away with murder. However, the dynamic of the floor is great, and I very rarely work with someone I don't like."
good,"Fast Paced, Hard Work, a Barista is one of the best jobs I've ever had, you learn so much about coffee and the likes and dislikes of just not your customers but yourself and your co-workers."
good,"Working at Starbucks is an extremely fast paced work place. Customer connection extremely important to the company. Always making things right for the customer and making sure that their experience was a successful one."
good,Every day at work is different. The hardest part of the job is being able to stay calm and maintain focus during the peak moments of the day. I learned patience and time management.
good,"I was lucky enough to work at a store with very fun people, but recently, we are overworked and understaffed. I struggle to get enough hours to pay rent, but the benefits are nice."
good,The workplace culture of Starbucks Canada is fantastic. Its great place to work part time while attending full time school. I enjoy going to work for each shift.
good,"-a typical day at work is 9am-6pm"
good,Overall a good company to work for. Some good benefits including free bag of coffee every week  and discounts on products. The skills you learn are useful for a wide range of jobs including customer service.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if your a student or if you are raising little one or ones on your own. They are extremely flexible with scheduling which is great because most employers require you to have complete open availability which is just impossible. You get tips weekly which can be a bit of a relief. Even though they are split between the team (baristas and shift supervisors) you have between an extra $20-$50 a week. you accumulate vacation and sick time so no one is exempt to paid time off, you get benefits after 90 days and you only need to work a minimum of 20 hours a week. Starbucks is a really close and personal place to work you get to meet a lot of different people and it can be pretty fun."
good,Starbucks has exceptional benefits for part time. It's hard to beat the benefits but the compensation isn't enough to live off of without support. It's great for college students or people that want free coffee and a supplementary income. Advancement is hard as it is fairly competitive and lots of star players apply for the same position. Management is on average fairly good and reasonable.
good,"It was a rewarding experience working at Starbucks. I (unfortunately) worked at the Columbia Mall, which meant the tips were poor and (some) customers were impatient and rude. Aside from those negative points, it was an excellent place to work. My manager was amazing; always helpful and understanding. My coworkers were a fun group of people and we got to know a lot about each other at work, some I remain in contact with today."
good,"starbucks is a great place to work if you love coffee and a fast paced work environment. however, this is not for the weak hearted. people that want their starbucks are rude and hateful and will call you names so if you cant handle that, go somewhere else"
good,Starbucks was the groundwork that built my professional career.  It was the development and continuous training that has been the building blocks that have made me the professional that I am today.
good,"My Starbucks is a licensed store inside the target, giving the employees the ability to cross train throughout the target store. This means employees are able to work around their busy schedules."
good,"Working as a barista is a very fast paced job, and can sometimes be overwhelming. However, every partner I have worked with has shared a positive attitude and made the busy environment surprisingly enjoyable regardless of how intense it may get."
good,"work with customers, take their orders, be extremely polite its one of Starbucks policies. Manage other baristas,make sure customers are being attended best way possible."
good,Customer focused in all aspects of the position; Making friends with coworkers is a must; Getting to know the regulars is fun; Having to be on your feet constantly can be very tiring for 8 hours
good,Starbucks was a great place to work while trying to find my feet. When I lost my job in 2008 they were the first company to lend a hand out and I took it. Great place and great team members. I have nothing but fond memories of working there.
good,"Buena, y positiva, me siento a gusto. Mis compañeros tienen una edad similar a la mía y eso me facilita y me es cómodo a la hora de hablar con ellos y conversar."
good,"Typical days at work were very hectic, especially in the drive-thru area, we had to treat every customer better than we treated each other. In my job I learned how to make every drink, handle cashier& be on customer support. the hardest part of the job was definitely handling both drive thru and the store, we had to keep up with every drink.I enjoyed working with my co workers and always trying to make up new drinks."
good,Great company to work for. They value their customers and staff highly and reward hard work. Flexible working hours. Employees are encouraged to work together and create a comfortable setting for the customer.
good,"Good place to work you learn about coffee and caffeine, but small hours.  You learn a lot about what makes coffee coffee and how it affects yourself and latte art."
good,"work with fun..new targets,new products,new customers,awards,coffee with customer means coffee testing..lots of activities..."
good,I love the people I work with. The only down fall is the expectations versus reality in the goals set for the store. Management is not helpful in the way they allow information to be relayed to employees.
good,"Working at Starbucks is challenging due to the fact paced and constant work needed to be done to make drinks and keep the area clean, however, the satisfaction of beating a rush makes up for the challenge. Working with a team and meeting customers, both regulars and new, is a rewarding experience that makes me want to work there. The company provides excellent benefits and really puts in the effort to listen to its partners. Overall, while it's hard to keep up with the pace of the work, the time I've spent there with the people I work with make it rewarding."
good,Starbucks is a company that does its best for its customers. The pay is ok and the benefits are good but recently the lack of labor is a struggle for people living paycheck to paycheck.
good,If you work for starbuck's be prepared to be busy and to have lots of training. Memorizing the drinks is the best part. I loved to be on the bar and making drinks or on drive through and taking orders. It is a challenge but its an awesome company to work for.
good,"Good benefits, fair place to work. Best part about the job for me were the hours, had options for overtime. Was under staffed while I was there, so had to complete the work of multiple employees."
good,"I find sometimes the expectations within the job are more than we are getting paid for, but overall would recommend this job to anyone. Fun place to work."
good,"Over-all great company to work for, amazing benefits, fair pay and fun environment. Work/personal life balance comes with time and initial work put in. 9/10"
good,"It's a fast paced job, it can get stressful when very busy. Patience is required when it's packed. Although they're days it can be slow and calm. The times that their aren't many people it's best to practice."
good,"The people, the smell of coffee... Lovely place to work. Lovely experience to learn art of coffee. Exceptional place to work atleast part time. I have been working here while I was studying and helped me to learn english and skills."
good,"This job is fast paced. There are a lot of benefits including free drinks while working, 30% off when not working, one free 1lb bag of coffee or box of tea per week, free meal while working."
good,"Every day we have our rush hours and in those moments, everyone works quickly, efficiently, and together. I truly enjoy the fact that every co-worker is always willing to help others and how our regular customers share a bit about their lives with us. We are constantly making connections with strangers, and it is honestly, a wonderful experience. This has taught me that little moments can make people's day a lot better, even a quick trip to your local coffee shop."
good,"The work environment is fun and energetic. However, management is lacking in certain areas. Also, customers are allowed to disrespect  employees to the extent of harsh verbal assaults and shaming with not interference or repercussions from management."
good,"empresa de bebidas y alimentos de muy buena calidad en la cual trabaja mucha gente joven estudiantes, y muy buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,The company and it's ideals are fantastic.  The benefits are amazing.  The communication is poor and the roll out of anything new is very painful.  There is no way for store managers to give feedback on their district level managers.  So cross our fingers you get a good one.
good,"Managers are consistently expected to fulfill their responsiblities within 40hrs but across the board I found this to be an unrealistic goal.  When OT is accrued, DMs praise the team for doing an amazing job but severly punish them for using the time to complete the task successfully.  DMs encourage managers to work hard and document all their hours while simultaneously reprimanding us for doing so... Many managers will agree that they are suggested to work off the clock but not in those words.  Work/Life balance can be challenging."
good,"The company does not pay it's workers near enough for the stress they have to go through daily. it's fast paced and rough for people who have never had to work before. It is a high stress and highvolume company. it's drawbacks are the high standards they put on partners with out compensating them near enough to their value. I beleive that the company uses the benefits as an excuse to pay the minimum wage. I have worked for almost 5 years at the company and the only reason i can validate getting paid minimum wage is the people. "
good,"I love the girls I work with, we are like a family. Relaxed dress code, tattoos and some piercings/stretched ears okay, no drug-testing, and you can get insurance, a free Bachelor's degree through Arizona State University, as they are a very progressive socialist company, trying to aid in having people not having to work for low wage jobs. Recycling programs are regular at most locations. Every barista gets a free pound of coffee (or K-Cups/pods or box of tea) every week, "
good,"I loved Starbucks, it was fast paced, challenging, and kept me busy. I was promoted within three months of working there, and I really missed just being a Barista, they get treated a lot better. Also, the pay isn't as great as they advertise, but the benefits are amazing. I would recommend it, but I would only recommend you being a part time Barista."
good,Working in Starbucks has been a wonderful experience. Not only has it refined my skills but it has introduced news ones to me as well. I've learned how to talk to customers and make them feel like they're not just customers but a very valuable part of the company.
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great gig to work at, overall just working there gave the opportunity to advance on my working, communication, plan strategy on knowing what needs to be done at certain times; time consuming."
good,I fully enjoyed working for Starbucks and learning everything they had to teach me. I gained many personal and work skills that I can carry with me to multiple jobs.
good,"most of the people in each shift works and put in their all to complete the mission of the day, and supervisors always come up with something to put a smile on the employees face and even the customers, they come up with different ways to make the job fast and easy so that we don't spend as much time on the most least important stuff. it makes our job easy and smooth so that we don't have any complaint from any customers. And most of all following the SOP and work as a team"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working there.  I loved the fast pace work.  I loved being able to make a customers day by simply making them coffee and asking about their day.  They also had great benefits.
good,"A typical work day is like what you see when you go into a starbucks and see a bunch of 20 somethings running around making coffee for some of the worst customers imaginable. It's fast paced and stressful at times but the people you work with generally are some of the best people. "
good,"Excellente entreprise qui m'a permis d'approfondir mon anglais grâce aux collègues de travail, très bonne ambiance avec tout le groupe, journée de travail très chargée. Différentes taches acquis : serveuse, bar, hôtesse d'accueil et dans différents Starbucks de la ville. Nourriture à volonté pour les salariées."
good,"The customers of Starbucks are the best and worst part of working there. However, they aren't very flexible with the work hours. The shifts are 8 hrs long typically."
good,I think that just like any job there is a struggle at first to find the hard workers and to get rid of the rest. The problem is when they don't get rid of the rest and a few people are doing the jobs of all. That's the only issue with Starbucks that I had. I really really enjoyed working there.
good,it was often busy but the store was able to always maintain. i learned how to make many drinks there. the work place had good employees.  the hardest but most fun part of the job was giving a positive work experience
good,"I always work an AM/early afternoon shift due to my child's daycare hours. It is fast paced, especially during the morning peak hours but, I love it. It's all about serving the customers, making the moment enjoyable for them, while also adhering to company standards and there is somewhat of a disconnect between partners and corporate office about what exactly is doable and what isn't. It's definitely not an easy ""fast food"" job. It's rough when it gets busy, there's no time for slacking. "
good,"Greenville SC District Managers took little care in employees with disabilities, and were not understanding of those disabilities in the least. Before the disability started to expose its self, the company was sub par to work for."
good,it was a target starbucks. everything outside the starbucks bubble was just awful. target management was pretty much out to make sure we were miserable all of the time.
good,"Work days are very consistent. Clean clean clean, Server server serve. You learn a lot about work environments at Starbucks, about ethics, about no matter how mundane your job may seem you can honestly impact peoples days. Management, varies greatly from store to store. Starbucks culture is one of the greatest I have ever gotten to experience. It is fun, it is engaging, it makes you grow while feeling secure. The hardest part of the job, can be dealing with the repetitiveness of it all. The most enjoyable part of the job is, the genuine connection you make with so many people."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for two years and the company provides great benefits. However, it can be very difficult to get promoted due to red tape within the corporation. In addition, you are only eligible to receive paid vacation days after your first year of working. The job is much more stressful than it seems."
good,great place to work. if you plan on moving up you have to be serious about work. overall had a good time because of my coworkers. hard to get shift covered because some coworkers did not feel that it was their job to help their team which was also very disappointing.
good,"Working in the morning is so much more enjoyable than working at night, that's for sure. In the morning, there is typically adequate staffing and business. The managers and shift supervisors really seem like they care about not only the baristas, but the customers as well."
good,"Starbucks is a great opportunity for anybody looking for security in the job that they work for. Starbucks always has your back whether you need more/less hours or if you need to transfer from one state to another. Starbucks is a great environment to work in, besides the occasional stressful busy days, you'll have a positive experience here."
good,"I worked at Starbucks as a barista and as a supervisor. Overall I think the company and what it stands for is pretty great. The benefits are solid and makes up for the so-so pay. My first two years at Starbucks were great, I had an extremely supportive team and manager so even during the toughest of times work stayed relatively good."
good,"This was a great job. I was promoted from barista to shift supervisor in under 6 months. You get to meet tons of people from all over the globe and do your part to really bring a bit of joy into their day. As a barista, I greeted customers, prepared beverages/food, maintained the store, ran the register/drive through, and other general support functions. As a shift supervisor, I was responsible for making sure the shift flowed smoothly for customers (resolving any issues, being extra welcoming) as well as ""partners"" by training, providing relief for breaks/lunches and being a motivator and general shoulder to lean on when needed. I absolutely loved the people I worked with. The only downside is the pay - the job does NOT pay very well. Other than that you get a 30% discount as well as free drinks on the clock. Can't really lose there."
good,Enjoyed working here but leaving to find a more competitive wage and advance my career. I would stay if I could just get a more consistent schedule. Starbucks doesn't reward good performance but a horrible and a fantastic employee are treated about the same.
good,"A good job if you are in college and need some money to get buy. Like any retail job, the stress comes from the customers but if you can learn not to take your work home with you, you will be okay."
good,"Starbucks is a place where people are expected to expand their roles over time, eventually leading to more contributions towards process improvement and growth for the company in support of the goals for each fiscal year.  This can prove to be quite challenging as more is expected from you with sometimes less resources than desired.  Rewarding hard work is usually done through merit increases and promotions."
good,starbucks is a great company and really takes care of their partners. IT does become challenging to have work life balance and the pay does not always match the level of dedication required to be successful in role. Starbucks has a variety of benefits available to employees and has recently increased the mental health benefit to 5000 per employee
good,"serving customers with their coffee, cleaning and maintaining a clean store. Awesome environment to work in if you're a student or just need something to get you by."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for. I am just looking for a new opportunity. The"
good,The atmosphere was always welcoming and everyone was helpful and you really got to build a first name basis with the regulars. The management was a bit rough but other than that it was an amazing experience
good,"The environment is extremely high paced and requires a bit of patience, especially with the more demanding customers. However, it is extremely rewarding in the sense of community. The benefits are great!"
good,Mornings were hard. Overall a good job to have to begin a career to start your young adult. Its a fastpass environment  which makes the time go by fast!
good,"Requires a lot of cleaning and talking to people. If you're an introvert looking to be a bit more of an extrovert I would definitely recommend working at Starbucks. It's a good start and you meet a lot of people. Good majority of the time customers are fairly nice, except you will still have a rude customer every now and then. Then again, that's everywhere in the customer service industry. Company has great missions and values."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast-paced place to work. The best employee will have a a balance of customer service, task-orientation, and speed with accuracy. The workplace culture is friendly and loyal. Regular customers are legitimate friends with the employees. Great place for an extrovert."
good,"Enjoyed coming to work, and seeing regular costumers they made it feel like a second home. The store is very busy, high volume store in both drive-thru and in the cafe. Partners are well rounded and we all work together to accomplish sells and goals."
good,Working at Starbucks was a great experience and they had a wonderful environment. I personally greatly enjoyed working there and would highly recommend it.
good,"The company is excellent, but baristas are way underpaid. The job is not easy, people have really high expectations that are often not obtainable due to understaffing and poor organizational skills from management. They make it near impossible to advance into high positions. Too many hoops to jump through with not enough pay."
good,"I think most people have been to Starbucks. When learning and training it can be a little discouraging. Once you get the hang of it, the job gets better. Every now and then you get 1 or 2 people that challenge you more than the job itself."
good,Starbucks was my first love when it came to my career.  The love I have for coffee and people made it a perfect match. The environment is enjoyable all aorund
good,"Working at this company i learned a lot of new things, i met new people socialize with. This company has many ways to improve in the company and in life."
good,"fast paced, stressful dealing with customers who haven't yet had their coffee. great benefits including health/vision/dental insurance, 401k and stock options, college tuition assistance, employee disaster bail-outs, employee discounts."
good,"A good place if you're looking for a short time job. You're always moving and have to keep up the pace no matter what. You clean more than you actually make the drinks. You learn how to multitask, keep calm, and strong work ethic. The customers vary from person to person. Coworkers are amazing and love to joke around. Management is a little all over the place but overall not that bad. The hardest part is understanding all the drinks and having to clean like it's no ones business. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with people even if it's for a split second."
good,"Loved the job while in college, but does not pay well enough to be a full time job until you reach the level of assistant manager. It's difficult to move up in the company because they outsource a lot of the hiring."
good,"Fantastic organization of learning and growth.  Rewarding experiences of building lasting relationships with great people/employees and customers.  High pace, rapid change and innovation."
good,"fast paced"
good,I've been with Starbucks Coffee Company almost a year and a half. I love the people that i work with and i love interacting with the customers. Starbucks really does take care of their partners and makes sure that everyday at work is enjoyable.
good,"a typical day at work would be "
good,"As a manager you're expected to juggle the day to day aspects of administrative management while still being held accountable for day to day store operations such as inventory, line prep, cash handling and customer interactions."
good,"It can get hectic at times, especially if working a drive through location and it can also get boring at other times.  Focus is mostly on customer service, service time and cleaning/health code.  Every store is different in its own way but at the same time every store has a consistency when it comes to its product.  Management consists of a store manager and several shift supervisor, sometimes an assistant store manager.  The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job are both the customers.  My current store has very few nasty customers and an overwhelming number of really awesome customers."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work but it definitely is based on your management at your store. Some managers aren't very hands on and you end up picking up their slack.
good,Starbucks is a workplace where you can actually have fun and build good relationship with partners and costumers. It's an extremely fast pace job where sales don't stop throughout the day.
good,"Working at Starbucks Co. will definitely be a job to remember. It has awesome opportunity for those who want to move up corporately and much more space for those who want to stay on the floor to connect with customers first-hand. Great benefits, great staff. Overall a great experience if you have the patience and passion to be there."
good,Working at Starbucks was a good experience because it helped me build my group working skills since the most efficient way to run the store was as a team.
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. You learn a lot about reading signals and working at a fast pace. You learn to look ahead and predict what will happen. Be ready for a challenge.
good,"Great workplace culture that fosters a strong care towards its own employees. "
good,I enjoy the customers at my specific store. I love my co-workers and my manager is fabulous. The only thing I wish were different is the pay. Barista's do a lot of work for their money.
good,"Starbucks is a pretty great place to work with its benefits, partners, and management, but the hours are sometimes difficult and stores are often understaffed, making it slightly more difficult to quickly help customers."
good,"if you can pass the training the rest is easy! if you have a good team, that really helps too definitely makes work more enjoyable.  made me learn how important it is to work up to your expectations when working in a team because everyone is counting on you. what i hated about this job is the workplace culture. people can become very selfish in the starbucks setting and the shallowness of the experience got me over it. also things become very old very fast because you're always busy"
good,"Starbucks is an enjoyable place to work. I loved the customers and got along well with my co workers. The hours were good. You will get pulled to deli bakery if they do not like you or want to get rid of you. When I say they I mean the women over the deli bakery. I would not want anyone to ever have to work in the deli bakery it is awful, miserable, and an obvious punishment to force employees to leave. If you can choose deli bakery or any other Dept. I would HIGHLY suggest you choose ANY other Dept"
good,"I learned how to manage my time well and to work well with others. Its a great work environment with plenty of tasks to complete during slow times. Great way to connect with customers, especially regulars."
good,I love the heart and soul of this company. Most morally sound company I have worked for. Very Inclusive and emotionally intelligent company. I highly recommend Starbucks.
good,"I like working for Starbucks, they genuinely care about their employees. You might want to decide what you put as your job availability though because you might be put to work the 5 am shift."
good,"Flexable work attire. hours are good to find. customers can be a pain, but do tip most of the time. nice benefits though low pay per hour. good job overall."
good,Starbucks will feed you and hand you many tools and  benefits that other employers would not. It is a high stress environment due to the chain being very popular but it  makes the time fly. Starbucks will feed you a meal every shift and weekly you can take an item of your choice (Bag of coffee etc..). The reason why I didn't stay with starbucks was because I needed to earn more money and needed more hours that fit my school schedule. I would recommend working for them.
good,Starbucks was a fast paced environment and sometimes the customers were not easy to deal with. Having a great staff helped but overall it's not a job people will likely want to do long-term.
good,The job starts you at the minimum wage but its a good stepping stone to gain customer service skills and learning to work as a team. I enjoyed learning about different coffee and culture of each product.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that you connect with people. Good way/place to start networking."
good,Great job while still in school and tons of benefits to go along! Stress levels can get rather high during busy rushes but overall quite a manageable level and very reasonable and well balanced management.
good,"The company itself is great. Takes great care of their partners. There is a lot of room for growth and lots of skills to learn. The higher you move up the more you start to see the politics around it, you have to ""play the game""...and it changes based on your manager..."
good,flexible and corporate experience in a fun work environment. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the wonderful diverse group of workers I have had the pleasure of working with
good,They worked with my school schedule in both high school and all through college. If you've got good coworkers it's a fairly fun low skill job that can have a surprising amount of stress at times. Management is very hit or miss however.
good,Alles ist reibungslos abgelaufen. Keine Probleme. Das von Starbucks  verfügte Team war gut.
good,I am a supervisor at Starbucks it's a great company to work for they treat the employees great  The most important of being a supervisor at Starbucks is remembering to follow up with your baristas making sure they accurately complete tasks
good,"This is usually a fast paced, creative environment. You get a lot of short customer interaction and become part of the neighborhood and their everyday life. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unappreciative customers and the best part of the job is the great benefits and perks."
good,"there is always something to do, cleaning, makings drink and or warming up food, helping customers find what they are looking for.  Its a fun place to work."
good,Starbucks is a good company but if you don't have good leadership at your store. I always suggest associate of mines to help other stores out to get a better concept of the business
good,"If working in a Starbucks inside a Safeway you will have chance to receive part time benefits, raise increases based on yours hours worked. If you enjoy people this is the job for you."
good,Had worked for the company for 1 1/2 years and enjoyed every minute of it. Got along with coworkers and had lots of great conversations with regular customers. Being at a neighborhood store helped build a strong relationship with the community and offering me connections outside of work that would benefit me professionally and academically.
good,"Work with great people, got to meet some fun people.  The customers were like family, a very welcoming work place.  Great management, was pushed to do my best.  Some times the hardest part of the job was waking up very early but the work with you on your hours and what can help."
good,"Love the culture of Starbucks and the benefits are great. They offer health coverage, education reimbursement and many other perks like reimbursements for 5k's."
good,"Wake up at 3:30 am to get to work by 4:30 to open at 5:00 and don't go home until the afternoon. Get a tiny raise each year with no guaranteed performance reviews. Never know what days you're going to work next week or if you're gonna have enough hours. Or if you're gonna get the schedule you requested, or if your availability is gonna be respected. No idea. And make every drink, every secret menu concoction and standard-breaking slop, and make it again if it doesn't taste right, and know that the only rule you'll ever get any backup in enforcing is ""make the moment right"". And still go back the next day because you're A Partner and it takes so much time that it's who you are and all your friends are your coworkers."
good,"Nice people, reasonable pay at the time. Great environment. Tips are nice, but not amazing. Overall it was slightly above average. No complaints, it was fun"
good,"I liked working at the Starbucks company it got me to learn skills for making beverages, the management wasn't best the manger left then the person who was suppose to be manger never came in, hardest part of the job was standing for 7 hours In a day, but at the end of the day I was happy serving people"
good,"Management and store was well kept up. Cleanliness and sanitized work environment was taken serious enough to score 96.4% on Qasa. Friendly and respectable customers, who were always loyal and patient."
good,"Starbucks is a uniques experience depending on which store you work at. Some are very fast paced and others not so much. As a whole, the company strives to take care of their partners and customers also. It's a good place to work with some awesome people to work with."
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks. It was fast-passed, the customers and co-workers were, for the most part, enjoyable."
good,I learned that you have to be the bigger person and not allow peoples attitude to mess with yours. I also learned how to work in a face pace work environment.
good,Everyone loves starbucks. The culture there is more modern and hipster-like. It's a great place to work with great benefits. This organization treats military veterans like gold.
good,I have been trying to get promoted at this job for quite some time but now I am realizing that I would like to do something else. Starbucks is a great company that is really supportive of its employees.
good,"the job was cool. Don't feel like they cared that I was in school, they cared more about me working. Even when I had to study. I would never work there again."
good,"Although stressful, Starbucks is a great place to work whenever you are needing something part time. I wouldn't recommend it as a career choice, though."
good,The company is growing to be something great. customers are amazing and the workers are hard working but when you have a manager who is a boss and not a leader its hard to be motivated.
good,"A empresa é dinâmica, favorecendo o bom convívio entre os funcionários e a valorização de bons desempenhos."
good,I learned how to operate the cash register as well as how to interact with customers. I also learned how to make different drinks. The hardest part of the job was getting picky and impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with.
good,"A typical you clock in and get right into work. Usually you get to meet wonderful people and somedays well, you want to quit on the spot due to dealing with despicable customers."
good,"I really like to work with them by the way i have to move my home. so can not possible to make it with them. i still missed them and their job. that is the reason, i'm trying to find a job like familiar"
good,"I had a great time working there it was fun and fast paced. the work was hard but with the right team, work was fun. all In all I loved my time there."
good,"Lots of information to retain and work tone done but the customers and team members make your day keep going. I learned how to multitask efficiently at this job because it is definitely a requirement. It is an enthusiastic workplace, very fun and fast paced. the hardest part of the job was memorizing formulas but after a week or two you know them. The best part of the job is definitely the regular customers because you end up building a connection with them."
good,"A typical day at work is going in, and greeting all of my other partners; seeing where they want me to work. Afterwards, playing my position to ensure customer satisfaction. All while maintaining a clean work station, and guaranteeing the success of the next shift."
good,"Although it has been quite a few years back since I worked for Starbucks, it is still one of the few companies that have  stayed strong in business. A typical day at work was pretty much making beverages and serving it to customers. What I learned at Starbucks is multi-tasking. Management was super. And, it had an ethical background that created good workplace culture. I enjoyed every single day working for the company."
good,It was a nice job to work for considering you could work at home. They had a good process for learning the job including online classes and management availability.
good,"The overall workplace culture is amazing.  The Starbucks community is very welcoming and friendly, it is a great company to work for. "
good,Starbucks is a great job for someone who needs a flexible schedule. They also have great benefits.  Having a good manager is important and will set the tone of the store.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. Very accepting of all walks of life, understanding and respectful."
good,It was the first job i had after graduating and i cudnt have gotten a better start to my career. The knowledge i acquired in Starbucks will forever help me grow.
good,"Great people to work with and its a comfortable environment but can be overwhelming.  Couldn't tell you about the food since I eat from chain franchises. The coffee is something I'm not big on but what from what I had it was pretty good. Overall if you like coffee then this is the place for you plus they have more then just coffee. Like smoothies, a verity of snacks, sandwiches, etc."
good,"This was a great job during my schooling. Flexible hours and decent pay. I had some managers that were better than others, but overall my managers were fine."
good,"In Starbucks culture mostly they delivery legendary services to customer , connect to customer and how to delievery most excited and happy environment every job we delievery"
good,Great workers and great boss very friendly enviorment. Wasn't really hard work just a lot of dealing with rude costumers other then that a great place to work
good,"A typical day at my work place involved a number of different tasks being performed depending on what my shift manager decided to have me do for my shift. Sometimes, I would be stationed in one place, other times, I would perform multiple roles and not be stuck in one position for an extended period of time. The tasks I would most commonly perform would be cleaning, coffee cadence/store support, register work, or bar work. Each one came with a different set of standards and required tasks, some more than others. For example, cleaning would require that I follow not just the local laws and health code regulations, but also those set forth by our company's own health auditing company. Coffee cadence/store support, on the other hand, would require that I follow a strict list of tasks to keep my store supplied and our lobby area looking welcoming and clean. Each role kept me occupied and I was never left wandering around with no idea as of what to do."
good,I had fun at the Starbucks I worked him but it's competitive for hours depending on the store. Do sometimes you can pick up shifts at other Starbucks.
good,This was a great job for students. It had any shift you need to fit a busy life.  The management is very helpful on average and will to help you if you seek to advance in the company.
good,Just like the rest of the coffee shops you are pretty much doing the same thing. Each company has their own products and standards to abide by. They are constantly evolving and producing new product so there is something new to learn.
good,"The culture of the company was amazing!  They prided themselves in diversity on all levels.  They made decisions based on the collective well-being of all employees.  They tried to promote from within and keep people working in the company, roles were designed around a combination of the employees strengths and the needs of the company.  Management would shift around work and duties to accommodate employee interests and they seemed genuinely interested in keeping employees happy."
good,"Pros: Starbucks is a decent place to work for anyone that needs a good work life balance. here's plenty of flexibility, and a slew of benefits. From free premium spotify, to health insurance, as well as an ASU program if you qualify. You also can be a part of the program that allows you to share a small percent of the bean stock after working for about a year or so."
good,"Great overall place to work, not the best management. Great benefits and breaks were never skipped. Management at other stores in the area was great just not the main one i worked at"
good,"Starbucks definitely cares about its partners! There are opportunities for advancement, if you so choose. The discounts are great, the job security is consistent, and they make working in the people business endurable most of the time. However, it is still a hard job. You get blamed for things that aren't your fault by customers, you have to do hard jobs, you have to constantly be on your game and be able to take the fast paced pressure to provide quality service. This job is great, but it isn't for everyone."
good,"I loved this job when I first started working for the company; however, bad management and constant work drama starts to wear on employees. Everyone at my particular store left around the same time due to these issues."
good,"servir les clients et prendre les commandes, jai appris beaucoup sur la culture de entreprise"
good,"The great part of the job is learning how to make all the new drinks. You meet a lot of new people and often get many regulars who come back to the store. You get decent benefits for the job including paid holidays and free coffee/tea to take home every week plus a company discount. If you need more hours you can always work at different Starbucks stores to meet these. The hardest part of the job is often standing on your feet for extended periods of time, however there are always things to do which help time fly by. You also get to work with a lot of people from various backgrounds."
good,"It's all about connecting with customers. Nice benefits, but also you need to be ready work under pressure. Carrier possibility available, just need to show your efforts."
good,"Wonderful company, offers good benefits even for the part time employee. early morning hours allow flexibility in overall life.  Lots of opportunities for advancement."
good,typical days at work are very well planned out and efficient. I'm normally in charge of taking orders which helps me to improve my people skills and the speed in which I take task on.
good,"I loved working here. My manager was amazing and I learned a lot of what has helped me in my job currently. I was very shy when I was hired and learned to come out of my shell. A very great job to have and lots of benefits. the only set back is that anytime I would try to advance I was put off and put off and putt off until after I had already gotten a new job, then I was offered a higher position. If only it would have come sooner."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work with. Great benefits all around. I've been working for Starbucks for 3 years. 1 years with Safeway and 2 with the official Starbucks
good,"Great stop over point in your career. Free school and cheap benefits"
good,"Customers' satisfaction for me is a priority. At my store we strive to give the customers a great experience whenever they come to the store. We know most of our regulars' orders so it gives us the opportunity to have the customers' orders ready as fast as possible."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience. I learned much about customer service and team collaboration. Hours were flexible, and job satisfaction depended heavily on who your management was. In my case, I had a very positive experience."
good,"Depending on the store, each place has it's own unique feel to it. Talk to people who work there already to see if that particular store is a good feel for yourself. "
good,"There's always something to clean, and usually corporate has something new to add to the menu for all baristas to try and learn how to either make it, or how to pair it with existing drinks. Regulars are always coming in and talking with you and other customers, which is nice to look forward to. I learned that making menu items and serving menu items take very different skillsets. In store management is great, but higher up was a little hard to understand. Everyone working in the store end up very close and everyone was always happy to be at work. The hardest part of the job was meeting corporate standards during rush hour times. The most enjoyable part as a barista was talking with people about their preferences of coffee and tea."
good,"The Job and responsibilities were good, individual management at certain locations could be improved. The people that work at Starbucks are focused and caring which creates a great work environment."
good,"Sodexo is a huge company and provides many benefits, great staff to work with. Each year you must attend a mandatory meeting and it recaps us on our purpose. A job isn's just something you do for money, but something yo should take pride in."
good,"Company ranked 3rd best company to work with. "
good,"Long hard days provide rewarding results for you and the field.  Managing all major areas with expected high results was stressful.  Looking for the right approach to grow areas to manage itself was my goal, making it bullet proof.  Little time allowed to do so and then move on."
good,"I worked at the Starbucks on campus at UNT and loved it. It is a perfect opportunity to meet people, learn multitasking and communication skills, and learn more about coffee. A typical day included making drinks, serving food and beverages to customers, managing the bar area and back end, receiving and stocking inventory, and cleaning. The culture was great. All the baristas liked working with each other and met outside of work all the time. The hardest part of the job is learning all the drinks and dealing with the crazy rushes but other than that, it is a great time."
good,Working as a barista was very fast-paced and provided me with good tools to help me in my future work endeavors. I also enjoyed the ability to get creative with different beverages and to make customers happy by being wanted (I was after all the one making their coffee)
good,"Great company to work for. Incredible benefits, Good working environment, and free drinks while on the clock. Would have preferred a store not inside a mall."
good,Awesome place to work once you find the store that fits you. Drive thru stores are the busiest. Cafe stores are where you wanna be if your just starting out.
good,"It's good if you get along with everyone, the costumers can get really rude only bad thing about that job and lifting some heavy things like milk and ice"
good,"I enjoyed my experience here for the most part, but had issues with feeling supported through higher positions. This could break the most hard working employee. My work team was awesome, and the new products and system updates kept you on your toes, and created a fast, fun environment that you felt good to stay on top of to share with customers. Every store had  a somewhat constant traffic flow which it was really important to stay well staffed for. You could do well if you enjoyed the company and wanted to put in the years."
good,Every day was different. The hardest part was time away from family. Enjoyable part was meeting all these great customers. Seeing others on my management team move on to be managers themselves
good,This is a very popular place as you know so it is often very busy and fast paced. Usually customers are impatient and you have to move fast to keep the customer happy. The staff members are sometimes friendly but can be mean in stressful situations.
good,"There is no ""typical"" day at Starbucks. Rushes come at different times from week day to weekend, while the number and size of transactions vary daily. Management has never been consistent in terms of following procedure for corrective action which led to unreliable workers and exhausted staff who did commit to showing up and working hard. Although Starbucks offer their employees exceptional benefits, the employees seem to be replaceable to the management. The hardest part of working at Starbucks is the unpredictability, but it has taught me to think on my feet and solve situations calmly while a team looks to me."
good,"I started working here for the benefits as a part time employee while going to school. I ended up becoming an asst manager based on my skills in a very short amount of time. I wasn't looking for advancement, but it really helped out the team and store culture for me to advance"
good,"Es un buen ambiente, grato, es desgastante mucha presión, sin embargo la flexibilidad en los horarios es muy buena. Me tocó muy buenos jefes, sin embargo los sueldos son bastante bajos para lo que uno entrega en el día a día."
good,"Starbucks was able to provide me the support I needed during that time in life. I met a lot of friends, and every step of the way you are supported. The best part about Starbucks was that it paved a way to learn customer service, and the free tea and coffees every two weeks!"
good,I had a zero hour contract so I could work as much or as little as I wanted. I was health and safety trained and also I was till trained. Being on the till allowed me to improve on my communication skills.
good,"I enjoyed the many people i met whether i worked with them or served them. Made many friends from this job. The benefits are great. I enjoy what the company stands for and their mission. It was a bit frustrating that some leaders didn't follow it or believe in it. Maybe its just this area because I didn't experience this from where I originally started. Went through 4 different district managers within a year. My promotion that was promised kept being dragged on and passed around. Although the company has a great training system, this district and many stores do not follow it which creates a frustrating environment, both for the employees and customers."
good,"In general, I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. During a typical shift, I would be responsible for taking orders, making drinks, and restocking supplies. I also learned how to empty out the cash register and document monetary transactions at the end of certain shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with a variety of customers and making custom drinks that weren't on the menu. However, the hardest part of the job was having to work with fellow employees who did not take their job seriously--which on more than one occasion, left me doing 2 to 3 different jobs at once."
good,"Rewarding with customer and partner interaction"
good,"Es un trabajo entretenido, bastante grato y acogedor..."
good,"The company is great and treats their employees incredibly. I have worked in two different districts for the company. One seemed a lot more focused and dedicated to making sure everything runs smoothly, while the other lacked in organization and communication among employees."
good,Good start up company for those willing and wanting to grow with in the company. This is for you . Only thing is you start as a part time so be aware. Over all really GOOD .
good,This establishment was very well run!  It was fast paced and efficiency was key.  The customers were a pleasure and the staff made the job such a great place to work!
good,"Project momentum and decisions can sometimes get slowed down by confusion within leadership review and approvals. "
good,"Employees were wonderful to work with.  Everyone is very patient and understanding.  All employees like to give a helping hand."
good,"Very fast pace work environment."
good,starbucks is a great company to work for. the customers and employees together are very outgoing the store was very clean and kept. The discounts and benefits from working at this establishment were great.
good,Amazing work environment and very friendly people.  Managers are fun to work with and are always understanding with employees.  Training program is awesome
good,"Pretty standard for retail/food industry.  Fast paced work when busy, hours are flexible, but they vary depending on your fellow employees schedules, and your manager's whims."
good,"Working at Starbucks Coffee Corporation can either be an amazing opportunity to learn the major ins and outs of corporate politics, the retail industry and help you develop some very useful skills. Or, it can be your worst nightmare, it all depends on your own personal goals. If you are looking for a job just to get you through college or need a little extra cash then Starbcuks is for you. If you are looking for a career then I suggest you look else where. The work load is overwhelmingly demanding for the very low hourly rate that they pay however the medical benefits, paid vacation, opportunity to dabble in the stock market and the promise for advancement opportunity is the juicy carrot that the corporations dangles in front of you to help ease the aggravation of such stressful work and inadequate hourly pay. But those benefits come at a cost, and almost %100 of the time the cost outweighs the benefit."
good,as an employee who grew with the company for the time spent i can say that it showed me true leadership skills and the ability to present myself and also teach others a great way to not just evolve but nurture the true customer experience.
good,"Starbucks is an environment to thrive on customer experience and connections.  Training for the position was very knowledgeable, challenging and exciting.  Getting to learn coffee not only as a beverage but also as a sustainable product, environmentally used.  The product knowledge  for customers to experience something different from any other coffee company."
good,"A typical day involves making drinks for customers, brewing coffee, and keeping up with maintenance of the storefront. Learning how to make drinks has been a rewarding and fulfilling part of the job. The most challenging part of the job is working in a timely manner, as there are so many moving parts. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and learning each regular customers favorite drinks."
good,"As a shift supervisor, I am heavily involved in all customer service experiences. We not only offer great coffee, but great food, pastries and environments. We take great steps to ensure our coffee is of quality."
good,I was pleased with the job for the most part. It was stressful at times at the location I worked in. It was nice receiving food and drink for free while I worked. I had a great team that worked pretty well together. Overall a good job.
good,Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. Walking into work everyday you are greeted by all the friendly analysts and managers. Not a day went by where i didn't enjoy coming into work because i was always learning something new and always had help available if i needed it whether that was their excellent tier 2 support or management.
good,The fast-paced environment requires great attention to detail and excellent client relations.  Perfect for sociable multi-taskers. Not suitable for those with back or knee problems.
good,"Typical day i serve coffee to our customers and giving my best to serve them and make their starbucks experience memorable"
good,"I have worked for this company for many years over the last decade. I greatly enjoy their culture and benefits plans even for part time employees. They've developed and enriched me as a person, and I am grateful. However, my career goals do not lie within Starbucks. I plan to pursue my MS in Psychology to become a professional counselor."
good,Great benefit while working with awesome crews. Some store has drive-through which means busier than those does not have. One great thing is you always getting you know your position and other people are willing to help you improve yourself.
good,"My experience at Starbucks has helped me to really understand the inner workings of modern business. While working as a regular Barista, I was promoted to Night Shift Lead/Manager. Assuming that position, duties of my role included, compiling shipping and inventory data and properly filing and faxing the relevant information, receiving weekly truck order, ordering the next truck, as well as other basic managerial duties such as handling employee matters. I loved how fast-paced and energetic the job almost always was, as we were a top performing store for Ingles Markets' Starbucks, but I was not 100% thrilled with the conflicting managements styles from Ingles as opposed to Starbucks--because their was direct management from both companies."
good,I work for the Pizza hut and Starbucks inside of Target. It has been a great experience learning to deal with the public and take on  my task as a worker. There is so much room for advancement in Target.
good,a good solid job that provides fair pay and more than adequate benefits. It allows me to have a flexible schedule and work as much as i need to.
good,"Apres avoir pris sa boisson quotidienne, on rentre directement sur le floor avec une ambiance agréable. La journée s'enchaine avec pas mal de rush mais toujours de la bonne humeur !"
good,"Co-Workers and Team Leaders/Management are very friendly and helpful. The two week training is informative and a good work speed. Unfortunately you cannot get a pay raise until you are working there for a year, but there are advancement options within the workplace. I enjoy working with my co-workers and satisfying our customers the most."
good,"The Starbucks at which I was located was in the heart of Liverpool Street Station. The majority of our customers were regulars as they worked in and around our shop in the offices. From time to time we had many tourists from all over the world coming in which was lovely as I am a very cultural individual. I learnt many things in my time there mostly self confidence. Dealing with the public is such a great thing but there are occasions where it may become difficult. I noticed if ever these occasions arose, the management within my shop always dealt with it in a professional manner. I love meeting new people so to have colleagues of all different nationalities ans backgrounds was really pleasing. The hardest part of my job was having to tell regular customers we had sold out of their favorite ingredients. Although they was always understanding and content, it wasn't ever the nicest feeling as I built such great relationships it often felt like we was letting them down. The most enjoyable part of being a Barista was most definitely interacting and meeting the public because not only does it help with self confidence, you are always meeting a different kind of person."
good,I was able to work and pursue a degree with ample support from my management and coworkers.  There are many opportunities for position advancement in both part and full time positions.
good,"Fellow employees were generally helpful and made the job fun.  good workplace culture, but the quality-of-life was different with each manager.  The bureaucracy of getting promoted past shift supervisor was formidable, from what I saw co-workers go through."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for.  I enjoy engaging conversations with my regular customers.  Boosting sale is my priority.  Getting to know my customers wants and needs to better support the company.
good,"A typical day at work was fun and enjoyable, but serious and goal oriented. I learned precious customer service skills and problem solving skills that have helped me in every job that I've had since. The management was amazing. All of my co-workers were very fun and inviting to work with. Great educators. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the demand, but I got the hang of it after a while. Also trying to keep up with my schooling and maintain proper grades while working was a struggle as this job is very demanding. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting a very diverse group of people, seeing my regular customers and helping with tasks."
good,"A typical day of work for me is 70% of my time being spent on taking care of customers. Taking orders, suggestive selling, making orders, engaging with customers and keeping the store clean and stocked are what I do the most. The rest of my day is doing daily tasks that I have assigned myself or my team to complete. Such tasks like heavy cleaning, building store displays, making or changing signage, markdown items and the like. Also I would do daily or weekly management responsibilities such as taking supply counts, sales forcasting, ordering and receiving products, inventory managements, employee training, scheduling and staffing and so forth. This is a customer service forward business so it requires you to be your best at all times and give the best service no matter what. That is the key to success."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks consist of greeting and taking the customer's order. The way in which you greet each customer will determine if they return again, they usually come back if they had a great experience. The co-workers are friendly and easy to work with, overall working at Starbucks had thought me to have patience and take one day at a time. It is a fast pace work atmosphere everyone has to be on their toes and alert at all times."
good,"It's a good enough job for those about to be working an hourly wage job either way. There's a revolving door when it comes to staffing, which is probably the hardest part of trying to supervise there. It's fast paced and customer focused which I always liked, makes the day go by faster. Coworkers can range from typical under performing high school kids, to way over qualified college graduates waiting to land their ideal career."
good,"You have to have a very loving amount of patience to work at a Starbucks. The best part of your job will be your co-workers; there's a small family that forms among you in the face of the physical and emotionally strenuous hardships that come with this job. I do want to say, if anyone important is reading this, that Starbucks really should compensate their Shift Leads more money. They do nearly everything the Store manager does for like, less than half they money."
good,Starbucks I've  worked there for years if you like a place that promotes repeatable routines then Starbucks should be a prospect. Easy to get  promoted and move up the company ladder. The company provides opportunity to develop your academic skills and also interpersonal skills. Starbucks is very flexible with scheduling and vacation time. The only thing that was very challenging was that the location where I worked was very busy at times and in my view was understaffed my partners and I had to work twice as hard on some days while dealing with the occasional crazies that enter the store.
good,"Bonne entreprise, environnement de travail agréable, capacité d'évolution"
good,"During the time I was there I really didn't have any trouble.Lunches were given as needed. Ten minute breaks were given as well, not really any complaints."
good,While working at Starbucks I grew as a person and was able to develop many new relationships with customers and coworkers alike. Every day was a new adventure in the uplifting world of coffee and tea.
good,"Working in Starbucks was a great experience, it was my first job and I learned a lot. You need a lot of patience and a lot of desire to work, it is stressful some times but it is worth it."
good,"Great to start out fresh specially with a brand new opening store. It was also a restaurant and served salads and sandwiches.  My favorite was their ice cream.  I enjoyed putting the store together, and generally working for them. I transfered to another starbucks, and I wasn't disapointed, I like the staff. they always hire energetic people.  Should of stayed. but I changed my jobs often because I was trying to make ends meet and go to school at the same time. Starbucks didn't pay much back then."
good,"Overall Starbucks is a company that cares about their employees; however the compensation is not up to par with other coffee chains."
good,"Make sure there was coffee brewing every 15 minutes. Always restocking lids, cups, syrups, and  wiping down counters. Making sure coffee beans were refilled. Always checking if front fridges temperatures were accurate. Hard part of the job was keeping up with the cycles of restocking and brewing."
good,"dealing with people that need caffeine is not always pleasant, but good times outweight the bad. how you feel about the job will mostly depend on how well u get alon with coworkers. very team heavy involvenment"
good,"A typical day consisted of making coffee, and working as a team delegating and completing the daily tasks. It was very fast paced as we we're across from a convention center. I became a master multitasker."
good,"- My day at work was busy and challenging"
good,Great working environment and great leadership. Very fast paced work and training is constant. Must be a driven individual to succeed in these stores.
good,"Aside from my manager, most were actually great to work with and wanted to help everyone succeed at what they wanted to do, the general consensus that Starbucks is an easy company to for is both true and false, its easy in that the tasks are easy to learn and one can learn to love it, its not easy in that even though one may know how everything work, the sheer volume of customers can be like a tidal wave that you need to get through. Now, personally I thrive on this and made it work for me to help teach me great multitasking skills"
good,"Fun place to work, with a great company culture and benefits. Best part of the job is the people you work with, and the amazing connections you make with customers everyday."
good,"I started out as a barista and worked my way up to a Supervisor. My day consisted of ordering new stock, cash handling (deposits) and finally providing the legendary Third Environment that Starbucks standards live by."
good,"Grato ambiente laboral con respecto a los compañeros, pero mala relación entre trabajo realizado versus el pago retribuido."
good,"It's a company that provides opportunity for all ages, race, color, and creed.  It's a company that know how to develop budding talents."
good,"There is nothing bad I can say about Starbucks. it's a great company to work for with benefits and flexibility. I learned a lot about professionalism, time management and responsibilty."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Starbucks, however there is hardly any opportunity for advancement within the company. The fast paced environment was something I truly enjoyed and the regular customers were always a friendly reminder of how a chain store can feel very local."
good,"Paperwork, delivery, orders, stock control, customer service and team leading in a very fast paced environment. Due to high staff absence I have been called in on my days off all the time. Fair salary and benefits however the job is really hard if you would like to do it properly."
good,"A typical day at work involves every facet of the customer service experience at Starbucks. From setting up coffees, teas and pastries, to serving customers and making bar drinks you get a taste of every job title. The work environment is amazing. You build relationships with regulars which gives the job a more personal feel. "
good,"Starbucks offers a great environment for anyone willing to put in hard work and dedication. It is a very active job which can be overwhelming if you are juggling other areas of your life such as school, but the experience which Baristas have varies widely depending on store location and volume, whether or not your store has a drive-through or is only a cafe, and your coworkers and superiors in management. At that, in my experience, scheduling was very flexible and accommodating."
good,management was spiteful when my uncle died and I missed a shift because of it. people were negative and did not take direction. customers are rude and don't care.
good,"A typical day at work would involve making a lot of drinks, as well as interacting with hundreds of customers in a shift. I have learned more about customer service through this job, as well as being able to sequence drinks for better efficiency."
good,"A typical day is very busy, you're on your feet for pretty much the whole shift. I learned how to make the drinks, run the cash register, maintain the store, and work as a team. My manager was THE best! She taught me how to do all these things, as well as my shift supervisors and my team members. I really did have a good store and laid back environment. Most enjoyable part of the job was people stopping in their tracks and saying that your drink was the best they had ever tasted, or bringing their friends in to brag on you. Hardest part of the job was the some people worked harder than others...but that pretty much happens at every job."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work where you get to meet tons of new people, practice valuable life skills (team work, promptness, quality of service)"
good,I really enjoyed working there. I enjoy meeting and getting to know people. I find that the different backgrounds and cultures make for interesting topics of conversation.
good,It was very helpful in learning about interpersonal relationships and how to communicate effectively in stressful environments. The opportunity for upward mobility is prolific if you are willing to work hard and commit to the job.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. I believe that there is a lot of opportunity for advancement. Also, the job security is phenomenal. The customers are great to interact with and so are my fellow employees. The only thing I could complain about is the pay. I wish it was a little higher."
good,"It was great in a lot of ways,but changed often.  It was great for networking and able to work around schedule changes. Coffee was interesting so there were no little seminars and what not offered, which was fun."
good,"The starbucks I worked for was an absolutely wonderful working environment with supportive coworkers and awesome management. Benefits are great, pay, meh."
good,Starbucks offers very flexible scheduling. Benefits are ok. Its a great place to get entry level customer service experience. Fast paced environment that helps develop multitasking skills.
good,"Fun place to work, some hard physical work, but rewarding every time you get to make a refreshing, delicious beverage to every single customers likings."
good,Starbucks is a great place for students and those who wish to make a career out of it. They're incredibly flexible when it comes to work scheduling and the ever-changing school semesters.
good,"This company is great, especially if you are in college. Tons of rules, tons of guidelines, but honestly couldn't complain much. Hours got tight, went from full time to part time in the matter of a week."
good,"Training focused"
good,"Started out as a barista made it upto manager in 3 years. Good if you can work for Company Starbucks but most are now franchises without a clue after working for both Company and various franchises I would avoid them at all costs."
good,"Food service is hard in general. While pay and benefits are amazing, Starbucks signature culture that comes across so inviting to customers does not always linger between partners. My work environment is passive aggressive and extremely unprofessional and my hours very from over 30 hours one week to less than 20 the next, which is difficult. "
good,"As a Barista - the beginning position at Starbucks you are taught how to make all their great drinks.  You are also taught the history of the company and how they got to where they are today. Coffee tasting is encouraged, if you can drink coffee.  "
good,"A typical day is warm and welcoming. I've learned various types of coffee and non-coffee blends and teas. The management was friendly, fun, organized, professional, and clean. Co-workers were helpful and worked hard together to achieve customer satisfaction. One of the hardest parts of the job was the barista training book and one of the most enjoyable parts were knowing dedicated everyday customers and what they enjoy already upon arrival without asking."
good,Working for Starbucks is a fun job to do! I loved it and worked there for years. When I decided to find a career I left Starbucks but still keep in contact with former coworkers and customers I've met along the way.
good,"A empresa tinha um grupo unido, fechado e que você podia confiar. Todos tinham muitas qualidades. Aprendi muitas coisas boas, com todos, cada um tinha seu jeitinho e te ensinava alguma coisa nova, de ajudava de algum jeito diferente. O único problema era sair as 23h."
good,really amazing people. you will meet different people everyday talking to them giving the best coffee that i made. exchanging knowledge to other people is interesting both of you will be knowledgeble.
good,everyday was amazing different people everyday the smell of coffee was great and to see how they made it was great i enjoyed my time there everybody is friendly
good,"I loved working with coffee and I'd love to work in coffee again, but with much better pay. it was very hard to making a living out of working with such a low pay rate."
good,"I did everyday barista duties including; preparing beverages, cleaning, customer service, sales. It was a fun job where I developed many of my interpersonal skills."
good,"Tolles Team, ab und an etwas chaotischen wegen Schichtübernahmen."
good,"If you work at a store where your manager does not care, then the work environment can be difficult, however, if the manager cares and is willing to put in the effort and time (to do their job correctly) and development the employees, it can be a great job. The labor hours had been cut down a lot over the 5 years I worked for the company, enough to be felt if the shift happened to be 1 person short for even a small amount of time (ex. on lunch break)."
good,"Was a great company to work for,  but to many managers not enough crew members. They always wanted you to come in to work,  but to cover all the shifts that people just quit on."
good,"staff is what makes starbucks so great you and your team will make it or break it. if you have one person thats negative, then your whole team feels it, hardest part about starbucks is making sure everyone leaves with a smile. ive learned to be very patience because not everyone is the nicest person in the am."
good,I enjoy working at Starbucks. The hours are flexible and the benefits are great. Occasionally the customers are a bit much to deal with buy mostly the environment and team is fast paced and enthusiastic.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. You learn organizational, social, math, cash handling and administrative skills. A typical day at Starbucks is about what you'd expect; taking orders, making drinks, keeping the store clean, doing inventory, etc. Management is overall satisfactory but can be a mixed bag. I've had amazing managers and managers who made everyone (employee and customer,) miserable. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace and remembering specifics when it comes to drink specifications. The best part of the job is working with a good crew, and of course the AMAZING benefits."
good,"Although the job was the same, everyday was different. The customers, especially the regulars, are what makes this job great. Making coffee and giving a boost to someone's day is what makes the job enjoyable. There is no such thing as cutting corners. The hardest part of the job was taking the verbal abuse from the not-so-content customers, but I had amazing partners that I worked with and we helped each other get through it."
good,I started working there when i was on break from school. I was there for over 2 years. i enjoyed meeting and building a relationship with both the customers and my work associates.
good,"Working here was the best job ever. I just could not work here anymore because they were not trying to relocate me and I couldnt work there and go to school in seattle at the same time. If i could, I would do it all over again."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work with if the individual is trying to finish school. The work load is somewhat too heavy for the pay but the benefits are great but are only available to full time partners.The amount of work needed to be done each day is overwhelming but it gets done.
good,Sometimes it would be quite busy and hectic but I always knew I could rely on my team. Every store I worked at had a great team. I received a great deal of knowledge about coffee while working there. The management in many cases weren't the best. It often felt like they weren't even there; spending most of their time hiding in the back away from the work. This was the case in many stores that I worked at. The most difficult thing on a day to day basis was making everything run smoothly. Sometimes we would be busier than we would have expected to be and so breaks might get a bit behind. As a supervisor it was my job to ensure that this didn't happen. It was also my job however to ensure that the lineup moved as quickly as possible. Trying to find balance between my customer's needs and my teams needs could sometimes prove to be difficult. It was my team and the regulars that would come in would make my day. They were always so joyful and happy to be there. Seeing their happiness always brought a smile to my face.
good,"I started off at a drive-thru location in Texas and transferred here after a year. I got lucky with my store, coworkers and manager! It's a great place to work, and great way to get to know so many people!"
good,Long hours. Requires great problem solving skills and the ability to think on your feet.  Need to maintain a high level of professionalism even during times of uncertainty. Need to be able to work with limited direction.
good,I love this job but am looking for something that is more consistent.  I love the customer service and fast pace of the job.  The partners have truely become family.
good,"A fast paced workplace where thinking on your feet is a necessity. Always meeting new people and building relationships as well as a stable clientele. Although fast paced, the atmosphere is also laid back. The team are all focused on creating quality product for customers in a timely manner and doing so with a genuine smile."
good,"I miss working for this company. It was great! I was able to transfer from state to state very easily if/when I moved, and it always had the added benefit of helping me make new friends quickly. A great culture and work-life-balalnce."
good,"Over all Starbucks is an interesting fast paced work environment, the management had a lot of tips and tricks to offer. I would definitely recommend the company Starbucks to any future possible employees."
good,"Working for Starbucks was amazing, the benefits are fantastic, but the only thing I didn't like and other co workers felt the same about was poor management. As a manager you should have pride in your work and not take advantage of it. Other than that I loved it, the atmosphere, the customers, the co-workers and culture behind every blend was just great to be around."
good,"Hardest part of the job is when you realize that you go to work in fear rather than going to work excited, why? fear of complaints from the customer and fear of higher managements demands though your salary does not cover any of their requests."
good,"Nice working with good people in my store.  Starbucks has good benefits.  Hardest part of the job though is the closing schedule since you need to clean the store after closing.  Most enjoyable part of my job is you get to meet a lot of people while working, talking to customers and knowing their favorite drinks.  In Starbucks, we are not just making a good cup of coffee but mostly giving the best customer service to all our customer."
good,"I really loved my regular customers that came in. I got to know there drinks, family and they became friends. We had different jobs each time we worked so it was a lot of fun getting to know each of the positions."
good,"It is a madhouse during a rush of 60 or more people per hr everyday, and more on the weekends. Management is always changing and unstable so it made it a little difficult to move up. The atmosphere is nice to work in."
good,At work a typical day can go by quick depending on business. The most enjoyable part of my job is that with every passing customer it gives me a chance to interact and meet new people.
good,"a typical day at starbucks consisted of learning about the many different types of coffees,people, and management styles. Like in any business you have you good managers and your lazy ones. what i learned during my time at starbucks is time management , team work, and most of all first impressions mean everything. My co-workers were sweet individuals for the most part but a major problem was that gossip and  ower managment faliure to communicate issues lead to unwanted additional problems. The hardest part of working here was that the poor training program caused alot of confusion among proper drink proccedues but i can honestly say work felt more like a home than a office"
good,"Most partners I had the pleasure of working with from Starbucks have been amazing but it's mostly the management that can ruin the experience. For me, it's just the district management ignoring our needs and cutting our hours. It really makes the shift difficult when you're only working with one other person all night and you have to still complete leftover work from the morning. I love being a shift and interacting with customers and my partners on a personal level and getting to know new and different people every day! I also enjoy the responsibility being in management gives you. My favorite thing to do is probably inventory because I really love organizing things and making sure we always have product helps all shifts run smoothly."
good,A typical day is making espresso beverages and cleaning the store. I have learned a lot about coffee and tea. I work with folks that interact excellently with each other. We tend to work to learn about each other lives outside of work. I like most about the job is knowing the customers by first name and remembering their drinks. It makes the day feel like a day with family and not strangers.
good,"Buen ambiente labroal, Buenas prestaciònes pero horarios muy amplios"
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work where you would adopted into a fast-step working environment as always. One of the major reasons that I choose to Starbucks is the flexible working hours it is able to offer while taking care of my family. Since my daughter is old enough for school, mommy suppose to find her truck back to the career."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, and you definitely have the potential of staying at this job for awhile. Most people that work at Starbucks have been there for a couple years, including myself. You will learn how to multi-task and prioritize certain tasks on a daily basis, and depending on how busy your store is you will be working under pressure."
good,It's a fun place to work and it was perfect for people who's moved form place to place. Great place to meet people but unfortunately you have to work hard but they ain't pay enough.
good,"Located in Samaritan Hospital in Moses Lake, WA. this is a great place to get volunteer hours and work experience. Flexible hours for high school/ college students. a great opportunity anyone should take for experience and volunteer hours"
good,"-always enjoyable work days- days went by super fast"
good,"I like the fast paced environment"
good,"Starbucks company is build on such a great management structure everything is laid out. When paired up with the store that suits you , coming to work is like hanging out with friends! When you need a shift to be cover you can reach out to other partners as well, this makes it ideal for students that are still in school."
good,"My coworkers made sure to teach me everything I needed to know, and they made working there very everyday very enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at Pac sun is very fast paced since customers are demanding.  I learned to approach every customer with enthusiasm. Supervisors and higher ups are the nicest people you can meet. they are very helpful and reliable.  The hardest part was helping women find clothes, yet the most enjoyable part was seeing the satisfaction of helping a customer."
good,"Depending on what location you work at, the great demand is usually in the morning shifts, when many people go to get their coffee. Customer experience is fine, you do get some good tips sometimes which is then split amongst your coworkers each week (you get your share depending on the hours you worked). It is a fun job overall, it is pretty much a fast food environment, a kitchen. Overall working is housekeeping, wiping down counters and washing dishes, restocking products, preparing syrups and counting food items. It is a good job for a school person, a part time job, having to talk to management over school schedule is fine. I took this job because I like to give good customer service and I enjoy how people give me their trust. I also enjoyed starbucks' environment in the lobby, something very distinct from what happens behind bar. Meeting diverse customers.The hardest part of working for starbucks as a barista is working under hard pressure. Sometimes I have to work at double bar, (iced drinks and hot drinks have separate bars) and it is overwhelming sometimes. I work besides a really big church and you get slammed with customers on sunday afternoon and I have to work on drive thru by myself, taking orders, handing them, preparing drinks, etc. It is physically demanding, having to lift heavy coffee ground bags and boxes to the dumpster. It has been my first job so far, and I have learned much about kitchen, food, and customer service."
good,"I've been there for years and it's been different each year but I do enjoy that with all the hassles of labor tasks and customer service we had to provide they cared about they're employees. Lately it's been more about numbers and things don't have a better flow anymore. But overall insurance is pretty good, co-workers are okay, and they are doing better numbers."
good,very positive work environment  with good management and lots of benefits such as free drinks while on shift and discounted prices
good,Its a fun job that requires you to have to be a people person. if you cant handle people being mad at you or talking to you please don't apply. it will destroy you.
good,"I got hired at Starbucks 1 year out of High school.  I had a couple of previous jobs but this was the first big corporate entity I had worked for.  It helped me tremendously and as it helped shape and sharpen my abilities.  The company had not yet been under new oversight and the atmosphere was amazing.  The ability to work at any other corporate Starbucks location on the fly was great for picking up extra shifts or to help cover shifts--a great tool for management."
good,"the atmosphere at Starbucks is great - other baristas are friendly, the customers are often lively and happy. The job is fast paced, but not overwhelming. The treats are a perk as well."
good,"It was an all around great experience, the customers were great, coworkers were great. Positive Outgoing atmosphere. work day was very very long, very fast paced. if you enjoy jobs like that this is perfect for you!"
good,Very fast pace for a typical day. I've learned to get my job done well and fast. Management was great and the same for my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was not getting to overwhelmed with the daily work. Having a lot of fun throughout the day.
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for from a benefits and big picture perspective. There are great benefit packages available even to part time employees if they need them. It is clear that the upper management cares a lot about the people working in their stores. "
good,"Not much to say other than that. Great place to start off and start saving for your next career, great benefits! Stressful work environment and fast paced settings."
good,Starbucks provides a very welcoming environment where baristas have the freedom to add their personality in the workplace and essentially allowing them to provide a personal individual service to the customers. This liberation is what makes the customers become part of Starbucks every day.
good,"Store Managers are the work horses of the operational side of Starbucks. Your management/admin time is 8 hours a week while still maintain your barista position. This can be challenging to many leaders brought in externally. The company has moved in a direction of ""satisfying the barista"" while the managers feel the pain. The company has forgotten that Managers are partners too. Advancing from Store Manager to any other role is incredibly difficult. All Store Managers are required/strongly recommended to have the District Manager position before entering a support role. The company is a wonderfully perceived place but has some inter workings that aren't quite thought out by senior leadership."
good,"- fast paced environment, always busy, always something to do. "
good,"My overall experience was nice.  The culture there tends to favor clicks.   I loved the customers, but the manager had her favorites and they always got the best hours."
good,"On a typical I make drinks and work the cash register, I enjoy the people that I work. The hardest part about this job is remembering all the drinks and how to make them."
good,"Flexible, especially when you are a college student. Co Workers are great and hardworking. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable customers."
good,Starbucks is an enjoyable experience and with all the benefits; I have to recommend to anyone to apply to work here. I have learned tons about the products at starbucks as well.
good,"-Great environment  "
good,"A typical day includes stock check, and coffee preparation. In more detail: setting the espresso beans in the machine and checking the pastery cabinets. It also entails making sure the cash register is ready to go. The first couple hours is a rush as people get their coffee and run. It's fast paced and loud. I got along with most of my coworkers. There was a problem with gossip, but for the most part it was fun and light. I got recoginized by the owner of the Starbucks of San Diego for excellent service to customers and smiling and thanking each customer."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. I have been there for 9 years, and worked my way to managment. Customer Service forward, always striving to make the customer happy."
good,"Starbucks provides a supportive, positive, driven workplace.  Work/life balance is good (but manager dependent).  Compensation is lower end for area."
good,"Here at Starbucks, we call each other partners, and as partners, we must be a team player and we work as a team that is why we have this deployment which the manager will tell us of what task we will be doing depending on the transaction during lean hours or rush hour. For me, everyday is a learning journey so everytime I go to work, I challenge myself to learn and know more about the company I've been working to."
good,Usually always busy and have to be able to work at a fast pace while keeping customers happy and satisfied. The co-workers are all very nice and treat each other like family.  Can sometimes become a hectic job and requires a lot of work. But the work place is always in good spirit and the supervisors and managers try to make each day fun for the workers(partners).
good,"Great place to work but more for the young!   Hectic, fast paced, and not enough pay, but great people, good benefits, and great coffee!"
good,"For me, a typical day at Starbucks was getting to work at 4 am, setting up and opening the store, coaching and directing baristas, delegating tasks, helping customers, and handling the stores money. I learned a lot about multi-tasking, and remaining calm during times of stress. The management is different from store to store, I have had some great managers and some terrible ones. My co-workers have always been amazing, I would butt heads with some of them occasionally but we always had each others backs. The hardest part of my job was the stress. Being a shift supervisor is a lot of responsibility and if something went wrong it was on me. I was held to a very high standard and I feared letting my boss down. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers, they were all such kind and caring people. I still talk to all of them every day. They will always be my team and they will always hold a special place in my heart."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you can handle the work load. Fast pace and high volume! But its a good time. Typically the people you work with really do become your Starbucks family. The hardest part of the job is honestly some of the customers. After all it is a customer service job so you are dealing with people from all walks of life and not every one is happy to be there they just want to get their coffee and get out. But if you can let that run down your back and move on with your day youll enjoy it.
good,"I Greatly enjoyed all my time working at Starbucks from when I started as a part time barista through now as a store manager. Its very hard to get a work life balance with the stores always being open. it does have a lot of advancement options once you get to the management level but it is retail based food service and it is easy to get ""burnt out""."
good,"Starbucks was a fun and outgoing environment to work in, but the management wasnt all that great. Very picky, and hard on workers."
good,The Way you Can Turn a Person's Bad Day Into a Good One After You Made Them Their Drink to Perfection.The Job Taught Me Self -Discipline and How To Manage Different Personalities of Customers That Come Into The Store.
good,"Love my job, it got me through college, and while being a shift or barista is a wonderful way to jump start one's career, it is not a permanent position. Unfortunately the only way to make it a career out of either of those jobs is if one is able to have a second job, or a spouse or partner with whom to share responsibilities. Unless of course you are planning on being a store manager."
good,"This is a great opportunity for me as my first job.Since I worked at a neighbor community area, my co-workers were super friendly, we hanged out a lot and had parties, I was luck that I got in."
good,Starbucks is a great work environment with great customers alike. The Baristas create great relationships with customers to make everyone feel welcome.
good,"its all starts with the morning smell of coffee. ive learned cash management, handling, and how to properly deal with angry and unsuitable people and sutuations."
good,"It's honestly a really fun job, where you meet so many great people throughout the day. You get to hone verbal skills while connecting with customers. My co-workers were fantastic, supportive, fun to work with, and driven people. I was usually an opener/morning person, so I'd get there and do all of the morning tasks, then deal with the bulk of the morning rush, after that died out, we would focus on recovering the store back to standard(clean and stocked). This job taught me the very meaning of multitasking, allowed me to perfect my customer service skills, meet lots of interesting people and gain connections, and put me in the fastest paced job I've ever had. The hardest part for me was the feeling of advancement wasn't there. It never seemed like opportunities overly presented themselves, so that I may better myself. But, what I absolutely loved about this place was being on bar and making the drinks and talking to our customers while I did so."
good,"Starbucks is a really neat place to work due to the amount of people that you are able to meet, the friends that you make while working there, the great life lessons that you learn along the way, and cultivating a passion for incredible coffee."
good,"The average day is waking up at 3:45am or so and going into work at 4:30. My first task is to setup the pastry case to feature the pastries of the day. By the time that is finished the store opens, and we begin to see customers very slowly until it picks up at around 7am. Before it picks up I will go through and ensure other partners have been keeping up with their cleaning tasks and are up to date on the standards for health and safety. Past 7 I am put onto bar to make drinks. Our store is the second most busy in the state of Virginia out of 240+ stores. As such I am regularly expected to put out as many as 80 drinks every 30 min. After work, I will go home get some food, and go to school."
good,"Overall it's been a great place to work. The hours aren't too bad, though the slow time of year has caused some problems, I get along great with my coworkers, and the job isn't a very difficult one. I've learned a lot about the job itself, but I've also done some specialized training and obtained my Coffee Master certification as well as my Trainer certification. My manager is still new in the position but she has done well for the most part. My coworkers are all pretty great. I guess the hardest part of my job is dealing with the unhappy customers that come through at times, but it's part of any job. I love my team in general. We all get along well and the shifts tend to go by pretty fast."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are in College or looking for a second part time job. "
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for they offer great benefits. Perfect job for a student. Flexible scheduling and the manager is extremely friendly and welcoming.
good,Starbucks is a happy place to work. I enjoyed working at Starbucks even just for 3 months. I have learned so many things especially when it comes to our customer.
good,"In a typical day at work, I touch the lives of 500 or so customers. I make them smile and help them start their day off on the right foot. I manage my team's performance and allow them to deliver exceptional customer care. "
good,"In a typical day at work, there will be extremely slow periods where very few customers come in the store with intermittent rushes during meal hours. During rushes, the job can be stressful; a successful Starbucks employee should be able to multitask and collaborate well with his or her coworkers. This is probably the hardest part of the job with is overall very easy and straightforward. The most enjoyable part of the job is conversing with the customers, so this is defiantly not a job for people who do not have good interpersonal skills."
good,An enjoyable employment that is fast paced and required a flair for the artisanal. It is rewarding to see customers satisfied with the end result of your handcrafted beverage.
good,"Friendly and fast paced environment, which allowed the customer and barista to have the right amount of interaction allowing both to have a high rate of satisfaction."
good,"Life at Starbucks is great. You meet new people, you interact and you make beverages. The staff and manger are great fun to work as they are really helpful as a team."
good,"Well Organized Organization"
good,Excellent place to work if you're a young adult about to go off to college or for Adults who are taking college courses at night.
good,By far the best job i've ever had. Loved the regular customers. Team members are always happy and great about working as a team.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is having conversations with customers. They give me some advice to succeed in studying.
good,"if you are not willing to brown nose, you will not advance. Starbucks can be a good company to work for. South Florida is not that area."
good,"When I first got hired at Starbucks, it was amazing. I had alot of fun, my coworkers were very friendly and it was easy to manage my time off requests. As time went on, however, the managers became very strict and it appeared as though I was being targeted and taken advantage of. Towards the end, I was treated unfairly and not compensated properly. I did alot for this employer and in the end I do not feel I was treated fairly."
good,Team is very friendly almost in all stores. The work is not so hard. Most interesting for me was stay on the bar. Most hardest was waiting when work is slow.
good,Fun work place. Enjoyed the job and the crew I worked with. Learned skills into becoming a skilled Barista. Also developed skills in working to help maintain company guidelines. Compensation could have been better
good,The company takes time to value its partner. The staff and co workers are great. I would definitely re-apply.I loved my experience. I had to learn how to multitask and work very hard.
good,"A great work life balance,  nice environment to work in. "
good,Management seemed to have more control of individuals careers than should be allowed. Fun work environment. Very little chance to move up past shift manager.
good,They allow you to build your schedule and can work around your lifestyle and needs. Unfortunately you only receive minimum wage. Stock and benefits are great but they don't add up to the overall stresses that the job can place upon you. Definitely a good place to start and search for other means of employment. Better for those who are looking to climb up the chain of command or receive some managing experience.
good,I was a certified barista.  The benefits were some of the best I work for and enjoyed all the great people I worked there with.  I still enjoy the memories of working there.
good,"Working with some of the best leaders in the company, I had a fantastic start to my journey with starbucks. "
good,"if you are young or in between jobs and are looking to cut your loses then this is a job worth considering.  Work days are between 4-8 hours and consist entirely of standing and repetitive use acitivities.  "
good,"A typical day at starbucks is hectic and fast paced but always worth the while. I learn each day as a supervisor about my strength and weaknesses at work, learning how to put them aside and thrive off what my strengths are. Management is thoroughly engaged and always makes sure that we are ready for our day and that customers and our service is the main goal. My co-workers have become a family, seeing these people more than you see your own sometimes allows for bonds to grow and theres no better feeling than to feel comfortable with people you work with. The hardest part of the job is the days when nothing seems to be going right and in starbucks a lot of machine malfunction and break apart so thats always the worst moments. The most enjoyable part of working there is the customers, you get to engage with new and different type of people all day with the common share of a love for coffee."
good,Very fast paced environment and good people to work with. The company offers great benefits and perks as well as weekly markouts for partners. Great incentives and retirement plans as well. I enjoyed being a part of the company greatly.
good,"Typical day would be going into work with a positive attitude and a smile on my face."
good,"A typical day at work for me started at 4:30am. "
good,Good place for young people. Feel as though advancement can only happen if you are a favourite of boss. Management can be hit or miss here. Every store is different.
good,Starbucks is a great company for offering great benefits to their partners. The advancement opportunities are always available for those that would like to advance and show promise and ownership.
good,Starbucks probably one of the best retail companies you can work for. Great (office level) benefits and pays fairly well as far as retail goes. They don't have unreachable standards and tend to hire people who only benefit the culture of the company.
good,"This was my favorite job. Everything overall was amazing. I loved my coworkers, management, the atmosphere, and would love another opportunity to work here again."
good,"Commencement d'une journée assez mouvementé dans les heures de rush de 8h à 10h et de 12h à 14h30. Le management est bien organisé, les roulements ce font à des heures précises. Pour ce qui est de mes collaborateurs, il y à une très bonne ambiance, du respect, de l'entente donc un travail d'équipe bien organisé. L'aspect que je trouve difficile mais réalisable est le lieu de préparation des commande à la clientèle, il faut resté dynamique, rigoureux en même temps toujours être a l'écoute de la clientèle et la fidélisé. Le poste où je me sent ""à l'aise"" est à la prise de commande et l'encaissement de la clientèle, c'est dans ce poste que je peut conseillé et mettre en avant de nos nouveaux produits auprès de ma clientèles."
good,Starbucks taught me a lot about serving and customer care. I was always busy learning or completing a task and was able to connect with new faces everyday.
good,"I love the environment, job model, and being able to serve the customers quality food and drinks."
good,I worked for Starbucks for one year and ten months. I had a wonderful relationship with my coworkers. The atmosphere always had a happy feel. We were a fabulous team who created relationships with every customer. A typical day was stressful but exciting. I always had fun in one way or another during my shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a wonderful team.
good,"At first with the initial rush of information (beverage info., pastry counts and customer connection) this job really takes off! The best part about being a barista for Starbucks is the never ending knowledge you can gain. As long as you apply yourself and make time for learning, Starbucks will match your enthusiasm. From coffee culture to hospitality, this job has never ending benefits!"
good,"I got a degree in  Biology in Italy. "
good,"I loved working for Starbucks actually - it was a great position and I learned a lot - The environment is outgoing, productive, positive, and enjoyable! While working here I advanced rather quickly moving up from a Barista to the Assistant Manager within a short time. The management classes provided by this corporation is fantastic and offers a very solid foundation for growth both personal and business."
good,"Operational management is very interesting. Lot of communication with operationnal. "
good,Starbucks was a young company with good benefits and pay structures I meet a lot of people that passed in there experiences I enjoyed working there.
good,"Very high paced job with lots to do and remember."
good,"The Starbucks experience (as an employee) depends entirely upon the location at which you work. Busy, drive-through stores that are located near highways or on college campuses will be stressful and un-enjoyable. Cafe only stores will be much easier to work at and also will be less stressful (tips are also usually higher). However, opportunities for advancement will only be found at the busy stores."
good,starbuck coffee was  the enjoyable places  to work and get so much wonderful expirience when we always work as a team and always interact with customer and also coffe lover.
good,"El ambiente laboral siempre fue positivo."
good,can be very stressful at times especially during promos and holidays. lots of fun people to work with.management isnt bad but is a struggle to find good work life balance. overall not a bad place to work.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, se fomenta mucho el compañerismo y los jefazos son muy educados y te tratan bien. Se pone esfuerzo en que se trabaje a gusto y que ese buen royo se transmita al cliente, que ve Starbucks como un lugar con un ambiente relajado y divertido."
good,"I spent over 5 years at Starbucks and learned a ton about customer service, multi-tasking, and overall hard work there. I was able to work and complete by BA and internships during my time as a barista. "
good,"Starbucks was a neat job. It was my first fast paced job and it became overwhelming at times, but I truly enjoyed It, and the people I worked with. Starbucks is also a very good company that takes very good care of their employees. I learned a lot of necessary skills I am going to need in my future careers. I have also became a lot more interpersonal with others."
good,Pay is terrible but the provided benefits are amazing! Really the only issue I have had with Starbucks is the pay everything else has been amazing!!!
good,"Starbucks is a decent company to work for. Job advancement is always offered to every partner. Also inquiring about job advancement is usually the best method. The down side to Starbucks is the staffing situation. Most times stores are extremely understaffed, which makes things for the partners stressful. Also Starbucks only pays minimum wage for all the work you have to do."
good,"Starbucks has one of the best benefit programs for it's employees. Health, dental, tuition plans, paid vacation, 401k, stock options, and even bonus pay. As far as part time jobs go, they are very generous. The job can be demanding though, especially if you work in a busy store, and the scheduling isn't usually consistent so you need to have a flexible availability if you expect to get good hours. Though the work is tough, it's never boring. Its a very busy work environment with little down time but if you're looking for something a little more involved than your run of the mill fast food job, then its perfect."
good,"a typical day at starbucks would be relaxing but at the same time fast paced with customers."
good,"My days working at Starbucks were always full, never a idle moment, it was very fast-paced place, however it was also a fun place to work, the team that I worked with was incredible."
good,"Great fast-paced company with awesome core beliefs!"
good,"its okay if you have a good manager."
good,Fun work place! Management actually cares about their employees & there is definitely room for personal growth in the company.
good,"Fun place to work, invested in helping employees develop. Very good treatment of employees, good benefits, but making minimum wage isn't very fun no matter how you slice  it."
good,"This is a great job and company to work for. I currently work at the franchise, but have worked at corporate before. The corporate has great benefits such as dental, vision, and medical. The company handpicks the baristas so we are all top notch and love our jobs!"
good,"fast paced,  pleaser to support  costumer service "
good,Fun fast paced work environment.. The management were helpful and supportive. I loved being able to make a connection with the customers on a daily basis. I like the busy locations the best as it keeps me on my toes and occupied. I also like being able to work in a team setting but having your independence too.
good,"This job teaches you the basics of customer service and retail. Since it is corporate, there are very specific ways to carry out roles, teaching you about attention to detail."
good,"It is my pleasure to help customers find their needs and get to know new people either co-workers or customers. In addition, the managers are so nice and trying to fulfill their employees needs in order to work hard for them without complaining."
good,"Starbucks is a GREAT company to work for.  They really do take care of their own, with full benefits and very flexible schedules.  Your experience will vary based on your shift supervisors but they do have District Managers in place to monitor that things are being done the way they're supposed to... so if something is wrong speak up, the company is very good with feedback.  The only set back about working at starbucks would be the ""CloPen"" when you close the store then have to open the next day...you get no sleep and no life. There are bratty customers from time to time but that's everywhere.  Honestly just keep smiling and have fun making drinks, the creative outlet can be rather stress relieving.  Have fun here and focus on boosting sales, your manager will thank you for it and it'll help you climb the ladder!"
good,starbucks is a good place to progress. the environment is good lots of regular customers is a good way to better your skills.
good,"It was an amazing experience. Learnt a lot about team work and how we could put efforts together to achieve a target."
good,"I've worked at two different Starbucks stores regularly in the year and a half I have been with the company. Most days, business is predictable, but there are certainly moments where employees have to kick it into overdrive in order to keep up with the flow of customers. I've learned to listen for what the customer is looking for as well as what my coworkers need from me throughout the day. Management has been different at both stores I've worked at. The previous store I was at, management was a little more lax and kept employees' personal lives in mind. At the store I'm currently at, management neglects the employees' personal needs more. The hardest part of the job is managing issues that arise with customers. In this case, good communication is necessary between everyone involved, otherwise everything becomes more confusing than it should be. However, for me, the most enjoyable part of my job is the regular customers and learning to make their drinks in addition to getting to know them."
good,"supportive management."
good,"Gracias a empleos como este he aprendido a trabajar en equipo, conocer otras culturas, también a la hora de organización y saber que puedo dar mucho de mí en próximos trabajos."
good,"I love my coworkers at Starbucks.  They're my second family, and my best friends.  The job itself can be hard at times, but overall, it becomes second nature."
good,"A typical work day would be fast pace, non stop working, hours would go by so fast. I enjoy working for this company. There's plenty of opportunities to advance in this company. With a supportive manager and team this job would be golden."
good,Hit or miss depending on the particular store you end up in. Benefits are generous and flexibility is great. It can be as good or bad as you make it but the job itself is pretty good for the industry.
good,not exactly comfortable with the pay. Especially with the 10 min breaks for a six hour shift which is just basically only enough time to use the bathroom at least 15 would be reasonable.
good,"you can never have two same day in a week as its a fun and exciting place to work at plus you get free drinks, what more one can ask for :)"
good,"Fast paced customer service job. Hand craft a variety of drinks as well as warm up foods. Connect with customers on a daily basis. Work with others as a team to deliver drinks to customers correctly and in a reasonable amount of time for lobby. Deliver orders to customers in drive thru quickly and correctly, while taking orders from other customers. Keep store clean, neat, and organized. Be able to deal with and resolve customer complaints."
good,"As an opener, meaning I came in to work at 4:00 am, you began to truly appreciate coffee because it sometimes the only thing keeping you going to get through the shift. Mornings are great because all you have to worry about is making sure the drinks are made perfect to order, the food is served hot and ready, and you are getting the morning customers in and out so they can travel on to their busy day. You don't have to worry about the craziness of closing with the insane cleaning and taking apart every bar machine. You just get to give people their coffee, and you get a satisfactory feeling that you are helping them get through the day, just like everyone else is. The cleaning at night was exceptional, you were always scrubbing, your hands are always wet, you're always sticky and trying to identify what the stain on your shirt is. Management was exceptional at this location, the GM was extremely kind and was always there for everyone else. Shift managers were great and were never micro-managing and let us do what needs to be done, because there is alot of trust in this job. Honestly, the hardest part of this job is what we got paid. We get paid enough to barely make ends meet, but I still rely on my daily free shift meals to eat, without them I honestly don't know what I would do. For anyone self-sufficient in paying bills, not some teenager who is working at Starbucks for the fun of it, this is not a job where you can feed your family on. I can barely feed myself thirteen cent ramen at the grocery store. To end on a good note however, the most enjoyable part of this job is"
good,"A typical day of work includes cleaning tasks and creating inspiring moments in each customers day, providing high quality beverages on a timely manner and acting with integrity and honesty to promote Starbucks culture. You need to respond to customers needs by constantly evaluating the environment and customers for cues. Management was ok, often wouldn't follow my availability but almost always corrected to it would. Co workers were amazing people. Very ease to connect with and to have a good time while working. Hardest part of the job was when customers would come to workers with questions regarding the app. We are not trained with the app so we had limited knowledge of the app and many clients got frustrated. Most enjoyable would be creating those inspiring moments every day and giving them their coffee they would need to get through the work day."
good,"Most days are awesome. Making a quality cup of coffee is always a treat to do, and then to hand out to a customer. I've learned how to multi-task a few things at once, customer service skills, and maintaining a positive attitude no matter what the situation is going on around."
good,I spent lots of time working for this company. I wish it was like it use to be back in the days. I loved it had so much from made friends with locals. If it wasn't for Starbucks I wouldn't know who i know!
good,"This job was so outstanding on so many levels;"
good,"My first and only english job so far which was really hard to get. I was suprised I had to go through so many steps to get employed. "
good,"Out of all my previous jobs, Starbucks has been the best."
good,"Fast paced job, of taking customer's orders and making their beverages. Became good friends with some of my fellow baristas. Learned a lot about customer interaction. Very flexible work schedule."
good,Tons of potential for growth withing an extremely strong concept with outstanding benefits.  Does require a good deal of schedule availability.
good,"En Starbucks se aprende mucho del trabajo en equipo, y las buenas relaciones interpersonales.Disfruté mucho el trato trabajador-cliente, mis compañeros al igual que yo disfrutábamos tener que vernos seguido, sin embargo el trabajo de igual forma desgasta bastante físicamente .Yo supe mantener en equilibrio todo, nunca me sentí muy cansada, pero sí creo que es importante tener un personal exclusivo de limpieza. Porque creo que es un poco incoherente tener mucho cuidado con la limpieza y a la vez tomar bolsas llenas de basuras, lavarse las manos e ir a preparar bebestibles o calentar comida. "
good,"Generally fun people to work with, management is generally pretty good as well. Lots of opportunities to engage and talk with clients. Pretty much unlimited free coffee/beverages is a plus, as well as sampling new food items is delicious! Good opportunities to learn for those who want to advance within the work place. Pay is minimum wage though, but expected considering its retail. However, there is very good health/dental plan and other perks."
good,"This place is far more enjoyable than other restaurants to work at, customer's tend to be nicer here especially if you can remember their drinks. Tips are also quite good."
good,It was fine. Really just okay. They expect to much of their management team. The team was good. but the higher up you get the more crazy it all seems
good,"Great fun place to work and meet new people. More than just co-workers. Only downside was my manager made it tough on the whole store with the scheduling, so it was time to move on. Not all Starbucks are the same."
good,Great benefits but pay does not really compensate you for all the responsibilities and the fact you are ALWAYS on call and required to cover a shift if someone calls out at the last minute and you are unable to find a replacement. I felt like this job took over my life and left me continually stressed. Starbucks is a great company to work for but the Store Manager has the hardest job in the company!
good,Starbucks is great to start off in but eventually turns into a not so great place. Its ok as in work wise but overall its just bad.
good,"I loved Starbucks. I loved with because the pay we pretty good and my coworkers were always great to work with. But the pay needs to be raised for what we had to deal with. The customers were sometimes rough. The homeless can be a little violent, the store needed repairs."
good,"Being with the company for three years I have seen a lot of areas where Starbucks can improve and where it truly thrives. Their benefits are some of the best one could hope to have, especially since they are offered to part-time partners. The level of job security is great, especially in our current economy. It's difficult to be let go of from this company. The management could benefit from better training and better applicant screenings."
good,my co workers are all young the management is understanding and there really isn't a hard time of the day when you know what you should be doing.
good,"Running a Starbucks store can be a challenge and rewarding. Running a highly motivated driven team is very important for success of the business and amazing customer service. The management team is strong and the communication has to be strong so that any issues can be solved in a timely manner.  Coaching every employee and making sure management is on par with the latest training is very important as well.  I have learned alot from working for Starbucks. From better time management to better organization skills, communication and giving back to the community."
good,"Overall it is a good job at Starbucks. I feel the company does not pay partners, especially tenured partners, their real worth. Also promotions are based on favortism."
good,"It is a good place to work, everyone you work with at starbucks are always nice they'll always take that shift you can't take or don't want."
good,"Amazing place to work, extremely fast paced with the work speed."
good,Starbucks provides great benefits for it's partners.  The company promotes a great team atmosphere and customer service. The relationships made with partners and customers is great.  Wish the company had more team development in place.
good,"-Medical, dental, vision, 401k all available for part time employees"
good,"I was able to work as a team with all me coworkers, learn how to up sale products,and order products for the store, handling money and deposits."
good,"Everyday I set up my store for the busy day ahead and make sure there is product to last to avoid us slowing down during the very busy morning and late afternoon and get everything set up so the employees coming in later have a smooth shift."
good,"A typical day at work for me would include coming in getting an update of the day from my managers and making sure all employees who were there were either leaving work on time or that they had received their breaks. After being caught up on breaks I would then focus my attention to the food counts. Each night the shift supervisor is required to pull fresh pastries to be ready for the next day, and then to do an inventory count. After the inventory count was completed I would send the current employees on breaks/meals. Very often covering their positions. Throughout my shift I am also taking orders, cleaning, making drinks, and helping out where needed.  "
good,"The leadership/management, as is the case for any job, ultimately determines whether this is a great place to work or not. I have had great managers and horrible managers over the years. The job itself is mostly fast paced, very hands on, and you have to learn how to do more than make a great cappuccino. Some of the best and worst customers come to Starbucks."
good,"I won't lie, I loved working for Starbucks. Changed happened very fast as soon as I got hired; typical day of work consisted of helping customers with their requests and delivering awesome hand crafted drinks. I was very happy here until management changed. First manager was awesome, second manager, was a bit disorganized and spiteful. My coworkers were the best part of my job; Only those that work at Starbucks can attest to the wonderful times we all have together, hardest part of the job was dealing with very though irrational customers and standing on my feet for 8 hours straight, and towards the end, dealing with a wrecked store. I will never forget this place."
good,"days can get stressful if it's really busy"
good,Managers come and go due to not being knowledgable. Employers leave because of the managers. There is a lot of laziness coming from the store managers. Over all an amazing company to work for just lacks knowledge on who to hire and keep around.
good,"I worked at several different locations and some were different than others when it came to the most identifying feature of a typical day: how busy it was. A typical day didn't include time to do much besides work, work, work because it was so busy. Even the slowest stores were very busy. I didn't know my co-workers or managers very well because there simply wasn't time for talking much. Being busy was probably the most enjoyable part of the job, though. I did everything from prepare drinks and food, to run the cash register, to train new baristas, to doing customer service. I like working hard; being busy. Being bored is...well...boring."
good,"Opening the store and preparing to serve coffee all day starting at 730 am.  Ive learned multi-tasking, management skills, communication skills as well as being able to get to know a person just by the cup of coffee they order every day.  The co-workers are a variety of students and full time staff but mostly students.  The hardest part of the job is ensuring that everyone is following the Starbucks Standard.  The most enjoyable part is learning a variety of recipes and getting to know customers on a more personal level.  You get to know peoples stories and understand the lives they lead. In return they get to know the same about you.  You end up becoming a familiar face all around town and it allows you to feel comfortable and loyal knowing that people return with their business simply because you have shown that you care."
good,Multitasking is a must in this position. Not only customer service but inspiring moments in customers days over a cup of coffee. The challenge I have is talent acquisition with the low pay rate.
good,This job was hard because you have to be fast yet know the menu even if its just coffee its different type.  I liked the overtime pay its great.
good,"- Enjoy working in a team setting"
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic place to work, with some of the best benefits of any public company. They treat partners with respect and provide full benefits to part time employees. The experience of managing a store, however, can vary. You're given full control of your store, within company guidelines, and complete control of hiring partners. Depending on the density of your market, however, partners may be taken from your store and placed in your store without your consent, including supervisors. This can happen with very little notice. Although we were expected to work ""as long as needed to get the job done"" often times the district manager would imply that working 6 or 7 days a week was expected. Supervisor hiring was limited by headcount, not availability, so often times if someone was sick or unavailable, this meant no coverage unless I came in. This often resulted in multiple 12-16 hours days. The district manager would call on days off and after working hours to complain about a handprint on the glass door. Work/Life balance was nearly nonexistent, and making plans or scheduling things outside of working hours is risky, again, depending on your district manager. The overall company culture, I believe, has the right idea in spirit."
good,"It's an amazing place to work and is very flexible, so is always an option. "
good,"Supervising a cafe is a multi faceted role, where no two days are the same, and each shift has a new dynamic or factor to consider, Never lacking in things to do, it keeps you constantly moving and adapting to the needs of the customer."
good,it was a great experience all around.... I love the fact there was no end to the combination of beverages you can create... fun upbeat young energy
good,"High stress work environment. Must be efficient in multitasking and have a high tolerance for customer service. Very repetitive day to day routines and corporate's policies and procedures are high in standards. Other than that, the benefits are amazing and if you like a fast work environment you would like Starbucks."
good,"Good benefits package, good customers. Feel varies from district to district, though. Promote from within. Overall good coworkers, but always some less so."
good,"At Starbucks people like their coffee an exact way and everyone differs.  The most interesting thing I have found about most Starbucks and their employees across the USA is that if you are a ""regular"" almost all the time the drink you prefer is coming off the employs mouth because they know you.  Starbucks is definitely exceeded in making their costumers feel special.  I experienced so many smiles and thank yous because of this, it always seemed to brighten that persons day and usually ours it was always nice to be in crisis and have our regulars telling others that no matter what we will get it right.  The hardest part being overwhelmed with people at certain times of the day took ture team work and was almost like watching a dance.  we often came out of the ""rush of people""covered in sticky substance head to toe. (Hence our dress code black and brown)"
good,"A typical day at work for me is to go in before daylight, count tills, clean and stock the espresso bars to prepare for opening. I oversee baristas while they, fill the food case and make coffee and teas for the morning. After I make sure my baristas are ok I step to the backroom to place the orders and pull the frozen food out to unthaw to sell that afternoon. "
good,"A typical day at work is hectic and long but also one with many laughs great conversation amongst workers and customers. I've learned more than enough multi-tasking skills, being able to remember to complete up to four or five things at once. The hardest part of this job is to always remember to breathe, but also the best part of this job is the people and environment."
good,"Overall starbucks is a good company, with great benefits and many oppurtunities to grow. A typical work day includes lots of cleaning, organizing, dating products, making coffee, serving hundreds of customers and preparing food. From the start of my job ive always loved my co workers. we all go through the same thing everyday and have a lot of similarities outside of work so we all learned to respect eachother. The only thing i would ever change about starbucks is the way our corporate handles certain conflicts with customers and baristas."
good,"Fast pasted, high demand coffee house."
good,"Very demanding job but it comes with very generous benefits. Work life balance is within your own control, but difficult to manage in some cases."
good,I learned how to handle doing multiple tasks during peak stress hours. I have learned how to deal with angry customers who haven't had their morning coffee while also learning how a simple smile can make someone's day.
good,"providing excellent customer service and beverage quality"
good,"Any place you work where you must serve other people food or drink is going to be rough. Not everyone is ever always happy, and that can make it hard. I've learned a great deal on how to deal with people  in many situations, and not just customers but my co-workers as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the regulars and seeing their faces when you make their day perfect."
good,"Working at Starbucks Coffee Company has been a great learning experience. I will take, and use in my daily life, the valuable time management training. It is a skill that can adapted for virtually any situation that has time constraints."
good,"It's food service. Take it or leave it. Great flexibility, great opportunity to meet people, plenty of perks like benefits and free stuff. Serving people can suck. People are rude, inconsiderate, selfish, hurried, ignorant, the list goes on, but you take it with a grain of salt and get their stuff for them so they can leave. Management is hit or miss. There are plenty of great managers and plenty of worthless ones. It's almost impossible to lose your job. You can no call no show, be late, act up, do nothing and its up to everyone else to pick up your slack. And the CEO makes controversial political statements that we as shareholders so all agree on, so that's a pain but overall pretty good place to work."
good,"Great discounts on coffee and tea. Busy and fun work environment, Meet awesome people, learn about fair-trade and organic products."
good,"Overall great workplace "
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks would consist of constantly serving a range of customers from different backgrounds and providing excellent customer service. This was the most important part of the job. Furthermore, the working day would also consist of making beverages and keeping the cafe clean to look appealing for customers, as well as keeping the store stocked up."
good,"This is a great job if you are in school, or an artist."
good,"I loved working for this company. They had a great training program and many different employee benefits. It was, however, difficult to move up in the company past a certain point."
good,Working here was greatest time of my life! It was always quiet and I had time to myself sometimes it wasn't after hours but I liked it a lot. The hardest part was being assistant and afterwards throwing out things like teeth that still had gums attached.
good,It was a great first job. It was easy to move up from barista to a team lead in little time
good,"Responsibilities:  Customer service (food/drink preparation, financial transactions, and handling customer complaints); shop duties (open/close the store, maintain clean and welcoming environment)"
good,"A typical day at work consisted mainly of creating and delivering an exceptional cup of coffee or drink with the highest standards of customer service.  I learned a lot about making espresso and steamed milk drinks. Also I learned a lot about the hiring and training process of a big company- it was very thorough. The management was hit or miss, as several mangers were very qualified for their positions but many should not have been in their positions. This seemed to be true of the employees: there were many great partners who cared about their work and were enjoyable to be around while contributing to the overall goals at work, while there were many partners who did not care about the product they created or their personal additions to the daily operations. The hardest part of the job was encouraging some partners to do their part. If you care about what you do, you end up picking up the slack for the people who don't.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a lot of people (including co-workers) and taking pride in your work at the end of the day."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would be fairly busy. With our customer count ranging from 450-530 between 8am and 11am, things would sometimes get a bit hectic. I have learned that the entire Starbucks Experience was mainly developing relationships with the customers. Most customers knew me by name and vice versa. Our supervisors were very cooperative with the baristas. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with all 450-530 different personalities in such a short time span and still keep your composure, especially when something would go wrong with their order. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting to see the customers you developed a relationship with and by making their day through a cup of coffee, a pastry or just being able to have a conversation with them."
good,I like working here co workers are fun and customers are very friendly. Free coffee is a plus and flexible schedules and tips are great to. Managers are very helpful and will work with you on your schedule and needing time off.
good,"H & R Block, if in the right office, can be one of the most interesting job/careers one can have. The amount I learned from this position is astonishing. Most of the general public has very little knowledge or understanding of taxes in the US and for that I am incredibly grateful for the position I held and the time I worked with them."
good,"Good coworkers but a lot of drama. Good management, costumer service has its ups and downs its part of the job."
good,"I have become a barista in such a short amount of time. After making drinks for just two month and cashiering I have achieved a plethora of coffee knowledge that I never even cared about. I have built a great rapport with the frequent mall visitors who are great to see when having to deal with the sometimes rude customers that visit. Starbucks at Northlake has a very team oriented staff who will go above and beyond to make sure that everyone is comfortable and not over worked even if the day is understaffed. The management makes mistakes as any other companies management team does but they are willing to admit and take care of them when necessary. Although the hourly rate is ridiculous, especially for those fast learners like myself, I will have walked away with a new set of skills when I move forward."
good,"Working at Starbucks is all coffee and customers. Keep the coffee coming and the customers are happy. It's a pretty busy place to work, but in my experience most employees are really great to work with. You learn teamwork really quickly if you want your store to run like a well oiled machine."
good,"Typical day is pretty busy, deal with over 500 customers by the end of my shift. I learned amazing customer service! Management is very helpful when they need to be. My co-workers are amazing and very bubbly. Hardest part of my job is making over 1000 drinks a day, most enjoyable part is being with my favorite customers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of bar-tending, money transactions and providing customer service to clients. I've learned patience and how to listen and provide what the customer has asked for. My co-workers were great very friendly people. The most enjoyable part was making a customers day just by talking to them and making a drink that they love."
good,"a typical day at work means to catch up on performance and pending reports."
good,Team oriented. Has high standards with their products and customer service.
good,Lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es la cultura y la pasion con que ven la marca es muy padre y me encanta
good,"Free drinks!! Cool employees ever changing menu and training-"
good,"Typical day at work: create specialty drinks, customer service, cash handling with computer-register system, maintain facility cleaning tasks."
good,"Having coffee in the morning before starting work is my typical routine, that's the thing who make me smile at you or to anyone, and of course to keep me awake."
good,"Ambiente creativo, relajado y optimista."
good,"The scheduling is flexible and you learn a lot about how to work with all kinds of people ( customers and co-workers). Peak hours can be stressful and it takes a while to get the hang of things, but people are very supportive."
good,"- fun and dynamic work environment"
good,"Pretty much your standard barista job. Make coffee, serve customers needs, clean things, sell things."
good,"Incredible Culture, people truly come first in this company.  "
good,"I love making quality drinks for customer's, It makes me feel great knowing that the customer will expect a nice drink. I like the sounds of thank you have a nice day every time I make someone's day. The store can get busy a lot but I do what I do which I make a drink one at a time, connecting with them. Customer service means a lot to me."
good,"A great place to work. "
good,"I would make endless drinks or work as a cashier. "
good,"Uma empresa que seguramente pode ser um modelo de excelencia operacional, utilizam ferramentas que tornam o padrao de atendimento mundial muito conectado. A missao 'e nutrir e inspirar o espirito humano, e os funcionarios, cada um deles, fazem parte dessa gratificante tarefa e responsabilidade."
good,Passionate in everything as per work.A hardworking and a fast learner.
good,"Good job job for a student to have because of flexible scheduling. Also, if you are a morning person this job would be a good fit for you."
good,"It is great for students, very flexible hours and schedules but not something to you want to make your career. If you want to grow in the company you are better off applying as a manager as most are hired from outside the company."
good,"most days you see and connect with your regular customers"
good,"At Starbucks I have learned a lot about people and how to properly serve those people. I have built great customer service skills because I saw how positive or negative interactions have effected the customer. Being a shift supervisor I am both, the partner and the customers resource to listening and fixing problems. This job has amplified my critical thinking skills ten fold. After working for this company for so many years, I feel I am able to take a great deal of knowledge away about how to properly and professionally deal with customers and maintain a calm presents towards my other coworkers and customers alike."
good,Always meeting new people and introduced to so many things at this job.
good,"It was very straightforward and for the most part employee friendly as far as benefits, but it was slow as far as advancing and pay raises."
good,"Every day at Starbucks is a hurricane. Busy days are nice because they go by quickly, but being a closer on those days sucks because nothing gets done and we have to stay late. There is a constant feud between closers and openers. Openers don't think the closers do enough to set them up, closers are frustrated because openers don't do any tasks and they can leave when their shift is over, not when the work is done. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers and the stress of the job. It's difficult to remember that it is just coffee. The way the customer treats it they act like we broke their kids arm, but really we made their drink with 2% instead of nonfat. I've been called every name in the book, and had hot coffee thrown at me. Despite all the gloom and doom of the job, Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. You get consistent raises every six months, there are endless perks for being a partner, you get a free pound of coffee or tea every week. Your co-workers truly support you and genuinely try to help you. Managers attempt to make schedules as flexible as possible for your life. I have learned a lot at Starbucks. It has brought my work ethic and my standards higher."
good,Daily routine consisted of providing great customer service.
good,l like the fast-paced work environment and interaction with hundreds of costumers.
good,"I have worked at two different stores now full time and have enjoyed them both in two different ways."
good,"This job has me face to face with the public everyday, and as a Shift Supervisor it is my job to handle any situation on the fly. Working in one of the busiest store in the district, it can be stressful, but coworkers and good management with scheduling helps keep true stress at bay."
good,Great place to work! Partners and customers are incredible.
good,"A typical day for me included clocking in, putting on my apron and jumping out there on the floor. A lot of time I was in the drive thru.  I learned a lot about coffee and retail and how to make different types of drinks for people. I worked with all types of people, students, older adults and people from all over the company who had transfered to Arizona.  "
good,"Boa empresa na area pressuposta."
good,"Starbucks is a great environment to work in.  The training is great and advancement opportunities are there for the motivated individual."
good,My typical day at Starbucks was very busy. I had worked the morning shift. So I was there from about 6am-1pm everyday. I learned alot from Starbucks such as learning how to deal with a fast pace store. My manger was pretty cool and she always made sure that her employees had a cup of coffee or something before they got settled in which I thought was thoughtful. My co workers were awesome we worked as an awesome team. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work the espresso machine. After my co workers helped me out and showed me how to work the machine I had got it from there and was very happy. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks was meeting new customers and regular customers  and putting smile on their faces when they see their drinks made for them.
good,"Would perform preventive maintenance on all equipment in store"
good,"Minimum wage pay, deal with picky customers. management isn't really helpful."
good,"You will be busy, but if you can multi task, have good dexterity for longer periods, and enjoy yourself, you will be great. Pretty good benefits for a cooperation in general, but you have to work their over a certain period of time."
good,Drink Making serving customers and ringing up sales. Good beniefts decent hours and quality enviroment
good,"Brewing coffee and making beverages for people to enjoy was the most typical day at work."
good,This place has good benefits. The hours vary but overall I enjoyed working at both the North Olmsted store and in the mall.
good,"My title as a manager at Starbucks has it's good days and it's bad days. While my duties require me to keep an organized and productive floor on a day to day basis, some days I have been given the short end of the stick and left with more task to do than a usual day requires. I tend to run a highly productive and enjoyable shift, but when it comes down to business and satisfying customers I make sure nothing comes before my customers leaving my store 110% satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is how busy the store tends to be. I love working in a fast paced environment and I enjoy being challenged and learning new ways to keep the store and its numbers at a great percentage. I work with some amazing people that I have formed great bonds with. I have no problem with any of my co-workers and they respond well to any orders or tasks I give them. There are 2 types of leaders in the work environment. Those who lead with charisma, and those who lead by the whip. I believe that to be a successful leader you need to posses a little bit of both of those leadership skills in order to run a proper business or floor. Most of my co-workers follow me and my orders due to being naturally drawn to my personality and the way I run things. However, there are some co-workers at times that need the whip instead of a please or thank you. If I need to get stern and straight forward with a co-worker so they can get their job done than that is what I will do. Starbucks is a great company to work for with great benefits, and if anyone were to ask me if they should apply for a job with Starbucks"
good,The hardest part of the job is the customers who think they know your job better than you- but that can happen anywhere. It's overall a decent place to work.
good,TATA STARBUCKS is good workplace for the growth purpose. All the partners are friendly in nature and behaviour. It is the best place to learn more things.
good,"Working at Starbucks, I learned a lot about costumer service and how important it is to have a costumer leaving with a smile on their face. The work environment was extremely manageable. I left work a lot feeling happy because of the environment I was in."
good,"By week two on the job I felt extremely confident in my job duties. By month four I was promoted to supervisor and was on track to be training for assistant store manager. The rules, standards and training are very clear which makes for confident leadership."
good,"Mise en place du service, vérification des lieux, hygiène et sécurité."
good,"I always do my best once it come about my job, I learn a lot, I always understand my co-workers, is when someone called out but I manage it"
good,"Une très bonne école, si vous souhaitez évoluer au sein d'une entreprise."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed most of my time at Starbucks.  Although there can be crabby customers, most of them are awesome and became friends.  Preparing a quality beverage took skill, learning and patience.  One that was down, it was all about my customer/co-worker interaction.  I loved it."
good,The general job can be fun if you make it so and coworkers don't drag too much. Great job for meeting people. Positive attitude goes a long way here.
good,"Working at SB is great, the customers are amazing and partners are cool. I do fell management needs a little help at some locations."
good,"Typical days as a shift supervisor included assisting the store manager in operational tasks as well as deploying partners and providing great service to our customers. "
good,"Retail and customer service with a high pace work load. I have gained a lot of leadership qualities working here as a supervisor reporting directly with management. The workforce at Starbucks is shaped by the staff training the employee and I have trained many employees over the many years with the company. The hardest part of the job is the relentless fast pace work with the expectation of near perfection of product, but the best part of the job is building good relationships with customers and coworkers, as well as being able to make people smile with something as simple as a quality cup of coffee."
good,"The pay at Starbucks is lackluster to say the least, unless you are able to obtain a higher level management position. If only a second job or work whilst attending school, it is a great bet. Benefits are available even if only working 20 hours a week, and are comparable if not better than most higher wage companies."
good,"Learned how to keep a fast pace and work in a small space with a great team spirited people."
good,"Served delicious beverages for customers. Learned how to create many drinks, and became very knowledgeable about coffee. The management was great. The co workers were great. The hardest part of the job was working without enough help. The most enjoyable part of the job was being involved with the customers."
good,Fun job with low pay! Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for.
good,"Working at Starbucks worked well with my strengths. A typical day at work would start with me generally starting at 5:15 am, we opened at 6, and from there I would serve my regulars, and others. Also among serving, I would accomplish a list of chores that were needing to be done. I was quite close with my co-workers, still am with most. We made work fun, constantly making the rushes seem like a breeze. The management that I worked with was the finest management I had ever worked for. I believe the hardest part of the job was maintaining an alert, high energy persona. I loved meeting all those people, who I still run into and have relationships with."
good,"Consistent coffee making, must provide excellent customer service."
good,"from the time you walk in the door til you leave its go go go. if you want time to fly and love having fun, apply here."
good,"Typically, I open the store or work early in the day. As a shift supervisor I am responsible for deploying baristas to their strongest positions so that store operations run as smoothly as possible and provide any addition support required. I have learned to create and maintain relationships with a wide variety of people - both partners and customers - to manage my time and the talent available to me, to be flexible to meet changing demands and to handle unexpected obstacles, and to coach my baristas to meet the expectations set before them. "
good,"Starbucks is world renowned for a reason. The baristas are amazing and so much fun to work with, even those who dont really get along find they are laughing together and enjoying their shifts. My only issue with any startbucks is the managers. Who chooses these people anyways? In the starbucks in campbell river almost every manager is as empty headed as a bag of air. I have found that most of the baristas are doing the work for the managers and still getting put in the lower wage range and treated poorly by them. If it werent for the wonderful spirits between baristas there could potentially be a disasterous blowout infront of the customers."
good,Well the starbucks was in a Harris Teeter so we did not get any benefits of starbucks. We didn't even get to keep our tips. But the starbucks company over all is good. I learned many things but since I was so good at cash register they would not let me make drinks and did not make me certified.
good,"Overall it was a fun and fast paced environment. Working with my co-workers was the best part of my job. There was a irate customer ever so often, but for the most part, our regular customers were very enjoyable."
good,A typical day at work includes serving customers in a timley manner and make sure each customer leaves happy. The management is good for the most part. The hardest part of the job is dealing with conflits between partners as well as customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to intereact with different people every day.
good,"Starbucks taught me quite a bit, all while having a good time. My typical day starts with a greeting from all of my coworkers and even some of the regular customers. Arriving on time is a must, not only because its a requirement, but also to show how much you respect the needs of your coworkers. Generating a highly satisfied customer and how you work, mainly your attitude, towards customers and coworkers really taught me how to create a great working environment, and in turn giving customers a reason to keep coming back. The management gives you a reason to keep coming back, learning everything is tough at first, patience and an honest sense of caring gives you the drive to perform at your best. Engaging with your coworkers is fun, working, understanding strengths and weaknesses, hanging out together outside of work and learning about one another gives you a sense of belonging and puts a smile on your face when arriving to work. The hardest part of the job, being as a person who runs shifts, is coaching partners. You cannot get impatient with people, or at least not let it show, as constant coaching bears slow or no results. Conversations with the store management is a must to help push along better results, which eventually comes to fruition. With the hard work comes enjoyment, which, for me, is creating a highly satisfied customer. Whether it's at the register, espresso bar, drive thru or even making sure the bathrooms are clean and stocked, when I go into an establishment that cares, and appreciates me as a customer I will continue to go back, and that's what I strive to"
good,Starbucks has a nice environment as a workplace. Work place is busy yet enjoyable. Shifts are good. Benefits are good. Management is not superior however it is not bad as well. Starbucks has an enjoyable work environment it just simply has an annoying amount of unnecessary stress.
good,"Wonderful high fast pace energetic work atmosphere! On your feet all day making coffee, running coffee or food, you'll be ready to go home and put your feet up. Typical food service wonderful partners to work with where everyone supports each other on and off the floor."
good,"My Roles & Responsibilities atr my clients we good Challenging,  I got good Teams at all my clients .  I faced  some issues when we come near to the delivery.  My team mates we very helpfull.,"
good,I enjoy working for Starbucks. The bubbly personalities of the employees and great customers make it such a great experience. The hardest part about working for Starbucks is learning to adapt to the constant change. The best part are the regular customers that come to make your day.
good,its a great place to relax while you drink one of the finest coffee.
good,Starbucks is a great company to launch someone into the working world. Each store has its own dynamic and each is like family. Making custom drinks and interacting with customers makes for an ever-evolving work experience.
good,assisting baristas and making sure job is done well making sure all customers are satisfied and employyes are doing there job
good,i enjoyed the variety of jobs with in the plant and the different responsibilities. my supervisors were good
good,Its very positive. I come in to work and the coworkers are friendly and always greet me. I also enjoy serving beverages to the customers/students. The management works hard to keep everyone happy and fulfilled. Hardest part of the job is having an unhappy customer which rarely happens when I work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with people. I have learned so much about Coffees and Teas.
good,"You will work. There is no time to stand around or act busy. Every location is incredibly busy and the mantra ""if there's time to lean, there's time to clean"" is used regularly. Great benefits. Management depends on the distract and the store manager...they can be great or they can make your life miserable."
good,"Great company! They offered great benefits, a flexible schedule, great work environment. My only beef was with my store manager. She refused to set examples of leadership with the shift supervisors, which lead to multiple conflicts with baristas."
good,"Initially I took a job at Starbucks because of the amazing benefits you get for working a minimum 20 hrs/week, but what I actually learned during my time there was equally as important - and I don't mean my mad cappuccino-making skills."
good,"Making drinks and learning the Starbucks culture are the only hard parts of working there. You can network and meet a lot of people. Its really just a typical restaurant job, but  your making coffee instead."
good,"It was a good place to work•	Obtained customer payment promptly and politely."
good,"I loved being a barista! It was a great experience, and I would go back in a heartbeat! I thoroughly enjoyed the customers, the making of the drinks, and being able to express myself happily each day. I could never be sad at work, my co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part of the job was learning the drinks initially, but once you got the hang of them, it was fun! Teh management i was under at the time was not very good and we had some disagreements. I had to resign because i was being asked to choose between my deathly sick child and my job."
good,"Completing daily pastry and paper product orders, running shifts (ensuring each barista receives time appropriate breaks and lunches), properly deploying partners to make sure each partner feels successful and content."
good,This is a great opportunity for a hard working individual who is looking  for advancement with in company.
good,"A typical day at work would include greeting customers, taking orders at the register, making drinks (hot bar and cold bar), warming up food, restocking pastries, cleaning, and making sure the store looks presentable. I learned how to make all of the drinks provided at Starbucks and how to be understanding of my customers wants and needs. My co-workers are a great group of people that are very diverse and skilled in this work environment. Everyone gets along with each other and always work together to provide the customers with the best experience. The hardest part of the job was taking orders from customers and remembering the indexes in order to mark the cups correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers."
good,"-Shift working"
good,"I love the Product, I have many great friends there. Howard(owner) should run the U.S. he has done a great job running his company!"
good,Enjoy getting to know the customers and theirs drinks while creating a fun and enjoyable yet comfortable environment for everybody.
good,"The benefits, scheduling, and work techniques were all very constrained and much less convenient than a corporate Starbucks location."
good,"Laghing and conversing with amny differant culures of people."
good,"Starbucks can be a very stressful environment; however, you oftentimes find yourself surrounded by compassionate people who ease  that stress. As a shift and a barista, friendships are made with customers on a daily basis and we really are able to create a ""third-place"" environment. We are always supported by our managers and by our teams and have the ability to act independently despite an obvious team-focused structure. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the shift runs smoothly; the most enjoyable part of the job however, is when you realize that the shift is running smoothly."
good,"The Starbucks environment is fast paced, very fun.  Managers are promoted from within in most instances."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would be prepping for the busy morning to begin. We stocked coolers checked the freezers and back  stock, placed orders where needed, cleaned, checked the schedule and decided where everyone would be for the day, brewed coffee, went to the bank, checked e-mails, did paperwork, and had great customer service to all customers. My co-workers were friendly, energetic, outgoing, reliable, and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was the schedule . It took the pro manager 2 hours or more to make one because it was so detailed. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my regular customers come in sometimes 3 times a day."
good,"Working at starbucks was a great experience, and I learned skills I hadn't had prior to this job. My coworkers were great, everyone was hard working and knew what they were there to do. The biggest downfall was our manager, She was a great person but lacked in some areas which became more apparent to the staff as time went on. There was issues with giving out a balanced work schedule as well as having a fully stocked inventory."
good,"Good for work/life balance, perfect part time job. Lots of training given. Co-workers always worked in a team."
good,"Serving the customers their coffee and foods."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks.  It was a part-time job for me in addition to my full-time job at that time.  They were flexible with my schedule and worked around my full-time job.  "
good,its a decent company to work at but can be challenging. its fast paced and keeps you busy. good job to start.
good,"1. Make a list of the thing you want/ need to a complish for the day."
good,"Good job to have if you are going to school, doesn't pay very well though."
good,"Its a great job, but it requires a lot of patience dealing with customers and hours standing up. You can move up the ladder but it does require a lot of time. The benefits are amazing but the starting pay is really low."
good,This job is not just making coffee.  It is very fulfilling work but it is hard work.  Benefits make the job.
good,"  A typical day at work was awesome! I learned about coffee and tea. Dealing with the people was the best part explain the new items to them and trying to get people to try new things. Management was good to me. Coworkers were awesome as well. The hardest part at "
good,"Customer Service, Scheduling( incl. Forecast), P&L statement, Sales, Coaching, Problem solving, Cash Handling, ECT. "
good,i really liked seeing all the people that came in every morning
good,"great people, great place. nice atmosphere. more competitive wage would be an asset."
good,"I worked at one of the top 3 most visited Starbucks in the world. I used to work at Starbucks at Union Sq. West. A typical day at work was dealing with 2 to 3 things at a given time. We usually had a line out of the door and customers from all parts of the world. I learned how to deal with needy and impatient customers and to just learn to please customers in any way possible. I also learned a lot about managements and working well with my co-workers. The people i worked with at Starbucks were all very smart and talented individuals, most of whom were in route to earning degrees at accredited universities and so on. The managers at Starbucks were very nice and understanding, working at that location takes lots of training and time. Due to the many styles of drinks and different preparations and recipes it takes a while to master the menu. Mark the store manager was a great manager and he always was patient when teaching new workers. The hardest part of the job was without a doubt dealing with the high volume of customers. There was no such thing as a ""slow day"" or ""take a minute to relax"". We had 10-12 employees at all shifts and there is reason why, we all would be working at maximum capacity non- stop. Another hard part of the job was little to no movement within the company. There were so many employees that it would be hard to stand out and managers didn't have time to notice who was working harder or was deserving of a monetary raise. I would have to say the most rewarding part of the job was being able to say i worked at one of the busiest Starbucks in the world as well"
good,"- Executed team deployment and efficiency to increased speed of service, motivate sales, and strengthen customer service dramatically."
good,"Fun place to work, very busy and demanding at times. I learned a lot here about customer service, and my co-workers were either very helpful, but a few were very lazy."
good,I started working for Starbucks Coffee Co. after I graduated from high school. They taught me a lot about working as a team and later after I became a shift supervisor leading a team. I enjoyed what I did and the company more often than not made sure I had the appropriate schedule to match my school schedule. The only thing I regret is biting off more than I could chew with my last few months with the company. I got promoted while taking on a new career after graduating college. I was unable to give both jobs the attention they needed from me. 
good,"You learn something new everyday and at this job I learned more about customer service, and being an Assistant Manager."
good,"Starbucks provides a fun and friendly atmosphere...though sometimes chaotic in the hustle and bustle of the coffee business. They offer great benefits for a minimum of 20hrs work a week as well as free coffee mark outs and discounts. The company is great for college kids, people looking for part time work, and those who are looking to move up in the company as well. The only draw back to me is that their pay is not competitive due to the providing of benefits"
good,"Fun, fast-paced work environment with great benefits. Good place to work while attending school or as a part-time job."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consisted of me coming in, signing into the computer, and being assigned to till. I would stay at the till for the first two hours before my first break and then I would go back for another two before my second. Around this time, the managers would switch shifts and I'd be assigned to another station, usually dishes or organizing the coffee shelves."
good, 
good,"The relationship building that is learned here between the customers and the staff is phenomenal. Along with keeping a fast-paced work environment, being able to enjoy the company of customer and co-workers alike is what makes this place."
good,"Starbucks expects a lot from their employees in terms of representing the Starbucks brand, and it creates a great atmosphere, and a structured work schedule and basis for assessment"
good,"I would always go to work at least 20 minutes before my scheduled shift so I could make a list of the things I (and my team) would need to complete for the day. Customer service, cleaning, prep-work, and restocking. were the most important things to be done on a daily basis. I learned a different type of customer goes into a coffee place, either they were very relaxed and calm, or in a hurry and nothing could please them (they were my challenge and I welcomed it) I liked almost all of the people I worked with at Starbucks. Many of them are still my friends today (we keep in touch) The hardest thing I had to deal with was Managers from other store that were treated badly at their store and then bringing that negativity to my place of business. I loved the different people I would meet there, and I was invited to parties by customers on a regular basis (I still keep in touch with a few of them as well).  "
good,This is a great beginner job that has lots of opportunity if wanted. Management is a bit young in most instances which can make it difficult. Although it is not at every store the work was not distributed evenly or if it was not done equally. Lots of young people
good,"A day in the life of a Starbucks employee required a lot of different things such as consistent, legendary customer service, making fresh coffee to regulation requirements, cleaning, restocking merchandise and daily milk, pastry and cup supplies, selling merchandise, sharing new offerings and promotions with every customer, cashier work, back room stock work, ordering and inventory and of course keeping in compliance with health codes. "
good,"Overall the company has been great. Advancement is a bit difficult, as there is a great disconnect between the front lines and higher levels of management."
good,"-Making quality beverages, cash handling , keeping work area tidy"
good,work all day
good,Fellowship. Charisma. Humility. Responsibility. Brand image. Education.
good,Great place to work. Every one gets along well. shifts run smooth. Good managment personel. They do alot to give back. Supports a better future. Great benefit package.
good,"Can get busy, but still pleasent work environment."
good,Its a great feeling to work at starbucks because with the amount of people coming and going the regulars always come in and take the time to remember our names and we remember their drinks. its a funny relationship customers and staff work together.
good,"I work about 35 hours per week and a variety of shifts, but mostly mornings. I started by learning about customer service and developed an in-depth knowledge of coffee while working my way from barista (entry level position) to shift supervisor. I manage very different personalities and strive to maintain an upbeat, friendly attitude towards customers while making fresh coffee and keeping all work stations as clean as possible."
good,I met a lot of different people working here.
good,"Waking up at 4am almost every day to open the store. Had to do management tasks as preparing the store to be open, food orders, counting money, doing deposit, inventory, supervising workers on the floor. Making sure everybody was following procedures and Company policies. Making sure employees and customers were having a great experience at the store. Some times i had very difficult customers but it gave me the experience to be able to listen and resolve the problem or conflict. At the end, everybody was happy."
good,"I go to work usually around 4 am, I do the morning set up. Around 6- 7 we get our rush/peak hours, and I get put on drive thru bar or cafe bar, whichever bar needs more of a fast pace, efficient barista."
good,• Manage marketing projects with innovative and dynamic design.
good,"Everyday I was greeted with a smile from everyone I worked with, despite how extremely early it was, which began the very early day with a sense of cooperation and belonging. I learned many valuable lessons in regards to specialization in the workplace, absolute customer service and of course, the trade of the Barista. The store management was excellent and my boss was an outstanding person to work with. The hardest aspect was first starting off and not knowing everything there was to know. The most enjoyable aspect was conversing with the customers and hand-crafting their specific drinks."
good,"Depending on what time we would start there were many different assignments like grinding and brewing coffee making whip cream and making sure our store was clean. We would then switch hourly from cash register to Barista (making the drinks.) I learned a lot about the history of coffee that i still talk about today, I learned some basic kitchen skills but most importantly we were trained very well on sanitation. My manager was awesome she was very different than many others I have had. She was very laid back as long as everyone did their job and she let us do our work and only stepped in to to check quality or to help with a problem. My co-workers were very unique and I worked on campus at Western Carolina so it gave me a great opportunity to meet kids at school. The hardest part of the job was memorizing every single different kind of drink, eventually i got a hold of it but it was definatly a struggle for a while. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere because we had to say hey to everyone who walked in and i got to see a lot of my friends from school and they would always stop and say hi."
good,i enjoy working here its a great environment i meet new wonderful people everyday its a fast working job but it keep be on my toes and helped me grow a lot with team work
good,"A typical day at work was busy, the store received 20-30 customers every 20-30 minutes. Working with Starbucks helped me learn how to interact and network easier on a professional level. It also provided me with the opportunity to work in a team environment and become a leader when rolls needed to be delegated on the floor. The management team were friendly, observant, and always willing to listen to any work related issues. It was always a pleasure working with my co-workers, the energy created a family environment. With this environment we were able to be fun and friendly while serving customers. The hardest part of the job is adapting to inconsistent scheduling, closing and waking up to an opening shift. The most enjoyable part was interacting with new people and working with my co-workers."
good,"Everyday at work was very busy. I was mainly a closer so I had to clean up the mess that was left from the rest of the day and still get out on time, Some days were challenging to make sure everything ran smoothly but my co-workers always helped to make sure they did. I learned how to manage my time and other peoples times as well. I also learned how to problem solve to keep everything running. The hardest part about my job was being left short handed during busy times of the day. Also, it was difficult to keep everything running smoothly when the manager tried to cut costs and did not order as much product as we needed. In the end we always worked as a team to make things work. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers. Everyone brought something different to the table and they all worked hard."
good,"Great place to work, long hours as managment, does not pay well"
good,Starbucks was a fun work place. Daily inventory me counting tills and doing bank drops. Cleaning the bar and getting ready for a productive day. I worked the bar making lattes hot and cold drinks. Keeping the pantry stocked and fresh.
good,"Typical work day i would assist with inventory and counting tills before opening the concession stand. Learned speed, inventory, and guest services. Management was a little unbalanced with each other but you couldn't tell unless you were behind the scenes. Co-workers worked together no matter who had what job."
good,If you like to talk to people and want great benefits for a part time job this is your place.
good,"If you love coffee and bartending this place is great. I enjoyed my short time here. I liked my superiors instead of one shift lead. I learned where coffee comes from, why it tastes and smells the way it does. How it gets to out store, i learned that people can get really cranky about their coffee. The hardest part was the detailed-cleaning and i had to put makeup on my tatoo everytime i came to work. Couldnt wear nailpolish or makeup. I loved making drinks and interacting with customers."
good,i loved it a really good experience good learning about different types of coffee and it's history
good,Prepare various specialty beverages for customers. I learned how to make a wide array of coffee based beverages. Management was phenomenal and the same can be said for the my co-workers. There was absolutely nothing hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with the customers especially the regulars.
good,"As individual stores they work well, there is a real sense of belonging to a store compared to the company as a whole. This family aspect may be a good thing or a negative, I havent yet decided. The staff make the work enjoyable and easy, the customers and the general public make the job a nightmare. Regular customers are valued and respected, they engage with the staff and make it worth while whilst restoring my faith in humanity. When people refuse to give me their names for the cups they dont seem to grasp the fact that its company policy and not my own obsession. If you dont want to give me your name, fine, give me a fake name, the more interesting the better. Im human too, i'll be polite and curtious, providing the same level of respect will just make me nicer to you."
good,"Great place to work, fast paced at times, bag former machines with scales and auger filling."
good,"Working at Starbucks really trained me to be able to multi-task, keep up a fun, fast pace, energetic vibe in the work place. I have great co-workers and a great store manager, it is great to get to know the customers and develop relationships as well as getting a great work ethic"
good,"Typical day consisted of maintaining the cafe, serving our guests, and ensuring the cafe was always ready for the next shift. Great management. All co-workers were fast paced and friendly. The hardest part of the job was not drinking way to much coffee. The most enjoyable part of the job was working directly with the public and cultivating strong customer service skills."
good,I'm the energetic and out going type to have around. I've always worked with teamplayer work skills and can get alone with everybody including the ugly. My personality gets me in because I do my job well and keep people satisfied with my service given. The hardest part of work is going home sometimes because the workplace is usually my get away and I can stay busy. The most enjoyable thing on a job is being there and having something do.
good,"typical day at work morning and lunch rushes, coffee brewed every 30 mins, turnover time on products, happy customers, valued employees. established management, friendly and hardworking co-workers. hardest part is keeping guest engaged while standing in a long line while making countless amounts of drink orders. satisfaction in guest faces on the wonderfulness of each drink."
good,Starbucks has been slowly moving away from the third place environment and the quality of the partners working there has gone down as well.
good,"As a Store Manger, my store was always what I made it. So it was a fun, upbeat place to work where the customer was always a welcomed part of our day."
good,"You walk in and smell the wonderful aroma of coffee as you go to the back to punch in. After tieing your apron you're directed to one of four positions (DTR, DTO, BAR, REG). You have about five minutes to get yourself adjusted, and then are required to take over for the person who is about to leave. You're in charge of organizing, stocking, and keeping pace to ensure everyone gets a unique and fast experience. I've learned how to organize a group of workers for more smooth transitions and general labor."
good,"I have learned a whole lot from Starbucks for one they gave me the oportunity to advance in the company within six months with a pay raise. I have learned pretty much how to run a store by myself from accounting side, to ordering product for the store, handling schedule issues, and always having the customer comes first attitude. I enjoy working for Starbucks as a whole but at store stand point it starts to look a little disappointing. We needed more leadership and praise for the hand work we have done to make our store good in all areas."
good,This was a fun job and had a lot of really sweet customers who loved you as long as you made the coffee right.
good,"I was over the area of Starbucks inside of Target. I was in charge of transitions, ordering, training and certification. I also created an environment to customers to enjoy their coffee. I was a leader over 10 people, who were essemtial in making the area successful."
good,"This is a good job to teach you excellent customer service. I love the environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers but that is like any other job and the most enjoyable part about the job was getting to know regular customers, I became really close to a lot of new people."
good,"Management is easy to follow, employees are easy to get along with, flexible schedule. Fast paced and easy work."
good,"Outstanding cutomer service, Starbucks strive for giving customers legendary experiences. For the most part I loved working there but later down the line I felt the company wasn't taking care of their workers. It had became a stressful work environment when management wasn't hearing the workers complaints. My co-workers were the most generous and to this day I keep in contract with most of them. This is one company I recommend, just not the locations I was working."
good,"Was able to meet tons of great customers! If you love coffee, its the place for you!"
good,I enjoy getting to know my customers and their drinks. They get to know us and we talk about our lives and jobs and even network with customers. It's nice to have such pleasant people come in everyday. Although there are those few customers that come in that it is impossible to make happy but that happens at every customer service job and you just do your best to make everyone happy.
good,"Se vvive un gran ambiente laboral, con el respeto y trato con dignidad como pilares fundamentales."
good,"typical day: logged in, served customer then stocked. after stocking went back to serving customers before cleaning at end of day"
good,Very fast paced. Peak transaction periods could exceed 2 per minute. Managed 3 very high volume stores. The management was supportive. Customer and employee interaction was the best part of the job
good,Fun on most occasions but too many times the employees that were not happy to be there ran the show and it was embarrassing to me for the customers to see that.
good,During my time at Starbucks I was expected to prepare a number of beverages to standards while staying in compliance with safety and sanitation regulations. I found the work to be satisfying and interesting. The preparation of the beverages was always a challenge but the customer service aspect of the job was the most enjoyable part.
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers while handling the daily tasks on the floor. As a supervisor I am responsible for cash handling, delegating cleaning tasks, and reaching our sales goals. The management at my current store has been difficult. We have had a lot of turn-over because of this, but I am always trying to keep a positive work atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is that I am responsible for everything from fixing an ice machine to removing unruly customers from the store. The most enjoyable part of this job has been the employees that I see everyday."
good,Starbucks is high volume customer service establishment so your always occupied and working. I have learned to have patience and remain cool and collective with my co-workers and customers. I also learned how to provide world class customer service and how to anticipate personalize and connect with customers as well. The only hard part about Starbucks is the memorization and trying your best to work with a sense of urgency. The enjoyable part of the job is making the customers satisfied and having fun while being a barista.
good,"nice steady work, good management and ethics, learned a lot about the company and the products, throughly enjoyed it"
good,"Barista's at Starbucks are the partners that work hard to make sure each customer gets a drink that is to the quality standard that Starbucks trains it's partners to achieve.. for each customer. Upon entering Starbucks for a shift, I would begin by ordering myself a complimentary partner beverage and proceed to the back room to chat with co-workers and drink coffee. Work would begin with a time punch and an ""Ok, let's go!"" attitude which coffee often contributes to the morning. As a barista I learned to be responsive to the unique shift I was working on any given day. If I was opening, then my responsibilities involved stocking the pastry case and being ready for customer numero uno to arrive directly at 5:30pm. If I was a mid shift, I might have duties beyond that of serving customers coffee and pastries. I might be a pre-closer responsible for cleaning the washrooms, sweeping and mopping the floors, restocking the condiment stands and changing the garbage and the organics. If I was closing barista, then I would be bar-closing, which meant cleaning down the entire machine and work surfaces including the cold beverage station and fridges, and ensuring the espresso was stored for freshness. The diversity of tasks under the job title barista were new to me and I appreciated management greatly in their in depth training. Working alongside other baristas under a Supervisor at Starbucks, I quite enjoyed the interactions we got to have while serving customers and keeping the store running cleanly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job is time management and co-ordination of"
good,"great place to work while going to school, I was able to change my availabilty as needed to get my degree. You also get insurance for working only part time."
good,A typical day at work was working on the cash register and making drinks for the customers. The management wasn't that good. My co-workers were very fun people to work with. The hardest part of the job was opening up the store and being the only one working for a few hours when its really busy in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday.
good,"I loved working a Starbucks mostly because of the diversity it brings into your daily life. I've had unforgettable experiences while working managing. I believe it is a great stepping stone job especially if you are looking to support yourself through college or wish to move up within the company. It was a great customer service developer. Yet, like any job it's all up to the individual to decide what they will take from it."
good,- Good environment
good,"I had learned team work, focus on gals. Also learn what people would to to get free stuff, and how in a way, the company some times focus on clients, but sometimes forget about the employees in a daily basis."
good,"very fun place to work at, get to meet alot of different people and learn new things everyday"
good,Nice place to work. The team unity makes it fun to go to work. Managers try to be fair in giving out hours.
good,"Great benefeits , competetive pay, goodworking enviorment. Offers oppotunity for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks . Great teamwork , and organzational skills . I received a perfect score from a ""Secret Shopper "" !"
good,"not enough hours, pay is for highschool students, and corp threatened employee's that it was going to shutdown."
good,I have had a great experience working for Starbucks. As a Barista at Starbucks I have developed great customer service skills as well as learned to multitask under pressure. I think my experience with this great corporation will help me blossom as not only a worker but a better person.
good,"i loved working here! the only reason i had to leave was because i lived in everett and worked in seattle and i just didnt have enough clients at the time to keep it up. the owner is great and the staff was warm and welcoming, wonderful people. the clients like us so much, they get hooked and keep coming after they are done with their treatment sessions! lots of opportunity for learning and growing your massage career in a place that fosters beginners and encourages self-improvement. i worked there 4 years ago and if they called me up and offered a job again, i would jump at it!"
good,starbucks was the ultimate career job for me. Loved the atmosphere loved the coffee and enjoyed the cultural part as well. I learned alot about coffee and the history of Starbucks. the part af Starbucks that I really enjoyed the most were all the friends I made. Those memories will last a life time!
good,"overall, the company is great to work for, its the customers who are the issue. a lot of them think they know more than you, and when their drinks are incorrect they will let you know."
good,I worked at several locations and worked with many incredible  baristas. There was always an exciting environment and I had and amazing time working with my team.
good,its a great place to better time management skills as well as giving you ways to solve different problems in certain situations. great management and team.
good,"If you are getting your first job or its been your 5th, Starbucks is good with pay, benefits, flexibility with hours, and you work with great people. No experience is needed but they do prefer those who do."
good,"This is very dependent on the location, but as I worked at a Drive-Tru location, it was very fast-paced and stressful environment during peek times. Other than that it would be fun and relaxed. It was also fairly easy to get a promotion, although that is dependent on the management as I got the promotion with a manager that left before anything was finalized and the second manager had a bias which caused me to lose out on the ability to become a supervisor. It was a great part-time job, but not recommended for more than that."
good,"Starbucks is a fun and fast pace environment to work! "
good,"With so many opportunities to grow, develop, and reinvent yourself within the company, working never felt like work. You feel supported and at the end of the day like you've made a positive contribution."
good,"The workplace there is very upbeat. I enjoy all my coworkers, everyone has a love for coffee. I feel motivated well at work and appreciated about my work"
good,My time at Starbucks has gifted my the ability  to multitask at an professional level . It has also help me learn to communicate wit different  cultures and ethnicities around the world
good,I learned a lot working for this company and met a lot of cool people along the way it taught me many responsibilities and turned me into the man I am today.
good,when working at Starbucks I really enjoyed the work and the staff where really nice I gained a lot of knowledge on how to approach the blind etc however I feel I was supressed slightly because I didn't get enough time to learn the tills when the shop was quiet instead id be made to clean the toilets or some other job nobody wanted to do however when the shop was busy id been thrown in the deep end and punished for the few mistakes I made.
good,Great workplace. I learned a lot about customer service and working in a fast-paced role. The overall experience was very positive and met a wonderful group of people.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, my partners made me feel happy to come to work. It is a very social job, from communicating with other partners to communicating with customers. I have had very amazing experiences to very stressful and angering experiences. Customers come in in so many different kinds of moods and some have a tendency to let it out on your or your partners. But because of the bond that you share with your coworkers, they will defend you when someone is unnecessarily getting upset at you. And in most cases, they will support you when you need help in your position. Whether that is on the drive-through making calls for you as you hand out drinks or helping you make some of your drinks when there is a rush. Working at Starbucks is neither perfect nor is it terrible. There is always a good part to combat a bad part. I loved my time there and eventually left because I decided to look for a job centered around my career. I will miss m time there and anyone considering it should do it, especially because they have great benefits and usually great flexibility."
good,"Good family vision, medical and dental insurance for part-time. Accrue sick & vacation-time. Ability to earn college degree through SCAP program which is fantastic."
good,"Multitasking in a high energy environment with lots of cool people and customers. Enjoyed learning about coffee, people, machines, food safety, etc. Very relaxed atmosphere but always something to do or learn."
good,"A good starting job if you want to get into the workforce, great schedule flexibility to work with, hours are always available. Meet great people and become good friends with them, most people who would come in I made friends with them and still speak to them this day. Friendly environment but also very fast paced. If you don't work fast or are too slow you will be called to work faster or put somewhere else in the store that doesn't require a lot of fast paced action."
good,"Good work environment"
good,"Learn faster on the coffee knowledge and do Multi-tasking on the task and deliver"
good,You serve beautiful hand crafted beverages to wonderful people in a fun workplace. You get to see airplanes land and take off. Such a great place to work at. The hardest part would be if a flight got delayed and we have to stay open after hours but it would be a great deed to those really in need or really feeling like they aren't having a great night.
good,"It was an ok job, you get comfortable with the job and people"
good,"If you are willing to put in the hard work, you will succeed at Starbucks. They provide all the opportunity you need to be successful and advance, if that is what you want to do."
good,Overall was a good company but the manager wasn't willing to work with my availability and would constantly mess up my schedule and change it without telling me or anyone else.
good,Fast paced energetic environment dedicated to providing customers with an individualized experience. Gives back to the community by participating in a variety of projects geared toward a cleaner planet.
good,"It was a challenging at first because of a lot of training and learning modules to finished. However, it's one of the best working experienced I've ever had."
good,This workplace helped me develop many skills that are very beneficial for working in other various environments. I was also able to get out of my shell to open up to customers and make connections.
good,I enjoy the people and atmosphere I work with. It is a great environment to improve personable skills and quality work habits. Management is always adjusting to standards.
good,"I was located at MOA where a lot of people visit therefore the work was hectic but really productive. I suggest looking for a store near where you live because work hours are too early or too late. A norm, for a coffee shop."
good,All of the locations I worked at i liked the people that worked there and all the free coffee and food that came with the job the pay was fair tips could be better.
good,"Friendly staff, fast work environment, consistent hours and expectations. Comfortable environment for building relationships with partners and customers."
good,"Starbucks provides a fun and welcoming platform, so that you can learn how to work best with your co workers to achieve the Starbucks experience for customers."
good,"Starbuck is a great company to work for, its fun, great environment, great people for the most part, you learn a lot and they actually take great care of there employees I would of loved to stay with Starbucks but unfortunately the way wasn't enough."
good,"If it’s your first job then prepare to learn something new everyday. Also, prepare to  quickly adjust and withstand the heavy workload that is being a part of the Starbucks machine."
good,"This job is intense and requires a high level of self-discipline and efficiency. It is a job that takes you out of your comfort zone and challenges you to pursue the best of excellence. The hardest part of the job is the demand for multitasking; however, the most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to connect with so many different people."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced, and organized, but also uplifting and personable. I enjoyed the workplace culture and the relationships that developed with customers"
good,As a younger employee I often worked the closing shift which taught me organization skills and time management. Cleaning is a major part of closing shifts and that became a skill I carried with me to multiple jobs.
good,"Great management. Great benefits like college reimbursement that lead to a high turn over rate. Also, many other benefits like good insurance, free Spotify premium and more. Other than that excellent part-time or full-time job."
good,"I worked at a high-volume store, so it was very stressful. However, you get close with your fellow baristas and bond as you get through rushes and deal with difficult customers together. Regular customers are lovely--part of the gig is getting to know them and building that rapport that keeps them coming back. Hours are part time and your manager will try to accommodate to your schedule."
good,"I loved doing Starbuck. But If you don't have good co-worker then you have to do double work. So my advice would before applying I would request would you walk in and see the atmosphere and if you feel good,then you may proceed further."
good,"Starbucks is a bit of a chaotic environment to work in but with a positive atmosphere. If you acquire the ability to work well as a team, shift will be a breeze."
good,The cultural is nice but not enough hours and constant turnover. The company says they have lots of opportunities but in reality they do not. It is only applicable to full time employees.
good,Apply here for part time to get amazing benefits and awesome job experience. Full time is too much labor for the return. Just being honest. Great company.
good,"I've met many great friends at Starbucks, its a very fun place to work. Its a very inclusive company, that wants its partners to succeed. Customers can be difficult and being a fast learner will help you in the beginning."
good,"Customers make or break you in this business. Anyone who works in retail or deals with the public must have common sense, patience and good with basic communication, verbal and written. Holidays are very hectic but they can be very fun with the right people on your team."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful job for college students and retirees. Benefits are great at 20 hour week that includes college achievement plan,dental, health  and vision."
good,What I loved most about my job as a barista was helping people try something new to drink and/or eat. Getting to know what the customer liked and didn't like was always interesting.
good,"Easy job. Sometimes you’ll get stuck with tenuous work but in general, it’s very laid back. It’s a fun little side job and there’s lots of opportunities for advancements. As long as you stay out of the “high school” drama, it’s super chill. Plus free coffee all day, every day"
good,"People thought that being a barista is an easy job but to be honest in this kind of work where you talk to customers everyday, having complaints, always a rush. Everything was just so tiring but fulfilling after a full shift."
good,"Working at Starbucks for 5 years, I've seen a lot from people. It takes a lot out of you. Doing the same thing, day in and day out, gets rough. But, I've always had a good manager to back me up and even my co-workers  were always behind me backing me up and helping me succeed."
good,"A typical day at work includes making beverages and making customer connections. "
good,"Fun workplace, always satisfy the customer. The pay is not bad, most of the employees that work there are very friendly and have lots of energy. outstanding atmosphere."
good,"I loved it from the beginning but then new management came in after working there for about over a year. The new management was not only horrible but uncomfortable to work there towards my ending months there. Other than that, Starbucks is a great place to work at if you're placed with positive people. The job is hard but gets easier. The costumers make it all better though and you tend to get your regulars. I gained over 6 friendships after working there with people that had been my costumers. The benefits are amazing and to top it off you get free drinks for yourself!"
good,"You get encouraged a lot to connect with customers. If you're kinda shy, then you'll get a lot of opportunities to speak up. You also get to define your work availability, so you can work part-time or full-time."
good,"Excellent people and training. Environment was dynamic and positive. Hours were sporadic at times, but this is the case in retail during low seasons. Overall excellent experience, and I learned what I wanted to learn."
good,Though there are always hills to climb there is definitely room for personal and business growth of you have an eye for it. The company offers a huge array of benefits to help with life outside and inside of work. Personalities can clash like in any workspace but it is easy to readjust accordingly.
good,Worked here for the majority of my undergrad and enjoyed every moment of it. If you like fast paced work with a fun environment this is the place for you!
good,"Very difficult to achieve what is expected of you , you are excepted to make customer connections but it is not possible when a store has numbers that are large!"
good,"Working in any coffee shop you should expect to have your ups and downs with customers. Starbucks is a great location to get your foot in the door of the coffee world, but you'll notice the style is different from some traditional barista styles. To get the part, just be super friendly and energetic, it makes a difference in you work environment as well on how customers interact with you."
good,"I worked at Starbucks briefly as a part-time job while I was at college. What I experienced was a great working environment that offered flexible hours, excellent training, and good pay. I can't speak for those who worked full-time, but my colleges seemed to enjoy their job."
good,nice place to work very clean and friendly my manager was the best when I worked there loved her she was the definition of a great person she made me want to come to work
good,"Starbucks has a very high expectations of its employees to maintain a clean store. They are very generous with benefits (health coverage, tuition reimbursement, etc.)."
good,"A typical day at work was not too bad unless you were on bar alone and it was very busy, the problem of where i worked was that we were very understaffed and therefore it was a bit stressful at times and caused some accidents with the drinks."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience during college. I highly recommend it. Free coffee and you learn patience and how to deal with a multitude of different personalities. The culture is great and while the service industry can be remarkably tough, it was overall a great experience. I still toy with the idea of going back to work with them in another capacity."
good,"The benefits are worth the lower pay. "
good,"The Starbucks environment is fun on the outside, but incredibly stressful on the inside.  Not from bad work conditions or management, but from the sheer volume of people who visit a Starbucks everyday.  Those kinds of numbers are hard to handle with a six person floor.  But that’s okay, because you have health insurance, paid tuition at ASU, and free food and drinks!"
good,The team I worked with got along very well.  Everyone worked very hard together to satisfy the customers.  The team had a very selfless attitude overall.
good,"Out of all the jobs I've had Starbucks was my favourite. Not only was it a healthy and supportive place to work, but it was comparative in a way that didn't make you feel inferior. The management in my district was intuitive to each store's needs, and an excellent representation of Starbucks's values. There is always something to do and it switched up every shift so you never got bored. I would not recommend this as a first job, though it is entry level, the fast paced environment is not for anxious or typically lazy people, or people with bad attitudes - and the connections you make with customers, especially regulars, will stay with you long after you move on or move up the chain."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. You are always on your feet and meeting new and interesting people. I got to learn a lot about customer service here and I was able to take my work as a barista to help me advance my career as a bartender.
good,Be open to learning something new everyday. In order to have fun making coffee or give good service you have to be happy first with your self. Then your customers will continue come and become regulars
good,I really enjoyed working here and during this stage in my life it was the perfect job. Great team to work with. Perfect job for someone going to college!
good,"It can vary by department, but within my department (where I worked for 17 years), managers were supportive and flexible, even during high-stress times.  That, along with an admiration for the company, is what kept me there for so long."
good,"Working at Starbucks was productive as I learned to work in a high-stress fast pace environment. The culture of the company was fantastic, and I considered coworkers friends."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is fast paced, engaging and fulfilling. Meeting people with different personalities allow me to show just how diverse I can be in a professional manner."
good,"Overall I've had nothing but good experiences working at Starbucks. In my years of working there, I've grown as person, my skillset increased and became more comfortable working a fast paced coffee house environment."
good,"Come in, already dressed properly and ready for work.Clock in and figure out which station your at; whether it be bar, oven, or customer support. Then you wash your hands and get started."
good,"has a lot of benefits, staff are friendly and willing to train, management is lax, hours are pretty good why cant i finish this thing without doing ifnoeifnainf"
good,I would clean and take out garbage for this job. I learned a lot about good customer service. It was a fast paced work environment. I wasn't pleased with cleaning the toilets.
good,"Company isn’t bad at all with good benefits and flexible scedule. The part they have problems is with the managers who manage the store, choosing favoritism amongst employees. Best part about Starbucks is th family that you work with, most of the most chill and hard working people i worked with"
good,"upbeat work environment with friendly coworkers. difficult customers at times, but still fun. mostly hands on training of how to make drinks properly and how to plan ahead to stay on top of incoming drink orders."
good,I loved working at Starbucks it was a great place but some of the rules was very unfair and I felt mistreated. Working at Starbucks was like working with your friends and family.
good,"At times demanding and requires a keen ability to multitask and work as a team while providing for customers. While at times hectic, the work itself can prove to be very rewarding."
good,"Un dia tipico en Starbucks, puede tocarte ser, barista y servir los cafes, estar en caja o hacer lobby y limpieza en general. Su ambiente es bueno, ya que estas trabajando con personas jóvenes y muy divertidas. "
good,Starbucks is a fast pace environment. They create a fun and Fulfilling environment for all partners. They have great benefit packages. The offer flexible work hours.
good,Cool place to be if surround with right people can be stressful but can also really gain good relationships with customers that would make your day better
good,"It was a good job, I moved up quick. Worked with alot of stores and met alot of good people. I loved it and I wouldve stayed. Just be careful with corporate. There's alot of nepotism."
good,"I work at a great location in Westlake, Ohio. People are supportive, very little work drama, if any and, you can speak with the managers without it getting out and all around."
good,"Good benefits, but not enough to live off of. Uplifting team, I always feel energized and appreciated for my work. It requires a lot of customer service abilities, however. If you're not a people person, I would not recommend."
good,Customers in and out and always a line in peak hours. Enjoy the experience with co-workers and have fun when you can. Good learning experience overall.
good,"Flexible, knowledge building, coffee perks, opportunity to get a degree. Pay is comparable to other companies. Not much room for advancement because there is only one manager at each location and you really have to want to be one and wait for an opening at another store which may be in a totally different city in which you live. Very fast paced and cleaning is a huge part of your job."
good,"Flexible work place and pretty good benefits, the management is caring and there if needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a good team bond."
good,overall great place to start out a coffee career and open ears when your going to school. and also have flex able hours for the staff. and half off for the workers.
good,work consisted of me running the floor and making sure everyone was at their stations. Learned a lot while running drivehtorugh as well. Learned how to mange my and my coworkers time.
good,"Working here as a barista trainer for over a year was overall a swell experience. My typical day at work here as a trainer specifically was welcoming every new barista coming into our store with open arms and get them set on board to become a barista. "
good,"It is what you make it. Come to work, learn and do your job right and be friendly, then move up. It's a great place to work if you enjoy customer service and helping people."
good,"This company pays its employees well. They make it relatively easy to advance but you'd be lucky if you're at one of the stores that gives its baristas and shifts the hours they need to pay bills or even just to keep a shift running smoothly and efficiently. Benefits are incredible, support is always there, but you have to scrounge for hours."
good,"Never a dull moment! However, customers can be pretty harsh. Must have thick skin and great customer service to work here. Peak business hours are so upbeat and fast-paced, there's hardly time for restroom breaks for about 2-4 hours. You will work with a variety of positive and unique characters from all walks of life."
good,Starbucks is a great first job. They teach a lot of skills and offer a lot of promotional opportunities. It definitely can be stressful because of how high the standards are. Overall I recommend this job.
good,"The people I worked with always made me feel welcomed and accepted. There was never a day that I finished my shift without some positivity. The only downsides to my job were the constant stress during rush hours, and the lack of flexibility from my manager. Working as a high school student came with some difficulties regarding scheduling and my manager didn't do a good job at fixing that aspect. I loved the customer interaction and always having something to do during each shift."
good,"Challenging to learn all the recipes at first, but the trainers are great! They want you to do well and learn the job. Starbucks is very much a family and  Starbucks barista's care about each other."
good,"This company offers great work availability  for 16-21 teenagers or adults."
good,"One of the leading best company in the gcc market."
good,"Starbucks is definitely considered a high paced environment and it requires a lot of attention to detail as well as drive to complete your teams daily goals.  Working at Starbucks for two years has had it's fair share of inconsistencies but nonetheless, great benefits and outcomes. The company is very loyal to their customer connection and satisfaction just as much as they are to their employees experiences. There is a great balance of responsibility that is split between upper management and supervisors, and room for growth is readily available for experienced employees. The most rewarding thing about this job has been the relationships I have built with my co-workers and friendships I have built with customers. From regulars to newcomers, I was always surrounded by diversity and acceptance, and that's what made this company worthwhile."
good,"Working at Starbucks allowed me to grow my interpersonal skills and improved my collaboration abilities. Everything is a team activity and without relying on one another, each individual's job would never be completed. I have also learned how to problem solve and read non-verbal cues in order to preemptively fix situations that could have possibly turned negative had I not stepped in. Starbucks is always willing to help partners develop and improve their Starbucks experience, whether that is within their current role or on a path to promotion. The environment is accepting, friendly, and positive. Rarely do you see a Starbucks employee with a scowl. Overall, a good place to work."
good,"Everyday you don't know what your doing until your about to start your shift. its a lot of switching around and moving but once you get the hang of it, it feels easier. for the most part its fun, but i feel the pay isnt worth the work."
good,"I truly did enjoy working there. The people were great to work with, the management was wonderful; my manager also worked with my school schedule as well!"
good,"Starbucks offers very flexible schedules for those that need it. It is an excellent place to work for that first-time work experience. Typical day includes making great customer connections, making drinks, and cleaning."
good,It's a lot of fun when its with the right people. Otherwise you get burned out. There are plenty of benefits which is why it hooks you in and most people stay for awhile.
good,"My experience with Starbucks was good. I've heard horror stories about the store before, and how employees have been treated in the past, but I wasn't able to relate, because the managers at our store treated everyone with the same level of respect."
good,"Make sure that customers are highly satisfied . The guest loved coming when they saw I was working, I brought so much life to work and they loved my smile"
good,A typical day at work for morning crew was getting through peak and staying assigned to a certain position because there was such volume where nothing else could basically be done. Stressful and under pressure to achieve maximum efforts.
good,"I learned much about self sufficiency, initiative, and leadership here at Starbucks. I've also made many friends. However, there is much unnecessary drama within the work environment."
good,This starbucks was subcontracted within Target. This fell under double jurisdiction by Targets rules as well as Starbucks. It was a cohesive environment with staff that supported each other.
good,Learned a lot through this company and would recommend anyone to work here. It can be very laid back at time and sometimes not where you're consistently moving.
good,"team work, customer relation management and communication skills. The job helped to learn about the requirement of the customer and attend to their requirements."
good,I was hired on as a supervisor and got paid very well. Starbucks is accommodates well for students and there is potential to move up in the business. I worked there for about 2.5 years until management changed.
good,It was a good experience. I very much enjoyed the people I worked with and the time spent working there. I only wish the training was more in-depth and informative.
good,"Starbucks is a great way to be thrown into a fast-paced environment and to learn to really ""work"" for your money. Your biggest challenge will be customer service, especially in mornings with people's patterns of inconsideration. But, if you learn to be patient and considerate, this job will treat you well."
good,"I currently work at the NY Roastery, and I have come to appreciate and learn so much more about coffee than I thought was possible. While I enjoy my coworkers and much of the customers, it is very draining and I don't necessarily find this job as a haven away from school. It is good due to its investment in their employees and flexibility, but not for a long term career."
good,"I learned how to manage a bar machine, how to make hot/cold beverages (even more of them in the same time)."
good,"I love the fast pace at starbucks, i only wish the starting rate were higher because for the amount of work you’re doing it doesn’t feel like the money you deserve."
good,It was always a busy day even on a slow day in Starbucks.I had to deep clean areas even in the middle of a busy day. Its was always a great day at work even when there is problem like the milk didn't come or we ran out of cups we can always count on our partners to be there for each other..
good,"Worked here for 3 years, 2 years as a supervisor. Pretty good gig overall, would need to move into management to make it a comfortable living. Health, retirement and stock benefits are excellent, but I would have rather had fewer benefits and a higher paycheck. With kids, this was definitely a paycheck to paycheck job for me."
good,Had the opportunity to create a continuous relationship with guests and customers. Learning how to make their drinks to their standard was most fun. Conversing with guests was also one of my favorite parts. Making their day was always a priority of mine.
good,"Starbucks prides itself on being a forward thinking people company. With its many benefits it strives to maintain that standing. Depending on your direct management, the experience will be amazing or dismal. During your time, you will be exposed to the most current business models and will equip your skills for future endeavors."
good,Great place for your first job and as a student. Culture inside the workplace is very diverse and employers are always looking for genuine and relaxed individuals who can also work in fast paced-environments.
good,"it was a great job always meeting new people, making coffee for the people, I worked with a lot of nice co-workers who I've helped and they have helped me in time of need we had a really good teamwork"
good,"Starbucks is heavily Oracle-centric and fosters a high emphasis on innovation, technology and leaning. Follows high standards and robust processes for quality of work delivered"
good,It was fun working here just need better ways to encourage employees to be happy at 4 am but over chill and understanding of their employees lives and wishes
good,"Working at Starbucks has the opportunity to be very rewarding. They often hire from within, promote to the highest levels, and offer fantastic benefits as well. However, this requires hard work and a fairly high level of dedication, especially for pay that isn't quite competitive. If you're willing to commit, work hard, and just be a good worker, Starbucks is a great place to grow, learn, and receive valuable work experience."
good,"Working at Starbucks chiseled me into a hard worker and made me appreciate working for a specific company, I had a great time making drinks and engaging with customers."
good,"Fast paced"
good,Starbucks is a very fast paced environment to work for.  It is stressful but also fun since there is a lot of opportunity to interact with other employees and customers.  One of the toughest parts of working at Starbucks is the hours of business.
good,"Learning to be a barista can be intimidating at first but once you get the hang of it, it's not bad at all.  We have the best customers! Our store was brand new and the community received us with open arms and have been so supportive as we learned to be the best baristas!"
good,"I loved working with the people at Starbucks, the manager was amazing and most of my co-workers were great. The job is generally pretty fast paced and intense which could get overwhelming when we were low staffed. However usually they had your back and were encouraging. The benefits were great, coverage after working there for 3 months. I worked the opening shift at 5am which could be challenging but overall it was pretty great. Be warned people can be brutal before they get their coffee."
good,"Over all okay, could be more constructive, overall very good"
good,A typical work day is very relaxing and fun. I work in a small kiosk and cleaning and restocking is very easy and equipment was easy to find. I learned how to multitask and to also work through problems and coming up with better solutions.
good,starbucks was honestly my favorite job so far that i’ve had. very fun fast paced work. lots of multitasking and time management. i would definitely go back.
good,Fast paced work where there is always something to occupy your time and the expectations are fairly strict but reasonable with good perks and compensation.
good,I enjoyed working there it was fast paced and busy but really enjoyed the type of jobs I was doing and there is a good room for progression. I felt well looked after there.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks but there were time where it was more challenging than i would have liked especially if staffing wasn't in tip top shape. But otherwise i would recommend the job to anyone looking to for a fast paced, fun, and ever changing environment."
good,"Career builder, positive work environment, longevity, teamwork a must, salary could be better. Amazing total package.................................."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. As you welcome and create connections with the guests you are making memories and experience for the guests
good,Employees are called partners because they’re considered share holders as well. Benefits are very nice and the company as a whole. Work environment is very friendly and it shows in the atmosphere of the workplace. Creates the sense of belongingness as you enter a store
good,"It felt like walking into work with family. I didn't have any issues with the people I worked with, and the work itself was rewarding. Making a guest's drink and seeing their face light up as they taste it made me happy."
good,"Working at Starbuck's is not for everyone, but, with the right mindset, work ethic and commitment, it can be a fantastic place to work. Remember that your attitude toward working will determine how enjoyable your work environment will be. If you have a complaint or concern, please let management know and it will be solved. Time-off requests are usually processed and accepted quickly, and tips are adequate, depending on customer count."
good,I met the most amazing people working for Starbucks. I was a single mom and my store was so amazing with working with me and my schedule and supporting me while I was there! They encouraged me when I set off into my career. Highly recommended!!
good,"If coffee is your thing, then Starbucks is definitely a job I would recommend. They provide a 20% discount on every purchase (whether on or off the clock) and a 30% discount for the holidays. There are opportunities for advancement as well."
good,"Lots of benefits for an entry-level job, but does require a large amount of emotional labor considering the workload required for a busy store. But does allow for good store culture and gives employees an outlet for community service."
good,Greeting for customers is important point at Starbucks and they have good benefits for employees. Working places ambience is happy but depends on store manager.
good,"Great company, unfortuantly the location had to close down. I had worked for a company that had a line of Starbucks, Simon Malls. They had multiple other starbucks with other management positions available and didn't offer me a position at the Time of closer."
good,It was very fast paced and there was a lot of information to memorize without much time to prepare for it before starting. I worked at a smaller stand inside a Safeway. It was fun though.
good,"I loved working for starbucks, always room for development and challenging yourself. The connections you make in this environment are like no ther. The benefits also rule: stocks, full healthcare, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, 401k"
good,"Overall I loved working with my partners, i became one of the top baristas I took pride in being the best partner and overall great with every customer. The pay was not that great, as a single mom I had to bar-tend at night to help meet my income with bills. My store ran thru managers like crazy during the time I was there I had 5 managers."
good,"Working is fun, customer interactions always make the day better. Great opportunity for meeting new people. I learned an extensive amount of information on coffee and the way things are processed."
good,"Starbucks has definitely helped me come out of my shell as a person, and I am constantly met with new ways to challenge myself. While the amount of traffic can be overwhelming at times, I find that being able to maintain composure in that kind of environment aids me in my every day life."
good,"A day at Starbucks is a good one, I learned how to multitask and work under pressure. It was a bit challenging but once you get the hang of things it all becomes a breeze. I’m one who loves challenges because it helps us grow as people."
good,Lieu très convivial et rythme de travail dynamique.
good,The job can be a lot of fun when you're working with the right people. The benefits are amazing and there is opportunity to move up and flexibility with your hours.
good,"I sincerely enjoy working at Starbucks, it’s always so wild and for me I like it, I stay busy and makes the time go by faster and it’s a way to make it fun! Of course there are always stressful days especially when staffing/coverage is not good but by having a good attitude and connecting with customers it is possible to get through any day."
good,"I appreciate the culture, except tips suck. I want more consistency in scheduling as well. I like the customers and how easy it is to transfer locations."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks until the last Manager I worked for.  Her lack of team building and management skills, and her lack for employee safety were why I left Starbucks.  Staff members are part-time.   Not sure why Starbucks does this.  There are times when you may be asked to work extra hours depending on how busy the store is or if someone called in sick."
good,I remember feeling very a part of the team and honestly really enjoyed my time there. The day was structured and you always knew what to do. Shift supervisors and managers I had were all really approachable and you get meetings to try all the new roll outs and they just make you feel really connected to what you are serving. Great company. If I could have made the tips I do serving in a restaurant or bar the same as working in a coffee shop I would not have left.
good,This role was continually challenging through fast-paced environments and working with team members cooperating and communicating helped to make the job an easier working role.
good,Very fun and accelerating. Learned a lot about coffee and how to make it. Great staff always working or being hired. District management could use some work.
good,my experience getting a job and working with starbucks (where I was) was overall good. I liked working for the company and there were many benefits available to those who desired them.
good,"Working at Starbucks is a good opportunity if you are looking to have your first job. The partners are great and I have no complaints. I enjoyed my time working here. If I can work again in this place, I would. But I hope management would be better a little bit. I had a hard time balancing work and studies due to my manager who wants me to either work more-full time hours or resign. So in the end, I had to prioritize school and I had to resign. But nonetheless, I love working in this place. It was a great experience!"
good,I’ve been a starbucks partner for 2 years & found it to be one of the better customer service jobs I have done. It’s extremely flexible with your schedule needs.
good,"Working at Starbucks is pretty good, I quite emojis making coffee and satisfying customers but it can also get very busy and chaotic there. I really enjoy making customer connections and getting to know the people I’m serving"
good,Starbucks hires a certain kind of people who are lovely and easy to get on with. The job is a great part time job and amazing if you love customer service. Customers can be very very difficult.
good,I've only been working here 8 or 9 months now and I've had 3 different managers and I've had a decent amount of employees get transferred to other stores so just know nothing is permanent there u could be moved if u are able to and in my specific starbucks the customers can be rude so just hold ur ground and smile.
good,"It was a fun learning experience and I met a lot of people, some still remain my friends and some I'm still in contact with. During the holidays some would give us gifts and I in turn would give them a small baked cookie tray."
good,"A typical day involves a lot of struggling to keep up, but all in all its a fair job. I love talking to customers, and the ability to change someone's day simply by chatting with them in the drive-thru is really special."
good,It's a fun work environment for someone that likes to stay busy. Clear job expectations are a plus and you typically get to pick the position you enjoy most.
good,Starbucks teaches individuals to have great teamwork. To always be on your feet and provide the best customer service to individuals. The environment was fun to be around
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun, but challenging at times. Ive worked at multiple ones, and the target starbucks are the most dysfunctional, and unorganized ones ive worked at."
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with those ""peak hours"". When the rush of customers come in between certain hours. It is very fast paced and you are always multi-tasking. Overall, co-workers and manager make it a fun place to work. The perks that come with the job also make it stand out among other part time jobs."
good,"Fast-paced, energetic working environment. Odd hours can take a huge toll on work/life balance. At first, the job has an overwhelming amount of information to learn and fast."
good,"Friendly environment to work at, management is understanding. Work schedules are flexible. Hardest part of the job is keeping up on bar during the busy hours."
good,"working at starbucks can make u feel relaxed and at the same time teach you to communicate with other people, improved ur eye contact and english, not really suitable for introvert tho."
good,"Starbucks culture is and has always been very good. We take care of our customers and each other. That really shows in the benefits. Although I myself (and most of my staff) would have preferred monetary increase over many of the benefit options, Starbucks does provide plenty of benefits if that interests you. Your experience can be amazing or absolutely terrible depending on who your manager is. That goes for any position, barista to Store manager."
good,They are a good company to work for. Pay you decent and love working in coffee. The bosses were great and seems to be a pretty flexible job. If you love coffee this is the job for you.
good,"Starbucks is definitely a place where you can be yourself."
good,"It's a fun place to work, fast paced environment, always busy and great team of workers. If you like working in fast paced and demanding environments, this is definitely the job to apply at."
good,"I enjoyed the people with whom I worked and the hours I worked. I love coffee so that was definitely a plus. I learned a lot about coffee, customer service and working fast and hard. It would be a great job for someone starting out in the workforce."
good,Starbucks is great if you are a student and are just trying to get by. The hours are pretty good and the people I worked with are nice. The management was fair and understanding. The free coffee was nice and I miss it.
good,Starbucks main issue is the pay isn’t worth all the stress and dealing with so many call outs from other cowokers so the ones that comes to work have to pick up the slack
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast paced place to work. The regular customers become fast friends and your team that you work with as well. Many benefits to working there including - free coffee!!"
good,A typical day is fast-paced. Keeping up is priority second only to good customer service. It's important to stay clean and organized while still engaging with customers.
good,Customers were the best part of the job! The interactions with customers were the best part of my day at Starbucks. Making drinks can be very stressful when you have a whole line of people waiting. Because your trying to make several drinks at one time and you are also expected to smile and and talk to the customers while they wait and you can barely hear them over the machines It can be difficult. The day can fly by and can be a lot of fun depending on who you work with!
good,very fast paced enviroment and I learned how to manage a lot at once.management could have been better about encouragement at least from what I witnessed.
good,I gained many job opportunities with Starbucks. This company trained me to gain management skills and the ability to communicate as a team lead. Starbucks gave me the push to move on
good,Partners really encourage new employees to not give up and help them with how to work in the store. The store manager I have is new and is already great with communication with fellow partners and very understanding
good,Love working at this Starbucks the management team was very flexible with my schedule due to school.  Free drinks all I wanted and I loved my co-workers.
good,fun work and fun partners. always meet new customers everyday. learnt new thing. MOD is always give courage to be better and to be kind with customers.
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for with lots of community involvement opportunities.  They have amazing benefits for employees and their families, unfortunately the pay is on the lower end."
good,"I worked at a Safeway stacks kiosk and enjoyed every minute of it. My team members became like my family. The only downside was waking up so early. overall, a great place to work"
good,This is a good place to learn but not to stay forever. The District Manger really isn’t understanding in my opinion and is not well committed to her work employees
good,When I would get to work I would get right to my tasks. I would help take and make orders and then start the process of getting everything ready for the next day. I usually worked during the day until the evening. Every coworker I had was amazing and helped me learn what I needed to. The management was great and made me feel very comfortable. I learned to work under stress and how to manage it
good,This job is only good if you're a student in college the pay isn't all that good and the moving up isn't all good either unless your buddies with a manager or district manager.
good,Great place to start working with endless opportunities to expand and grow. A job where you can reach higher positions within one year of entry. An awesome company to grow and increase your work skills.
good,"Not the best pay, but the culture and family you build with your crew is awesome. The dress code is pretty relaxed - you just need to wear colors along their guidelines. Not super limiting."
good,"Very busy, but fun place to work."
good,Great company to work for especially for the perks that they offer. They really help with your advancement in whatever field you wish to work in. Busy Mornings
good,"It’s a normal retail job. The management, compensation, customers and job dustiest are what to be expected. It was hard to advance in the company without a college degree"
good,"Depending on store location, rushes throughout the day can demand a lot from an employee. Luckily, my management was always upbeat, empathetic, and forward-thinking. When not dealing with difficult customers, the culture promoted casual conversation (within reason) and optimal reprieves from work."
good,It was a nice job! It was busy and you always had something to do. It had a nice work community we liked to be together a work together. It was a little crazy when it was busy but it wasn't unmanageable.
good,I find myself constantly coming back to this employer because of how wonderful they have been to me and my fellow partners. I have never experienced such a strong bond with coworkers and customers.
good,Great always fun and a pleasure to wake up in the morning to be there schedual was never a problem always catered to anyones needs always attempting to go above and beyond
good,"When you’re working at Starbucks, you’ll be surrounded by like-minded coworkers and  managers. Starbucks is dedicated to the academic and career success of its employees. Starbucks offers full tuition coverage to all full- and part-time employees in partnership with Arizona State University. Employees can choose from over 70 online degree programs, and you are not required to stay with Starbucks after you earn your degree."
good,I really enjoy that this company believes in the balance of work a family life. I have always been able to and provide my staff with flexible schedule options that allows the opportunity to really maximize a good balance.
good,quite nice place to work but u need to adapt with the attitude of partners. The salary is not affordable for me because for the full time u only can get like RM1350 a month because i worked at the drive thru store that open until 1.30am and sometimes we finish work on 3am and need to come to work on 11am or 12pm but this place quite good to improve your communication skills towarf customers.
good,It was a fun part time job with not great pay. reccomend if you are a student as they will accommodate school schedule or as a second job. Fairly easy to move up.
good,It was a pretty fun place to work. Training was easy and consistent. Compensation was average. Scheduling and management were average. Our store was set up badly. Stocking closet was way too far away.
good,"Overall, Starbucks is great.  They are really focused on making sure their employees are supported and the benefits are amazing.  The biggest issue I have is just feeling burned out with the pure volume of work.  Even at a ""slower"" location, there's tons to do and after awhile, you just start to lose motivation."
good,"I enjoy the culture and feel safe as an LGBGQ+ person, but i dont feel compensated for my work. The high turn over rate causes a sense of never really being a part of a solid team."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes rotating through a series of tasks set to be completed throughout each daypart. We prepare drinks, clean the counters and equipment, and maintain an efficient environment by stocking necessary materials."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work and they offer flexibility and benefits for part time workers. I learned a lot from working there and met so many awesome people who I'm still friends with today. I never thought I was good enough to be a shift supervisor, but the saw something in me that I didn't se in myself and I will be forever grateful for that. It will help me in my career be the best I can be."
good,"Starbucks is a terrific company at heart. They want to make money and make coffee for the people. That's the higher calling and siren song that leads the district managers on up to the current CEO."
good,"At Starbucks you have to always have a smile, run around working and fix problems with customers. Free coffee and health care is great but the pay is very little with year raises of about .20 cents."
good,"Starbucks has the potential to be a wonderful job. Your benefits are great, it is an extremely welcoming environment for all sorts of people, and they pay above minimum wage (which, for a job with no qualifications, is not bad). The company is built for the employees, so assuming that you have a good manager you will feel included, supported, respected, and heard. It isn't always easy, as business patterns can be extremely erratic and you often see yourself understaffed, but a good team can get through it with smiles. You can essentially make the beverages and/or food, stock the store, or talk to customers. Free coffee every week, a discount at every Starbucks, and free drinks/food on your shifts are just some of the wonderful benefits Starbucks offers to all employees, not just full time ones."
good,"Starbucks is a welcoming work environment with advancement opportunities. Relocating to virtually anywhere is fairly easy as long as you find a store with an open position in the area you are looking. There are times where it is extremely busy, but routine standards are in place to make work flow more effortlessly. I learned the importance of listening to customers and helping with their individual needs or concerns to make their experience legendary."
good,"Working at Starbucks was okay, you got paid weekyl, tips off the books cash weekly and a free coffee or boxed jiuce item weekly. That was cool and a food and drink on every shift"
good,Enjoyed my time working at Starbucks while earning my degree. I worked full time and felt that the job was relaxed enough that I was able to make money and still be committed to my studies.
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company who takes pride in their products, Partners (employees), and serves all communities all for the greater good."
good,Culture depends on who the supervisor is but it was entertaining/business professional for the most part. Learned how to communicate with others and gained social skills.
good,I was at Starbucks for almost 8 years and I love working for Starbucks when I left I was so sad but you have to change but I would recommend someone who wants to work at Starbucks go for it
good,"A typical day at Starbucks started with clocking into the store's computer system, from there you would go to the current shift lead and inquire which position needed to be filled during your shift. Based on the time of day the roles in which needed to be filled would change as the flow of customers slowed or speed up during rushes. I learned a large amount about the unique coffee culture which Starbucks prides itself on, along with the many unique ways of making different kinds of coffee. The most difficult part of the job was keeping up with the intense flow of customers during rushes. During the mornings and lunchtimes, large rushes would occur and in order to keep up with the demands of our customers, each employee would be placed at a station. Due to this, it was a very interesting team-building experience where the very success of the store depended on each employees ability to work as a team."
good,"Typical day:"
good,"I worked at Starbucks for years, and working in many different stores. It was a great place to make friends and it was a fun spot to work. It is fast paced and each store is very different. I enjoyed working at some stores more than others, but always enjoyed going to work."
good,Starbucks was a great place to work and learn how to be a supervisor. One of the major benefits was insurance even for parttime employees. Flexible work schedules.
good,"Good for anyone who enjoys a fast passed environment. The job taught me to make real life connections with customers, provided diversity training and a passion for coffee."
good,Je viens souvent prendre un cafe a Starbucks et je me retrouve avec un très grand sourire une fois sortie. Les gens qui travaillent st très gentilles et aides beaucoup.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and fast paced. I learned many skills as their are different roles you take while being a barista such as cashier, customer support etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was making connections with the customers and being able to engage in conversation with them."
good,"SBUX corporate in Seattle's SODO district is a pleasant place to work with good mix of cultural backgrounds, pleasant people, generally very professional and personable.  "
good,"They offer great benefits, including college tuition reimbursement, It is an enjoyable work environment and sets you up for real life skills that can be applied to a number of jobs."
good,Overall I love my job. I enjoy Starbucks as a customer and as a partner but there are a lot of kinks within Starbucks stores. Poorly trained partners to inexperienced managers. More time needs to be taken for the hourly partners to ensure comfort and readiness. I also feel as if Starbucks should only promote from within because you cannot be a manager without being a barista and a key holder first because the two are so demanding and can only truly be understood if starting there not working backwards.
good,"A typical day at work was usually laid back, but when we did get rush hours that is when the stress kinda kicked in. I learned a lot. How to handle time, money handling and how to deal with customers feedback professionally."
good,I leared how to clean certain parts of the coffe machine that i have never discovered before. I also made friends with customers that came on the regular.  This job strengthens your ability to multi task as well as remembering i loved working there it was a challenge at first till i got the hang of it
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for when you need help with collage or a 401k plan. Starbucks has great benefits. Always a good job to have when you love meeting new people and wanting to be creative.
good,"Un buen lugar para comenzar a trabajar, hay capacitación constante"
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a lot of fun- you bond with your coworkers and get to meet and interact with a lot of people. I am personally very passionate about coffee, but if you are not, it's not hard (certainly not as hard as working at a restaurant). I love going to work and don't dread it, and shifts are only 4-6 hours usually so even if you do, it's not bad. Each shift, you'll be assigned to a different position (bar, cashier, drive-through, etc.) and you get a 10 minute break (30 if you work more than 7 hours). Unfortunately, the pay isn't great but if you have any substituted income, it can be enough. If you do plan on applying, stores are always accepting applications online but you have to go in person and ask to speak with the manager to get an interview. You definitely want to research the company and talk about their values of ""customer connections"" and stuff."
good,I learned that being a barista takes a lot of multitasking and stamina to be handle to keep a smile on even when in a rush or focusing on more than one task at a time. My days at starbucks were always enjoyable especially because of my co workers at that time.
good,I worked at Starbucks through the holiday season and I though it was an amazing experience. I trained and became so good at being a barista I got promoted to a shift leader within the first 2 months of working there. Their product is good and interesting to learn about. My manager at the time was terrible however. She would come in hung over and throw up out back and could never complete anything. My co-worker and I practically ran the place for the last few months it was open.
good,"Good, flexible job for a college student it heart figuring out life. I worked here because my college class schedules were chaotic but they worked with me and even during my military obligations"
good,I was the assist manager and then transitioned to become the manager of a starbucks inside a grocery store. It was a decent place to work not far from where I lived. I loved making coffee and working with a good team to ensure everything was in order and items were ordered as needed.
good,"The benefits are wonderful, and the team is very welcoming. Pay is way too low for the detail-oriented job in which you have a lot of expectations to uphold. Peak times are very busy, but manageable with your team."
good,"A typical day as a Starbucks barista would be working together with your fellow co-workers to create different drinks for paying customers."
good,My particular store was high volume and the manager has high demands for our speed and efficiency. This job can be very stressful at times if you are not well staffed. The job can be rewarding at times though when you get to make genuine customer connections.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of getting there, counting the safe over, making sure all of the baristas on shift were where they needed to be, start cleaning things, making sure everything is in order, do the pastry pull, then proceed with the rest of the day until close. At close you count down all of the tills, make sure everything is cleaned and put back, make sure all of the fridge and freezer temps are correct and close up."
good,My overall experience with starbucks was decent. Great management and my co workers were always helpful. Ive also built healthy relationships with customers giving me something to look forward to on a daily.
good,Love interacting with customers. Typical day was making sure every customer was satisfied with their order and getting all daily tasks completed while helping customers.
good,I started at a Starbucks in a Target and left because Target literally has no idea what they’re doing with a Target. Came to a Starbucks and loved it a lot.
good,"At the time of working there I was around 18 or 19 years old. The work environment was just entry level enough for me to understand and enjoy but also had plenty of opportunity for moving up and establishing a proper living off of. The friendships made from working there, both customers and coworkers, still hold up years later. The benefits are rather good for being a simple barista job."
good,"Lovely company to work for, in terms of benefits and how they help employees. Can over-work some larger, high-volume stores, but morale tends to stay up as long as in-store management is positive and understands how their floor should run"
good,"Fun, fast paced job where an ability to quickly change gears and multitask is key. Easy to bond with coworkers. Upper management can be a bit cult-y and has some strange and unrealistic expectations for the workers on the ground. The quality of lower level management and workplace culture varies from store to store but is generally pretty good. The hardest part of the job is mastering the wide range of small tasks that must be completed daily: For most people this takes several months. The most enjoyable part of the job comes from a sense of solidarity with coworkers and connections with regular customers. The free coffee is a nice bonus too."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I started as a barista after working in a few other fast casual restaurants. The culture, at least at my store, was completely unlike other food service jobs I had worked in previously. Everyone was collaborative and fun to work with, and if you can put up with always being on your feet and moving it is a good job. However the pay isn't great, and a lot of opportunity for advancement can be limited once you get past Shift Supervisor depending on your area."
good,"This store is one of the busiest stores in my district, but it also has one of the best teams running it."
good,"I would brew coffee, clean and wash dishes. I would handle the register, take orders, and help with customer service. I would also handle trash, and move tables and equipment."
good,"The free coffee, free Spotify and the friendships that you form are what kept me there so long! It gets very stressful when its busy. People are not very nice when they want their coffee."
good,What I learned working at Starbucks as a shift supervisor was to be patient and also not to be a hot head when things aren't going right. I do admit it was awesome to working at Starbucks cause I learned how to be quick and multi-task
good,I still work for Starbucks and I enjoy working for them. As a leader for Starbucks you have to be resilient and adaptable . Its taught me to be both . I'm truly grateful for the opportunities this company has given me.
good,The job is easy however sometimes becomes difficult which is why it’s important to have good communication skills when working with your team but also work independently.
good,"Working for Starbucks has its pros and cons.  Coworkers were amazing, and I learned a lot during my time there.  Can get stressful, and corporate can be a little out of touch at times.  Benefits are amazing."
good,I had an amazing experience while working  at Starbucks. Although it was a little stressful but I love the challenges that  faced during my time there.
good,I worked at Starbucks within a Target store. I enjoyed the workflow and the team mentality. My only complaint was that I would often be left alone on a shift to handle multiple customers at a time.
good,"I will miss the social aspect of this job, but it is hard work at the end of the day. Just like any other job you will have good and bad days. If you have a bad day you are expected to brush it under the rug or else the managers will patronize you about how you're living up to the mission statement."
good,Slinging drinks is a blast with a good crew. Gets pretty busy at times so may not be the best for everyone. I loved working there. Some customers can be pretty rude though.
good,"There are different daily and weekly tasks depending on what shift you're working and what role you have for the day. I loved that shift supervisors would try to put you where you worked best, but would also try to not put you in the same role each time, which kept things fresh. Typically, your goal is to leave the least amount of work possible for the next shift. Rushes happen at every store, no matter the size or type (i.e. drive-thru vs cafe-only) so being able to work quickly and under pressure is a must-have skill. One of the hardest parts of the job is the first few weeks of training. It is a lot of information and new abilities that you are required to memorize and pick up quickly. Another difficult part of the job is handling rude customers (as with any service job). I had both great and awful managers, but I found that the store managers that had started from the bottom as a barista and made their way up, made much better bosses to work for. I see more Starbucks' hiring managers straight into the position and it often causes a rift in the relationship between the baristas and managers because they don't have the foundation for how a Starbucks runs, which is imperative to the role. It is a unique balancing act to run a successful and smooth shift and experience on the floor is absolutely required to be able to do that. In any case, the most enjoyable part of the job was building strong relationships with my co-workers and our customers. Experimenting with drink combinations and working on bar was always so much fun!"
good,"It is a place where you are not scared to be yourself. Partners and warm and welcoming, customers become fast friends, and HR is always there to answer the most difficult questions to make your jab life easier."
good,"Emphasis on Connecting with Customers, creating an inclusive environment, delivering excellent customer service and product."
good,"a typical day at work would be me punching in to work and asking my shift supervisor where would they want me at today (bar,register,customer support) and making sure every customer has a great starbucks experience. i learn communication skills , time management and customer experience the hardest part would be being short staff while trying create the customer experience. having to connect with customers and getting there feedback on how was there encounter and there drink or food here at starbucks."
good,"Honestly just need to get paid more for the work you do, especially at busy stores. The job is rewarding and satisfying when things go well, but there are many time where you are put under pressure and intense stress to produce, Things can go bad very quickly. With how profitable Starbucks is as a company. Partners are definitely underpaid."
good,Working at Starbucks can help you become and even better person in the future. You get to meet an ample amount of customers and get to hear about their lives and what they are into. The only difficult part about working here was taking care of all of the tasks that is given in such a short amount of time
good,fast paced at times as long as you work together it is a cool place to work very diverse and enjoyable to work day or night just remain calm when there are a lot of customers
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making 50+ customizable drinks for customers and heating frozen food items. This job also included frequent cleaning like mopping, dishes, trash runs, etc. "
good,"A very balance workplace, good in enhancing skills as a person and a barista but undergraduates like dont have a chance to be promoted as part of management team."
good,"El empleo es bueno, tienen un muy buen ambiente de trabajo lo malo son los clientes ya que ellos siempre tienen la razon"
good,"As we all know, to be a part of the service industry it is most likely very tiring but I enjoyed it a lot as I was able to learn a lot of things like such adapting with the different personalities of our customers."
good,"Working the graveyard shift at Starbucks has taught me a great many things. I have learned to be quick on my feet, self-sufficient and a pro at multi-tasking. From manning the cash register, working both cafe and drive thru, making drinks and preparing food, restocking and cleaning all at the same time."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Starbucks.  "
good,"Productive, quick-paced & fun environment to work in. Cleaning: from the bathrooms (major cleaning at least three times a day, with checks every ten to fifteen minutes) to the floors, counters, tables, chairs, condiment bars, trash cans, drivethrough (checking for trash, emptying trash cans), any patio areas (wiping tables, sweeping messes, etc), backroom (dishes, floors, mop sink, etc), and the obvious front-of-house cleaning tasks (floors, sinks, counters, machines, pastry case, refrigerated case, etc etc). Restocking: under-counter refrigerators (Milks, soy, any prepared items we used like eggnog, etc), refrigerated case (any RTD - ready to drink - items like bottled frappuccinos, juices, waters, and also the lunch items like the fruit & cheese trays, sandwiches, etc), pastry case, condiment bar (sugars, straws, stir sticks, napkins), things behind the counter (cups, lids, syrups, etc)... Dishes - endless work here! Prep (mixing mocha, and, back in the day, frappuccino mix, etc)."
good,"A typical day at work looked like, clocking in and asking the manager in charge where you are located to work at and working there and doing side tasks until the shift was over."
good,Starbucks has changed over the course of years I've been for 12 I was ready for a change too. I no longer feel required to speak on the job itself. overall it is a good company to work for if that's where you choose to work
good,"This job is excellent for students who seeking for new experiences in communication and gaining more confidence. But this job not always give the opportunities to grow in your own career or develop yourself."
good,"The fast paced business really whips you into a efficient state. The company has great benefits for the type of job you have. The one complaint I had was focused on the customers that came in. My fellow employees were fun to wrk with, but the customers consistently test your limits. This truly made me grow as an employee, showing me how to handle the stickiest of situations and how to keep the guests satisfied."
good,"Good if you need a part time job for benefits, lots of the experience depends on the store you work at. I would not recommend working in a drive through."
good,"Some of the managers could be better, just depends what store you’re at. It gets extremely busy at times. Customers can be rude but you must treat them as your best friend. Starbucks is very big on their connections with customers and making sure everyone feels welcome. The work isn’t that hard and the company is great."
good,"Day to day tasks are very repetitive so you know what to expect, but learning new drinks and having a wide demographic of customers keeps the day interesting and refreshing. You learn how to multi-task very well and to always be thinking on your feet."
good,"Management was great and the partners I worked with where all amazing people. It was fun to work with them and also very educational. The only problem is the customers, they are usually very entitled and rude but that's not the company's fault."
good,"I worked here for five years, and it was a great first job for me to learn the basics in an environment where you didn't constantly feel pressured not to fail. The worst thing you could do was spill coffee at the barista level, so it was a good place to learn urgency, time management, and people skills."
good,"Working for Starbucks,Canada was an amazing experience. It also was my first job! I was able to acquire the skills that I never acknowledged before. I really would recommend Starbucks to anybody for a job!"
good,"busy specially around the holiday,and spring break.ilike that its busy because time go by fast.and they tips you make through out the day are awesome."
good,What I enjoyed most about this job was how I felt very close and connected with the other employees there. The same sort of connection was also expressed with the customers. It was as if everyone was a family there.
good,"Having to work at starbucks while having college on the side was quite stressful at times to balance as it would take too much time and energy out of me which left me worn out and unable to concentrate with my studies but, other than that was a great experience and enjoyed working with my team alot."
good,Starbucks is a great company for advancement if you have the personality type. You cannot be easily stressed or offended due to the fast pace nature and type of customers the company appeals to.
good,"Enjoyed working there for almost 2 years, the team was really great and lovely and the hours were very flexible. It is a very good place to start to work."
good,"Fun fast paced environment with great people, with great work ethic and attitude.  Company treats you great and id reccomend it as a first time job for anyone trying to get into the food industry."
good,"My time at Starbucks was a great learning experience.  Working in close quarters with a team was challenging, bring customers into it was even more challenging. "
good,"Overall, Starbucks should improve the organization of employer to employee conversation(s). They should be documented depending on the subject. "
good,I love the company. Just some stores are complete train wrecks. The customers are usually great. It's worth sticking in there and finding the right store for you. I just ended up somewhere where there isnt a Starbucks so I had to quit. The commute was too unbearable.
good,"a typical work day was starting shift at about 6, helping customers, making drinks, and once things slowed down , began breaking things down cleaning, restocking and getting things ready for the next day.i learn about all sorts of coffees, and drinks and how to make them. management was probably the best part. the people i worked with were always cool and interesting. the hardest part of the job was probably just satisfying many customers when your  working by yourself at the end of the night. the mot enjoyable part was probably getting to know my coworkers."
good,"When I was in college and even when I was not, this was a great job. Benefits are very good. Pay is reasonable. Work environment was fun and fast paced."
good,"As stated in other reviews I have read, accountability of partners is discretionary. Many things are overlooked. If you have a good attitude and work ethic, you will be fine. If you rock the boat, you will be on a fast track out."
good,"The people you work with on a daily basis, both other partners as well as customers, were very interesting and great to work with and around.  It is a pretty quickly paced work environment and you need to be able to work quickly and efficiently, but it's fun and the people I worked with were great."
good,I started working  at Starbucks at 16 and I left at 19 throughout those 2 years Starbucks taught me many things but the main tools it taught me were how to be a great manager and to multi task.
