rating,review
bad,Horrible management with no knowledge of the project at hand. They do not take responsibility for their actions nor have  the ability to treat their team with respect and proper training.
bad,"The Hiring manager shortlist your resume and sends you email to get more details. Upon seeing salary expectation they reply this is their budget and then you need to call and beg for an update. An email will come asking if you are comfortable at particular outlet and when you reply yes, they will say you didnt get a job because you didnt pass a phone interview - that never happened. "
bad,The company's leadership doesn't appear to have a clear vision of how to effectively transform the company in order to succeed in the future. The pay is significantly below market and the work-life balance is the worst I've experienced.
bad,"The company is struggling to grow due to increased competition from tech and low cost providers. With the switch to digital the core Western Union service going away at the current price point, this eroding it’s margins. WU is laying off a significant amount of its staff (10% to 20%) and moving various operations to low cost areas. This shift is crippling the business and productivity, thus creating a terrible environment."
bad,"Not engaged, unprofessional, and unethical. One of the worse places I have ever worked, have never been treated as bad as I was treated at this place.  Wouldn't recommend anyone to work here."
bad,Constant layoffs and those who remain have to pick up the work.  I don't recommend the company.  Jobs are being shipped to India and to Lithuania.  Looks elsewhere.
bad,"Very poor work environment. "
bad,Would not go back.  Glad I left.  Would not recommend for anything.  Horrible culture and dishonest management.  Avoid at all costs.  Lots of talk about great culture and employees with no actual execution of anything other than lining management's pockets.
bad,"Security didn't feel as safe as I would as if I was in a federal building. With the amounts of cash that travels in and out daily. I would of thought the building would more secure, Considering the location of the business."
bad,"Empresa que você não tinha suporte de marketing, cobravam metas abusivas."
bad,"poor direction.   not happy with management and overall outlook.   extremely high turnover in the sales dept.  no opportunity for growth.  lots of favoritism shown.   "
bad,"Exelente empresa. Pero el pago. Es muy bajo un cajero de un super gana entre 25 y 27 mil pesos y cajero bancario gana mucho mas."
bad,"I do not work for Western Union, I work for a company that provides their services. Western Union is a difficult company to deal with. I do not have much to say about this company."
bad,This company did not take care employees the underpay and no room for advancement the manager was rude  and my DM was the best thing for the company and then they fired her
bad,was very thankful and very fortunate for an opportunity to do a job i learned to love appreciate and take pride in doing smiling greeting and assisting others is what i took pride in and miss the most there
bad,"Stressful atmosphere, didnt like it one bit"
bad,"I started at coral beach since 2006 but I am proud being on this team and will always remember all the knowledge and experience i had with this prestigious company.They let me develop my skills and personality as well as my talent that helps me to be a better person "
bad,"I cant say much because I still cant understand the ludicrousness from start to end. it was a sloppy hiring initiation, and i had a bad feeling and sure enough you should listen to your gut. Starting from pre-interview to now it has been a decision I wish i could erase from my mind. But you live and you take the negatives to make future positives."
bad,"Management was a joke, very condescending and amateurish."
bad,"reaching out to the general public"
bad,"Although it is a great name in the money transfer world, but here in Syria, it doesn’t live up to its name around the world. It should really pay more attention to its employees."
bad,"Locals who work in the company treat foreigners so badly, and the management doesn't care! "
bad,Company lost in its own bureaucracy. Unattainable quotas which are not communicated until late into the quarter. No explanation on how quotas are set. Supervisors are micro managed who in turn micro manage employees. No flexibility or receptiveness to new ideas or procedures. Toxic work environment from the leadership down to bottom. Was once a positive upbeat company
bad,I worked for Western Union for 8 years and the leadership has no clue of what drives the company. They set goals that are not obtainable to set even higher goals. The Leadership brings in managers from other countries to run the US. These managers are office managers and has no clue what it takes to keeps agents going. The new goal is cut customer service and grow.
bad,Accounting department was poorly managed and understaffed.  Work hours on some days would be 15+ hours due to under staffing issues and too much work to be done in a short time.
bad,Management are total micro managers obsessing about KPI's and day to say targets. When targets are being missed the only remedy is to make more low quality badly researched calls. There is no culture for education  or progression and no real intent to uptier the offering
bad,"Pésima empresa, desordenada, la gerencia es desatenta no te da base para mejora."
bad,This company is no longer operating as a call center in the United States. Since they closed the call center in 2008 unable to give a review or rate this company fairly.
bad,"Management were overall out to further themselves and when things went wrong (which can happen), there was a tendency to blame people before trying to resolve problems. "
bad,"If you are seeing an increase in openings it is because 50%  of the US division has left or is in the process of leaving.   Western Union has hit rock bottom with unstable leadership, antiquated systems and a product that is no longer competitive.   The word toxic is used on a daily basis."
bad,"Learned Vision and SQL"
bad,"This company offers the chance to learn and understand business from a global perspective. The best part is your brain does not get bored and there is always opportunity to learn. That said, senior management is terrible at best. The company's mantra is layoffs, layoffs, layoffs in order to meet bottom lines.There is not a lot of accountability shown at the top and subordinates are held to higher standards than leaders hold themselves to. It's too bad because this could be an amazing company."
bad,We came in not knowing it was a ill equipped call center with no direction and zero professionalism from team leads. Favoritism and a lack of knowledge was 2 of the most displayed activities on the floor if you were bilingual.
bad,Leider wird man nicht wertgeschätzt. habe keine guten Erfahrungen
bad,Great salary but no concept of work/life balance. Management was terrible. They were all transported from New York City to Denver and not suited to the Denver culture.
bad,No career growth or career development. Senior management team has a clear vision but it doesn’t trickle down to the other managers. Very limited opportunities to growth within the organization unless you are located in Denver.
bad,I don't see any growth in the company. It feels like they are planning to ship the job to anther country and the turnover these past weeks is becoming quite alarming
bad,"Benefits are great and people are generally nice, but THE most dysfunctional company I have EVER worked for.  I have NEVER seen such overwhelming incompetence at the manager, Director, and Executive levels in a company.  Not only does the right hand not know what the left hand is doing, the thumb and index finger on the same hand are out of sync.  The real culture in the company (not the marketing propaganda) highly rewards those that tell leadership what they want hear versus the truth - to the extent of people outright lying to leadership.  And if you do point out the issues and details that are not in the leadership fantasies, you are marginalized.  Most importantly, Leadership has no idea how to actually manage and lead people.   They have grand visions, but completely fail to recognize the fact that they don't have ANY of the talent in the company necessary to make the grand plans happen.  They hire happy, positive sounding people with no real skills or experience - even at the senior levels.  Getting ANYTHING done takes twice as long and 3 times more money than it would at any other company because very few people are actually competent at their jobs and leadership focuses on completely the wrong things.  There is no real leadership in the company, departments go off and do their own thing without aligning or coordinating with other departments  Leadership presents pretty pictures of the future, but then doesn't actually manage and LEAD the process - they just assume their visions will magically happen by themselves.  So many ""senior"" people here would barely qualify for"
bad,"Empresa ótima, tem uma remuneração excelente, porém a gerência é péssima."
bad,"The company is an industry that is going through huge disruption from digital players. While the company pays lip service to change and innovation, there is not a whole lot of appetite for doing things differently from the old ways."
bad,Un buen. Ambiente laboral tanto con los jefes como con los compañeros
bad,"Come to work on time and punch in"
bad,Poorly managed and under paid for the duties that you are required to carry out. Have to be a grade 10 or above to get a bonus even though you are still expected to work above and beyond to help the company to reach it's goals only few are rewarded with a bonus.
bad,"It's been almost 10 years since working there, however when I was employed at WU, I found the work place to be unfriendly and unstable. The product was not sustainable which drove a lot of fear among employees."
bad,"Not satisfactory with the work and don't like night shifts, also there is not technical learning curve"
bad,I cannot speak about the western union company that i never work for. I worked as an agent for this company inside Stop and shop to process transactions.
bad,Management does not care about the employees. Whistle blowing is not welcomed. Forget about life-work balance. The managerial strategy is let's see how much work we can give the employees before they snap.
bad,"Depending on the day and the hour. A day at work can be chaotic one day and real slow on other days. We have to make sure we keep our cool and have maximum patience to get through the day smoothly. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting through it without coming out short on money. Due to the fact that there are many tasks to get by, but once you get used to the fast pace it is good."
bad,not recommend to anyone no work life balance. Would not recommend WU unless you are desperate. Very difficult culture and very difficult work environment
bad,"The Customer Service staff bearly speaks English,everything is outsource over seas. Ugh..I felt sorry for the customers. Customer Service reps do not know how to listen to what the customer issues are. They really..really need to not outsource the one way customers have of getting help for their concerns. Very very awful."
bad,"A typical day at WU included check my emails, handle transactions, provide an excellent customer services by calling the customer center line for the client , many times translate for them because most of the customers spoke Spanish, take my compliance quizzes, answer phone calls, have meetings with supervisors and manager and make sure my team was up to date with the new regulations or restrictions. The hardest part of the job was to make some customers understand that sending money to people they do not personally know was a type of scam and we can not proceed her/his transaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was when my supervisors would approach to me and say that a lot of customers would ask for me while I was out on vacation. The relationship I had with my customers was unique because they knew that I will go above and beyond to help them."
bad,This was a call center and the environment was very high school like in nature. The WU contract has been dissolved therefore this job is no longer available.
bad,"extreme Fluktuation, gerade im Sales /CRM"
bad,"Productive and fun place with ping pong table."
bad,"unprofessional.... not a fit to be called as MNC... low level politics... work balance on toss... A Lebanese mafia company... dominated by Lebanese. "
bad,"Pros: relaxed work environment, not alot of big egos and good office location."
bad,"There is a clear disconnect between all the moving of this massive company. Unfortunately, there's much to be done internally to reach an environment where employees can fulfill the basic duties of their job and meet consumer demands."
bad,Im here because of our boss is so kind and helpful but our salary is so small compare to other.So I decided to look other job to increase my monthly income for my family.
bad,"the environment was pretty casual and relaxed, and it was fairly low stress. pay wasn't great. data entry was pretty easy and required some personal judgment - supervisors were willing to help answer questions due to how ambiguous some of the data entry could be."
bad,"Aucune gestion n'est plus difficile que la gestion du client mais un client satisfait devient un client fidèle. Il ne s'agit pas seulement de comptabilité ou de profit mais beaucoup plus de satisfaction de la clientèle tout en respectant les normes de Western Union; et donc offrir un service de qualité, ponctualité et satisfaction."
bad,Western union is going to massing change for the past 10 years. Change is inevitable but  in Western union change is happening so frequently that there is no long term vision for the company.
bad,"Workload out of control at times management not always supportive, management meetings every day hard pushed to find a team leader at his or her desk. Company is all about money. My role was down graded overnight bonus taken away and a large salary loss but worked harder and longer than most, very clicky to much favouritism and they were the ones always rewarded time and time again you dedicate yourself to the company but no loyalty in return"
bad,"Declining work environment experience.  Management not valuing people assets. Priority is perception, not work getting done."
bad,"making transactions for people who want to send or receive money worldwide"
bad,A typical day at work would be processing a high volume of Draft's and wires while upholding daily deadlines.I learned how to multi-task in a fast pace environment while maintaining the integrity in my work.Management played a supervisory role more then they managed. A great morale among co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting other departments to communicate and share information with each other on more than just a need to know basis.The elated responses and feedback i would get from clients praising my attention to detail and accuracy associated with my work.
bad,"Poor leadership, no culture to speak of, poor practices, not a good future ahead of it."
bad,"Great potential, but disconnected management. A good place to work for consultants, not so good for FTEs."
bad,I supported multiple applications at Western Union and as such no day was generally the same.  I worked remotely and therefore had to constantly evaluate the priorities ensuring that what needed to be done got done.  This made each day different and challenging which I liked.
bad,"Poor leadership from the top down, it is like being back in Jr. high you have to be in the right group to get noticed, move ahead or even keep you job."
bad,"As this industry favors the Arab expacts, this company is one good example. Had good learning experience working in western union but due to arabic culture i lost my job."
bad,"Buen horario laboral, buen salario, comisiones, pero poco respeto a la dignidad del empleado."
bad,"The environment at Western Union is toxic. Although the position paid well, the emotional stress was too much to compensate."
bad,for someone who is a tad older and needs a stable job. however you will be sitting and repeating your for 8hrs. it consisted of sitting down listening to people screem at you. you must pay 40 dollars of your own money for headphones. no one will be able to hear you and a good 90% of all callers are very rude and nearly impossible to deal with.
bad,"Process set up is required to easy employee life in Western Union. Should look forward to be employee friendly."
bad,Worked my tail off for them for 29 years and they laid me off for the all might dollar.  Would not recommend this company for anyone.
bad,"As a company with a history of innovation, the Board and Executive Team need to get out of the way and let this company succeed.  Ongoing restructuring isn't a great way to run a business!"
bad,The workplace was a normal environment. The work a person must do isn't all that hard. The only thing really good is the benefits western union provides.
bad,"Although my career with WU started well, not all changes which occur with a company are positive.  I loved my job at WU and the people I associated with.  I was able to learn and grow with the company and gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to perform my job.  The former management was typical of a ""Corporate"" environment and was relatively good.  Benefits offered by the company were good as were educational opportunities."
bad,"The company itself is wonderful. There are plenty of resources for learning and plenty of things to do at all times. I learned a few new ways to help defuse an escalated situation as well as how to file paperwork in a more efficient way. The management however does not live up to standards. They did not give proper training, did not have a schedule they stuck to, and were not easy to talk to. They were very inconsistent with what their employees could and could not do."
bad,"Office environment was great, same for my coworkers and management. Hardest part of the job were the hours, and certainly no holidays off or paid overtime. Thanksgiving, Christmas and New years hours were the same from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. Monday-Sunday same hours. No sick days, personal days, or vacation."
bad,I would not recommend working here if you want to be happy and feel secure in your position
bad,"lots of work but you need to figure your way out, heavy work load so be prepared to work long hours and weekends"
bad,"A Western Union, não cultiva um ambiente colaborativo nem multicultural, pessoas com cargos ""menores"", são ignoradas em suas necessidades, o RH é gerido de forma muito ruim, onde as diretora e gerente, visam benefícios apenas para cargos altos como diretores, não há nenhum tipo de apoio mesmo que solicitado, eu fazia frequentes consultas com psicólogos, me abri para a diretora de RH (Florência Schwartzman)  pessoalmente e por e-mail tentando encontrar um equilíbrio, mas ela nunca se manifestou. De modo geral, empresa competitiva entre as áreas onde o mais importante é encontrar o culpado e não a solução."
bad,"Global company with good pay and benefits. Issue in Toronto was the toxic sales management and so called leadership. The VP of Sales was a tyrant who would harass his sales assistants, belittle sales people and steal credit to make himself look good. He was protected by the Country Manager and HR turned the other cheek each time. Definitely not the “WU Way” of culture and respect. This company needs to take a hard look at how this toxic environment is allowed to continue and behaviour is allowed to go unchecked."
bad,"Benefits are great and people are generally nice, but THE most dysfunctional company I have EVER worked for.  I have NEVER seen such overwhelming incompetence at the manager, Director, and Executive levels in a company.  Not only does the right hand not know what the left hand is doing, the thumb and index finger on the same hand are out of sync.

bad,"To many projects to work on at one time, so can't make sure they are done correctly by IT. This causes a lot of rework. Need to have a better organized approach that is supported."
bad,"Exciting company when the digital division was started.  However, while the people are talented and down to earth, the company is having a hard time executing."
bad,"Got an opportunity to learn about a new domain i.e. Vendor Management. A typical day at work would be to start with a daily huddle, get to know about individual and team priorities."
bad,"I have been working at WU full time for about 5 years. The pay and benefits are competitive and easy to hold on to. Management is constantly confused, not sure what is going on within the company, or can't get through to other departments. The strategy changes constantly and the waste is astronomical. WU has been trying to implement lean for a couple of years now and it has added new departments with new silos. There is heavy middle management with no reports acting independently. The company is very big on stating 'you own your career' but leaves even internal employees in the dark on any company opportunities or internal applications. Easy to coast through for salary and benefits, mind-numbingly hard to navigate and move forward in even the day to day tasks."
bad,Uncertainty within the work environment as communication is withheld sometimes deliberately by line management. There are lots of dinosaurs who are change averse and have been around for ever.
bad,Empresa donde se crece profesionalmente pues participas en las estrategias para nejorar
bad,Me gusto murcho la explicaciones por eso lê califique meu nome a todo
bad,This was a great company to work for. You got hands-on experience in everything to do with financial institution Management staff was great. Face to face customer service with general public.
bad,im trying to telecaller job because iknow very well computer knowledge and how to talk with custumers i know 3 languanges ENGLISH ; TELUGU ;HINDI
good,Company is very good but senior employ is not supportive so I want change this company because salary structure is very bad as cluster manager only providing me 4th class salary.
good,"Kmart is a good job for a person that is looking for their very 1st job it only pays minimum wage, their management is ok."
good,This place is not suitable for whom who work free mindedly. There is a lot of pressure from the company to the firm holder about sales and other work.
good,"I learned a lot of new skills, that I didn't know, but the pay was not too good the hours were flexible, but not what I was looking for, staying there late nights was not efficient for me.  I am glad that i got the experience  of learning something new."
good,"Hi Team,"
good,Good professionals. Merit-based advancement needs to improve.
good,"The company changes its operating themes  at least once a year, sometimes quarterly. Management gets excited about one idea, and everyone wants to align with the CEO's vision, only to find out six months later that there is a new idea and the company doesn't promote the old one any more. Employees have learned to motor through these periods by keeping their heads down and thinking/acting conservatively. Annual layoffs can be severe, to enhance expense projections for the following year, and they always happen the week before Thanksgiving. The work environment is good. Most people start work early and leave early. In general, flexible work hours are supported by management. It is a family-friendly company."
good,"culture is to excel no matter who you need to run over. Stressful and no opportunity for career growth, too many political games.  Very good benefits but hard to be motivated to work"
good,"Nice to work with this company 1 year six months, get good experience, this is basically communication job, and easiest way to send& receive money from other country,"
good,"Was working for a call centre for a Western Union project. Was challenging and never boring, the best were the colleagues and the environment created. Learnt a lot of things, mainly to have extreme patience with the customers and how to deal with the most problematic ones. The hardest part of the job is that when dealing with money, you have to deal with the different country restrictions and the lack of understanding from the customers. The most enjoyable part would be the same, depends on how you take it."
good,"Learned: Market and what to expect, how to correctly defuse client issues and find the best outcome for the client"
good,Working at Western Union was eye-opening and not very pleasant because of the internal politics that played out between the technical and the creative team.
good,"security was a little too non existent, and the opportunity for growth is stifled. The schedule did not allow for persons to further education. Customers threaten you daily."
good,"Poor management"
good,Poor management. Little direction. Lots of individual empire building with little cooperation amongst or between groups. Company focus on how things have been done in the past. The procedures are tedious and out of step with current technology and trends.
good,"Time was flexible, career growth was very challenging for most, little opportunity for advancement. The culture changed between organizations. Management struggles at times with clear direction."
good,OK job until you realize you're underpaid for the long hours without vacation or time off. The owners are completely shady and fire employees for unreasonable excuses.
good,Help your manager understand what he wants to know.
good,"Good place to work.  I'm not sure how this is helping me find a new career, but I will make sure I type at least 150 words minimum so that I can finish."
good,Moree to cashiering job. Collecting money and transfer to the preferable countries. Give away money to customer. Handling the branch alone was a good experience.
good,At times the job would be difficult as well as management would be difficult. I found the managers to be biased pertaining to its workers. But other than that the environment in regards to the customers was fairly friendly
good,"exceptional co-works to work with"
good,"Productive place, the customers are handled correctly and respectfully every single time. It can get hectic at times because the systems are continually failing. Overall the management is excellent."
good,Work with a good team of folks.  Managers are promoted without having current experience in managing people.  Most jobs are Day shift which is a plus and the Salary is fair.
good,"employees are friendly and easy to talk to and willing to help "
good,"High turnover, management and leadership constantly changing, average benefits, and expensive parking garage prices. Free gym in building, walking distance to popular areas,"
good,"the culture here is awful"
good,"The actual job itself was inspiring, interacting with co-workers across the nation made it enjoyable, learning new processes made it challenging in the most positive way. "
good,"Typical clerk job in a 24 hour Currency Exchange. "
good,"A typical day of work includes opening up the office reviewing paperwork for the day. Business of order is number  one the customers, collections, courtesy calls, filing, check cashing, Western Union, Pay Day advances, and Car Title loans."
good,"Aufgaben sind sehr interessant und lehrreich"
good,"El dia a dia es complicado dado que se trabaja con gente de distintos niveles culturales y educacion, mucha de la documentacion que se pide generalmente falta al momento del envio por lo que se complica mucho llevara cavo una operacion como corresponde y se pierde tiempo explicando los requicitos. La gente normalmente presenta mala predisposicion y es agotador el dia a dia por lo que muchas veces tampoco se ofrece un buen servicio optimamente, dado lo que agota. La parte mas dificil es la atencion al cliente y a la vez la mejor, dado que tambien hay clientes con buena predisposicion. La direccion gerencia es muy pobre en relacion a nuestro lugar del trabajo, dado que trabajan muy burocraticamente y no con la realidad de lo que sucede en el local. Aprendi mucho de la gente en si y del servio bien prestado."
good,"I worked at WU for 5 years. During that time there were several rounds of layoffs. My pay was barley increased, even with positive reviews, because of the companies financial troubles. Senior management talks a big game but doesn't deliver. Before this last round of layoffs, they were overly positive and incredibly insensitive. Please who had worked there for 20 years were let go with zero fan fair. Completely dismissed. They overhauled the work force and laid off about 15% of employees, but not one person in the office of the CEO was let go. Call me crazy, but change of that magnitude should start at the top."
good,having good working condition with life and work balance. but job security is less and salary is less then the market. also work from home available in wu.
good,Many jobs have been moved offshore causing angst on many levels.  The work ethic in other countries varies and causes a great deal of frustration.  US Domestic employees constantly worry about keeping their job while trying to manage expectations related to working significantly longer hours than international colleagues.  There is also very little appreciation for resources with tenure and institutional knowledge.
good,"Busy work days, great training and nesting period, you are required to read and handle calls by using a prewritten script, not much room for growth within"
good,"Not a terrible place to be... Many people come and go, and come back... I did... it depends on your leadership team and if you thrive on getting things done quickly.  If you yearn for quick accomplishments you will probably be frustrated.  If you are looking for a ""job"" vs. a ""career"" it might be the right place for you."
good,"I dont work for Western Union or Lotto, I work for Stop and Shop. It's an okay place to work for but the management had become very lazy and the culture is not a fun place to be in."
good,"The company doesn't offer retirement benefit which is a downside for me. Salary as an agent along with the commission is somewhat good. They have annual team buildings/family day/year end party. But if you have a shift then you'll not be able to join. If you have work on a New Year's eve, management doesn't provide any free meals to employees, despite every restaurant/fast foods being closed during that occasion except for 7/11 convenience store which is really disappointing since this is a well-known company. I also find that it has less room for career growth being an agent. Management is currently undergoing a lot changes and adjustment which put it off the balance but I guess its for a better future. Most agents working here are friendly and are family oriented. In the end, I never really see myself growing old working at this company."
good,"Coordinación de locales Western Union, a nivel Guayaquil y provincias desiganadas cada 6 meses, manejo de personal, crear informes semanales, crear informe Gerencial cada mes, soporte técnico personal o via teamveawer, soporte via telefónica, desarrollo de correos diarios. "
good,"The culture and direction that the company is heading is pretty good.  The biggest challenge there is the management teams.  For the most part the people placed in management roles are not people managers, they were promoted because of their individual production and results.  This becomes a problem when it is necessary to help train or coach individuals that are struggling.  It just doesn't happen.  They would rather see someone quit or be terminated than take the the time to coach them up."
good,"Very good company! Leaders dont believe in Work/ Life Balance. You have to accept change, because company is ever changing with the competitive environment."
good,IT dept needs more structure and need more room for IT staff to work.  Also the location is not that great and Tier 1 support needs more training.
good,"Western Union has decided to outsource their IT staff to contracting firms in India, I do not recommend applying for work with them if you're in the IT world.  Many of us with 10+ years experience and knowledge have been let go."
good,"I worked at Vons for five years, two years as a bagger and three as customer service/cashier. I basically could do everything by the first year at customer service desk. Only made 8.60 from five years of being at Vons."
good,"I liked the people I worked with, but the job was the same everyday.  The company put us on a new system and there was no real training.  There was no place for advancement."
good,un día típico es un día normal.
good,"Good Place to work if the management is good,HR does not deal with employee they ask managers,And if you are not agree with manager at some point then be ready to face consequences even though you are correct.Product based organization Working like a service based industry."
good,Management is trying to change the culture and in the process are making it worse. The people are good and dedicated but morale is poor and people are feeling defeated.
good,"Working with Western union as a CSR( mtbp, core and TMT) compared to accounts that I've handled before super easy. Client just needs to be realistic in terms of KPI's, we're humans not godlike. Managers should be objective for promotions. Plus with the job description that clearly blurs up along the way deserves better compensation."
good,"Payday Loans, Title Loan, Cash checks."
good,"It is hard to get anywhere in the company.  When I was there upper management had been there for decades. Their meetings were informative, when we had them."
good,Was a excellent stepping stone to get my feet into the customer service/sales departments. 
good,"I usually ""hit the ground running. Being a Western Union Agent is just one aspect of my position. Preparing task lists and ensuring that each task is completed in a timely fashion by assigning duties to various employees.  I also need to be sure that all shoppers are receiving the best customer service possible. I also count and record all cashier tills, count and balance safe. There are so many things going on at once and the atmosphere is usually fast paced and upbeat."
good,It seems that Management do not know what they want.Keeps changing the goals. It seems they are always putting the fire instead of trying to prevent it.
good,Low on staff leaving people working from open to close almost everyday. Unorganized corporate office. Management is poor. Communication skills are weak.

good,"Western Union is definitely the fastest and most secure way of sending and receiving money, it is also a fairly inexpensive service. But the outdated systems were the hardest part of my job as it made it at times difficult to please the customers that were calling regarding information about payments made to companies, or other affairs that required more attention to detail. The best part of my job was being able to speak and assist people from such different backgrounds residing in US and Canada, as well as solving whatever issue they were calling for and hearing the ""thank you so much"" at the end of every call."
good,Accepted money transfers over the phone via credit cards also paid out money to agents for customers. Learned that transferring money can be transferred quickly and conveniently for whatever situations arise in an individuals life. Overall management was god. My co-workers were like family. The hardest part of the job was telling someone that their money was not availble after hearing how desparately they needed it.

Upper management needs to better align the 'business solutions' entities into the overall company and resources. Sales compensations plans are unnecessarily complex. Good employer nonetheless. A very 'purpose driven' company that focuses on financial inclusion in some of the poorest regions. They also support many charities with their products and fund education initiatives."

good,"They mean well but the corporate politics get in the way. Senior leaders listen too much to squeaky wheels and  don't look for the substance. They are trying to change and I think if they stay focused it will be positive, but they tend to miss the mark and get distracted by other things."
good,My experience with Western Union has been an insightful learning experience. I have learned a tremendous amount by working with the public as far as customer service.

good,I actually enjoyed working at Western Union. It is a fast paced environment but growth within the company is stagnant. The location was a great place to learn. The location manager and supervisors believed in cross training and encouraged personal growth through cross training. Individual goals were set fairly and training was provided for all products offered to clients. My only negative observation is that departments are very disconnected and there is no growth outside of each department.

La gente a veces viene mal predispuesta o enojada con las empresas, y eso hace todo mas dificil.  Aprendi y me enseñaron a formar mi caracter, soy muy simpatica y atenta y sobre todo muy paciente.  Lo mas dificil era el dia a dia en solucionar problemas de facturacion, siempre por supuesto defendiendo la postura de las empresas, ya que la gente no comprende el accionar de las empresas y los periodos de facturacion y ante una situacion piensan que los estan estafando.  Lo que mas me gusto de trabajar ahi, fue el ambiente laboral, sumamente cordial, con buenos compañeros, trabajando en equipo, aprendiendo todos los dias, y formando mi caracter con sumas dosis de paciencia."

good,The people I worked with were wonderful we were like family. The call center was open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. So depending on the shift you work especially the night shift your co-workers were most likely to become some of your best friends. Mainly because you saw them more than your family during day hours and early night hours. You had to clock out to go to the bathroom and that was a task all in itself. I had mastered that task by being able to relieve myself within 2 1/2 minutes without missing making any money. The company paid you very well but you earned every dime you made. I learned a lot from the job about assisting people over the phone to the most irate customers to the language challenge customers. I will never forget the time I worked there for it truly prepared me for a lot of things in life.

good,Western Union was a nice company to work for.  They were good to me and for me.  The only thing that I believe that should change is Western Union should set up some sort of anonymous process to see how the management is treating their team.
