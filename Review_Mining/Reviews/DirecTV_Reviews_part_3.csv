rating,review
good,"The day-to-day was fine. My immediate team was fantastic and my manager was approachable and receptive. However, I was severely underpaid, even after completing my degree and repeatedly approaching management about opportunities for advancement. Even though I consistently met and exceeded goals at my performance reviews, I never received a pay raise or the opportunity to move up into a more challenging role."
good,AT&T is an innovative forward thinking company that challenges it's employees to be better than the standard. It's broad portfolio of services and products demand employees to keep learning and taking on additional responsibilities. The work culture varies depending on the business segment but overall a very ethical and equal opportunity type company.
good,"Though AT&T has many great leaders, one of the benefits working for AT&T is tenure.  Simply put, AT&T takes care of their own.  The environment was easy going."
good,"Very High paced. Get your numbers early and quick, and the day goes great. "
good,"Prem tech job is a great job, loved the job. The hours get a little long and attics suck, but all in all it was a really good job and id live to get back into it"
good,"We had crew meetings once a week, expected to performance manage techs.  Management and policy vary greatly from area, not uniform in policies.  Seems like company is making an effort to better the culture, but local management has big influence on culture.  Some mid level managers were head hunters."
good,CO-OP Program to help college students work around their class schedule and get paid fairly. Good resume builder for customer service and client relations.
good,"Stock holders are #1  in all decisions//Employees, though told they important and appreciated,  are normally in precarious positions as technology advances. So if  you don't keep your skills up and market them regularly, you will be quickly stepped over and left with no options...(discarded with yesterdays  trash)"
good,"Overall a nice place to work. Very good benefits/Salary, Management overall is good but as with all large companies there are some management issues.Depending on position/role there can be great flexibility."
good,"Great training provided 8 to 12 weeks paid training depending on field, management always there to support and teach fast pace but very layed back great team work."
good,"My days at work are stressful but they greatly enhanced my knowledge of various IT issues and systems.  My management was hands-off letting me explore and set my own pace, while providing me boundaries and support to continue my career.  The work culture takes some getting used to and may at times seem isolating and closed off,  really its the hardest part of working within the group that i do. But the Clients and successes you will have, really make the job worth it."
good,"AT&T provides excellent pay and benefits. I have worked for AT&T for 23 years and learned many different things. For the most part, the environment is laid back and casual."
good,"Depending on the store, the work day could be very slow, or very fast paced. A lot of commission relies on getting the right customer. Manager huddles every morning to keep you on track of goals. Many ATT goals that they push do not pay you but do pay management. Overall an ok job with pay that has a good potential."
good,Job was challenging working with customers and tech's. Satisfaction of bringing superior customer services. Ability to coach and develop technicians. Everyday hands it's different rewards and challenges.
good,This is a great place to learn how to work as a team . Excellent benefits and commission. Management was easy to contact with any issues and usually resolved them quickly.
good,"N/A not at the moment. Just don't have the right words to explain. It's something you have to prepare yourself for, and if not you're going to seek new opportunities."
good,"Met several great ppl, learned a lot abt telecommunications, data entry"
good,The job allowed me to meet people from all walks of life which made work interesting. I learned great customer service skill.  the hardest part of the job is not having a set skill or shift work is done when the last job was completed.
good,"Great company to work for. Due to all-wireless phase coming in 2018, Prem. Techs are being laid off and so are the Management teams. The culture is great and so are the people I worked with. The management did their jobs accordingly and helped with issues while out in the field. Pay was decent and so were the benefits. If given the opportunity to work there again, I would most positively accept it."
good,The company is constantly growing and so there are always new things to learn.  You have to be willing to work through holidays and give up some family time. Train and work with people from other countries.  Travel is a must if working in some areas of IT.
good,No hay más que decir que s una empresa que tiene muchos beneficios pero personalmente hablando la distancia hace que unicamente tega una actividad al día. trabajar y solo eso.
good,"Great Place to work.  I had a lot of opportunities to work and learn different parts of the business, the company is leading I Technology so it is easy to keep learning.  "
good,"This job has its ups and downs. My Co-Workers and customers helped my day go by smooth. Management was decent, we had so many changes there we had to readjust."
good,Was a stable place to start my career. Learned many things in the process. Unfortunately had to leave the organization because I ventured out to start my own business.
good,Great place to use diverse skills in developing self. Opportunity to meet people of different backgrounds and a diverse background of skills to learn from in order to grow in the company.
good,"The people were nice, professional. Good perks. Management was flexible. lots of help when needed."
good,Great Work Life Balance when you are working in AT&T . I think we need more career opportunity withing AT&T  specifically in IT Industry where technology is changing like anything.
good,"Having worked for various divisions over a twenty year career, I would rate the company as very good to work for. The environment fosters self thinking managers and is a friendly workplace with  excellent environments and overall benefits. I would recommend working for this company.  ."
good,"Management treated employees with respect, listened to what we had to say and came up with solutions that worked both ways.  All other employees were laid back, not a stressful environment at all."
good,I prefer not to answer on this since it will be a personal opinion only. My manager treated me very well and the company provided it's workers with good benefits
good,It was a nice experience working for Att. As an intern you don't expect much benefits. Overall i can say that it is a nice place to learn about your job.
good,Impending lay offs take away from all of the positives. Good pay and benefits mean nothing without job security. With job security it would not be a bad place to work.
good,Good business culture to work within and great training offered by company to learn emerging technologies.  Very process driven workplace however.  Recent company mergers have caused a decrease in workplace motivation.
good,Att is a fun cool job to work at . It’s very very very very super super very cool awesome job to work for the benefits are super cool and a fun work space.
good,AT&T is a GREAT place to work....I'm in a different place in my life seeking a position that offers work life balance (work from home). At this time AT&T does not offer many options for this which is why I am looking for different opportunities. If you are strong minded and know what you want. AT&T will help get you there....If telecommunications is for you.
good,AT&T is so large that it's hard to apply generalizations. Tons of great people. You get all the benefits of a stable large corporation but also the typical drawbacks.
good,I matured as a person and an employee because of the opportunities afforded to me by my tenure at AT&T and BellSouth.  I learned the skills I have now because of the positions I was encouraged to take.  I have met good people and made great friends over the years.  I have had great managers who care about the company and the culture.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for AT&T.The environment was continuously changing towards a positive and upbeat surrounding. They were always finding incentives and different ways to keep the employees energetic and enthusiastic. The call center was a diverse area. This made the place more enjoyable to work at. There was always something new to learn from the co-workers you were surrounded by. The breaks were pretty short. It did take up most of your break time to even get to the break area or cafeteria, but they did still honor break time on schedule every day. If I could, I'd move back home just to have this job back. Overall, it was a really educational position. I loved this job."
good,Great place to work if you love to be early adopter of technology. It will teach you to work from the customers perspective. Success comes when you get an extraordinary experience to each individual you engage while at the store.
good,"Productive, very busy day during releases. Fun place to work .  You will learn a lot. Team mates are helpful. Also, if you are a contractor be sure to be in good books of your manager. You can be thrown out anytime for funding issues !"
good,"Because shifts change once or twice a year, you can work a variety of times of day and you can work for a variety of managers. There are different types of managers so if you don't like one, you may love the next one. They try to inject fun themes through out the year. Sometimes it gets old but some times it makes things fun."
good,"With AT&T, you are largely a well compensated number. If you play the political games right, then you can move up in management regardless of actual skill. I am not the type to do that. I am the nuts & bolts type that makes things happen, and that was punished because I can be a little direct with things."
good,"I had a great manager who helped me develop new skills and was great to work with. The store was run by the owner of the store, and I was the person in charge when when they were not present."
good,"There have been many changes over the years.  Unfortunately, the management teams have continued to change, yet not improve.  Poor management has left a lot of dedicated employees concerned about the stability of their job and office.  There is a lack of appreciation and acknowledgment when an employee is preforming their job well.  The management tends to only focus on what their employees aren't doing instead of balancing it out with what the employees are doing well.  This has caused the moral of the office to decline.  When I first starting working there, the management team was all about supporting their employees and making the office environment upbeat and positive.  That has steadily declined to almost non existent over the years."
good,"You were required to be on the phone taking incoming calls regarding customer questions on bills, programming and technical support.  Detailed notations during call were recorded in database.  Each 15 minute break and lunch were timed.  The company had every minute accounted for.  Which set a specific schedule for each day.  "
good,"I was hired through AT&T's Technical Development Program (TDP) which looks to hire recent undergrad graduates wielding a STEM degree.  The culture here varies depending on which location you are in.  To progress, the trick is to network with others and gain insight from mentors."
good,I enjoyed my work at AT&T.  I was given opportunity to learn more.  The sad part is management was not able to save my job.  Most jos are being shipped overseas.  The company now is very different from when I first started with this company
good,Great job. There’s advancement but not as open or transparent as they make it seem. Most employees are friendly but like every where there’s always one or two thorns in the bouquet of roses.
good,"On time ready to work 8+ hours daily. Customer service, building rapport, multi-tasking all required. Need to be knowledgeable on all products and service and ready for changes. You need to be flexible for new changes happening daily"
good,I enjoyed working there for the time I did. Unless you have adequate childcare and a support system I wouldn't recommend this call center because you won't be able to be dedicated. It takes a lot of dedication to be successful here and it's not a place that you're able to come and go as you please or take a lot of time away.
good,Goos place to work but it can be tough making monthly numbers at times. Plenty of time off and with other good benifits . Most bosses are wasy to get along with
good,"Good people to work with each day.   It is a good company but like many it has gone through its share of downsizing.   There are opportunities to move around in the company.   I enjoyed my time with the company, but it was mainly because of the people that I worked with and their desire to be great in what they did each day."
good,"Overall, good job. Nice people. I cant say what the detailed ins and outs are of the company, but the managment was easy to work with and the other techs help each other out when they can."
good,its a great company to work for i learned how to do technical support and customers through setups. The hardest part with the jib was understanding the foreign languages that i recieved at times but other than that it was awesome.
good,At&t was a very nice place to work. The people I worked with were the best. # out of the 4 managers were great and they have a great training program.
good,"In my  21 years with AT&T,  I have had 3 different careers. What a great thing to work in different roles without changing employers."
good,if you need a job to pay bills and get discounts on wireless service that normally expensive then this would be a great place to work. great bonus opportunities and they train on how to sell.
good,AT&T Call Center is a great place to work for people in Wichita Falls. Workers need to have a strong work ethic and they will do well. Policy change is non stop and rules and procedures need to be communicated more effectively.
good,I worked at AT&T for 21 years.  The hardest part was all the mergers and continual changes. I was developed well at AT&T.  They provide plenty of training and availability to access self-paced training.
good,AT&T is a great place to work. There is a great workplace culture that drives you to become better. I really like AT&T. The hardest part is the layoffs due to restructuring
good,Too stress full every 3 months metrics changed management was good desks were too close to each other things changed quickly without very little time to express your opinion
good,Compensation good. productivity not a priority for job security. Problem with overuse/misuse of FMLA. Management doesn’t always inforce office procedures
good,"Great place initially to work - lots of collaboration/teamwork on projects."
good,Being In Management for years you adapt daily to all the changes and try to create a positive productive work force environment weekly. I have learned in Management you will always be faced with new challenges in the Business field its all about how you deal with adversity to be successful.
good,"The best thing about AT&T is the benefit and the education they give you to do to job.  They used to be better training in the classroom, but know some jobs are training via video."
good,"aprendi la paciencia para tratar a los clientes con diferentes caracteres, y me llevo muchas experiencias buenas."
good,"Pay is pretty decent for the work being done. There are other departments that make more, but are harder to get into if you are low on the totem pole."
good,"If I could go back, I wouldn't have left. Great opportunity and excellent company. Being paid to show some of the greatest new technology to customers is a dream!"
good,"Company has a very high turn over rate and there aren't any benefits for part time employees.  Other than that,  the management staff was awesome, the work experience was great with many learning opportunities."
good,I loved the job. You will have to exit your comfort zone and ask for the sale but all in all a great paying job. I would have loved to stay but the schedules are not made for a single parent and promotions are available to those who are willing to travel.
good,"Install and Repair Internet, Phone, and TV services."
good,Not concerned about people having families and the effects of late hours and weekends. Tired of retention/ sales work. My family was starting to suffer due to the company shift in hours
good,AT&T has a great workplace culture with excellent compensation and benefits. There are places within the company that are much better than others. I ended up in an organization that didn't the best managed.
good,AT&T customers are unmatched in depth and scope.  We count virtually all the Fortune 500 companies as customers.  They are why I get up in the morning and stay late in the day.  AT&T technologies effect lives no matter where you work and play.  No two days are the same as each customer presents unique opportunities  to help them solve/collaborate on what matters most to them.
good,"The work environment is pretty easy going barring crazy customers. It does take a good chunk of physical work, and some technical knowledge of computers is a boon, but your work days will never be the same from one to the next. Out times can wildly shift, work loads can go from overloaded to no work in the span of a week, and considering a good chunk of the work is outside weather is a huge factor in the work."
good,Taking inbound calls is much more lucrative than outbound calls. If given the opportunity to take inbound calls for AT&T I would recommend this position.
good,I am a At&t contractor which doesnt apply to most people employed by At&t my review for the company would not be fair as I do not receive the same benefits and opportunity a corporate employee receives.
good,"A weird mix of a really big corporation and unionized employees. Expect bureaucracy and corporate greed with mixed messages about employee rights. If you like talking to customers, you'll enjoy the day to day."
good,Productive place to work. Advancement possibilities. Good benefits. Good teams. Flexible placements. Opportunities to work from home depending on your job title.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, and would recommend it to anyone who is curious of technology, customer service, and working hard. The benefits to this job, as well as the sense of accomplishment that this job gives, is well worth it. I intend to go back as soon as possible."
good,As a prem tech it's best to not to schedule plans on days that it's iffy that you'll get off at the actual scheduled time. Hard to get a decent amount of time to spend at home with family if you have smaller children
good,"Fast paced work for a skilled technician. Management only cared about the bottom line, not so much the technicians. If customers called in with a problem they caused the technician would get charged for it."
good,"•	Managed escalated calls with at risk customers which required special handling in a nationwide operations center."
good,A great place to work. worked in many departments. cross functional team skills a required to thrive. the phone company is no longer a land line environment and is becoming data driven and software specific.
good,"AT&T will prepare you for success through it's massive training culture. The landscape changes quickly which is good because you do not become complacent, and those that do are not kept around very long. Still compensation and health plan could be better."
good,"Let's see,  as long as you are doing your work with quality in mind you will do fine.  The first year I worked for att was the bussiest year.  Then they bought Directv and it has slowed to the point where I can barely get 40 hours.  I would recommend working here if you don't mind outdoor work in the winter and summer."
good,Generally the culture is good.  They encourage growth and development.  The company is ever changing so be prepared to accept and like change.  AT&T has an award winning training university and great benefits.
good,"Very competitive cut throat stressful but full of benefits Always changing and growth limited without relocating, Good pay and time off, bargained position and friendly environment."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers get their telephone up and running. Did whatever it took .Lots of perks but the only draw back ws"
good,"One of the Best companies to work for based on                                 "
good,I am enjoy working with AT&T. Employees are helping each other out as need. Clean work place. The hardest part of the job is going up and down on the pole. The most enjoyable part of the job is when complete the job and notice that customers are happy to get their service done.
good,"Close work with product on customer support.   Like the working environment.   But commute is long as it was downtown."
good,They wont really bother you as long as you do your job the correct way. You have to REALLY mess up to get fired. Overall great experience and I would recommend anyone to work at AT&T.
good,I would recommend this job to someone who has a more open schedule and flexibility to work retail hours that are permitted to change week to week. Working PT as a student this would be a wonderful and lucrative job for any college student.
good,"Fast paced competitive environment, advancement is declining due to layoffs.  Fun and enjoyable job with work life balance.  Most people who leave want to come back."
good,The work environment was very team oriented and my co-workers were wonderful. Please keep in mind that I have not worked there for almost 30 years. I have not stayed in contact with anyone from my old work group.
good,"I'm a field tech and soon my job will be phased out in favor of wireless technology. However, this is has been the best job I've had. I have reasonable freedom and the management at my yard is the best. I've heard the horror stories of management at other yards. Regardless of the micromanagement and lack of union support, this job has allowed me to be a single supporter of my family and buy our first home. The techs and management are like a 2nd family."
good,"A typical day at work will be a relaxing place but can get busy at times when customers foot traffic becomes heavy. At times, the job at AT&T Park can be overwhelming with challenging obstacles."
good,"Amazing position within AT&T - I highly recommend it."
good,"Seniority is what counts at this company.  The more years you work there, the better you are treated.  There is opportunity for advancement if you have the education & show an interest in doing so."
good,I loved my job as a wire tech. But AT&T did not pay me for the training or experience I had prior to working for them. They did hold my job when I joined the Coast Guard.
good,"Ambiente laboral agradable, a pesar de manejar ventas y trabajar bajo presión, no había un ambiente hostil o incomodo. "
good,"I worked for AT&T for twenty-five and a-half years. In Finances Dept.,"
good,"Supported work and client teams spread across the US and Europe from my home in Huntsville. This remote teleworker model is no longer supported in favor of IT / client co located ""innovation centers""."
good,"It was a good job. Stressful sometimes when you have to meet sales numbers, but it was a fun job to have and decent money for what you have to do. Good workplace"
good,will love to keep working there owner is really outgoing and helpful good commission. they have really Koo game room . free food every other Friday company trips are fun.
good,Fast paced environment and hours based on the business needs. Many times you are working on multiple assignments and sometimes overnight based on the business needs
good,"dealing with the angry customers and getting yelled at about things you do not have control over. Management can be somewhat lazy at times. You kind of have to do self-motivation at this job, because it is very stressful."
good,"Worked in the Government space for AT&T in San Antonio.  We lost a huge contract that made me find a new job.  When I was there it was a good place to work for.  My manager was great and cared about my career.  I didn't work with too many AT&T employees, mostly other contractors on client site.  Overall I would say the experience was good and I learned quite a bit even under the umbrella of the government.  The Airmen we worked with were great and they allowed us the freedom to try new industry standards and really tilt the way software was produced for them previously."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for. Excellent pay w/ benefits. Management in my store is great. Company is evolving in a very rapid pace. Customer interactions can be rewarding, but also the hardest part of the job."
good,"It was a great experience and big challenge at the same  time. Very demanding and fast changing environment.The typical work day is to make sure billing cycles meet the dead line and get all the issues checked and answered. Every day there is something new to learn and new challenge to over come. The management is fair, however demanding as well. Hardest part of the job is to get correct people to work on the issues, as sometimes issue can have complicated scenario and multiple teams involved. The best part of the job is the feeling of satisfaction when the task gets completed, as some of them take an extra energy and require big amount of afford and critical thinking."
good,"A typical day of work included: troubleshooting, account management, problem resolution and system resets. A large majority of the day is spent sitting and receiving back to back product calls."
good,Work was great. Had great coworkers and an amazing manager. Compensation is low compared to other Tech companies. Corporate Culture could use a little work.
good,"Normally have 3-4 jobs a day average, ranging from complete installs to simple repairs. I learned tons about customer service, and how to make customers feel comfortable in their own home. Management doesn't bother you as long as you're doing what you're supposed to be doing and you do an adequate job. Hardest part of the job is DirecTV installations, mostly very labor intensive and lengthy usually all day jobs, most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new and interesting people."
good,"At&t consistantly trained their employees, making them fee valued and knowledgeable about product and services presented to customers. Great work enviornment and great people."
good,I love my job even though it was short lived training was great coworkers work as a team as well you competitor all in all make for a cool place to work
good,"AT&T I mean everyone knows why they are. If you do well and are ok with ding the same thing everyday the by all means stay here for an entire career. If you seek a bit more excitement in life, look elsewhere."
good,"the job is really good, its a call centre where you deal with customers and technicians, fixing problems that develop during an installation/upgrade/service call."
good,A typical day at work was talking with customers internal and external regarding projects and the timelines associated. I would conduct weekly status calls with all of my customers unless they requested not to have calls. In those circumstances I would update them via email weekly. I had 7 different managers in the 12 years I was in project management so I had to be flexible while working with my managers. I never had much in the way of workplace culture since I worked from home mostly and my coworkers were all in other states. The hardest part of the job was when I would get new products to manage and learning how to implement them usually on my own. The most enjoyable part of the job was being my own boss for the most part.
good,"I’ve been with the company 3 years,  lived my first 2 but currently have a regional on a role and hate it.as a whole I love the company but just make sure your ready to be stress d."
good,"Customer Service type of environment that I was able to gain a good,  hard-working environment that I appreciated being apart of the team and sales personnel"
good,"Great benefits, fair salary package, excellent work/life balance.  Very fair and respectful of each other from the top down.  A culture of honesty and integrity."
good,"AT&T core businesses are maturing.  The lack of cash flow cause massive lay offs every year."
good,Good compensation; however the bottom line is almost always observed and takes preference over individuals.  Relaxed environment on most days.  Management is extremely mobile and our department had new leadership over 12 times in 8 years.
good,I did get a chance to travel which was pretty fun and interesting. I didn't like the long hours and time away from family. but I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a great career
good,"Trabajé poco tiempo, menos de 3 meses por problemas personales por lo que no conocí bien a la empresa y relación con el equipo de trabajo. Fue mi primera vez que trabajé en empresa grande."
good,It's the top company in a top Industry. I'd go back in a heart beat for another contract. Always feel that you are on the winning team with ATT. It's constantly changing and never ever stale.
good,"A typical day as an AT&T intern required adding customers to the queue as they walked in, to ensure them that they will be helped shortly. This was followed by scanning and stocking the inventory after each delivery. The management at AT&T was always very supportive and understanding."
good,Learned how to better interact with people dealing with concerna snd service. Was knowledge about the products and service to better assist customers.
good,I really am enjoying my time at AT&T. The hours are long but when you are about selling you will make the best of every opportunity. The pressure is decent and you feel like you can always meet your quota.
good,"I loved the fast paced sales environment, the customers weren't always nice or happy when they came in but were usually satisfied by the time they left. They did a very good job educating and training us about sales and how to meet every customers needs. The only part that was hard about working there was the lack of job/work life balance, being that it was a union based company if you were the last to be hired in you were the low man on the totem pole, you would get the last pick of days off, even if you requested the day off someone with more seniority would get the day off if they requested it  off as well making it hard to schedule doctors appointments, attend events, family time, ect.. their time off and late point policy system needs to be reassessed because it was extremely sick and left little room for understanding when it came to real life emergencies or sick time."
good,"mainly incoming calls, sometimes your team is selected to go through return mail, there are moments when the call volume is very high and times when it is low."
good,I loved my job at AT&T until we received a new area manager.  The job moral went out of the window and the management team were not doing their jobs at all.
good,Enjoyed the team environment always felt listened to. There was always raining and learning new things. lots of opportunity to learn new skills. Furthering your education encouraged.
good,I have enjoyed working with ATT and i have learned a great deal of work in the project. The new technologies in Hadoop Eco System have been used in the project.
good,AT&T is my current employer. The fast paced environment assures that you are never bored. A great perk is the ongoing field related training that is provided.
good,The most enjoyable part of this position was working on the front lines of wireless communications and being able to see all the changes evolving.  And having a say in what is done with the networks.
good,Fast paced and ever-changing work environment.  I enjoy working with technology and AT&T provides that opportunity.  AT&T for the most part offers a good balance between work and family time.
good,Good place to chill. hated some management and had issues with policies but very well paid and fun working environment. manipulate customers everyday.
good,They were replacing employees who had been there a long time with temporary employees.  A manager who was being replaced trained me.  Felt bad for them.
good,I am not authorized by legal to publish comment.  Only specific personnel are provided authorization to give public comments on the workplace and how it functions or culture.
good,You get to choose your work and own it which is very beneficial. The work culture is very detached as at the time you feel it's only you that working in the building as most employees choose to work from home.
good,"Good benefits, good pay, achievement, paid time off, sick days, 401k and health benefits. Safe environment, strict policies, free parking, accesible..."
good,It is a decent place to work. The pay is good as well as the benefits. There tends to be a lot of attrition lately as the company keeps relocating offices.
good,"I have various positions such as  - software development, testing, production support and release management. workplace culture management at times was what have you done for me lately , some individuals were cutthroat  but the majority of the team members were great o work with and everyone worked hard to ensure stable, adaptive and innovative software to support AT&T's financial and customer support goals. Work / Life balance was not the best. But that is the nature of developing and maintaining application software  but honestly that lack of balance was not something AT&T management cared about"
good,"Job was fast pace, continually updating with trainings, management was easy to work with, diverse culture. Managers were always encouraging and helpful."
good,The benefits are amazing...as is the pay.  Upper Management is not always competent and those under them suffer while they get promoted.  I would go back for the benefits if the opportunity presents itself.
good,"Si es bueno el trabajo "
good,Very sales driven company. It is a high stress environment where sales are priority. The benefits and compensation are excellent. The time off options have improved but could be better.
good,"I've happily worked for AT&T for ten years.  The last three executives I've supported have had to move to Dallas, TX.  Otherwise, I would not be searching for a position with another company.  The hardest part of the job is being secluded since so many people have moved away and the most enjoyable part of my position was being surrounded by co-workers and friends, not to mention my short commute!"
good,"Would strongly recommend ATT as a good place to work.  It has its issues as most large companies do, but the stability was nice and the management is exceptional."
good,Love the job and what I do but dislike the pay and the adding of more people's jobs without being compensated for the extra work or given extra time to do proper job
good,just sell stuff pretty basic they change focus every 3 months or so  they make a little hard to sometimes hit basic commission goals but if you are a strong seller you should be able to hit those goals
good,Overall the work experience at AT&T has been great!  The work environment and the team that I worked with are very cooperative and we worked well as a team.  There were no corporate politics and willingness to share knowledge within the team gave opportunity to learn.  Immediate management was good at recognizing hardwork and talent.
good,"Working for Alorica has its ups and downs. I'm certain that's primarily because it is a call center. There's constantly drama going on, and although I managed to avoid it, it's impossible not to hear about it."
good,"My time spent at ATT I learned a lot around corporate culture and organizational structure. At times, the org could feel stuffy, and even in my short tenure, the restructuring occurred twice ."
good,It's a good job but not the best. The pay is somewhat fair but being a over the phone rep is stressful and they only add more things that need to be done.
good,"I had many managers and worked in several departments, each one was a little different. I enjoyed my time as a desktop technician and Remedy developer. I made some great friendship and had some great managers. I was laid off in 2015 and took a job offered to me internally, however the lay offs kept coming and managers didn't seem to value their employees as before all the lay offs. I believe AT&T is a good company too work for, but the structure changed and many employees were left behind to make room for contractors. I still value my time with AT&T, it was a great learning experience and good solid company. I would go back, if the opportunity presented itself."
good,I liked trying to hide the wires at installation as much as possible in order to get complimented by the costumers. hands down my favorite part of the job
good,Competitive work environment. Commission has been cut in half over the past few years. Benefits have gone up and more jobs are being cut on a regular basis
good,As Customer service Rep we were responsible to make sure that our customers are happy and satisfied with our services. it was very rewarding to assist the customer with their concerns.
good,"My biggest complaint is that management was too worried about stats or performance metrics and behaviors; instead of focusing more on just coming to work and being on time, and keeping a good attitude and showing you are really trying to make improvement."
good,ATT had some very good people but was very bureaucratic.  It could take forever to get a deal from design to close.  They were all about the contract and re-occurring revenue being locked in.
good,"Sells all products and services offered by the Company."
good,"I worked for At&t for 17 years and have been part of a surplus every three years.  I've worked many positions through out the company, many of which were not chosen due to being surplused.  At&t provides tuition reimbursement but advancement is minimal once within."
good,"Standing all day talking to customer about services and try and sell them those services. "
good,"Be as mentally strong as you are skilled to handle to work life environment of Att. Att will gladly compensate you for what you bring to the table, but of course, they expect from you maximum effort one hundred percent of the time you're on the clock."
good,"A typical day included answering inbound calls, logging into programs and meeting metrics. I learned a lot about television programming and computers. I only had one good manager wile working here, the rest were either burned out or immature. The entire call center reminded me of how high school was. Very cliquish. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the young immature co-workers and managers that put popularity above work performance."
good,"Long hours, lots of turn-over, high pressure, sometimes ridiculous goals and expectation. Bleed Blue - Breathe Orange is our running joke. Always attached to you work phone and iPad, even on vacations."
good,It was fun but calls were terrible adds didn't really reflect what we had.. prices didn't go well with customers...I loved my coworkers but directv as a company sucked with getting people in the right departments and taking money and having angry customers calling
good,Liked working at the call center and also at the store. Only left working with this company because Hurricane Katrina came through and my ex-husband and I opened our business.
good,"AT&T is a great place to work, but it's important to work for a good manager. A bad manager can make you work life miserable at a good company.  I believe it's important to look for a manager that has vision and flexibility."
good,"AT&T is a very large company and originally of Bellsouth the very first to hit the market for telecommunications."
good,"If you like autonomy, only seeing your supervisor 2 to 3 times a month, meeting new people throughout the day, like working outdoors, in a fast paced, physically active job, then its great. As long as you do your job right, and follow all company policies and procedures, management leaves you alone. Depending on work performance, you can get monthly and quarterly bonuses. Good pay, lots of overtime. Horrible work/life balance. Company vehicle with gas card, issued all the tools you need, paid training."
good,I had many jobs in the phone company. I learned to be on time and work hard. A typical day at my job varied according to the job I was doing. Management could be a challenge because it was such a large company. The workplace culture could be difficult or great depending on your boss but that is something you deal with and do your best job.The hardest part of the job was learning new things if your trainer was not the best. I enjoyed all the people I got to know over the years and the opportunity to learn different things.
good,"Fair pay for retail sales, but the atmosphere will eventually take its' toll on you.  If you're looking for decent money without a degree it's great money, but make sure you keep your other options open."
good,AT&T can be a large and bureaucratic company at times.. A review of it's middle and low-senior-level management teams illustrates that it is not a meritocracy.
good,"great company to work for in areas of new technologies. Always new innovations to be apart of. Good compensation and benefits. Employees are fun ,enthusiastic and eager to help."
good,The company has nice people and good benefits definitely pays well. It is an equal opportunity employer. The company is filled with diversity. Unfortunately  most jobs are moving out of state and overseas.
good,good job and benefits while you work. Good management along with good overall culture. We have weekly meetings which are informative and productive. Nothing more to say.
good,"Learned lots of sales techniques"
good,Quick paced job in a customer facing position with plenty of challenges. Supported commercial customers that required a high level of service delivery based on SLA's.
good,"Benefiets are  awesome. 401k . Medical, dental , vision, paid time off, vacation . Very competitive . Would recommend . Strict attendance policy "
good,"Lots of learning, excellent compensation. difficult internal processes.  Not a clear direction of what your role would look like 6 months down the road."
good,Good place to work.  Learned how to do travel vouchers for management.  Most employee's were easy to get along with.  Not micro managed.  Had a nice cafeteria and places to go for lunch.
good,Things are always changing that don't need changing or do not make sense. There are many policy changes that positively and negatively impact us a reps
good,"I worked for AT&T for 25 years.  All of my 10 or so supervisors were good or great except one bad apple. Company benefits are great. AT&T take seriously ethics, diversity, and environmental issues. The company buys and merges with another large company about every 2-3 years (SBC, Pacbell, Ameritech, Singular Wireless, Bell South, DirectTV, and soon Time-Warner, and more). "
good,Fortune 500 company with great benefits. Employee torn over is high because they expect sales. The industry is forever changing so training is continuous.
good,Liked my job but they closed the center after working there for 25 years.  Upper management doesn't seem to care about first level managers.  Can't seem to get back into AT&T once they close a center???
good,The management I had caused a lot of stress and tension I the store. The most stressful job I have ever had. I dreaded going to work did not enjoy this job at all.
good,The problem I found with the company is that when it comes to advancement there's no fairness. Management interviews who they believe is a good candidate and does not take in consideration of experience and education.
good,"This is not an easy job to preform however you are well compensated.  The hours can be a little difficult to deal with because you do not have a set time to get off work, however with what you make there its worth it."
good,"Every day was busy and stressful, but helping people made it worth going to work.Being a telephone operator helped in learning that even being a voice on the phone can help people. The hardest part of the job was being yelled at by a customer."
good,AT&T is an awesome place to work. The only issue is that the work life balance is at its lowest. And they compensate it by giving work from home option.
good,"AT&T is above average when you consider pay, benefits, and discounts.  Bonuses for upper management is extremely rediculous compared to what the average employee receives."
good,So I worked as a expeditor at the AT&T Park  and this position was fun because of all the different kind of people I was able to meet. I love to converse with new people.
good,Great company great benefit great pay balance for work/home horrible alot if over time never have time for yourself managers are really hostile an apply a lot of pressure
good,Fun call center environment. AT&T works with a union and promotes within but they offer great benefits and make sure their employees are taken care of.
good,I have worked in the call center industry for many years and when I started my career at Att/Directv I knew it was a job I would love. Working as a customer loyalty specialist can be stressful like most call center jobs are but at the end of the day I can always say that I truly helped someone whether that is by lowering their bill to a more manageable rate for them or by disconnecting their account in a kind and courteous way. Being able to truly help someone and know that you have made their day better is why I love customer service and this job allows me to think about the customer first unlike other jobs I've had.
good,Fun place to work at times.  It seemed like management at the time wanted to hurt you more than they wanted to help you.   Very fast paced environment.
good,"It was a long time since I worked there. The whole leadership team is different."
good,Pull down tickets for compliance review. Go over State and Federal laws. Go over each contract and verbiage  of each contract to see if it was under compliance. Audit all charges and shortages with tariffs and conventional government contracts with corporate facilities.
good,Great job working directory assistance until no one no longer needed it due to cell phone assistance and use of online directory pay excellent benefits super retirement terrific
good,"AT&T has went through many changes in the 10 years i was there, some good, some bad.  Overall it is a great company to work for.  I feel they need to be more transparent with their employees."
good,AT&T has gone through many company changes. It was very challenging at times as the changes were implemented but as a good customer service representative you learn to adapt.
good,AT&T is a premier communication company dedicated to providing first class services in mobility voice and data services. The company provide employees with work life balance.
good,"Es una compañía con un excelente ambiente laboral, un plan de beneficios muy bueno y salarios acordes al mercado un poco bajos frente a compañías del mismo sector, los compañeros son muy colaborativos y de gran trabajo en equipo. sin embargo los tiempos que se necesitan para cubrir las expectativas de los cargos son demasiado altos , trabajando cerca de 12 Horas diarias , con disponibilidad en horarios fuera de oficina inclusive noches y feriados."
good,Very detail orientated. Cant be afraid of heights. Company is very big on production and numbers. Have very high expectations for meeting and exceeding metrics.
good,"It has been over 10 years since I worked there, but when I was there it wasn't a bad place to work, busy but not overwhelming.  At the time they were transitioning from Cingular to ATT Wireless and there were some growing pains, working with people in remote locations, etc...but it is not surprising after such a transition.  By now I would be confident they  have all this worked out and it would be a fine place to work."
good,at&t offers good pay and good benefits. Great people to work with but unfortunately there is no such thing as job security with this company. Advancement is pretty hard to reach.
good,Various positions throughout my employment. Good chances to advance if you wanted to change. Benefits were good when I was employed there. Union was ok.
good,"Good company to work with. "
good,"Technical Support Desk, maintained detailed files, reference, and active communication"
good,The job is great.  Awesome pay and decent benefits.  A lot of politics.  Not much room for advancement unless you play the game.  Always plenty of work.
good,"The overall culture and stability of the company is great.  Additionally, the individuals that I work with both directly and indirectly have been extremely helpful to my knowledge and development.  The only issue I have had thus far is working in an operations/call center type environment due to my inability to get noticed.  It has mad obtaining promotions pursuing my other professional interest within the company extremely difficult.  Despite this issue, I would recommend this company and it's culture to anyone seeking employment."
good,"Excellent company to work for, my job moved to Slovakia and i was forced into early retirement. I am too young to retire. I would love to work with them again as a contractor or regular employee."
good,"The management is very political, but the pay is very good and they give you bonuses on top of your hourly. It's worth it when you need a good strong job and don't have a college degree"
good,"Higher up you are, the closer you are to the door. Great place for sales and commissions, however much has changed over the last 10 years and the sales pressure and work life balance really make this a tough company to work for."
good,"right fitted, up-sold, cross sold to desiring customers and business owners. "
good,"The company provides great benefits in health insurance, products and services. A typical day is resolving the customer issues from technical support, billing issues and sales and product education."
good,"Very flexible hours, commission structure was very rewarding. The company had many new services available for the first time in wireless industry making commissions and bonuses very attainable"
good,AT &T is a great place to work.  My position provides a daily challenge that I completely enjoy.  The workplace culture allows for additional educational opportunities and leadership is always open to an elevator pitch.
good,"Un trabajo bajo presión pero mis jefes no saben escuchar nuestras peticiones dia a dia y hablan con palabras altisonantes así mismo no te puedes acercar a recursos humanos por que no te brindan el apoyo que te mereces, perjudican nuestro interés de seguir dentro de la empresa, puede haber problemas y jamás logran poner un punto final o brindarnos una solución a nuestros problemas, no se puede alzar la voz por que por cualquier cosa quieren que tu firmes tu renuncia no te despiden por no pagarte lo que te mereces por despido."
good,"- solid compensation/benefits compared to industry standards"
good,"They are a great company that take care of their employees, but the compensation is a little lower then other competitors. The atmosphere is laid back and high paced, but you have to build your success and work hard to maintain it."
good,Upper management has been out of sales for so long they tend to make unfair and inflated sales goals. The work is stressful but compensated well. My personal manager was great.
good,All depends on your manger. The company is leadership driven. sooo if your not in leadership or a producer you may not be heard much. Customers can be very demanding and impatient.
good,"AT&T is in the steps of restructuring, having laid off half their managers in the last few months, that being said as long as you're good at meeting quotas and following management instruction it's very easy to succeed and move up."
good,"This company is always looking for the next big thing forcing employees to pivot skills on a consistent bases. This makes focusing on one Department, project, or business very difficult."
good,"Great benefits and compensation. However there is a very high churn rate on employees in part due to a high volume of lay-offs and offshoring of jobs. It is also very difficult to move around to other positions within the company, and even more difficult to move up."
good,"I was allowed to do some of my best work at AT&T. The company has deep enough pockets to allow some experimentation. In my case, this experimentation paid off very well."
good,Craft/field personnel almost impossible to advance if your not well known. Been trying to advance for over 5 years and still cant get promoted. Managers I have worked for were great.
good,It really depends on the location you are at. You can grow with the company but sometimes they ask for a little much. You have great benefits. Most of the managers are really cool.
good,"I retired in 1999."
good,"CEO clearly defined goals of company."
good,"Working for At&t was a good experience. Meeting new people everyday, and solving their issues or connecting them to U-verse prepared me for my future that I have today."
good,"most days good, have to stay on your toes.management,and  people seemed to get along good. hardest part,trying to get out the production.  enjoyable part was being able to communicate with others,take walks at break time."
good,"A typical saying around AT&T is that the acronym actually means ""At This Time"" which refers to how often change happens within the company.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing but it can require employees to adapt frequently.  AT&T's biggest strength is its diversity in its workforce.  The people are truly the most important resource it has and this can sometimes be forgotten as the chain of command grows.  There is a culture of trickle down authority which can be demoralizing at times but can also be necessary in a sales driven workforce.  Overall, if you mold and grow a solid team based on core values you will have a great time working at AT&T!"
good,I was a call center rep /floor supervisor. I worked many hours and different shifts. I can say that they really know how to take care of their associates. They do have a sales matrix which is not that hard if yo just interacted with the callers. Listening is very important as you can't get too involved with the customers. You will get short breaks all day and at times they even supplied snacks. The upper management encourages you to speak-up and get involved.
good,"If you're looking to work for a company with its finger on the pulse of cutting edge technology as it relates to entertainment - you'll absolutely love this face paced company!"
good,I had a wonderful career at AT&T. I did want to finish my career there  but it wasn't in the cards. I was able  to learn and grow and thrive  within the company despite of my education.
good,"Enjoyed my time with this company. Great coworkers, always ready to step up when assistance was needed. Position allowed a view into how companies protect information. Management generally upbeat, hosting different small events each month to engage employees, show appreciation. Similar set up to, but definitely not a call center. Hardest part of the job was technology related."
good,"This is a high performance job, metrics are constantly looked at and you are rated everyday. There is a ranking system used to motivate and inspire competition. If this does not bother you, then this is the job for you."
good,"The project teams are the best part of the job because the people are professional, respectful, knowledgeable, and always willing to help. Projects are varied and always interesting."
good,"Leading technology fast pace , very good benefits and place to work. work life balance is manageable. Company culture can use some work. Great company to work for"
good,"Nothing is the same in a work day, each job is different even if it is the same type of circuit. Work groups are good, even though techs work individually, there is a willingness to help and assist one another. Hardest part of the job, maintaining the numbers. Most enjoyable portion is the customer and being able to deliver to them the service they expect in one seamless visit."
good,we wroked 8 hr shifts which were pretty much spent on the phone either introducing customers to new products they would actually benefit from  and even some they werent aware we offered as well as saving those we would want to fully or partially disconnect
good,The people are great to work with. I learned a lot of about the technology of cell phones and how the network operates. Management was sometimes not very understanding at situations.
good,They pay better if you come off the street than if you get promoted from within. Get the pay upfront because promotions are capped. If you come in underpaid you will always be underpaid.
good,"I worked in a department that no longer exists. The company is a giant therefore it offered it's employee's great perks. Unfortunately, I don't really remember what it was like working there."
good,"this company is the first company that i have been, the process for hiring is not so complicated and they take good are of their employees and newly hires, it helps me stand on my own and face different situations and to solve a problem that is unreachable and attain my goals"
good,ATT was a great place to work. Lots of room for advancement. It just depends on you of how far you want to go. Started as a customer service representative and ended up a Manager.
good,"Great company to work for.  Inclusive culture that promotes both professional and personal career development, Ensures products are align to enhance customer experience and satisfaction."
good,"Att is a great company, but the advancement is so hard. Money is wonderful but your family life will suffer unless you are in management.  Things are always changing so you must be prepared to change with it and adapt."
good,troubleshooting telecommunication equipment sold by AT&T. labor relations. hardest part of the job was being forced to try and sell more equipment to customers who were contacting AT&T because their current equipment was malfunctioning
good,"Good work life balance"
good,good company to work for money making potential is there for those who work hard and want to be successful in sales environment very competitive all the tools need to thrive is accessible
good,"although direct tv was about to make at&t fall through and managers were already warning us of lay-offs, it was a great company to work for especially with the other employees. Management is not always so great because they want more of numbers and than if you get quality wrong they ding you on that but still push for you to get the jobs done. Managers will come and sneak up on you while you are doing a job and they will go around streets just to sneak up on you."
good,"My typical day began before I was able to log-in to my computer. I was always a great day to start busy and usually the momentum continued throughout the day. Customer interaction was always fun, I learned mostly through my customers and their questions. I was busy and glad to help them learn their devices for their daily use. Management was nearby for overrides for existing customers, they trusted us to handle small issues and resolve them ourselves. This created trust in our customers and also helped create a loyal amount of clients. Most difficult were usually issues with Direct TV or landline services, people like to interact with people face to face. These services had call center people who portrayed the lack of interacting with people. I enjoyed every aspect of my job, my work associates, the management, and especially the customers. I am a social person, and meeting new people was exciting."
good,"Taking you out of your comfort zone, a position with AT&T will put you front in center to learn new skills such as negotiation, sales techniques and time management."
good,Overall I have a flexible role in which I have the ability to address issues with my team and responsibility as the leader. The workplace culture is fine.  The difficulty is moving or advancement.
good,not the worse place ive ever worked. employees are great and fun to work with. do get some freedom to work when managers arent miro-managing you. everything is a numbers game must get a good score or find a new job. best part working the benefits are amazing.
good,They encourage you to come to work. The benefits are good and they always have fun incentives during work. The customers you deal with can be difficult.
good,AT&T provided me many opportunities to manage large scale projects supporting the telecommunications network.  I managed a team of 12 responsible for the provisioning systems *BSS/OSS.
good,"Good work culture"
good,Starting when you clock in until you clock out you are on phone calls dealing with customer issues and new accounts. I was able to learn great sales skills that have developed over the years and i am grateful i had a position there. the job security is not there though.
good,Thought out my tenure with ATT i witness many surpluses and realignments... your always wonder if your job will exist the next year.
good,Great place to work. Be very careful about what you say in the center. It is a great place to work but you have to be cautious of other individuals overhearing any conversations and misunderstand your intent.
good,"Customer Service is beginning to be less important at AT&T. Still an amazing company to work for, but you can no longer take pride in just doing a great job helping people."
good,I worked for a third party company. Took about 100-150 calls per day. Relaxed place to work and management was easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the new crm system they just got.
good,I loved ATT I should have never left. grate people and grate place to work. lots of opportunities for job advancement. and was also given the tool i needed to move up.
good,"Good people to work with."
good,"Great job, fun hours and independence, If I ever had trouble, my co workers would go out of their way to help. I work best while alone and this job gave me that."
good,Great company to work for with multiple advancement opportunities.  Only down fall they have periodic lay-offs. Would be willing to go back if another opportunity was available.  Great retirement program.
good,Loved this job as a sales consultant for the lay and benefits and vacation and also all the great people and relationships built in the industry. Sales can be a very heavy job to deal with but the pros out weigh the cons.
good,"This is a good place to start working part time or right out of college. You are able to gain sales experience in a controlled environment. The only downside would be the hours around the holidays and on the weekends, which is expected in retail."
good,Some days as any job are extremely busy but over my career I have learned so much that money can't buy. The experience alone is priceless
good,"good place to work, always a group of fun loving colleagues and a management team that is ready to assist you in any way to achieve your goals. A very diverse culture."
good,fast paced work environment for sales.  a good/bad manager can make or break your experience.  recommend if you're good at sales and like to be consistently challenged.
good,"Great company to gain management experience. Development programs are great quality and supported by the Harvard Business School of management. Once you get acclimated with the fast-paced environment, the job becomes fun if you are a competitive person. The hardest part of the job is understanding that your goals are reset every single month. Therefore, self-motivation is a must."
good,A typical day at work included taking many calls from customers with different attitudes and issues. What I learned from this experience was that listening to and empathizing with the customer were the first steps to the resolution.
good,AT&T do not play about their customer feedback.  Any negative remarks from a customer could risk your employment with the company.  Advancement is there but you definitely have to work for it.  Depending on your position the balance between work and home can be tricky but doable.  The type of company to get your foot in the door with and see where you can go.
good,Great benefits but in management you can be surplussed at any given moment. Company is changing in general. All of retail is changing and many jobs will be lost because big business wants everything to go online to make the company more money but let go of the hard workers of the company.
good,Great place to build yourself and learn a lot of different things. From selling phones to cable. We sold home security as well. Over all great place to grow. May take a while but this place has a lot of potential.
good,"AT&T can be a great company to work for. You get great discounts on service and accessories, a free phone for work, and access to the newest gadgets before they come out. "
good,Looking for a change of scenary. Work day can be 8-12hrs. Complete anywhere between 1-6 jobs a day. Had company truck and tools. Was home based technician. Great benefits.
good,"AT&T in New York (Wall Street location) was great, everyday we dealt wit elite customers who wanted service and wanted everything done quickly and correctly. We dealt with a lot of brokers who did not have much time and needed our guidance in setting them up with the correct product. I love the fast paced environment and thrived in it."
good,I have worked for AT&T for the last 14 years and have been very happy.  Unfortunately they go through a reorganization every few years and my position nation wide has been eliminated.
good,"AT&T is a great place to work. You have health benefits, matching 401K, discounted service for your home and wireless needs, and they continually teach you new things regarding technology."
good,No fue buena porque. Cuando me encapacite no se me pago y todo un mes me quede sin trabajo y al terminar mi incapacidad mejor renuncie y busque otro trabajo
good,"Very nice Place to work and have a very good experience.Yo can learn great technical experience in Cloud ,Development and automation side. Work flexibility is very good ."
good,"What ever can go wrong will go wrong at the most inopportune times. "
good,"Fun place to work at, loved working with my coworkers and employees.  Managed the sales reps to focus on hitting goals.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with the stress from hitting goals in the new store."
good,"Reviewed clients' accounts regularly, corrected any errors with customers business account in the wholesale markets. Call taker for the business center."
good,I do not have anything negative or positive to say about working here. I do not believe all of these reviews should be required from indeed. This is a waste of time.
good,its a call center job you either like it or you don't. you are based on numbers high stress pay is decent compared to other call center jobs
good,"Independent work environment, self motivating, good team players / members. good exposure to real estate development and business development skill sets. Good exposure to problem solving capabilities. Good leadership and mentoring."
good,"Responsible for a variety of tasks associated with managing employees and maintaining a branch of a business. Duties include: sales, scheduling, organizing meetings, maintaining metrics necessary for company goals to be met, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Utilized computer programs at a highly proficient level in order to create an efficient work atmosphere."
good,Professional environment . You will see a lot of technology from the inside. Casual dressing code. Very easy to advance if you are diligent at your job.
good,AT&T is a company that strives to provide a diverse and inclusive work environment. The company also provides access to training to grow management skills and tuition reimbursement.
good,"I enjoy my time with AT&T as a prem tech. No matter how many times it's internet, phone and TV, every job is differnet. Every job presents it's own challenges, from the customer or the job it's self."
good,You are expected to follow rules very closely including being at work everyday and being on time.  The training is very good and you learn a lot about how to do your job.
good,"Each and everyday is different because know two homes or apartments are the same. there always knew ways to do in installation. weather it being via Coax, Copper, or Fiber optic installs.  Its a were you have to use both common sense as well as some critical thinking."
good,"Its difficult to get the 3rd level, I've learned how to many all types of projects and have honed my skills over the years.  Training is provided at no cost online and tuition is reimbursed."
good,"Great place to work."
good,Fast pace workplace where change is constant.  Always pushing for new technology that would advance company further into the future.  Ability to educate yourself at your own pace.  Over all great place to work nd learn.
good,This company allows for the opportunity to learn lots about growing technology and provides a great overall experience to its employees.
good,"They do care about their employees, but their dedication first and foremost is to the shareholders.  Profit is the king.  Layoffs are constant, and job security is hard to find."
good,"You basically sit at your desk and receive calls from customers about billing and products, yet you also recommend products that will help their business and save them money.  They constantly train you to become a better representative and help with your sales, including new promotions and products.  The managers will always try to help in whatever you need help in, such as, computer training, sales and your desk set  up for ergo correct posture and position.  The hardest part of the job was the sales.  You had goals to meet, so you had pressure there. The co-workers made the office much more welcoming.  They planned potluck lunches, celebrated birthdays and socially meet after shifts.  They made it such a pleasure to work there."
good,Typical work day is a sales position in a customer service setting. Have gained alot of experience in the sales field but would like to get back into the medical field and therapy setting.
good,was a cable provider that bought TCI cable. Great customer service and sales was our goal. Company closed in 2001 and sold operations later to Comcast.
good,"The job security is very low at this company. But I did enjoy getting to help out customers who needed me. The general oversight of the company is a little off base, but that is how they run their business and I did not want to push."
good,"Great company...sometimes it's hard to advance if you're not known by senior levels, but overall great. Retail is fast paced and easy to get into business it is hard to get out of."
good,"A typical day would start by signing in to the system to dispatch on jobs.what jobs you are assigned is always a mystery, that's based on your skill sets. You get 20 minutes to make sure you've gone over the details of your assigned job,and make sure you have all equipment needed ,as well to making sure you've contacted your cx.This is repeated throughout the day up until the work load is clear, sounds easy a piece a cake not really."
good,"AT&T is a very efficient company that truly gets the most out of its employees. Definitely a difficult company to work for due to the micromanagement, but it is also very successful at getting the job done as effectively as possible."
good,Good place to work. turn around is high. Most boss' are great. calls are easy and fast. great break room. automated lunch/snack area is a neat idea if a bit too expencive
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. It's a challenging environment because of the ever changing telecommunications industry. Managers become agents of change by being flexible and understanding that the only constant in our business is change. The compensation package is comparable to the telecom industry. Best of all for me is that we're the Gold Standard in the industry and take real pride in that level of recognition.
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar,  con buen ambiente laboral y beneficios"
good,"Working for AT&T provides good compensation and amazing insurance. The managers you are assigned to will vary in quality. I've had an apathetic one, one that was willing to cheat to be on top, and two that were phenomenal in all aspects of their position. Most coworkers were wonderful, and overall we acted as a family. The hardest part of the job is the fact that things change constantly in terms of policy and it is as though the corporate leadership is totally disconnected from the day-to-day workings of their offices, which is sort of expected in a company that size. The relationship with my current and final manager is probably the best part of the job. I was on the verge of leaving due to the constant changes that harmed the employees, but her commitment to her team was enough to compensate. We operated in a ""just do what has to be done"" kind of way, which is how I tend to work anyway. If you can get a manager like her, then you're golden. If not, well, you might be more like bronze."
good,Overall a good place to work. Management made sure you enjoyed the work you were doing and if not at least attempted to transition you to a different project.
good,Assist customers with technical support and retail service. Learned marketing techniques and other skills that improved the interpersonal relationship between parties.
good,Great company to work for.  There is plenty of opportunity at this company.  It all depends on what interest you. They work hard to make sure all employees are skilled in certain areas.
good,Great benefits and pay. Not so great hours especially if you're not tenured with the company. Hard to have a good work/life balance.
good,"A positive work environment builds morale and contributes to the culture of the store. The management team is effective at communicating with the team and a standard of high quality and excellence is expected for our customers and the work we do. "
good,Great opportunities to further yourself within the company after 2 and half years your about to decide where within the company you would like to work next
good,5 months training to get you familiar with all systems. learned all systems great people to work with. very informative
good,"AT&T pays well , the job can be challenging some times as leadership is always crushing ideas that originate from below their level but overall I imagine its no different than any other large company."
good,At&t has great benefits. The environment is stressful and hard to work for. The requirements vary so much with each customer that you can't fit a model.
good,This was a good company to work for and I learned several really good lessons.  My co-workers were great and really fun as we got all the work done.  The hardest part of the job was the politics.
good,Many opportunities for career advancement. If you work hard and work well under pressure this is a good fit.  Many different areas to work in based on your skills.
good,"Very competitive compensation for the industry and job function. Benefits are on the pricey side. Lots of downsizing, layoffs/ surplus/ early retirement packages occurring due to centralization to Dallas, TX and El Segundo, CA after the acquisition of Directv and other entities. Great employee discounts and perks."
good,"My experience at AT&t was absolutely a pleasant one. I've got an opportunity to learn new things and work on projects on a large scale."
good,Plenty of jobs if you want to move laterally but promotions are far and few. Typical executive and officer level jobs come from the outside from other companies
good,Lots of opportunities/exposure to relevant mobile technology.  An old guard company making investments in the future.
good,"Fast paced and energetic. Focused on results not the problem"
good,"Love the health benefits the job offer. Great company cares about the employees, provides a safe work environment. Hardest part of the job which is also the most enjoyable part of the job is solving the issues a customer may call in about."
good,"Great Company with a great vision. Lots of changes and you must be dynamic to adjust. Information does not get passed down during these changes very well, probably because things move so quickly, which leave some uneasy or anxious. I truly enjoy my job here."
good,"I am highly capable and experienced with web technologies. My programming skills, penchant for details and general aptitude have all served to help make me an excellent programmer.  My approach to work goes beyond my job description as I am always looking for ways to improve efficiency and reduce cost/efforts."
good,"This position is normally filled by internal candidates. If you are applying from outside the company be prepared for a dynamic day to day that requires creative problem solving. "
good,Finding any which way to help customers and make sure all of there needs a met or more than what that expected. Having fun with my fellow co-workers.  Making sure the store is always clean and well stocked.
good,"the company is excellent. there is money to be made within the sales environment. the employee determines their pay."
good,AT&T was a great company to work for after we were outsourced from CSC. We had the same team and management which was a great team. Recongnition and salary was great and working.
good,I was glad to be part of the AT&T team. It was fun to be able to help customers and be able to hear about their awesome vacations.
good,"The only thing that stays the same is change. If you are uncomfortable with that then do not apply. Also, no matter how comfortable you are in your current position. Always find ways to learn new skills and most importantly meet people outside of your own organization. When it comes time to surplus employees and it always does. You want to make sure that you have contacts to call upon outside of the affected group. I speak from experience. I did that very well for 13 years and then I got complacent and stopped making new connections. Layoff were announced and all of those that people that I had connections with where affected or retired. Nobody to blame but myself."
good,"Best job that I have ever had.  Loved working in customer service. When SBC bought ATT, there were a lot of redundant jobs, so there were  big surpluses."
good,AT&T is overall a good company.I was employed by AT&T for 21 years.The benefits were great and the management was good.After 21 years with the same company I have decided I need a change.
good,"I learned a lot about telecommunications, met a lot of awesome people and had some fun doing it. My favorite thing about the company is all of the training available to you. You just have to put forth some effort to complete it."
good,"i made good money... good co workers, some managers are terrible, hard to make your number in a plant thats 30,40 years old in most metro urban ares..."
good,"When I first started my job at AT&T, I just knew everything was going to be perfect and that job was going to be the one for me that I actually enjoyed. Unfortunately that wasn't the case for me because my manager wasn't training me properly and I'm only as good as my manager. She wasn't very nice to me and that I didn't mind. I did the best I could to keep the peace and learn what I could, but I didn't get much help. Before I knew it, it was time to show what I knew to the very manager that barely taught me anything. She taunted me and I was forced to quit. ATT was another great job with bad management."
good,"Overall I was happy, spending 14 years with AT&T counting merged time from BellSouth. The benefits are still solid, there was a pension for management, and there are a lot of opportunities. They try to reinvest in employees, but the hiring process is a mess and it feels like they are trying to change the company to cater to millennials rather than their existing workforce."
good,"I was promoted twice within the company within the 9 year career at AT&T.  I started in sales, then assistant store manager, and finally retail account executive.  Even though the work/life balance was challenging at times, the rewards were endless.  I worked with great people and in a fun, challenging environment.  The one thing is constant is that things will change, and for anyone who wants to consider a career with AT&T needs to embrace that mantra and LIVE IT!"
good,I like working for AT&T work environment. Everybody mind his/her own business with some exception minor problems in treating their contractors as outsiders.
good,"Having been with AT&T since before divestiture, I've seen so many changes based on the current technology advances over 35 years in total. Flexibility is a must for survival and advancement in AT&T. I enjoyed the many employees I have worked with over the years, some have become life time friends. Overall a good place to work"
good,"working from home was made convenient. while helping customers with technical issues, they management was not as professional as they should be, the hardest part was not being able to help customers when it stormed in they area"
good,"i liked working at at&t it was a good work environment, good people, the management was good, the hardest part of the jobs was sitting all day, most enjoyable was you could eat all day"
good,AT&T is good company to build a career if you are interested in wireless technology. Sometimes the pressure of their sales environment rub the sellers and customers the wrong way.
good,"Typical day could be in office or at home, lots of relatable and experienced coworkers. Learned plenty about business, software process, applications and systems development skills. Modern ""2020"" workspace. Management is stagnant at middle layers, and elite a level just above that. Hardest part of the job is finding a good group of people on a project you care about. Most enjoyable part is once you find that and work out a good work/life balance."
good,"Great company to work for.  Coworkers work together in a unified team environment.  In general, compensation is above average, people are great to work with, and Job security is the only concern Ive ever had."
good,This is a great company to grow with and earn a living but as with most big organization you are knowing more than a gear in the big wheel.
good,The environment facilities are in excellent condition and modern.  Learned and acquired several certification and paid for the the company.
good,"It was a great place to work, with plenty of opportunity for a variety of positions and the pay and benefits were great.  However, there always seems to be a downsizing every two years."
good,I learned a lot working there. Learned very good customer service skills.  I would still be the if I had not moved out of the city
good,"When working for a company, such as AT&T Mobility, LLC., you must always be prepared and willing to adapt to frequent changes in order to immediately apply to your job responsibilities."
good,Loved that I got to learn so much with this company and gain the experience I needed to move forward. As far as life balance their is none. Once you work here there is no life outside at&t. To many managers that don't show leadership and all they care about is getting paid and not really helping it's employees progress and get them where they need to be. Hate that the way they get you to produce numbers is by treating to fire you.  Besides that I loved the company it's self. Good money and benefits.
good,"A day at work was always about learning about new services, products, how to resolve and assist in any kind of technical & non-technical issue, billing inquiries or issues, and , of course, learning people those on and off the phone."
good,Company worked on creating a healthy environment.  Management still needs work.  It was a good campus after the renovations.
good,"Good work life balance. They have made a great cultural shift and focused on behaviors that drive performance and not juts focusing on numbers. The pay isn't the best, but there is a good work/life balance if you have been here longer than 7 years."
good,"AT&T was excellent in the beginning but as all things do, it changed. Due to upper mgmt. changes and CEO changes over the course of 20 years, the company also changed. In all honesty, it was a sweet ride for employment, benefits, bonuses and overall extensive training.  I would definitely do it again, working in IT for my entire career there."
good,"At&t Enterprise Routing Solutions Center in Colorado is a great place to learn / use Cisco Contact Center Technologies."
good,Phones are answered and customers are helped with a first call resolution.  The people are amazing.  I enjoy helping and working with everyone
good,"Planificado, divertido, distinto."
good,"Great place to work for sales enthusiastic individuals, great pay, room for growth. Enjoyed the comradery and good job perks."
good,Prepare presentations to renew or sell new advertising products to current or potential clients.  2 to 3 premise visits daily.  30 to 40 phone calls daily.
good,A typical work day was come to work and work on firewalls. I learned alot about them. Management was always down your throat. Co-Workers always helped where they could. The hardest part was always having someone look over your shoulder.
good,Pay and benefits are good. Training is good and they will train you on a lot. Co-workers are scattered throughout the US.  Work at home benefits for some positions. Management is friendly.  Overall very good company to work for.
good,"Typical day starts at 8 with a morning meeting about whats going on with the company and safety. Load your work vehicle that the company provides. drive to your jobs, typically do about 5 jobs a day. just about every day is overtime. hard to plan anything after work on a work day. I learned a lot about internet, tv and phone, using coax, cat5, and fiber. Management was great as long as you did what you needed to do. Co-workers at att are mostly great. seemed more like a bortherhood than co-workers. Hardest part of the job is weather. Most enjoyable is meeting new people and problem solving."
good,"fun at times to balance stress work life balance a plus, compensation was level according to job title, enjoyed training indirect reports and my teammates and managers"
good,Technology is interesting but big org processes tend to slow things down.  Good management who take the time to listen. Organization is very hierarchical.  The major HQ cities of Dallas and Atlanta tend to have more focus on facilities and better career path than satellite locations.
good,I enjoyed working with AT&T. Co-workers were so supportive and helpful. The work-life balance is an attractive feature of AT&T employees. Work is filled with lot of fun and entertainment. I would love to go back to AT&T if I get a chance.
good,"they offer a cafeteria. Diverse group of worker. Set work hours. volunteer overtime when offered. Union optional participation. Hardest part of job is working on dead lines, so it was a good place to work."
good,"Nos anos trabalhando na AT&T aprendi lidar com pessoas compartilhar conhecimento e aprender com pessoas mais qualificadas e experientes. "
good,"It was a great place to work. They have excellent training. The only thing is that they do shift bids, which always didn't work with my schedule"
good,"The best people you would ever want to work for , they put their employees education about the company and customer service first. "
good,"I made over 50,000 my first year as an RSC. Just be prepared to sacrifice a lot if family time. Good advancement opportunity as long as your numbers are good and you get along with management."
good,GNC is a fun place to work because you get to talk with like fitness enthusiasts like yourself all day long. You also feel good about your self when you see the heath changes in your customer base.
good,"Working for ATT was an amazing experience. They offer quite a bit of training, but call volumes (call center) do limit the time available. The environment was surprisingly upbeat for a call center and Management was by far the best i've ever worked under. "
good,The people working there was good workers. Not a fan of how the union ran things there.  And if you were on contract. You could not do or say anything.
good,Good company to work for but it takes awhile to move up in the company. You have to sell real hard and take the initative to move up. You have to prove to managment that you want to grow in the company. Make good money if you're good at sales.
good,I have been with AT&T for about 5 years and have progressed moderately upward. My job is very technical and can be quite challenging. I work with a national group of about 15 people located all over the US so we never see each other. My manager is very hands off with me as I am a self started and work consistently everyday. This position is the first time I have worked somewhere that actually promoted people. Although in my current position the only way to move forward is to find another job.
good,"a typical day of phone calls i have learned handling difficult or irate customers effectively. Setting expectations and deliver information in a positive and articulate way. Taking action to meet customer’s needs. Solves routine problems effectively, gathering the information necessary from the customer. Applies systematic approach to solving problem Professional and positive in interactions with others and is able to establish rapport quickly learned  to adjust to any environment. making commission is the hardest part of the job , i love my co workers they are amazing people to work with the most i enjoy about my job is communicating with my customers and building relationships with my co workers and customers."
good,"great place to start your career, too much pressure from senior management and inconsistency between senior leadership"
good,"Once AT&T acquired Centennial many employees started moving to other companies due to job insecurity."
good,Stable work environment with great salary and benefits. Fulfilling while helping customers resolve their technical issues. Great co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job is the repetitive nature. There is no flexibility or challenge to the job. It is the same thing over and over.
good,"AT&T was awesome to work for, they offer awesome commissions and other avenues of income. They care for there employees and offer generous discounts."
good,"AT&T is a good company with many different areas to look into, Great benefits. Many upcoming products and services t be on fire about!"
good,"Fun, exciting, challenging and friendly environment.It is a great learning environment, and helps building not only career, skills and knowledge, but also advance in different fields of expertise"
good,Good play to work and gain valuable experience and to learn and develop skills in advancing technologies. Benefits are comparable to companies of similar size.
good,AT&T as a whole is a wonderful company. I work at a call center so it is not an environment where you get to be around others as much. In store opportunities are more of my expertise. Management in my department are decent. Co-workers experience the same things that you do and can help answers questions that you may have so they are excellent. The hardest part of the job is when calls are backed up and you might have a customer that is mad. The most enjoyable part is when you get a customer that is very understanding and you are able to assist them in every way the need; in which they leave feeling better to have called in.
good,"AT&T is transitioning from a telecommunications company to an entertainment company. Because of this transition, focus is now on wireless services and not so much on traditional landline services. The future of the company is very exciting. AT&T has always been known for innovation and that has not changed. "
good,"Managing vendor relationships. Providing business leaders reporting on weekly-monthly basis based off of the reporting that I have gathered. Using statistical formulas to develop trends to better enhance the business operations. Develop training materials to implement new ideas and expectations. In order to successful, you need to be able to adapt to different business needs, and become the subject matter expert in your field."
good,ATT has been very good to me over my 15 + years with them. I have learned how to work with a diverse group of my peers and leadership.
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving at 7:30 and taking inventory of the store, emailing with daily goals to be achieved. I learned all about cell phones, internet and television packages. Management was okay. The co-workers were amazing. The most enjoyable part of my job was the friendly and competitive atmosphere."
good,AT&T Wi-Fi services is a fine place to work. I've had supportive management the whole time I've worked there. It suffers from not being fully integrated into AT&T as a whole though. I feel that we lack opportunities that AT&T employees in other departments receive because of this and it negatively impacts possible career advancement.
good,"Manage, Coach, Train and Develop Sales Teams."
good,"Learned the functions of multiple departments and vendor centers. Handled many special projects. Worked out of State on many occasions. Normal day to day activities were training and coaching agents on my team. Assisting with taking customer escalations, payroll, potential new hire interviews and review performance reports on the team"
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Typical day at work would be to review my calendar to see what meetings and reports were due for the day.  Research any open trouble ticket items.  Interact with peers and customers to resolve any open issues.  Process reports.  I have learned many things over the years working at AT&T.  One very important item is when communicating with customers, less is always more.  Don't over explain.  My co-workers were great and very easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a positive attitude when working with negative customers. The most enjoyable part was working with my peers to discover new ways to address and resolve issues."
good,"inbound call center 90%, offline10% or less.  learned excellent"
good,"While some of the requirements for tech support are ridiculous, overall, DTV is a good place to work. Most of the management is good to work for, and care for the employees. "
good,Working with a global customer base was challenging at times.  The job itself was rewarding when you did complete your duties and was recognized by the customers for a job done correctly and well done. Connecting customers from all over the world at one time is amazing. Too bad they kept outsourcing our jobs.
good,"I wrote about this already in 2 reviews before, great team, great management, great attitude - not robot like attitude. Working with high-end network devices, learned a lot about whole data center structure."
good,a typical day at directv is your morning coffee meeting with your supervisor in the morning explaining new ways and new details about the services asking if we need help or coaching before starting then get ready to take about 35 to 40 calls a day don't now what type of calls your going to get but part of customer service and make sure the customers are satisfied with anything we are helping them with the most enjoyable part will be the customers  about the great customer service u helped them with.
good,"Directv is a nice place to work but it seems like there are more contract employees an direct hires."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a fast paced mix of different customers with varying needs. Being a veteran of almost 12 years meant other employees asking me questions on a regular basis."
good,I would recommend this to someone who wants to be in IT.  Was able to learn allot while there.  This company is not also known as telephone company.  They have Governments contractor side that is wonderful
good,Liked the time I was there but the work had to leave and I did not want to move.  This job was a great opportunity to excel in technologies.
good,"I enjoyed this position.  It gave the opportunity use all my logistics, IT, Management and Transportation skills all together in a one mission concept to prepare for the next milestone of Army logistics,"
good,"For those looking to have flexible job/life balance, I would recommend AT&T. Be ready to work weekends and holidays, but overall a fun place to work."
good,It's has been a good co to work till 2008 and then working environment changed as the MSOC was introduced. Healthy Management converted into Micro-management.
good,"Excellent job for life/work balance.  As a consultant I did my job, offer solutions to better the job some of which were well received and used.  Yea.  And managed for the first time in my life to keep to a fourty hour week.  Over-time was approved and paid for when needed."
good,Can be a pretty enjoyable job if you can keep up with the constantly changing sales environment and technology. Amazing benefits package.
good,Inbound call center. In depth training. Amazing benefits. Diverse group of co-workers. Very enjoyable place to spend your work hours.
good,It's an fun job with great atmosphere and reliable services and they supply you with tools and take good care of you. The only downside is they are switching to piece rate for all employees.
good,"help customers with satellite issues, home equipment issues, set appointments for techs to go to customers home for repairs, take payments for services"
good,"Good benefits including health, dental, vision, 401K, Short-term and Long-term disability options with paid time off plans."
good,"This is a good place to work if you are motivated and a self started. Don't expect much help beyond the supervisor level unless the manages know you, so make yourself known. Good advancement opportunities."
good,"Very cool co-workers, was often brought in on changes to work plan, managers included you in some decisions on team planning."
good,the best part of the job is your coworkers and customers. the benefits are pretty good. you are always on the go and have to think on your feet. you get to demo new products and see the latest and greatest technology.
good,Good job with great pay and benefits. Poor treatment of employees otherwise. Discipline given for being legitimately sick. Difficult to advance or transfer.
good,AT&T CEO is good leader and is leading the company in correct direction. Typical work day involves performing your duties. It is a fast paced technological environment.
good,"Very in depth. i cannot state that enough. working for att is completely different than working for any other branch of cellular. while verizon has metrics and goals to hit (three maybe four) at att, you have opps, accessories, wired, connected, digital life, wtr, prpo, plenti, myatt and mpp. while rewarding, working for this company can be taxing to say the least"
good,"It was work, very cold and slow. A lot of cold calling with the pressures of meeting quotas. But easy to get into the routine. My kids were little then and I was a young mother so it conflicted with my schedule."
good,AT&T was an enjoyable place to work and meet people from all types of backgrounds and cultures.  There is plenty of job opportunity and advancement as long as you are committed to the job that you are doing.
good,"As a Wire Tech daily work can leave a lot to be desired.  It was not what I expected when I hired on.  The performance metrix is more out of your control then anything and once you get in a hole its hard to recover.  No to mention its hard to understand how it works.  "
good,This position is great as far as compensation goes but you have no life outside of work because the job is so time consuming. If you are looking for great pay and no time for play then yes this is for you.
good,"I was a project manager for capital replacement projects for cell sites as will as expense repairs for the Ohio and Western Pa Market. "
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T for 3 years as a contractor.  Unfortunately after my 3 year contract was over they had to let me go.  The co-workers that I engaged with on a daily basis within Network Deployment were great to work with.  I was able to gain a tremendous amount of knowledge on the New Site Build process.  I was able to use my reporting skills and was able to provide my management team with necessary reports in a timely manner.
good,"Daily this job was very busy coordinating all activities that needed to happen prior to each Release Test of system components. A lot of multi tasking trying to get all test components in place and systems prepared for execution.  Working with other teams/clients was very enjoyable to make sure a quality test is provided. My personal manager is very good to work with and was always confident with the results of my work.  I am able to work independantly  and in a team setting too.  I would oversee the entire project and validate all testing is covered as needed. I trained and mentored our Off-shore team but that is why I am looking for a new job now , because my position has been off-shored because the company reduced a lot of their projects as a cost deduction.  This job was always challenging because of a lot of different changes always taking place.  I really enjoyed the job because it was never dull and it always gave you a good feeling to get through a successful release with no or minimal impact to our production systems once we deployed."
good,"Start of day by clocking into your computer, then logging into your phone.  Ready to take calls from customers about technical issues with their cell phones.  I learned a lot about technology in the mobile world.  Manager was supportive and a family guy.  Looked at his employees as his kids.  The majority of my co-workers were nice and became good friends.  Hardest part of the job was the noisy call center.  I believe the customer is top priority and the focus should be on them not what is going on around you.  The most enjoyable part of my job with at&t was helping the elderly with their cell phones and fixing them when they stopped working.  Customer's depend on their phones so much these days.  It was a great feeling to make someone's day better."
good,"I enjoyed my group of peers at  AT&T mostly due to the working and sharing environment. All Managers had individual challenges with personnel and we would share our experiences to better the team. "
good,"Working at AT&T offered a wide variety of opportunities, good pay and benefits.  "
good,"great place great pay have to work weekends. i learned a lot at this company how to manage, how to deal with all different personalities"
good,"nice team  ,good work ,scope to learn more and most enjoyable part of job was the team .fun work place with supportive managment"
good,"Fun place to work everyone is nice and friendly , everyone works well together great job all together , i enjoyed working and looked forward to going to work everyday"
good,at&t as a company was great but the management was poor... the benefits and pay was great.. friendly atmostphere.. shift changes are a variable that may be willing to change.. there is a point system that may need to have some adjusting. overall a great company to work
good,Atmosphere was great with supportive management. With hard work there is room to grow and help to get you there. I enjoyed engaging with customer and problem solving the most while working at AT&T.
good,Challenging place of employment that forces employees to think outside the box. Places high standards on quality customer service and ensures that all employees adhere to creating a positive interaction with our customers. I have enjoyed working at AT&T for the last four years and I have been able to advance to a management position. They have given me the opportunity to grow as an individual and the tools necessary to succeed in a leadership role.
good,Work with customers and business on there needs.  I have learned how to stay positive and also how to be in a management role. My management is always try to help me move on with my career with AT&T. I like my co workers they are positive to be around and also to help me stay positive to try to achieve my goals. Customers telling you no.  Making very good money and also the benefits
good,"Directv is a company that is willing to work you. It is not a bad place to work at all but you have to be the right type of person to work for them. This job has great benefits, good compensation, and good people that are very knowledgable on the product. "
good,"Fun workplace but lot of work pressure and overtimes are common. Co-workers are Awesome."
good,"A typical day at AT&T would consist of answering calls, sales, and providing great customer service. Management was ok but could've been better. I absolutely loved my co-workers we always helped each other if needed."
good,"Plenty of interface with manufacturing, engineering and quality control departments which meant this was a varied and challenging role. Excellent grounding to learn computer skills and administration."
good,"Top notch training organization that provides the means for its employee to continuously improve their skills and advance their careers (e.g. tuition reimbursement, trainings to help prepare its workforce for a rapidly changing industry)."
good,"Gave an opportunity to work on HANA including many migrations, refreshes etc. A very fast paced work environment working for customers satisfaction."
good,A typical day was getting my day started by picking out my daily goals and setting my self up on how i was going to achieve them
good,AT&T is a large stable company with a vision for the future of communications. Focused on providing their customers with a useful and valuable service.
good,"It was a fun place to work. Unfortunately they are downsizing. Prior to the this, it was a very stable job. The benefits and pay are excellent."
good,"I enjoyed working here, my co-workers were all really nice. Management was cool too, they did their best to satisfy everyone's needs."
good,able to work at your own pace and be your own boss pretty much get to meet new people on a day to day basis get benefits great pay and overall good shop enviroment
good,"For motivated, hard working individuals with a great work ethic AT&T is the place.  The job is exceptonally demanding and you must be a problem solver with an ability to learn and be flexible with the ever changing movement and technology."
good,"Each day was very different.  High level of incoming calls.  Focus was on hiring and to keep current employees motivated and feeling good about their jobs.  Great HR department that made sure work environment was pleasant and motivating.  Sr. Management was very hand-on, encouraging and focused on getting you to the next level."
good,"I worked for AT&T for over 26 years.  If the position was not eliminated, I would have continued to work with AT&T until I retired. My office was line a family, we were a office that had been together for so long.  Our life events such as births, weddings and graduations were shared by all.  "

good,"opportunities for advancement were great.  It was fun to work there, but job security was not very good.  The other employees were great and still keep in contact with most of them."
good,"No customer service, a Sales office.  In the 18 years I worked for the company it changed a lot.  From a customer service company, to a sales only company."
good,"Worked independently as an individual contributor in a significant market level leadership role; responsible for getting results across several functional areas.

good,"Production manager on the floor with a team of 47 team members.After six months was moved to wave planning."
good,As a sales rep you are treated like a robot. very negative environment. Managers do not value employees as much as they value their paychecks. Great pay for what you actually do but to me its not worth being treated like dirt.
good,"AT&T is definitely a very prestigious organization and I learned a lot of new things during my entire tenure here. It was absolutely a pleasure to work for the company. The team members, and other associated staff personnel were very courteous, helpful and considerate of me."

good,Great job! I gained a lot of experience from this position like soft skills with customers and just learning to put myself in the customers shows. I learned how to be a salesperson. I enjoyed my time here with all of the hands on training and support from my upper management. They took good care of us and made sure that we had all of the tools and things we needed to successfully perform our job. We were never left in the dark about changes and we were always prepared for what was coming our way. We had evaluations on our performance with constructive criticism which I believe helps in any industry. Thank you Nor Cal for the opportunity!
good,I have been working with Mas Tec/AT&T for a year and a half.  The pay is good but the hours are very erratic.  Sometimes i leave my home at 6:00 am and may not get home till 11:00pm.  I recently had a baby and its become difficult to balance work and life at home since then.  The job is very rewarding i just feel as though it may be time for a change
good,Answer inbound /outbound calls close to 300 or more a day. Over come objections and settle disgruntled customers. As well as place new orders.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Great Company, unfortunately they like to hire most temporary or term employees. Very hard to get a permanent position in this Company. Work is intensive, expansive, and very interesting. Employees are well compensated."
good,"Great Benefits, Advancement is not so great unless you were an officer in the military.  Other than that, great company."
good,"If you have never worked in retail sales, what you should know."
good,"a typical day starts at 5am and ends when the last customer has been serviced no matter the time of day."
good,It was a good place when we were allowed to help the clients in whatever they needed- then everything started getting automated and ATT started downsizing the people
good,"Liked the tradition and community-based culture which makes at&t fun place to work effectively.  The process is slow , which lower the bar of effectiveness. The organization is solid , however the result/outcome is second criteria when it comes to relationship,"
good,"The company is an exciting place to work with new products and services. The employees work in a collaborative environment and the company provides good tools to help eliminate geographic distances and improve collaboration. The company is helping to prepare the work force to get ready for change. It is hard to get promoted within the company, but there are many opportunities to move laterally."
good,I started off as a temporary employee with AT&T and eventually became a permanent employee.  The company has great benefits and perks.  It is hard to move up unless you have connections.

good,"Good people. Strong and determined to get the job done. Tension was normal, and stress free. Management cared more about you as a person then as a employee."
good,"never have i ever had the job security, or income based life style previous to working for AT&T. Paid vacation, paid sick days, 401k, and they only promote from within. the down side is you have an extremely limited option on work shifts, and you keep your schedule for 6 mth before bidding for a new one. in order to work 8 - 5, you will have to gain a tenure of at least 3 years, and even then there are no guarantees."
good,For the work we had did the pay was reasonable and the establishment was very quite nice with a cafeteria and inside store to purchase food items
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was, gettting to know different people while working in the public. I had the opportunity to work for different stores  that consist of unquie cultural back grounds. A typical day at AT&T will be greeting customers with a smile and friendly greeting, getting them assigned to the que to be seen by a Retail Sales Asscociate.  Multi-task between greeting and checking in with the waiting customers and tell them about our promotions. Through out the day, back office duties will be completed before the next days works. Furthmore; including package handling, audits, cash audits, and checking in inventory."
good,"Money and benefits were great, but apparently some managers feel they can change the rules when it came to coaching (weekly reviews) of call; most managers let you pick the call. If you pick a bad one that's on you. At least one manager of the call center I worked decided to start picking calls on his own, which could easily skew the performance stats."
good,dont really have anything to say. It's alot of hopes and dreams that don't come true even when you are a top performer for multiple consecitive months.
good,come in to work on sales and upgrades for customers both products and services to upgrade customers experience with sbc and there company
good,"Spent most of the day answering customer phone calls regarding issues with payments, phone shut offs and billing disputes. This was my first professional job and I learned many things about how to work in a professional environment . My coworkers were fun to be with. Many of us spent time together outside of work. The hardest part of the job was working in August and September when call volume was the heaviest and trying to have a positive attitude with all of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fun and friendly environment."
good,"fast pace, good hard working people."
good,took inbound calls. co workers where nice. the training was very good and when you need help there where people there to help. Directv wanted you to succeeded. the hardest part was dealing with very difficult customers. the most enjoyable was working with the computer.
good,Appreciate the opportunity to have worked with a great group of dedicated team players. I also had the opportunity to travel to many places in this position and network with a lot of individuals who have supported me through my career growth and transformation.
good,Spend most of my day analyzing errors on the consumer website. Reach out to dev team to try to find resolutions for issues on website.
good,"A typical day at work includes taking between ten and twenty-five calls, and assisting customers with technical issues as well as any other issues or needs a customer may have. "
good,"Overall, my experience working for AT&T was good.  Regular training, benefits package, and management were all great and what you want in employment."
good,"Very few people are fortunate enough to have a career in which they constantly learn and grow. Over the past ten years at AT&T I have held various positions progressing from a front line sales person to a district manager. My experience has allowed me to develop and strengthen my leadership skills and qualities. "
good,Helping clients with problems and understanding their equipment by troubleshooting. Not only that but looking at their monthly bill and showing empathy when in need.
good,"i could do anywhere from 2 to 6 job a day "
good,"AT&T was a great opportunity for me. "
good,"AT&T has a great potential and right goals. However, some locations require different approaches, not the same throughout the country. Overall great place to work, always something new and interesting to learn. Every day i educated public about devices; assisted customers in gaining understanding of new technologies; worked with new and upcoming technologies. Created and managed customer accounts in specialized computer systems."
good,"A typical day at work includes: cleaning your area of work, greeting customers, listen to customer's problems and recommending solutions accordingly, pitching and making sales, making invoices, and handing cash transactions. The manager provided a very friendly work environment and lots of guidance."
good,"I have enjoyed my long term employment with AT&T, I take inbound to retain customers and to assist customers with their concerns,needs, and also sell our products and services. Meeting sells quotas. I'm and account analyst and take pride in providing superior customer service. Also being able to multi-task in different systems."
good,"Pros:"

I learned new skills like using consulted sales abilities and trips program for routing purposes, how to make effective selection, the on-boarding processes for new hires, basic project management skills, handled customer service issues and teaching other staff associates (Coaching and Leadership)."
good,"Good company overall to work for, job security is very good the only con the that your paid on a piece rate system, which means your pay is based on the size of the contract and how busy the company is so pay greatly varies."
good,"This was a very positive experience.  I would absolutely work here again.  Lots of fun during the day, team building, and extra acitivites.  Management was very open and approachable."

good,"I liked working for AT&T because I was able to work in different departments, learn different things and meet different people."
good,"Worked there for a long time they had a ton on metrics to manage, so you will get a lot of experience in managing to metrics. Also you will handle all kinds of customer issues."
good,"A typical day at work entailed logging in to your computer, loading all the programs needed to work, then answering inbound calls from customers and internal employees. Calls would range from basic needs of checking about their bills, to porting their number from their previous carrier, to more advanced needs as to their device not working. Management was very good, my managers in particular I enjoyed, you always knew what was expected. Co workers were great as well, meant some great people, and everyone was always willing to help one another. The hardest part of the job was the constant change in policy, and the stats that were being driven on every single call. It could get stressful when you were unable to meet certain stats in a day, and the micro management could get a bit overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers. When you would get a customer who had called in numerous times with an issue that hadn't been resolved previously, and being able to take care of the issue for them was very gratifying."
good,I learned how to be prompt to work and how to be loyal.  How to properly speak and respect customers and well as co-workers. To be productive follow instructions even if I didn't agree with them. The hardest part of my job was to do something that was not productive or didn't help the customer or correct the problem.  I like when the upper management team acknowledge the employees for helping the company make their benchmarks.
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for. There are high pressure moment so as long as you can meet your goals, you won't have an issue."
good,"management seems o be too happy with situation as it is, not interrested in innovations and new processes announced by people in below levels. "
good,"I loved greeting customers, but I mostly enjoyed being in the office learning about the internal flow of the company. I did not enjoy the lack of flexibility and communication from management."
good,"If you are in the game of call center work, DirecTV offers great pay (bonuses are real) and benefits, opportunity to grow within the company, and a positive atmosphere to work in. Also, they have an atrium in the main entrance way, which is pretty fantastic."
good,Show up in the morning and get the equipment needed for the day. get on the computer and get your job head to your customer home and do the work desired. most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions and relationships built with customers but the hardest part of the job is working in all types of turbulent weather and no consistency on what time you get off work daily
good,"Great Company to work for excellent benefits hours are difficult long meetings weekly, company changes very frequently must be willing to adapt to change, pay is competitive, must sell plus ones with every customer"
good,"All of my current QA experience has been with AT&T. With the help of the company, I have learned to identify test cases within documentation, creating and executing test cases, as well as conduct and hold meetings in regards to defects, documentation reviews, and issues that arise during testing. It also taught me how to manage others working on projects to ensure that testing gets done and an efficient and timely manner."
good,It was a high volume call center so you answer a lot of calls throughout the day. You will get support from your supervisors when needed.
good,"Working for AT&T has had its ups and downs, mostly depending on how the customer reacts to the information we provide to them. I have learned that no matter the situation with any customer, there is always a way to help them understand exactly what is going on , and to calm them down. I have learned to be patient with my customers, and confidently give them the solutions. The customers that I work with are always happy with their resolutions. Your experience working here can entirely depend on what manager you get, as all management styles are different. "
good,working with the public to give them the best possible experience. Constantly building relationships and trust. Diffcult hours...hard to keep a personal life because your mind is constantly on work.
good,"Your manager makes a huge difference and I have been blessed to have a very good manager for the last year and continuing into 2015.  My job is very rewarding, can be very lucrative and I am helping very large companies provide even more benefits to their employees."
good,"Good company, other than being surplused after 18 years of working for them. Approximately 3000 other managers surplused at same time."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Job was easy, work was basic, pay just wasn't the best. Worked midnights which is usually a positive for me."
good,Back in the days it was a great place to work NOW not so much also my position was eliminated. The management team came and went In the 7 years i worked i saw about 8 managers
good,"At&t is one of the biggest firm in its field in USA. It provide  services to all 500 fortune companies."
good,AT&T is a company that offers many benefits. The compensation for your work is excellent. Health insurance for you and your family is hard to find now days in the work place.
good,"Strong company, needs more diversity in senior leadership roles.  Ability to travel to most major U.S. cities if willing or desire to relocate.  Toughest part of the job is learning new role on the go without official and structured training.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to telecommute."
good,Upper management does not care about their employees. Other than that the job is ok. The best part of the day is knowing you have resolved a customer's issue
good,"Overall AT&T is a great company to work for. They offer excellent benefits, great training, and good management. Some of the management processes are a little less than timely and shift changes can make scheduling anything in advance tricky, but the company gives as much notice as possible prior to changing work schedules. At the time I worked for AT&T benefits were outsourced and working with the insurance company was difficult at best. "
good,A normal day would be being pushed to sell products to all customers that come into the store. Being knowledgeable of products and services to best help the company. Can be an enjoyable work place at times and other times you may just need a break from being on overload all the time.
good,"Pros	"
good,"The day is like any other when it comes to a sales positions, sell sell sell"
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for. Fast paced, always learning."
good,Fast paced. Lots of  daily requirements being a call center manager. Too many levels of approval to get the smallest thing done.
good,"A typical day at work is my relentless attitude toward contributing to the team and helping to keep it one unified front. Getting along with co-workers makes my day more fun, besides that, I think is important to enjoy your job. The hardest part of the job is when you don't have the right information to process a new assignment."
good,"Very good work/life balance and benefits.  Compensation is ok, when you factor in vacation and bonuses.  I would highly recommend working for this company."
good,a lot has changed I am sure and my feedback would be irrelevant. I worked in outside business sales and it was a blast....tons of freedom and there were no demands to be in the office except for Monday meeting...money and co-workers were great
good,The typical day there was 30 calls waiting for assistance with a technical issue.  I learned a lot about communications systems and cellular devices and how to create case notes and submit files for network issues.  I had access to learn the current status of work orders and the ability to request work to be done at specific locations.  The hardest part of this job was if there was a major networking issue there was no automated was to alert customers before attempting to contact us when it was weather or other type of mechanical problem causing major network issues.  Being able to successfully fix a large issue that has eluded people for some time is a satisfying feeling.
good,"Great place to work! There are plenty of education opportunities."
good,I've learned the value of customer. I've learned that not matter the situation the customer is always right. Listen to the concerns of the customer. Involve yourself. Look as if the show was on the other feet.
good,The work hours can be long from 8am to 10pm. You will learn how to install wiring for phone lines and data connections. install modems and tv boxes. Management varies depending on location. Some co-workers enjoy the job and take it seriously others may look at it as a job because of the work schedule. the hardest part of the job is learning enough information about the job in the given timeframe. the enjoyable part is customer satisfaction once the issues are resolved.
good,"A very structured environment typical of a very large corporation.  Motivated, hard-working and capable employees have the ability to make a large impact on company's bottom line and see the fruits of their labor.  A great place to learn and develop skills for employees with strong inner drive and desire to improve."
good,"Provided valuable sales and customer service experience. Hardest part of the job was adjusting to, learning about and positioning new and upcoming products offered by company. Great working environment. Demanding management team with proper cause, it was a high traffic quota driven position."
good,"Retrieved and update records for medical and dental direct pay reports. Friendly work environment with co-operative co-workers. Most of us were taking the Actuarial Exams, hence a lot of applied analysis and learning became a part of my job experience."
good,Job was a good job and i learned a lot from it and also helped me manager people and my team a lot better. My peers were great and had a lot of fun.
good,Management is old school and managed by fear instead of supporting sales reps. I think the Yellow Pages will not have a bright future.
good,"My job was very stressful but I liked the multitasking, but unfortunately my dad got sick and I had to take a leave to take care of my dad"
good,Working overnight shift is not good for management employee in my position I had limited promotion opportunities. I believe AT&T is a great company just this division was not great. The Good Ole boy promotions and advancement was in full effect.
good,AT&T promoted interaction among co-workers with excellent team activities.  The managers were an excellent source of information and assistance as well.
good,"I was a contractor at AT&T Labs for a number of years. I worked in an operations group which supported the entire computing infrastructure in our organization within the Labs corporate structure. The job was challenging, and very interesting. I worked with some of the best, most talented and motivated individuals I have ever known."
good,"I previously covered my experience at AT&T. The training was superb/phenomenal, the people were great. The products just became antiquated and I found myself at a point where it was time to move forward."
good,"Good place to work, people make the environment. If i wasnt going through family issues at the time i would of stayed. Only problem is the break times giving for the amount of work put in."
good,"When its good its GREAT but when its bad you better have tough skin and understand that those up top couldn't care less of the excuses you may have. On a good day with a high volume of traffic every one hits their numbers but those who are really good sellers maximize on the great days and exceed their numbers. On bad days for example in new Hampshire we had blizzards and worked on those days and the mall could be completely empty but you will still here the push from the top ""we need to get this"" or ""you guys should be doing that"" while they relax at home and if you cant take that pressure this isn't for you. Pay is great being i exceed most of my goals so i enjoy my commission checks able to save lots of cash. Good thing is to me my managers, area manager and DOS were great but you will have those who complain."
good,"Typical workday includes conference calls, managing data in spreadsheets, and communicating with national team mates to solve issues."
good,"This division of AT&T Small Business was sold and renamed, Lucent Technologies, and then again to Avaya.  I no longer know what the name of this division is, if it even still exists."
good,Co-workers at AT&T were amazing. Very diverse environment with people of all different experience level and backgrounds. This was an amazing experience as my first corporate role out of college.
good,ATT D2D was a great experience for me the management was great and they were able to work with my school schedule. Unfortunately our department was closed down.
good,"Whenever I come to work, We are in cubicles, we answer between 15-80 calls a day. I answer calls for AT&T International Care. The hardest part of my job is trying to explain some bills. They enjoyable part is interacting with so many people on a daily basis."
good,Great place to gain some work experience. There is plenty of job advancement oppurtunity at att. I would recommend it for job seekers.
good,"take inbound calls "
good,"""In my role as the Sales Manager of a fast paced and high transaction retail business I lead, develop, and motivate the sales and support staff to achieve business goals and increase revenues while managing & reducing operation costs. "
good,"AT&T provided training, budgets and technology for me to assist my retail stores to be the very best we could be. The training was on a daily, weekly, then monthly basis. After passing our training requirements we were rewarded with bonuses and /or prizes."
good,"I enjoyed this job very much, although, I wish it would have offered more benefits and better pay. I started as a temp and was hired full-time. Later, I found out that I was accepted for nursing school and the hours were conflicting so I had to leave in order to obtain a career"
good,A normal day consisted of interacting with 20 or more different people and being able to problem solve for multiple representatives simultaneously. I was able to greatly improve my multitasking skills as well. The hardest part of my job was the amount of research that would be required to resolve some issues but it was also the most enjoyable part as I was able to assist customers with any concerns they may have had.
good,This has been a fantastic company to work with and quite honestly the one I planned on retiring with.  Since I started in 1998 they have provide non-stop training and mentoring which has allowed me to move all the way from the front lines to where I am today.  The hardest part of the job is also the most rewarding.  Supporting the ever changing demands of our customers.  The most enjoyable is working with people and helping them get to where they want to be.
good,"Great way to start a career, after 16 years i've been surplused. I've learned a lot and plan to continue to learn with a new company."
good,Nice workplace with good leadership and management opportunities. Support from co-workers is always there. The company follows process and employees are required to adhere to all policies.
good,Sales management with AT&T gives you the opportunity to effect both the lives of our customers everyday as well as our internal customers( direct reports). It's a great environment to work with so many different personalities.
good,"Had a great 5 year run with the company. Learned alot, and grew within management. They have plenty of activities to enrich personal life such as Heart Walk and employee engagement groups. Lots of extra training and schooling available if you are willing to put in the time."
good,Working at AT&T can be very stressful but rewarding as a leveraged representative. You will learn various company applications and become knowledgeable of the product line
good,"A typical work day is 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time, but can vary. I have learned a wealth of knowledge from customer care, to billing, to products, to network engineering. The management style is one of support and collaboration. Co-workers are dedicated and supportive. The hardest part of the job is dealing with layers of bureaucracy in order to resolve customer-impacting issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a positive difference for the company and the customer.."
good,"Each day starts with its own set of challenges and no two days are the same. This job is challenging, yet rewarding at the same time. Communication among all the teams and groups involved are crucial. Luckily, my co-workers are on par with their own roles and responsibilities. "
good,day to day sales customer service bill monitoring and troubleshooting.
good,"You get adequate training before being placed in a live environment. There is an opportunity to make all the money you would need. There is a set schedule which rotates every 6 months based on seniority, but there is no room for attendance issues. The work on the phone is very repetitive."
good,"Typical day at work is 8 - 11 hours and very busy which makes the time go by very fast."
good,"Challenging position, continuously met milestones. Great team environment. Awesome training programs."
good,"Care customer issue, Phone sale and accessories, take payments,"

good,"Typical Day: Receiving calls from customers looking for assistance."
good,Fun and exciting place to work. I am just contracted to the company but I love working here!
good,Good Company to work for. Great pay and benefits. Had very little tolerance for attendance and tardies.
good,"worked on B2B application"
good,A typical day at work includes greeting incoming customers and helping them with their needs. UPSELL! UPSELL! UPSELL!
good,I love working with people and getting to know about them. It makes it fun to connect them with new possibilities that make life easier.
good,"The job is good, retention center, need to retain customer, upgrade him with something or sell him something and still let cust very satisfied, what I have learned is that people there has a dedication to do their job, we started giving service to 5 states, then had to be trained for 7 more states, then be trained for 8 states and at last for 2 states total 22 states. The management is bad since they placed a Supervisor that was a very bad salesman always at the bottom of the list missed work a lot because he was from the union, without asking anybody... and there is another supervisor with same conditions she just delegates and screams and we always are threaten t o be fired id you miss the ""call flow"" but the truth is that they handle the cue or the calls, they send it to certain persons already designated by them. The coworker are great we have good environment but you don't know if we are going to see each other tomorrow since if you miss a word in a call (they record all the calls) and suddenly they take a call from 2013 or 2014 and they ""suspend"" you for life so that you have to go and find a job since they left you ""frozen"". The hardest part of the work is tolerating the ""supervisors"" that they push you to the limit and beyond if you do 100, do 200, if you do it, do 300, if you do it, do 400 until never... there is not enough, The most enjoyable part of the job is treating customers resolving their issues that is what it make the day better"
good,"Very big company with big team."
good,"-A slightly competitive relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Needed better communication and organization"
good,As a manager for AT&T it was my responsibility to coach and development of the employees to achieve higher than just average targets.  I would focus on the behaviors and pull the information out of the employee on how he/she would improve or change the behavior to accomplish their goals.  I would then check in with the employee at least once a day to see how the behavior was being implemented.  Then I would listen with the employee to re-enforce that the behavior was changed.  If there was no change or minimum change in their said behavior then I would coach by again pulling the information from the employee as to why.  This coaching style resulted in my team being the top team in the call center. It also resulted in a happier workforce because I would work with the employee together to accomplish their set goals.
good,AT&T is an excellent company to work for.  The growth within the company can tend to be a little slower than some may like.  The trade off is that there is job security.
good,On a typical day at AT&T Mobility; you can expect 30-40 Customer Service calls. The call types range from billing issues to rate plan changes; and everything in between. You get an opportunity to meet some great people that become like family. The atmosphere is great.
good,Fast paced ever changing environment that demands you keep up or get left behind.  Changing company strategy to reposition place in the market.  Need ability to adapt to a new job that is technology related or get left behind...or released.  Co-workers great in your own ecosystem however intra company interaction is very silo-istic.
good,"I started my day looking at the number and types of jobs that were due for the day.  I also looked at the appointment times and changed  priority to jobs due first,  I then had conferences calls with the field supervisors and discussed what we had in work and what the jobs per tech were.  The remainder of the day I checked the load to ensure the tickets were moving in a timely manner.  I techs needed to be moved to other areas to cover the work I moved them.  The last part of the day was another call with the supervisors to advise them of the progress and areas or techs that needed to increase productivity."
good,"While it was still in operations, AT&T Hawaii was a great place to work at and an awesome company to work for. The challenges this job offered was great. I was able to prove to myself that getting to know your customers or clients even if not in person is a great way to teach yourself how to approach people in various ways!"
good,"> Good Company"
good,"Maintained dailys operations, staffing, coaching and training. Achieved mongthly targets."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work in the beginning.  With current market trends quickly turning to non subsidised devices for consumers and an increasing price competitive market, the job has evolved to a switchers market and the company is struggling to maintain year over year growth and meeting Wall St. expectations."
good,I enjoyed helping people. I had a great team but management was horrible and very mean. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
good,Overall a good place to work. Fast paced call center environment
good,"I like being a part of my company,  no day is ever the same. Each day I am presented with new challenges and situations, which really helps me to stay focused and interested."
good,"Typically it is my best start up company."
good,my work day began at 7:00 am and ended at 3:30..Ithe first thing i would do is check for emails received and if there were any voice mails received after i had left for the day..I learned to be more patient as job duties increased as the company was downsizing..I got along perfectly with my co-workers however my supervisor and i had our differences at time..my prior supervisor before the reorganization was awesome and a pleasure to work for..the most enjoyable part was getting along with everyone in our office...it was like family...the hardest part was trying my hardest to make sure i was able to meet the needs of some customers due to we had to rely on workers in Texas for assistance and that wasnt always easy.All in all i totally enjoyed my time there.
good,"Day starts on preparation/strategy on effectiveness and completion of assigned work/job for the day. Short handed routes is given assistance. Whence, a smooth morning jobs be in placed.               "
good,i enjoy working at ATT Overall but local management miss guiding
good,"For certain projects the work day can be very intense and long.  AT&T is a global company which requires countless meetings at a various times due to different time zones.  Support from co-workers, department managers and direct reports very cohesive because teaming is essential to getting the job done.  The most enjoyable part of the job was a happy and satisfied client that recommended your work to others within the department.  Building a strong reputation as a knowledgeable, dependable, resourceful employee is highly valued."
good,I produced reports using Microsoft Excel and Access.  I do not feel like my skill set was used to its fullest extent nor did I receive the training that was necessary to keep me competitive with my peers.
good,good place to work. good pay and benefits. lots of good people work together as a family.
good,"Ensure locations are in compliance with policies and procedures. Communicate to the field changes in operations and procedures.  Conduct fraud investigations. Evaluated company stores on metrics related to inventory, safety, cash, policies and procedures. Prep for audits in various locations on west coast.  Provide feedback on audits to senior level employees. Enjoyed working for AT&T so much to learn from this company.  This company provides growth in many different areas of communication."
good,At&t offers a fast paced ever changing environment for all employees.  There are many trainings on customer service skills and technology.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers.  The most enjoyable part is fulfilling a customer's needs and educating them on services and products.
good,Directv was a great company to work for. I was able to build good business relationships with co-workers around the country.
good,"There is a lot of great co-workers, the work itself starts rough but the longer you are there the easier it becomes. The commission is great when you make sales which makes the job challenging and enjoyable."
good,"I really enjoyed working here while I did!"
good,"Wonderful place to work. Environment friendly. Family Oriented."
good,Fun to work for. Kept it competive.  Management met with you on monthly basis to assure doing job accurately and effective for the customer. Monthly reviews.
good,Training was sufficient and work conditions were satisfactory.
good,"AT&T had a strong disciplinary action method . The easiest part of the job was selling, the hardest part was dealing with management . The people that work there are generally friendly and helpful."
good,"Managed different implemention projects, so status had to be provided on a daily bases. Also had to remove obstacles, which would prevent projects from completing, This position was very challenging because it allowed for me to learn management and telecomunications from all specrums. I worked with a great team, they supported me from A to Z. Dealing with a demanding customer was the hardest thing but I think we all are demanding at one point.Knmowing that at the end of the day the customer waws satisfied with your effort and dedication."
good,"The pay and benefits are what keeps everyone at AT&T. Not the same since Bellsouth went away, the customer approach is all but lost. Co-workers were awesome."
good,"The job itself is a good one - it is paid pretty well & has a good benefit package. A typical work day is pretty standard for a call center job. The management for the most part is supportive & knowledgable. The co-workers I had were for the most part wonderful people who supported one another & I would say were the most enjoyable part of this job. The only negative is that the 3rd party company(Sedgewick) AT&T uses for their FMLA or STD & LTD are crooked. Unfortunately, a lot of good people are denied disability for legitimate disabilities; which if it doesn't cost them their job, creates added stress not needed in a call center environment."
good,Great folks to work with. Fast moving environment. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"Good group of people to work with, a variety of customers to deal with, assist managers when asked, able to learn some new things"
good,I loved working for AT&T. It was an innovative and productive work environment. The hours could get long but the compensations was worth it. The only thing is that with such a large company it can take time to move up.
good,"This job is a good and fun job. It has its ups and downs but at the end of the day I still love it. The employees and managers are very nice and helpful. The hardest part about this job is trying to sell five strategic products, for example: Ipads, tablets, hotspots and whps. The best part of this job is getting to meet new customers and helping them out."
good,"Great place to work and great benefits. Not much to complain about. "
good,"The Company is better at supporting the networking aspect to the companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.. I have seen many products/services that are geared to provide more security and efficiency for customer users."
good,Lots of opportunities but the culture is not friendly to older workers
good,"A typical day at work consist of troubleshooting, diagnosing, and resolving technical issues with users in Tier II Technical support.  Management provided the opportunity to grow and advance to various departments.  The hardest part was waiting 2 1/2 years to become a permanent employee, but the most enjoyable part was the day that I became a permanent employee."
good,ATT provides great benefits and great pay for cellular sales. Working in a retail store nowadays has very little to do with selling cellular devices nowadays as ATT has expanded into the home security and home cable and internet. If you are willing to work the retail hours you will enjoy this job.
good,Working there was a lot of fun. We worked hard and played hard.
good,It's a good place to work that pays well for what you really have to do.  Everything changes daily so nothing remains the same for long.  Work life balance doesn't exist but the company gives you a phone and discounts and pays well.
good,DTV is a great company that provides a variety of high class perks such as free service and medical benefits. a typical day there would allow me to assist customers with their issues no matter what situation with out being micromanaged.
good,I loved working for ATT.  Great benefits.  CWA was wonderful.
good,I loved working there but when the busy seasons hit the management is overly strict and stressed.
good,"This used to be a great company to work for when it was Bellsouth. After AT&T took it over, it has declined since then. The infusion of the ""Premises tech"" position which was created several years ago, they have continued to push technicians to the limits forcing overtime, there is a lot of unhappy employees within the company now. A lot of people just stay there because we all have bills to pay, it really is no longer a family company, just a place to go to during the day where you look forward to leaving and going home at the end. The focus has turned to a numbers game in a huge way. We have all had our numbers to worry about for many years, you will have a certain amount of time to complete a certain task, but the the way they figure these times out are totally a mystery to everyone. Every morning you will have a meeting with all of the techs pointing out the previous days figures, the high tech and low ones.Low numbers means they will push you to get them up, which creates a faster uneven pace for technicians to just worry about them, and creates sloppy work. You will certainly be fired if you don't keep up."
good,Didn't really have a set schedule which really effects family time.
good,"great pay, good management, good work life balance very professional work environment"
good,"A typical work day involved managing assigned accounts Digital Advertising campaigns in order to get contract renewals and upgrades. New business development was required as well, so time management was extremely important. Management was hands off so the role required independence and accountability to be a hunter, set appointments, and conduct presentations on mutli-platform of products. The products that we offered were all digital and included SEO, SEM, Display Ads (CPM), PPC (CPC), Websites, Mailers, Texting Programs, and YP.com listings. The job also required reps to submit and enter signed contracts in Salesforce and other CRM systems in a timely manner. Co workers were always available to assist. The hardest part of the job was the intense travel because the territory was so large. The most enjoyable part of the job was building strategic campaigns for businesses and meeting so many great business owners in which I established a stellar working relationship."
good,"overall it was a beneficial and enjoyable job to have. Unfortunately, it started to interfere with school, and childcare for me."
good,"• Supported warehouse operations by efficiently picking product for retail distribution through RF Scanning"
good,"Currently employed as Manager for entire Northeast Construction in charge of implementing work for outside contractors used by ATT for Line Construction. Days are very busy, workers are pleasant to deal with, have some interaction with customers about complaints."
good,Typical days vary from assignment.  Many teams are geographically dispersed which requires the use of leading edge communication and collaboration tools.  Company in highly competitive space with emphasis on cost controls.
good,The hours of operation are great.  I learned a lot about the telephoney industry. Management could use a little more people training.  Co-workers are great.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the disgrumbled customers after someone else mislead them into buying something that they don't want or didn't need.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the salary.
good,I have learned many things working at AT&T over the past 13 1/2 years.  It has allowed me to learn many things about the wireless industry and grow with the company.  The hardest part of my job is being on top of all the policy and procedure changes and being flexible.
good,"The team leaders and coaches are great, my team mates are cooperative as regards making sure no colleague is left behind in meeting his or her goals or metrics. Everyone work as a Team."
good,I love my position and company I work for. The lack for upward mobility is the only reason I would look elsewhere. I want to move up and better myself in every way possible.
good,A typical day at work with ATT was a busy high stressed day. it was however enjoyable and exciting to work with so many different types of people.

good,My typical day at work was taking inbound calls for telecommunication needs. I learned about new products and services that we could offer to the public. I enjoyed my co-workers because of the long hours we formed friendships. The hardest part of the job was changing managers so much and some of the daily duties weren't consistent. I enjoyed the pay and benefits along with room for growth.
good,Worked in an inbound Call Center answering customer requests regarding AT&T branded products and services. I learned how to multitask in this job. Management & Co-workers became my extended family. The hardest part of the job was other departments being moved out of State. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting an irate customer & making them very satisfied at the end of the call.
good,sales oriented and concentrated type of day. Driven to sell.
good,"I love my co workers - they make my job go by fast. The sales rep position goes by seniority, meaning you get preferences on your schedule the longer you stay with the company. For part timers you have no preference in days off - will always work weekends."
good,"Good pay, good benefits, job security, but lots of stress for being another retail company."
good,"In a fast-paced work environment like AT&T, I was able to enhance my communication skills, ability to multitask, and work very well on a team in order to exceed my goals."
good,Very fair when it comes to work/life balancing. Compensation/benefits comparable to other companies
good,AT&T is a Great Company to work for and offers great Benefits for it's employees.
good,AT&T is a very good company to work for. I accepted the job with any knowledge of Human Resource now I have 5 years of experience under my belt.
good,Company had great benefits and great pay. I learned what hard work was about and how to push myself to prove to show the company that I am an excellent employee. The hardest part of the job is crawling through the attics and trying to install the cabling up there was a challenge. The best part was getting the chance to work with customers face to face and getting to meet all sorts of wonderful people.
good,"Worked in four different offices for this company! This company is the same in every office. Hard work, fast paced telecommunications company that you learn all aspects of. I learned how to multitask better by working in a call center, engineering office, and bill payment center. Co-workers always varied in age and were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was getting laid off from 3 offices, making good money then unemployment. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was that everyone in every office considers themselves family."
good,"I honestly will say this job was one of the most interesting jobs I have ever had. Every day I worked with customers and employees with real concerns, requesting real fixes. I have learned a tremendous amount about internal networking, software, and customer needs. The hardest part about this job is making sure you satisfy the customers concerns in the most professional way possible. Every customer calling has a real concern no matter how big. The most rewarding is knowing your making a difference every day one customer at a time. "
good,"Worked on VIP/Project Light Speed. Installing Fiber to Cross Box. This a dedicated line to customer premise by using fiber optics and copper for the last mile to customer.

good,Great company to work for.  Excellent compensation.  Employee development not the best
good,"As a retail sales consultant your typical day is to be at work on time to clock in, gather your tools (ipad, pens, paper, badge) and head to the sales floor to assist customers. I learned during my year at  my AT&T retail store is that good management equals success. When you have management that cares more about the end of the day numbers rather than what you did to achieve such numbers, the morale will go down. My immediate management at my location was fairly good at the beginning and it got better with the hiring of my second store manger. The assistant managers all emulate what the store manager normally does and says so my coworkers and I normally stay in line. Working a commissioned-based job means that every salesmen is out there for themselves in terms of sales, but in the backroom everyone is helpful into achieving each other's set goals. The hardest part about working this job is the amount of effort you have to put into each customer, which can become overwhelming and exhausting. The most enjoyable part of the this job is seeing all of the new technology rolling out before other people, and also possibly getting a chance to win that technology."
good,"long hours, great pay, ever changing dynamics, and extremely challenging clientel."
good,Great Company. Provided excellent benefits and career opportunities.
good,"While it was Netcom Canada and run by 3 highly competent Execs, things ran smoothly, but once it was sold to AT&T Canada, things went downhill, and ""we"" became primarily a number."
good,AT&T offers great benefits and a world class training program for their employees. They tend to hire managers out of the company though which make it hard to move up even when you do great.
good,"productive and fun working enviroment when you enjoy helping out others. typical day starts by opening store by setting up merchandise and money drawer followed by reviewing inventory and paper work from previous day. No Problems with management or any co-workers at my location, we do a great job of helping each other out. I would hvae to say the the most enjoyable part of the job is when you complete a sell, see their satifaction, then hear them tell you that their experience with you is byfar the best they have had and look forward to returning."
good,"As a customer service rep I answered calls, helped customers with various account questions/problems. As floor support, I handled escalations, answered questions from the representatives, assisted managers. The managers at the call center were helpful and fun to work with, they did the best they could to maintain a pleasant work environment, even with all the pressure they were getting from their supervisors. The hardest part of the day was trying to sell television to a customer that was calling in about a high bill. The most enjoyable part was selling the customer o the tv product."
good,I worked in the mobility call center and it is one of the best employers I have ever worked for.
good,great company to work for. every day is something new. constantly learning new products and pricing. if you are a bit of a tech geek and good with people this is a place you wanna work.

good,Directv is a great company to work for with wonderful benefits.
good,"Good place to work with steady hours and great benefits, I had a terrific manager and still miss working with her, union based and all promotions are based on time, not experience or performance."
good,"un día típico cuando no hay mucha gente , lo que aprendí es mucho por que me desenvolví mucho con la gente y tener mas carácter , con mis colegas bien me llevo bien con  todo tipo de persona en especial en el trabajo, cuando  no sabia vender a la gente y costo mucho , la actitud que siempre había y mejor desempeño"
good,"Company sets the standards for the rest of the industry.  Very rigid but doable, feels almost military, but assures high quality.  Co-workers are very friendly and helpful.  Managers stern but fair.  Most enjoyable part of job is independently working, and being on the move and working outside.  Training is always up to date and top-notch as well as equipment and resources.  Typically a days work is intense and very busy but enjoyable, and rewarding."
good,"Worked very long hours and got routinely pulled in after work, nights, weekends and holidays in order to support my customers. Push back on expedites or unusual requests from customers was unheard of. While customer friendly, it would mean routinely being the bearer of bad news when systems, tools or workloads forced out dates."
good,"AT&T is a very fast paced, typical sales environment.  A typical day consists of helping customers, determining solutions in mobile and home services."
good,"co-workers are great. learned to stay competitive with sales goals management constantly rotated , but i learned to just focus on my own task and stay out of other peoples business as it can get very chatty and rumors. the hardest part of the job is fearing for your job everyday , but best part is again the bonds you build with co-workers it can be a life long thing."
good,I learned to deal with all types of individuals in person and over the phone.
good,"this is nice job, have nice co-worker as well. bad management on this company."
good,A typical day at work for me normally begins at 9am.  I arrive at my cell site location and prep the site for the upcoming migration. I've learned several troubleshooting techniques throughout the time I've been working.  I work alone while talking on a conference call.

good,Fast Pace company easy to advance within but you have to give your blood to do so.
good,"having good management in terms of giving motivation while working, good team members always supportive when ever needed.."
good,"Typical call center environment, taking calls all days. You will learn a lot of things about working for a call center. Also will learn about AT&T products and services. Co workers come and go, but the ones who stay, you will enjoy working with most. The hardest part is taking calls after calls, sounding almost like  robots, same greeting same call flow pretty much. Good for some not good for others, it depends on you. The enjoyable part is knowing you can make a difference for some customers and knowing they counted on you."
good,"Working for AT&T Mobility was fun and exciting but very competitive company to work for. You get the best training to learn new devices that are launching and chances within the company. My position in AT&T was Finance/Customer Service. I performed all operational Inventory, assist management team with maintaining daily merchandising of location while assisting customers with question on service and billing. You get to meet and work with hard, fun and educational individuals who are gifted to be sale rep and extraordinary customer service rep. The only challenges I've came a cross where some customer didn't understand there bills and just need to be explain more carefully to them. Overall its was a pleasure working for AT&T Mobility."
good,I have worked for this company several times over the years and it has always been a good experience.  The money is great if you truly know how to sell.
good,"I've worked for At&t for about 8 years. Its been an up and down experience but overall I would recommend this job to anybody looking for secure, well paid employment that is proportionate to work load."
good,"While being a telesales rep can be a bit repetitive, ATT does a great job of keeping the job from stagnating.  One issue however is the work hours.  Since it is a bargained employment situation, all schedules are based on tenure and it can take a while to reach a level where your work schedule is preferable."
good,"Tell us about:"
good,"My typical day at this company was fairly simple and robotic. i had the pleasures of answering inbound calls as well as making outgoing calls. I displayed customer service to all different types of people. My job i would say was an exciting fun job. For the reasons that each call was different and i never knew what to expect, and it was fun because not only did the customers make my job exciting but the company offered serveral other ways to help ease our minds. Arcade games, ping pong tables, and etc.."
good,"On the whole, AT&T was a good place to work. The managers were quite helpful. If there was something you did not understand, they would immediately help you. I liked to learn new skills, so all I did was ask. The hardest part of the job was not understanding customers, but once that was conquered it was a good job."
good,"The pay is excellent, however the environment is very stressful."
good,A great employer with excellent benefits.  Plenty of career opportunities.
good,Call Center Work. Enjoyable aspects is helping out someone who doesn't know much about how to use the internet or WIFI
good,I worked for 3 years at Yellowbook winning CEO multiple times. I enjoyed learning how to be a hunter which fit perfectly with my personality. I sold yellowpage advertising to small to medium size businesses. The best part of the job was learning how to be a professional sales person. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a very small new business territory.
good,"Loved being a manager and having my own store.  Loved my employees, the customers, and dealing with the administration side of retail."
good,"Work week would start with a tech meeting first thing in the am. Discussion about workload status, scheduled test meets and supply and equipment demand to achieve the weeks objectives. Support field techs with technical support and carrier escalations should they be required. It was difficult to manage my personal work load with tech support at times due to multiple failures occurring with different carriers and locations on separate circuits. However the payoff was getting everything repaired and tested on schedule to allow the completion of the weeks work."
good,Using supplied programs to handle customers' issues and billing needs.
good,"It's not so much that ATT sucked, as Cingular was really fun to work for and provided great pay and benefits."
good,good job fun place to work I liked the job and the people. good benifits
good,"Competitive job which is fun but when you have no customers walking in then you can sell anything. I was great at it and could have moved up in the company but it wasn't for me. If you like technology and people this job is for you. You get to up sell, make commission and talk to people."
good,"A great place to work for young people, the pay, benefits and training are excellent.  You have to enjoy talking to people and have a thick skin to deal with their complaints, but overall casual and fun place to work."
good,ATT was an adventerous and rewarding company to work for. They are focused on teaching training and challenging its workforce.
good,"enjoyed the environment and my coworkers, hated the work life balance, it was pretty much non-existent."
good,"Worked alone and drove my own work truck to install satellite cable. I learned how to proficiently install satellites, co-axle cable to various rooms of houses, how to set up receivers, and run phone lines. It was hard working with mad customers and pay wasn't good. Management was fun and co-workers were friendly. I enjoyed no supervision and having my own work truck"
good,On the phone all day handling all calls. Some customers were hostile and wanted to take your head off but I remained calm in every situation. I listened to my customers and reflected everything they were concerned about ensuring them that I will handle their issues. Often the customers were very apologetic mid way through the call. I never took it personal I just put myself in there shoes. I love to help people and make them smile. It puts joy in my heart.
good,Varying hours and schedule.  Opportunity to broaden knowledge base.  Immediate managers are very supportive.  The travel involved is the most challenging part of the job.
good,"A typical day at AT&T includes helping customers, managing accounts, and managing store inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job is regularly dealing with interesting people.  The hardest part of the job is the irregular retail schedule. Management varies on which store you are at. My store has had great management in the last year or so."
good,"Good money, fun workplace, little room for advancement. Lots of ongoing training, must love people. Great for someone in college."
good,"Had a really good experience with AT&T. Most management and employees were great. Pay was really good and benefits good as well. Can be stressful to meet goals at times, but well worth it when you do meet and exceed your goals. Lots of sales contest to win things like phones, tablets, and other electronics."

good,AT&T is a good solid company to work for with many good benefits for their employers. The most enjoyable part about working for the company is the customers that you get to interact with on a daily.
good,"Managed customer accounts, reviewed and made sure they were on the proper rate plans to benefit them the most monetarily and maximize convenience. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. My initial manager was fantastic at his job and received a well deserved promotion. His replacement and I struggled personally. I approached her on a few occasions, but she was resistant to any resolution. I was one of the top sales persons the entire time I worked there. The benefits were superb!"
good,"the environment was fun , uplifting and friendly. The pay was good and overtime was unlimited. If I did not require surgery, I would still work for AT&T."
good,"selling long distance phone service to people, learned how to communicate with people and learned good people skills, my co workers were great, hardest part of the job was getting to know the job expectations,"
good,"A typical day at work would be very slow paced after the holiday seasons. Co-workers were friendly easy going people, and the management accommodated to life outside of work (IE school schedules; although this is sometimes not guaranteed). The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people get used to their new devices, and because I was the most technologically savvy person there everyone came to me for help. The hardest part of the job was another requirement that was added to our commission structure every other month that prevented some if not all of us to reach our goals to maximize on our commission. Overall, AT&T COR is a great place to work at if this will be your first retail job. The pay is great, and the benefits are top notch."

I received excellent training in sales, product information, and interpersonal skills.  It was a fast paced job where every day was very different.  I learned great organizational skills and time management.  I usually spent some time in the office preparing for sales presentations and doing follow up paper work. I was also responsible for customer satisfaction and service after the sale.  The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting with clients face-to-face and delivering sales presentations."
good,Great work environment if you're constantly looking for change.
good,"Worked here for 10+ years and will say that when this company was AT&T Wireless, there was a lot of career development and growth. Now, it's not really about the employees but more of the numbers. How you can do more for less mentality."
good,Very friendly environment with a lot of opportunity to maintain a career. I achieved the highest audit the store had since opening. Co-workers are very friendly and always ready to help you in anything you need. Hardest part of the job is getting to work around a schedule outside of work.  Other than that it is a awesome place to work and always surrounded by great peers.
good,This was a good team environment.  The sales work was ok...goals changed a lot which made things more challenging.
good,"AT&T is a large telecommunications company with locations both nationally and internationally.  Great company for growth and relocation opportunities, however not many openings specifically in California."

Utilize organizational system databases to troubleshoot and resolve customers inquire and problems.  Receive online billing payments and post funds to customer’s account.

good,Very large company with many locations and product flavors working together to provide everything under the sky.
good,Over the past 13 years at DIRECTV a focus on process improvements which result in cost saving.
good,Overall a good place to work. The pay was great and very good benefits.  There were very strict sales goals and long hours. During busy times we had mandatory 6 day work weeks with 30 minute lunches. It was hard to make plans because you never new when you would get off. Your schedule could say off 8 pm(close) but if people walked in at 7:55 pm you were required to stay. There were times I was there until 11:00pm. But if you enjoy sales and don't mind long work hours it is good place to work.
good,typical day at work includes taking about 50 calls a day and hour break and maybe two 15 minute breaks. I learned a lot about how most phones work and alot of technical attributes as well. I learned how to explain a bill in laymans terms to a customers. My co-workers were very knowledgeable and courteous for the most part. Management did need to be worked on. The hardest part of the job was telling a very nice and respectable customer that there was no way for us to guarantee him/her good service in their area. The most enjoyable part is helping someone get their phone back in working condition for them.
good,"Come in to office in business casual attire. "
good,Work was fast paced. Very little supervision. I learned a lot about paid television. Managment was almost absent from day to day.
good,"Great Pay and benefits, this is a company that is always training you on the next best wireless devices. A solid company to work for."

good,Selling cellular solutions to new and exiting retail and business customers. Handling my existing customers and finding more needs for them as the company rolled out new solutions. I learned how to manage my existing customer base. How to relate more to businesses in the area and grow on them. I also learned that the more down to earth you are in retail the more a customer will remember you. The local store management were great. Higher ups tend to change things often even if it didn't make sense at the store level. The hardest part of the job was doing the same job for almost 6 years and getting paid less for selling more. The most enjoyable part was my store team. Everyone got along and it was a great place to go every day. I also really enjoyed helping customers solve their problems.
good,Provided technical (tier 1) support each day and all day for 12 to 14 intra-company applications.

good,"During a typical day, I would answer between 30 and 50 phone calls a day.   I would assist customers in resolving their problems.   I would talk and type at the same time.   The hardest part was talking and typing at the same time.   The best part of the job was fixing customers problems.   My manager was supportive."
good,"Overall I liked it, but 20 new sales were needed a month to earn commission. It was a tough market competing with Cingular core and franchise stores in the area."
good,Good place to work. Industry is changing which means that there are cuts in pay lately. Benefits are great. Because of the union it is hard to be let go.

good,"I was hired on as a Mid level manager.  Pay was great.  I was successful.  8 months into it, they did a ""management reorg"".  I was low man on the totem pole and they laid me off.  They didn' t eliminate my position, they were reducing positions in other areas and since I was with the company for only 8 months, they decided that I was expendable, despite my growing the channel by 26% year over year.  Management there only looks out for those whom they know.  It is a ""good ole boy"" network."
good,"Excellent, fun, and rewarding... I believe they will continue to appreciate their employees in all of their job markets concerning pay and advancement"
good,era entretenido salir a terreno y compartir pero a veces los jefes nos dejaban sin transporte

good,I have worked for AT&T for 6 years.  I have learned a ton about sales and credit my success in sales to them and their coaching.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction and great co-workers. the hardest part of the job was managing the different personalities that conflicted with the vision of the company. The easiest part getting the daily work done in a timely manner. I learned how to be a more efficient worker and how to work smarter not harder. a typical day at work consisted of balancing books, customer service, ordering merchandise to fill inventory, and managing my team to ensure that all daily task were done."
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. You come in log in to the phone and assist the customer with whatever issue that are calling in about. You learn how to deal with the different attitudes that comes on the line. You also learn how to not take the comments personal from the customer. The management team is awesome everyone pitch in to make the customer happy. My co-workers are helpful. The hardest part of the job is contacting another department in the company that is not trying to help you satisfy the customer needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is making sure the customer happy  before getting off the phone.
good,"I am a person whom likes to be busy. "
good,nice place to work if you want to stay on top of the latest and greatest cell phones
good,Good place to work with good pay and benefits. Learned to handle customers who were not happy. Changed managers every three months which was hard to adjust to.
good,"Not much of a work, life balance.  It seemed as if you worked from sun up to sun down daily no matter if it rained, snowed, or hailed."
good,"I would sit a table and answer phones with my other co-workers. I would troubleshoot lines, direct callers to higher management. The hardest part was staying over on the weekends. I learned how to become a better team player and like the job at hand"
good,"This is a nursing home, and I loved working here, the nurses were great and the management seemed to really care not only about its residents but also about staff."
good,Check orders to sort through day. Connected uverse television service and internet service at homes and business. Managment hard a hard job. Customer locations with hard to access space and old equipment. Overtime

good,"Go to the office get the equipment that I would need for the day.  Look over the work orders and plan my route."
good,"I liked ATT.  It's pretty easy when everyone wants Iphones.  The only true complaint here is the scheduling.  If you are new, expect to work every weekend & holiday.  It's all based on seniority, which sucks.  Other than that, it's a pretty cushy job.  This is perfect for college students."
good,Great learning experience! This was one of my first real jobs that gave me lots of exposure and help built lasting business friendships.
good,"As a CSR within this company I gained customer relation skills, multi-tasking skills, and goal setting skills. The most challenging part of my job was exceeding my personal goals beyond what the company required. The most enjoyable part of my job was resolving customers issues/ concerns with one call resolution.  My co-workers were fairly easy to get along with and were genuine people. My managers were approachable and available when needed."
good,"I learned a lot about the troubleshooting details. The difference between routers and modems, servers, cabling, each role each department has. The different languages you will hear  throughout the day by talking to so many different people."
good,"I loved working for AT&T, it provided a lot of training skills and knowledge of internet troubleshooting... I Love the change it provides and the opportunity for growth with the company... Being in the internet support service has benefits and changes constantly and AT&T will definitely train you and prepare you for anything. "
good,"coming in on time "
good,I was very impressed to the quality of people on every team I worked.  The telecommute policy was stellar.  I found the company to be very focused on work/life balance.  I saw a downturn in some of the benefits but the retirement & investment plans were excellent.  They offered an excellent training program online but the change from salaried to hourly employment made it a bit more difficult to take advantage of that.
good,Work day consists of installing U-verse services and repairing U-verse services.  I learned how to set up IPTV.
good,It is a good job with good pay and benefits.  But if you didn't fit into one of the cliqs around there you were treated unfairly.
good,"A typical day at work always keeping a smile on, making sure your customer are happy and greeted."
good,"Door to door sales"
good,"Retail hours. "
good,"Let me say this first, I wanted to rate 1 star because I really didn't like this job at all. However to be fare not everyone hates working at call centers and this particular call center is incredible."
good,"At&t overall is a good company to work for however, over a few years in retail here everything seems to become routine.  "
good,"Calls came frequently, and we received regular training because promotions and policies were always changing. I learned patience  because calls could be quite challenging when callers were irate. Management and co-workers were laid back and friendly. The hardest part of the job was meeting sales goals when callers wanted to lower their bill, and were reluctant to add new products & services. The most enjoyable part of the job was company functions such as barbecues, picnics, talent shows, and award ceremonies."
good,I would take technical support calls for roughly eight hours a day and I would assist in resolving many of them to the best of my abilities. I learned a lot about the call center experience. It's not as easy as everyone thinks it is. The management was very good and very helpful with many things. My co-workers were equally as helpful. I think the hardest part about the job was the fact that no one seemed to want to cooperate in order to resolve their issue. The most enjoyable part was the employment interaction. The company did make you feel welcome.
good,Great people to work for and the management I was under was great.  Unfortunately it is mainly just contract work now a days.
good,"AT&T is a good company, you will be able to advance after 1 year and 8 months with in the company, I work in Tech support in detroit mi, it is good, i love tech support, but some things are a little harsh such there metrics and also they way they have us *sell stuff* but, we dont get the money that a sales agent would get, and the way they make it better is by saying we are suggesting things, but at that same time we are basically measured on if we sell it or not "
good,"A typical day here is brainstorming new ideas for our annual event, like new ways to engage with our customers. Writing emails, editing newsletters, writing social media posts and pranking each other."
good,love being around the people there management is good to a certain extent learned so much about the wireless industry and how things work 
good,"llegando al trabajo tenia que realizar el aseo de la oficina y a la vez atender a clientes que fueran llegando, relizaba facturas y pendientes  de contabilidad y de la misma oficina, realizaba el cierre de venta, lo complicado era lidiar con los lavadores"
good,"Work is great, day to day there is always new things to learn. Everyday is an accomplishements. Co workers are great and fun to work with, just the work stability, they are laying off people this coming Jan 2014 and it's just sucks to know, but overall company is good."
good,Was able to do my job with little to no supervision.  Learned many different areas of the company.
good,"Typical day- Very Busy"
good,I wasn't with AT&T long enough due to conflict with School and scheduling. While I was there it was very awkward to be a manager working with people who are reps and have way more knowledge than you also a little intimidating. I will say the pay made up for all of that...I was getting paid more than I did in the military with amazing benefits. I do sometimes wish I stayed a little longer and just put school on hold.
good,this company was able to teach me how to muti-task. working with about 5-7 systems at one time while noting and staying conversational with the customer help me to better my work ethics.   
good,Install U-Verse cable and other services. The most learned is signal flow and how to troubleshoot. Management is very lackluster and do not care why you don't meet their expectations only that you need to. Co-workers leave sloppy work for you to come behind and interferes with your own numbers.  
good,"Excellent position for working with people, although restrictive due to high pressure environment for sales."
good,I worked there for 3 years in the teir 2 department and showed up for work one day and over 60 people were standing outside one man stated they were all laid off. Upon walking inside they 5 of standing there were also laid off. Over 200 people with in a couple months time span were laid off. It shows that their CEOs are more worried about not reducing their spending and dropping a mercadies per month then to keep some families with dependant children employed.
good,"As a senior Functional Tester: My duties included performing full System Lifecycle Management (SLM) for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) application software maintenance and new system releases; conducted functional system test support to include System Acceptance Testing, security testing and vulnerability scanning, Section 508c compliance testing, and test automation.

good,"I enjoyed working at At&t Mobility.  It was hard work, and long hours.  The people I worked with were great.  The hardest part of the job was being able to manage all of the different jobs that were on my plate and to show progress.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing all that I had accomplished in such a short time."
good,"I began my service representative job talking with customers regarding their phone service, placing repair tickets, offering sales options to better their service.  The job was interesting because of the different types of people you come in contact with and every call was different.  Management was not a problem if you did what was expected of you."
good,A typical work day usually concludes begins by setting your goals for the day. I learn about the new products and services company offers. The management is there to help with your transactions and are willing to help you achieve your goals. Co-workers are great and we work as a team. The hardest part of the job is meeting all the quotas for the end of the month in each category.
good,"handling billing questions and issues for customers, as well as fixing broken phones"
good,Was a pleasurable working experience. Also worked with 4 other clerks and they were a joy to work with.
good,AT&T is a pretty decent company to work for but the union environment only rewards longevity not expertize or accomplishments.  The day started with customers lined up outside the door and it was a very diversified job.  You had to be successful with customer facing problems and often I would explain billing issues or teach them how to use the phone along with running complicated systems simultaneously.  The managers were a great asset.  The hardest part of the job was trying to balance all the people who wanted free customer service issues and the need to meet the sales quotas.  The most enjoyable part of the job was happy customers leaving the store satisfied.
good,One of the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers and seeing the look of satisfaction on their faces as I walk them out of the door of the store!
good,A typical day at work is when my team sit together 30 minutes before the store open to come up with a new strategy on how to make the day more successful than the day before. It's fun and exciting because each one of us come up with an idea to increase profit and provide better customer service.
good,"answer 50+ calls per day answering a variety of questions regarding billing and service questions to mid-sized customer base. Provide problem resolution and offer additional products and serivces to address customer needs."
good,Wonderful work environment. They care about the employees and ensure you have all the resources you need to be successful.
good,"Call center was always busy during my shift(2nd). AT&T did everything very specifically. You were required to take your 2-15 minute breaks and you 30 minute lunch, and could not be anywhere near your cube during those times. Management was fun to work with."
good,The company continues to evolve. With the advent of digital technologies AT&T is constantly redefining of its possibilities as a company. There is little time for engagement in the company provided training as the work load is constantly develops. Management use of metrics and certain processes don't truly define the actual work environment. Obstacles tend to be self-inflicted by the lack of better equipment. Technicians and in a transition phase too as the company redevelops. The new technicians are required to do more and are under constant scrutiny. Most newer individuals burn out from the lack work-life of balance and robust physical demands both internally and externally.
good,Fast pace environment. Learned various software testing practices. Enjoyed learning new things daily.
good,great paying retail company to work for. co-workers are young and enthusiastic. AT&T has many different departments sometimes not available to call at all times. 
good,The Company is overall a good employer. however sales is at times a tough job in todays economic situation and has caused excessive stress lately with sales quotas continuing to be raised. 
good,"We would have 30 minute meetings, and have 5 minutes after that to collect information on our Job, call the customer and leave. Employees would usually use old decrepit lines in the house, and when they fail they get a ""repeat"", which is bad for you and the company. I would install new cat5 lines to all parts of the system and never get a repeat, but it would take longer and was much more reliable. At the end of the day we had 15 minutes to clean, restock and organize our vans. We also had to call back all of our customers, which we always had to do on our own time. We got unionized, but we got a 50 cent increase in pay, more rules and it was even more about time management and money, then it was about customers. Threatened to get fired if you don't complete work on time, so you can't follow the rules to do the job correctly. There's a lot of bad work out there."
good,"Good management but limited ability to advance to senior roles.  Highly bureaucratic but if you know how to play the system, you will do well."
good,"Ample oppurtunitys to advance. They really promote growth in this company. If you work hard, you will reap good benefits."
good,I enjoyed my position and its duties of handling customers calls and interacting with the nation. I learned that you cannot please everyone and not every is to be pleased. The most enjoyable part of the position was the freedom and the hardest part of the position was failing to meet my own personal expectations. 
good,"As an employee for Direct TV one must know the available packages and knowledge of channels, promotions, and that of other competitors as well, I enjoyed meeting and talking with new people every day. "
good,"The call center is a very comfortable place to work. Management and co-workers were are very friendly and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was meeting all the categories of the monthly quotas.

good,under / over houses.. pulling and fixing cables.. program tv and teaching customer how to use there new install..
good,"I enjoyed all of my co-workers and management! A typical day at work for me was coming to my desk, immediately pulling up everything on my computer to assist my customer and becoming available to them in our queue. There wasn't anything hard about my job except the hours. I have small children and I wouldn't get off until 9 o'clock and I also had to work Saturdays. My daughter, at the time she was 3 months, was admitted into the hospital and I could not take off work to stay with her so I had to leave her at the hospital alone. That was the only thing that I didn't like about at&t. I learned a lot while I was there. I learned how to ease over angry customers by keeping a good tone of voice and showing my concern, I learned how to troubleshoot internet issues, and use a wide variety of internet programs. One thing that I enjoyed most at at&t was my manager and my team. They were all great!"
good,mid level management was good

A phenomenal experience that I will always treasure."

good,"The old Bell Labs has very good job security. However, management and co-workers were not very considered of others."
good,"work is extremely easy, but can lack challenge. The internal operations are a bit of a mess, each department is very limited making it hard to get things accomplished in a timely manner. Management, are nice but can't really write people up due to the Union so some employees that lack integrity can get away with what ever they wont. My join the union, it's weak and they aren't helpful and it's very expensive. They also have layoffs every 3 months."
good,High emphasis on customer service and ever-changing sales. Love my co-workers.
good,"A great company to work for with excellent compensation and benefits. As expected of a Corporation of this magnitude, there"
good,"On the road alot training on our new products, made sure that the stores I went to had the correct POS materials up, if not I had to look for it in their store and had them put it out"
good,"I have been on the Non-Management and Management side of the company. As a non-management employee it was rewarding and the interaction with other employees, vendors and upper Management was fine. I promoted to Management and it was very different from being a non-management employed. It was rewarding in the sense that you work with your employees, trust is built with them. On the other hand, dealing with the Union, upper Management and employees that caused unnecessary situations in the workplace can be trying. When considering Management with the company you have to dedicate your time over and beyond a normal days work."
good,Talented people who are fun to work with. Lots of opportunities give the size.
good,"Typical call center atmosphere, easy policies and procedures to follow, as long as you can deal with people calling you every name in the book for something you haven't done then job is fine, pay makes it worth it."

good,"- typical day started at 3 pm (pretty late, huh?)"
good,"Loved the customer service part of the job. Started selling home products and it was too pressurized for me. Quota was high and you got written up if you didn't meet the monthly sales goal, and weren't supposed to take no from the customer. Loved my team and coworkers. Loved assisting the customers with the issues they called in about."
good,"Highly competitive working environment, which can be very fun at times. A lot of corporate politics involved with advancement and oftentimes talent is overlooked due to this. Appearance standards are very strict, scheduling is not as flexible as it used to be. Excellent compensation, excellent benefits, however."
good,Working with customers to ensure the proper functioning of their mobile devices. Assisting with technical or billing inquiries. Being able to assist customers and knowing that every call is a challenge was something to look forward to daily.

This definitely helps in numerous ways. I work with a fantastic team. Hardest part is coordinating with different teams in different timezones sometimes."
good,It was overwhelming with all the layoffs.. but I was lucky I was part of GEM.
good,Handing technical issues and account information for directv customers via incoming calls. Job provided great management and qiality training.

The management level were very helpful and cared for the team. My co-workers were fun to work with and we tried our best to help each other to accomplish our team objectives.

I have learned a lot about the different devices that are available to the customers. I was never a person that was hung up on gadgets and devices but AT&T has the most wonderful phones, ipads, and service for these devices. I enjoy interacting with others that are doing the same thing that I am. For the most part everyone who works for AT&T are very open, honest, and friendly about passing on great advice. The management department could be a little better about troubleshooting with the reps but for the most part AT&T is a great place to work. I absolutely love what I do. Nothing makes me happier than when I hear the joy in a customers voice after that have had their issue resolved or their questions answered."

I learned a lot of sales technique and AT&T such as value positioning vs price, overcoming sharp rejection and quickly position value to customer based on what they told me. Management was not harsh and always coached to help very rarely performed write ups and believed in coaching first mentality, overall management was good. The most enjoyable was working with customers and my co workers. The most challenging would be the constant performance monitoring daily."
good,"I enjoyed working for this employer, really knows how to treat their employees and customers."

It is a very faced paced center with little room for error. I deal with very sensitive information and meet all sales goals that are given to me. I have been able to act as a floor lead which enables me to work with my peers and directly with managers. The joy I get is knowing I can help our customers and give them a sense of security. The difficult part of the job is dealing with the frustrated customers. 90% of our customers that call in are angry or hostile. We are the ones they first talk to so they assume it's our fault. Also it is tough working a later shift and working Saturdays. I work with a great group of people which makes the day go by fast.
good,At day at AT&T consists of logging into your computer and handling sales/retention calls till your shift ends. You have monthly sales quotas and retention rates that you must meet t. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the irate customers when your hands were tied and you couldn't help them.

I also served as team lead for new employees needing help with the different operating systems. Management was just as stressed as service reps which made some days hard but mostly enjoyed working with them. My co-workers were great. I made a lot of life long friends at AT&T which began as BellSouth. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the sales goals required by the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to people from all around the country and getting to see my friends everyday."

good,"Fast paced sales environment, frequently changing technology, great pay and solid benefits."
good,"Technical environment, not much offered to de-stress. I learned the make-up of a telephone switch and its inner-workings. My co-workers didn't posses the same work ethic values I had. The hardest part of the job was the lack of team work I experienced."
good,Typical day at work is approving vendor bills/contracts/ledgers. Co-workers are professional. The hardest part of the job is coordinating with various departments to get a satisfactory result. Most enjoyable part of the job is achieving success in overall job performance.

good,"For 17 years I reconciled and balanced accounts, performed journal and ledger entries and made payments (ACH) for millions of dollars in Corporate green paper transactions."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of a morning meeting discussing target goal for the day to ensure all reps hit their monthly goal of sales. When reps had trouble or needed that extra push to close sale I would come in offer extra incentive or additional support to make customer make decision in store. Had to report directly with district manager and helped come up with ideas for district wide meetings. Weekly conference calls were also part of my duties. Had to discuss goals and devise tactics to improve sales throughout district. I managed 25 reps at store level, very exciting work enviornment, face to face interactions with customers. Hardest part of the job was the sometimes unbalance between work and a personal life but compensation made up for it. The most enjoyable part for me was the interaction with customers, providing them a service but also making them feel appreciated for their business. Also having an opportunity of implementing my ideas to drive more sales into our store and making our store top 3 in region every month."
good,You are the face of the AT&T corporation while working as a sales rep. The training is a month long and the management's compensation is based on the performance of their team. These two items help ensure the success of the sales rep.
good,"I enjoyed working with all the different types of customers that would call in about there accounts. And although there were some upset customers about previous issues, I would do my best to resolve them, I tried very hard to make every contact a good one. I do believe they had good business sense, but pleasing the customers is also very important."
good,The majority of my day is devoted to prospecting new and existing customers. This is done via cold calling and visiting territories. My main goal is to establish a trusted business partnership for acquiring new clients as well as grow existing business with my current clients. There are always account issues and paperwork which needs to be handled on a daily basis. I take care of these matters early in the morning or later in the evening (time management). My main priority is generating sales.
good,I enjoyed working outside and interacting with people. I learned low-voltage wiring and became comfortable working from heights. The hardest part about the job was not being able to help customers due to service order issues. Co-workers was very helpful and diligent. Management kept my learning up to date.

good,A typical day at work consist of handling inbound calls from customers regarding their internet/cable issues. I learned to use multiple computer software and how to trouble shoot technical problems. Management was very understanding and very helpful and very easy to talk to. My co-workers were fun and professional. The hardest part of the job was to learn not to talk technical terms with customers. You had to be able to break down simple terms so that they could get a full understanding of your instructions and how to operate their equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work enviroment was professional and comfortable. There was up to date equipment and technology. It was a great learning experience that able me to utilize my skills in future projects or endeavors.
good,Great benefits and compensation. Hard work pays off.
good,"Overall it is what a corporation is, co-workers was great management was okay. With a corporation the advancement wasn't available as much but had great training ."
good,In a typical day I would install on average 2 homes a day with 3-5 tv recievers internet and phone and repair on average 2-3 homes.
good,"A typical day at work is making out-bound phone calls all day and being rejected. I learned to be patient and the skill of customer service. Mangement was typical for a job like that, they pay close attention to the calls volume. The co-workers all had their own areas and there was not much communication between one another because of the demands of the Job, only during lunch break did we socialized."
good,"Nice perks, great working conditions, amazing advancement opportunities"
good,Fortune 500 company. Room for advancement they promote from within. Pay is pretty good could be better. Sometimes sales goals be tough depending on your work location but never not manageable if you're motivated. You can expect lots of over time regardless of what management says. They are always understaffed.
good,"A typical day at work envolved reviewing previous days results. Conduct side x side rep observations, hold coaching sessions, facilitate calibrations. Observe for training gaps develop continuous training based on gaps. Senior management is goal orientated and encourage open communication. My co-workers all bring different strenghts to the table and we work as a team to accomplish goals. I am passionate about training and development so there was nothing hard about the job, sometimes the hours were long but only to ensure projects were accomplished timely. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing someone's eyes light up because they understand a process or concept based on my teachings. That was the most gratifying for me."
good,"Worked on the 4G LTE project. The technology was new and I always had something to learn every day. The job environment was really good. Tested the cell sites everyday, work was mostly on field. Had to supervise the tower crew if any problems with the cell site. Hardest part of the job was to trouble shoot with the swapped sectors of the site and with the low uplink and downlink speeds. The most enjoyable part was to practically see the tiniest of theoretical fundamentals that we learnt at college."
good,"This was a very challenging job as well. I've always had strong phone skills, so that helped me here. The challenge was the amount of information that we were responsible combined with back to back irate customers. I did everything from paying a customers bill for them to saving them from going to Comcast for their tv and internet needs. I learned a lot about the industry. I also learned a lot about the value of having a good income. Money allows a person to impact the environment around them. This is simply amplified when you have more money. My co workers were great, although most of the time we were talking to our customers. The hardest part of my job"
good,i enjoyed the company for many reasons but i learned alot of the skills i posses now. Customer service was number one and learning the how to assist angry customers while maintaining good quality scores.
good,"The knowledge that i recieved at AT&T is second to none. The training was outstanding in the first five years working for AT&T, but in the last five years there was practically no training. There was never any movement between departments, and once a person retired or left the company that position wasnt backfilled."
good,while i was at at&t.. the best part of my job was the co workers.. great benifits... schedules was ok..
good,"Troubleshooting headends at apartment complexs. AT&T had contracts to provide DIRECTV or DISH system to the complex. I covered an area ranging from Santa Clarita, CA. to Chula Vista, CA. The hardest part all day traveling on the freeway. The most enjoyable was the customers smile when their programming came back on. I was the most senior technician."
good,Great benefits and people to work with. They offer equal opportunities for anyone. Train you to your best.
good,"This job overall is a great job while working for a top Fortune 500 company such as AT&T. My typical day at work involves cold calling small to medium size businesses to sell advertising in the Yellow Pages, and Yellow Pages.COM. Typcially my day starts with a daily office meeting going over the goals that we want to reach for the day. Afterwards I am on the phones from 8:30-5pm reaching out to existing advertisers and non-advertisers."
good,"My day started with making sure that I had all my tools I needed to work with and that they are working correctly,helping my coworkers to setup their systems so that they will be ready to assist members with their inquiries, in this job i learned how to work with the management and clients to ensure the members have all their concerns met to have a memorable experience to make a lasting member, the hardest part of this job was not to be able to complete the task at hand , the most enjoyable part of this job was each time a member told me that I helped them with all their concerns."
good,"Overall the company is a very good place to work for. Alot of room for growth and training is provided upon request for other positions. Longevity is key for this company and as you grow the company grows. Management is ok but could be alot better as far as dedication, showing how to move up the chain is not communicated well. Good people work for AT@T, the hardest part of the job was the weekly/monthly quotas. Discipline was handed out every three months which brings on pressure to keep your job. The most enjoyable part of the job were the benefits: bonuses, outtings, and incentives At@T provided. Its also a place where you could retire from."
good,"the most enjoyable part is knowing that your hard work is rewarding..I have learned an enormous amount about phones, computers, tablets and how the wireless industry works...Coworkers are very competitive and have exciting personalities..the hardest part is scheduling and life balance because it is retail so hours are pretty much all day"
good,"A typical day at AT&T included many service issues, ie: billing problems or questions, technical trouble shooting on wireless devices, offering and selling the many products AT&T offered. The most enjoyable part of this position was solving a customers problem and assisting them with their concerns. This was a fun, face paced environment most of the time. I learned to become more open minded toward the diversity of employees and customers we interacted with on a daily basis. Management was not consistent and did not follow through on goals, commitments and company policies."
good,Good place for a career! Has great benifits good people good place to network
good,"always ready for something new as far as dealing with people, places , and installs"
good,"DirecTv is a great employer with great benefits. However, the only downfall are the required hours."
good,"In it's heyday, this was probably the best company in the world to work for and one of the best sales jobs on the planet but because of technological changes the company has been cannibalizing itself for sometime."
good,- still remember a job where 2 techs were already without success. I spent extras hours but was able to fix the issues and made a whole house happy.
good,"One thing that i've learned is that you must always strive to do better. If you hire into this company not expecting to go any where or progress, that's exactly what will happen. However if you desire to advance and find a career working here, there are people and resources available that will assist you in your journey. The training you receive at AT&T is respected around the globe."
good,"Very challenging position, Gained great experience working with customers with a broad base knowledge of services offered by company."
good,A typical day at work for me was to dispatch/over see 125 technicians from various locations through the San Ferando Valley. The management team was always on hand and ready to help if needed.
good,Servicing customers while educating them on the benefits of the device.
good,Compete to beat daily sales goals.
good,I worked for HP for 2years in a call center and it was the main reason i choose to be a technical person. the things I learned though training there help me going forward
good,"I gained a wealth of knowledge working for AT&T for many years, it was a rewarding career and I look forward to their continued success."
good,Use of Agile Methodology to perform testing on mobile applications. Wrote test case based on the application requirement.
good,"There are benefits to working in a call center. The dress code is relaxed, and the culture is very easy going. It is very difficult to get time off, trade shifts, and earn a promotion. The attendance policy is draconian, and scheduling is stiff. In my opinion advancement and promotions have been difficult, and the scale does not match the reality of actual work. Opportunities for advancement are few a far between."
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T as a Small Business Representative in the Mobile Sales unit. The pay was great! Benefits were great! The people were great! Managment was OK at the store level yet it seemed that they were a bit lax.
good,"I worked for the contracting firm who placed me with AT&T for 4.5 years. As long as they have work to do it's great, but the second they see you as expandable, you will be let go."
good,AT&T good place to work. Felxible hours and great benefits.
good,ATT Mobility is a work from home opportunity that gives me the freedom to set my own schedule around my current school schedule.
good,"Professional enviornment, productive but schedules are not flexible considering where it is located."
good,"Great Company to work for. So many perks (pay, benefits, vacation.) Managers were very nice especially my last manager. AT&T makes it a bit hard when you are a parent, their attendance policy is very strict."
good,Directv is a great place to work if u dont mind having to change your schedule every 6-9 months. The pay is good and you get to know a lot of different people. Also if you can stand changes in the workplace every month then you should adjust fine.
good,AT&T pays you really fair in return for hard work. If you aren't willing to bleed AT&T colors 100% then it wont be a good match.
good,a very pleasant enviroment to work with. great team environment. one of the best places that i worked.
good,Very fun and interesting place to work. Compensated very well.
good,AT&T is a great place to work. Its been good to me and my family over the past 10 years. I am blessed to have a job with such a great company.
good,At&t is a good company to work for. They offer great benefits and pay for employees.
good,Working for a Fortune 10 Company was a great experience. AT&T has been on the cutting edge of wireless technology for decades.
good,"This is a good company to work for, Good benefits and lots of overtime"
good,I loved working for AT&T. I was taught what customer satisfaction truly means. The family atmosphere was rewarding too. However as with a lot of work environments it has changed.
good,Good work environment with a lot of young people and a chance to have fun with technology.
good,My job doesn’t exist anymore for AT&T employees  I was the last company employee in the maintenance and property management department  it is now outsourced
good,"Compensation became lower over the years due to online sales taking over brick and mortar but still overall a great place to work, learn, progress, and grow."
good,"Best life experience , great benefits , good working environment and they have all the modern equipment needed to get the job done right."
good,Depending on what job you're doing your day can range from steady to over whelming.  Job roles would change about every 6 months to 1 year based on the needs of the business.  They provided an atmosphere for employees to have fun during break and lunch hours. They constantly have meeting/conference calls. The best part of job was the folks you worked with.
good,"Can be a great place to work, but recent changes to job function and standard business hours are added to decline of employee satisfaction. We are an offline support group, but are being forced to switch back to a standard call center. Used to have business hours from 5am-7pm to help staff work around traffic, but new business hours are 7:45am-7pm making for a longer morning commute."
good,Definitely a sales focused job but can be great if you get a good manager to help ya. Just make sure to focus on the customer experience and the res will just follow.
good,"I worked for this company for many years.   I saw it change from being extremely people oriented to being more about the bottom line.   This change, of course,  was necessary to keep up with industry demands."
good,"Customer sales and service is a fast-paced, highly stressful position. This wasn’t the right fit For me, but if you are sales oriented- you would be great."
good,"There was so many aspects to the job, I wouldn't be able to give an honest overview. Sales, customer service, physical aspects of the job are one of the most important."
good,"At&t gave the skills & importance of customer service, did learn a lot and I learn that I did not wanted to worked in retail any longer. Company does give you the opportunity to have a career and grow in it."
good,Very fast paced and great place to work. Some days can be very stressful but still they are very rewarding. Pay and bonus structure is good and future is good.
good,"It is a great company to work for, has good benefits, pay rate and incentives. You will feel like you spend most of your time at work, great if you are single and do not have kids. It will come down to what your priorities are job and money or family and friends. I would recommend this job to others."
good,I learned more about phones and directv and what there was to offer. I got to deal with the public and wats to handle them. I really enjoyed getting the experience.
good,Good benefits are available and company discounts for services such as AT&T mobile. Company invests in volunteering and supporting not for profit organizations.
good,"AT&T is a good place to work if you don't mind working a lot of hours and being away from your family. Advancement and benefits are the best, management is micromanaging style which brings the stress level up."
good,A great call center office environment with advanced office technologies.  The most enjoyable part of the job is providing excellent customer service.
good,"I learn how to coach my reps."
good,You must be very flexible and willing to relocate when needed. They provide lots educational opportunities which is a must have to keep pace with the ever changing culture.
good,"The best company I have worked for in my entire working career. At&t is innovative and will be a company to watch for in the year 2020 and beyond. Great dental benefits, Pension, 401K etc. Very diverse all inclusive culture."
good,"I think this is a very innovative in educational company that is very fair and diverse."
good,Manage Operations- Hardest part of job is finding solutions and finding the right people to assist.  The peers I work with are great and the benefits in company are great.
good,Part of large team learnt lot of group dynamics and interaction. With Multiple datacenters spreed across cloud and in-house got unique experience working with distributed teams and efforts
good,"Very busy work day"
good,Loved job at Directv just hate that h as d to end once it was bought out by ATT. Was very convenient work at home and wouldn't mind another part time job similar to this one from home.
good,"Interactive environment, provides professional growth.  Work does get demanding based on business need. Teamwork is highly encouraged.  The company constantly innovates."
good,"Work environment was very stressful at times.  Customers were anxious and many were impatient and frustrated with wait time.  But overall, employees were content and management was very supportive."
good,"Innovate company, with good benefits for employees, job growth opportunity.Excellent training in Customer Services.Always at the forefront of technology."
good,"My time at At&T was very productive. With the right mindset, anyone can move ahead within the company. You'll enjoy the repetitive support that you give to the customers."
good,"Flexible Hours and work location"
good,You have to drive around all day even in bad weather managers are super strict and expect you to meet sales goals no matter what. Most fun part was getting to set up all the latest phones and seeing how happy and exited the customers are.
good,"Since I've started working here, I have liked the people at my store. You get to learn a lot of people and it really helps with networking. You are given the tools to succeed. However, I felt as if we didn't have a voice to upper management on some things."
good,Working at AT&T was ok I was great at my job but it took a lot out of me to constantly perform and not much if at all was given for taling time off and thus was too much
good,"Great place to work, solid pay and decent hours, depending on your job title and location.  Excellent opportunities for growth, when there is hiring.  Very strict on presence."
good,Decent company with good people. The managers are under a lot of pressure to make numbers and a lot of them don't last long but once you get a good manager if you do your job they will have your back. I would still be employed their however the union and I did not get along because I would not join and they did everything they could to get me out.
good,AT&T was a good company to work for at the time. Pay and benefits were great. Management style not so great. It was more like everyone out for self.  Management had a lot of expectations but did not lead by example.
good,"Pros: "
good,"I got transferred to IBM as contractor working for IBM last September"
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed working at AT&T they pay well, offer great profit sharing bonuses, & a lot of vacation days.  Downside  Is that even with 20 years you still have to worry about being laid off.  I had to move to Oregon to maintain the wages I was accustomed to rather than being laid off  are taking a demotion to a lower paying position.   But after living in Portland I realized I had to come back to Chicago. Portland is not my kind of town"
good,Productive and growth oriented company.  There are opportunity to grown vertically and horizontally. Cross functional team leadership opportunities available.
good,Overall great experience would till be there if it wasn’t for the very rude customers that you got time and time again. Always something to snack on clean facility and good culture
good,Good place to work at.  Would tell other people to work here if provided they had to skills for the job requirements.  The managers that I had during my time at AT&T were good and would help you if the need  came up.
good,"Met lots of great people. They emphasize training and development. "
good,With any retail environment there will be challenges but as long as you have a great team and positive attitude when you go to work you will succeed in this company.
good,"I absolutely love the company I work for! AT&T really does take care of you. The only thing that sucks about AT&T is the point system. You have 8 point for the year if you go over that you are fired. It’s ridiculous to be honest. I see a lot of good hard working people be let go because of this. Now, management on the other hand.... we have managers moving to different stores all the time. Especially when we find really good managers, and it’s hard to see them go. Now there are a few managers in here that are absolutely horrible and just don’t know how to be a manager and just use that title name to take advantage of everyone. . Other then that, this company is a very good company to work for!"
good,"A typical day on the job is helping customers w/ their service. It is always nice to help another. I have learned that empathy goes a long way and the feeling of support is a lovely situation. The hardest part of the job is not always having an immediate solution for a customer, and the best part is when you have been able to assist a customer and they leave w/ a smile."
good,AT&T was a productive work place with different challenges.   I learned how to work with clients in different places in the county and support staff in different parts of the world.   A typical day was filled with meetings and following up on changes and issues that arise the night before.  The workplace culture was good and I was able to voice my opinion without any concern of retribution.   The hardest part of my job was being able to totally satisfy the client and at the same time maintain the data on that the client uses.   The most enjoyable part of my jobs was the chance to troubleshoot issues and to provide a solution.
good,it was a very good place. management could be better benefits were good. would i work their again yes the people are nice as well. They give 45 min lunch and 2 15 min breaks very lovely
good,"Good energy, Customers are first Priority."
good,"I worked for some form of AT&T Wireless and Mobility and my experiences have been great, good and bad at different times, depending on project work and team, current boss.  Right now the climate is pretty stressful, as they have been having regular layoffs at least twice a year and sometimes more for the last few years.  "
good,"working toward goals pertaining to future accomplishments and services for success of the company and customer satisfaction , learned a lot about how technology works and how it makes work , businesses , entertainment , and telecommunications much easier to function at a much better and advanced pace. The hardest part of the job was being able to do your job in a set time because of other construction workers sometimes not having prepared an area where work was to be performed or not performed that prevented us from finishing our job ontime. The most enjoyable part was feeling good about providing good quality service to happy customers safely and a good feeling about accomplishing goals."
good,It was an amazing job I love working from home gave me the opportunity to be a stay-at-home mother with lots of flexibility. I work better without people I like the fight that I didn't have someone standing over my head. Paid training enhance on if I needed it.
good,"worked with diverse personalities and cultures and learned to be organize and to prioritize my workload to meet multiple deadlines, had a great managers who did not micro-manage"
good,It is a very relaxed but at the same time it could be stressful and fast paced. Management will be good with you and help out during struggles but will hold you accountable tp monthly goals
good,At&t used to be a great company to work for.  They used to care for its employees.   Now its all about its shareholders. I feel lucky to have had a secure job for twenty-seven years.
good,"Conditions got worse, as did the fee schedule, each time the company was sold. Management was a decent bunch of people. nnn nnnnnn nn nnnnn nnnn nnnnnn nnnnnn."
good,"Working for AT&T was great, they are union based until you get into management. They have paid time off and the starting pay is good! It is a fast paced sales job, so you have to be on your A game each day."
good,Company pays ok but doesn’t have much room for employees to grow at least in my position. Has the freedom of no one watching over your shoulder but they GPS on your trucks and can tell what your looking at on your devices.
good,Good for beginners and can improve your communication skills. Good benefit. Employees in retail change very fast. As well for management. Less consider about customer services in retail.
good,"Everything at ATT is done at scale, if you want to work on big long term projects this is the place for you. They're still working on redefining themselves, the wireline telephone company attitudes have been hard to shed but there is real progress."
good,"I enjoyed my 19+ years at AT&T. I learned a lot about network architecture and server deployment. The culture at my location was great, Very community oriented. I appreciated the very relaxed dress code."
good,The company is contually growing through acquisition.  There was always a new product / technology to learn and this made the company more appealing to customers.  This was the best part and at times the hardest part as there were so many systems to maneuver.  I liked the culture in that we were paired with an inside sales counterpart.  We were a team and backed eachother up continually
good,"Overall good experience, but the management needed some work."
good,"Good manager and a great team to work with."
good,challenging workplace fast-paced; great technology transfer; extensive training; great peers to work with; great benefits; culture conducive to advancement
good,"I was a wire technician. I was hired as a temporary worker for Project Lightspeed. My job was to climb poles and optimize and refurbish the telephone connections to customer's houses in order to increase bandwidth, allowing for faster internet connections. I lived in the deep south, and it was extremely hot and humid, and the hardest part of the job was making sure you don't overheat doing the strenuous work."
good,"The store I worked in had management teams that would hire their friends, not people who really deserved the promotion via hard work. This created unnecessary stress for employees when we are given a manager who is unfit for the position because of their lack of managerial and people skills. This particular manager and the area manager above him were both good for talking down to people when they asked for Assistance. The store manager would often ruin sales and in turn try to discipline me when I don't hit my goals. The company and pay were amazing as well as the people I worked with outside of that one manager I had when I decided to leave the company."
good,Goals were made during the program for sales but the only time to actually make calls were before and after work. The rest of the time was spent learning about the products and services.
good,"Customer demand drives a typical workday.  New Sales, movement of existing services and repairs are scheduled in advance based upon forecasted workforce supply for every given day.  Management provides safety, process and workload updates for the day.  I received my assigned work electronically, which can involve any service or product, since i am trained for all.  Making the scheduled/committed timeframes are the most difficult part of the job.  No 2 jobs are the same.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to see a very satisfied customer upon completion."
good,this company has good salary and good benefits.  nice place to work over time.  good job security.  long term employment.  many opportunities for jobs if you want to move to different part of company
good,"It could be a hectic work environment, but the people I worked with were top notch. Benefits ( medical, 401k, retirement were great, dental was so-so) . I would still be there if not for cuts in headcount. The department I worked in was split between 2 cities, corporate decided to close the center I worked out of."
good,"Overall this place was a great place to work. The people were cool, had a steady work flow and rarely had bad days in the office. Depending on the project, I would work with them again."
good,"AT&T is probably the best company I've worked for. Yeah they may have treated you like a number, but as a number the benefits and training were outstanding. When I was there was during the time they worked techs way to long without being able to deny overtime. So you felt like you were worked to death, but I've been told that they've change and regained some compassion. The culture is great at AT&T. The fact that they are so worried on their appearance and what value their name holds means they will do what it takes to make sure the customers experience is great, and as someone who cares what people think of me and the company I work for it was nice knowing I had the support. All that being said, if you are going to be a Premise Technician just know you are going to work the hardest you've worked maybe in your entire life, but the are going to train you the right way while taking good care of you."
good,"The job requires a great deal of technical knowledge, physical endurance and the ability to manage your work in stressful, dangerous situations. Training is very in depth and it becomes a lifelong career for many."
good,Loved working with the Tech's and the company seemed to care about the people that they employed. Dealing with the customers and helping them solve the problems that they had was a rewarding part of my day.
good,"Drives sales for the Mobile Channel and serves as an ambassador of the AT&T Brand.  Leads the sales efforts for the Mobile Retail assets and events within a specified territory to deliver on organizational objectives and goals. "
good,"Me gusto trabajar ahi en AT&T. Tiene buen ambiente y estabilidad laboral, mi antigua jefa es muy amigable y tiene buen trato y acepta sugerencia que nosotros como su equipo proponiamos. Si recomiendo trabajar ahi"
good,"Good management, but not very exciting day to day. Good perks in DC office as well, but many workers there seem complacent--or at least not highly excited to push the envelope"
good,Working at AT&T required a full day of focus and dedication to your work. Learning and growth were constant and encouraged. AT&T provided a family like environment where everyone was willing to provide help and support. Diversity was valued  and respected. The most challenging part of the job was staying abreast of the various advancements in telecommunications technologies. AT&T always provided avenues for personal growth. AT&T also was very big on giving back to underserved communities. Overall my career at AT&T was a great experience.
good,"A great place to work. My group was caught in a restructuring of legacy services, where the company's primary focus seems to be in their news making multimedia acquisitions."
good,"Stable business; unsure about where it's going, though.  Company has generally rewarded staffers with bonuses even in lean years with few exceptions.  Company also appears to invest in re-training employees."
good,"Financial Analyst for corporate billing operations."
good,"Opening store. Set up registers. Check floor for inventory. Perform spot inventory duties at times when store is slow. Management  was very helpful, assisting in projects while maintaining staff."
good,"I worked 3 different positions at AT&T and learned more skills like customer service, troubleshooting devices and network issues, working with large and small teams, learning how to work in a fast paced demanding position at a network operations center, and other skills related to telecommunications."
good,"Una empresa con gran cultura organizacional, la cual se ocupa de mantener motivados a cada uno de sus miembros por medio de la competencia interna y externa del giro de negocio de las telecomunicaciones a nivel nacional."
good,"Entire experience was great including the workplace culture, benefits that were provided, name recognition, the relationship building, employee services, and rate of pay."
good,AT&T is a very diverse company with a wide variety of positions and departments.  The company works hard to be at the forefront of technology and attempts to grow their internal employees.
good,Lots of outside activities.  Good compensation as far as bonuses. Great sports program for employees.  Tips on how to stay fit mentally and physically.
good,"My director had an easy going personality.  Easy to express yourself with him and he would try an accommodate your needs in those times of needs.  "
good,You get out of it what u put in. The customers are the worst but once you hear all of their ongoing issues you kind of understand. Be ready for overtime just an hour added at times mandatory.
good,"AT&T has been a great work place for me, while there are challenges like anywhere else the company support its employees, they helped me pay for my school and give you all the tools you need to succeed. "
good,Often times the managers that are placed in their positions often are the biggest stress factors the company itself can be overwhelming at times with the goals sometimes being a bit out of reach for some areas
good,"I think its an awesome laid back job as long as you enjoy working with people , a problem solver you will love it as well. I was working for a authorized retailer, there was times where staffing as a bit tight because you were working alone. But all in all it was never nothing i was not able to handle or able to call and get help."
good,"You can make some real money with AT&T, if you work hard and stay focused. It is a fun environment and you meet a lot of new people. There is not a lot of schedule flexibility if you’re in the store but it’s not hard work and it is good pay."
good,"All in all it's a good place to work, management can be stressful when it comes to quality and meeting production goals, shifts vary often due to shift bids are determined by seniority and not by the level that you preform"
good,"Overall, my time at this company was quite pleasant. I got along well with my boss and coworkers, and I was dutiful in completing my online training. Unfortunately, the holiday season that year was a bust, and though I had been told in my interview that there was a possibility I could be hired as permanent staff, there was really no prospect of being kept long term. I started in mid September, and was put on an extended vacation at the end of October, which turned into a full blown layoff, and eventual release through no fault of my own that I am aware of."
good,"All positions can be stressful, when bad weather hits your expected to work late, depending on the position OT can be 9 to 17 hours of expected overtime, but I loved it."
good,"Was hired for Web Analytics on Webtrends but got great opportunity to enhance my skills by learning new skills like Adobe Analytics, Agile methodogloies."
good,"Great place at the time, but a lot has changed. Everyone is all about numbers and not quality and making sure the customer is satisfied. Today's technology doesn't allow someone to be completely satisfied in a week. Problems come up, but you are told to direct them to call a computerized system."
good,"Could not ask for better paying job or better benefits.  Worked very long hours sometimes. The only complaint I had with my job there was the expectation to work as late as we were needed by the company, not necessarily by the customer."
good,The work itself was not hard mainly because my managers prepared me for all types of customers. We would have demo sessions and they would give pointers on how to best approach customers and close the deal.
good,"Overall a great company to work with, but its definitely a harsh working environment since you are always in danger on the street. Climbing poles around high voltage and driving all day. But a great career once you settle down."
good,AT&T changed throughout the years and switched from traditional phone service to mobility but it was a great experience for me overall.  I really learned a lot and their continuing education classes were great!
good,I was a field manager it was the hardest job I've ever had. Field managers get a score rating that reflects how well their team of technicians work so it's imperative to have a positive relationship with the techs.
good,"Workplace culture, management, and commission differs depending on which store you work at.  Pay is hourly plus commission and commission really makes the difference if you want to make a living wage."
good,"You will hear a lot of reviews talking bad about AT&T."
good,"This department has a stable work environment, the hours are given by a quarterly shift trade. The shifts are given in order of seniority. "
good,"The encouragement and te growth it’s great it’s an excellent place to work they really care about their workers the installations are really awesome, the paycheck it’s very good, on the other hand the work it’s really hard and painful specially if you are in CLG customer loyalty group. Because the customers get to us really really mad yelling about all the problems with other reps and the service, usually they think that we are supervisors so .. not for everyone"
good,The pay is amazing if you’re willing to work for it. No understanding for missed days though. Unless you have fmla you won’t be forgiven for any call outs. Very stressful and a little too political for moving up in the company. I worked in a mostly all African American center and they constantly made mention that they were going to have an all black management team and it just wasn’t professional.
good,"great place to work if you love sales,   you really write your own checks due to the commission structures, safe clean work environment with plenty of promotional opportunities"
good,Be ready to sell people things they won't ever learn how to use because you aren't required to teach them how to use it..Be ready to try to sell people things that have nothing to do with cellphones like home security. The pay is good and so are the benefits.
good,"Great company to work for and manager was excellent help. Although lay offs were inevitable, the pay was great.i also learned a lot working as everyday was basically just repetition"
good,Great work experience and helpful with obtaining knowledge of todays work ethics and technical advances.  This company is very fast paced and had great benefits in 401k and healthcare.  The equipment used is in accordance with todays technology. the hardest part of the job is the fast pace changes in which occur without prior knowledge of that change and having to face it without any pre warning. However I was trained in such a manner that I was unconsciously prepared to take on those challenges.
good,"The job pays pretty well, and the work is fairly easy. Coming from working instore, this job gives you a much better experience of controlling your own sales."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work for, that pay is great. Depending on the type of management you'll have can make the job fun and exciting  or fear to be fired, if you're not selling."
good,"I spent many good years working here. The pay was good and the work was no too stressful. The management quality varies wildly, which is the biggest issue."
good,Great company to work for with good benefits. The compensation structure needs to be adjusted. Employees should make more for their sales and service expertise.
good,"For a retail job, AT&T is union and you are compensated well with a high hourly and monthly commission. Lots of stress to sell Direct TV and insurance. If you are competitive and are hungry to make more money, this is a great retail job especially for part time."
good,"Needs work in Sales department. Upper Management needs a lot of work as well. Very unorganized at times, with no direction in leading the team in success. Could be fixed with proper Upper Management personnel."
good,"I enjoyed working at Directv, the management was good and helpful, the hours were good until it was bought by AT&T, it became difficult to get 40 hours."
good,Att pays well but has a lot of pressure when u don’t sale. Although I am a seller you do have bad months and when those months happen the light is on you and pressure starts applying
good,"N/A. Hectic. Must be driven. Customer service oriented. Able to multitask. Able to communicate confidently with customers. Must be a team player."
good,"My employment experience was great with AT&T.  The training was excellent.  Management was always supportive and it's rate to be part of a union in Florida, so the benefits are outstanding. Due to the nature of the job, they are a LITTLE inflexible when it comes to getting days off.  That is the only ""issue""  I've had with AT&T, but it is a great company and if I had to return, I'd do so happily."
good,Has a built in cafeteria which offers a lot of different choices for a range of different. Plenty of employee parking and nice environment. Good management!
good,"Repetitive, but compensates well. Good customer service and multi tasking skills are required. Being a good listener certainly helps. Sales is a big part of the position."
good,the job is great just looking for more flexible and job advance based upon performance. Att is great company however sometime the larger companies forget about team building and positive morals.
good,la razon por la cual sali de ahi fue por que el que me toco de coach no iba no subio mis encuestas y no hizo su parte del trabajo alimentando mi expediente por ende creyeron que no era un buen agente y me dieron de baja
good,enjoyed working there customers are the most difficult part of the job management usually steps in and de-escalates the situation quickly benefits where good
good,AT&T Uverse employees were not covered by the traditional union plan while I was employed by them and there were many unfair differences. At that time we were umder appendix J which was a major disadvantage at that time
good,Love competition with other workers. At the time management could have been much better. Look to create selling opportunities with every customer and offer all qualifying products to customers. Be cheerful as you are doing so.
good,I was very disappointed when I was let go because of budget cuts. I was never given an an opp4to be hired as a permanent employee. The money that I made was very GOOD.
good,"Great company, not always the best leadership. Every time a new VP was hired, sales was sent in new direction. More about directors and VP's making a mark instead of making the best decisions for sales channels."
good,"Great Job with great people and benefits "
good,Loved my job and didn't want to leave my job.  I wanted to remain with AT&T and retire.  Surplus employees attributed to my release.  I didn't want to lose my job.
good,ATT was a good experience. I would go back if i could. One thing they need to work on is routing and dispatch. Us as techs we were crisscorssing which made our route not efficient.
good,Working for AT&T has been a pleasure to date The sales goals are somewhat unrealistic for most and the work:life balance is limited Looking to advance
good,"I was responsible for the installation and repair of Uverse internet TV and phone at customer premise. I would generally get two to five jobs a day depending on the work. Worked with cat 5, fiber and satellite dishes."
good,"I was able to have hands on experience with new technology and pass that information on to customers and employees. Some of the benefits were being allowed to take my vehicle home and dispatch from my house. I had a bunch of good coworkers and actually enjoyed the work I performed. Only thing i didn't care for was the forced overtime, as it was sometimes hard to keep plans I had made."
good,"Employee development is a key focus within AT&T.  AT&T University promotes higher learning programs and degrees ranging from Undergraduate, Bachelor's& Master's Degrees."
good,"Working with AT&T for the past few years has been great, but it's becoming less and less enjoyable. Changes in management after the merger have created a environment where ways to fail are being created every day."
good,"Difficult transition times over the latest few years created new working teams that were in constant flux. Dynamics within the teams were constantly shifting and several areas overloaded key resources stalling teams’ efforts. That said, the incredible dedication and focus of team members allowed many things to be completed in spite of strict structure and process barriers."
good,"Days would start out slow, then gradually pick up throughout. I would answer calls and assist the customers with what they needed, whether that was inquiring about new services, upgrading existing services, answering any and all questions about the services, etc."
good,"Fast Past some days which is good"
good,Muy buena empresa para trabajar muy responsable muy buen empresa
good,Many opportunities in various fields.  I worked with many talented people who were very helpful and sharing.  I think some of the policies can be a bit short-sighted however.
good,"AT&T no longer a networking company but still offer great opportunities for Software developers, Data Architects, and Cloud Engineers. Much influx of new workers."
good,"The benefits were great and the insurance coverage was phenomenal, but the stress loads were just as much. Being there almost 9 years, I had seen the company go from being customer service to just iPhone tech at the time, management was... SOME were great! Others left a lot to be desired. We bid for shifts by seniority so the same ppl would keep the earlier shifts ALL THE TIME. The pay was more than decent but sometimes the combining of all the departments to one would get really stressful, not to mention the stats you had to maintain. Some seemed quite unrealistic. It is also a unionized environment so raises are guaranteed annually if not 2x a year."
good,I enjoyed working with the directv family at RDI! Management and supervisors are awesome.Plenty of room for advancement and daily sales insentives also free coffee all day.
good,"I enjoyed my team, and the fact that it was a relaxed and casual work environment. My manager was excellent. We received solid benefits although the pay was lower than appropriate for our jobs."
good,"Great place to work with great people. You meet a lot of really cool customers. But it can be faced paced, overwhelming and stressful. Worth it though, the pay is good."
good,a very good place to learn the full operations on the telecommunications industry. safety is number one priority with quality second. most supervisors are fair.
good,"Worked there for 20 years.  Autonomy was good, development  opportunities also good.  Outstanding benefits and competitive wages.  Management overall good, with some exceptions."
good,"Great company; however, currently took a lot of debit when acquired Time Warner.  Company is downsize to reduce debit.  Company has great benefits and vacation policies are the best."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a diverse group of smart hard working people. The work was hectic at times, but was rewarding when I was able to help someone complete their task."
good,"Wonderful workplace environment "
good,"Great company to work for, they're still growing but the work life balance in retail is a little strenuous. But overall a great company to work for. Great benefits and culture."
good,"I liked everything about working for AT&T except for the job security thing. There always seem to be layoffs looming in the background. Management seems to care about employees and there are a lot of opportunities for personal and career development, including tuition reimbursement."
good,"I started with AT&T a month after getting out of the military. Paid 6 or 9 week training was nice. Decent pay, enjoyed the other techs i worked with. I worked in the Tulsa North shop, management is horrible, that was hands down the worst part. Other than poor management, that made everything hectic, i enjoyed it."
good,was employed for 30 years promoted to several positions until forced retirement. workplace culture was different with each position held. Learned something new with every job held.
good,"Realizar demostraciones prácticas de las funciones de los equipos"
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company. As management, I coached reps and helped make the atmosphere as electro and sales driven as possible. We had fun at work. And everyone made money!!"
good,"Nice place to work. The only reason you'd have problems would be if your co-workers end up being mean spirited ones. But if they're friendly, you'll come out of it with some good job experience! "
good,"Es una empresa de mucha inclusión laboral, gran crecimiento al ascender puestos, definitivamente la recomiendo para trabajar. Un ambiente amigable e inclusivo, con una facilidad de comunicación entre todos los departamentos y a lo largo del país."
good,AT&T has been a great place to work. Change is creating uncertain environment that requires flexibility. I have enjoyed my time with AT&T it is a challenging yet fulfilling environment.
good,Was hired for specific type of sales position and the structure isn't what was promised. The job should get better when they work out the details. Yadda yadda yadda
good,"This company focuses on the whole person and works to improve on it.  In my ten years working for the company, I received increasing quality benefits which enabled me to grow and perform as a member of the team."
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for, and offers reasonable and competitive benefits. Sales goals are very high and there is pressure to meet them, however this is completely dependent upon your local management."
good,"The flexible schedule allowed for great work/life balance. There were great opportunities to further your education and in-house certifications.  However, the workloads were heavy, training was non-existent for management.  Layoffs were constant due to outsourcing.  Overall, it was a great place to work until the last few years.  Staffing cuts made if hard for everyone."
good,"""Clean, neat, casual"" attire was a plus that helped me be comfortable at work and not have to break the bank by having to buy a separate wardrobe. I enjoyed the proximity to the Riverwalk. It was a bit intimidating to learn and use so many different software programs. I found it very challenging to focus on keeping calls as short as possible while providing excellent customer service with accurate screening questions, time-consuming technical troubleshooting and offering self-service options. It's a juggling act and I was good at de-escalating irate customers and getting issues resolved, and almost never needed a manager or floor support--but it costs precious seconds to make all that happen. "
good,"AT&T has a very good system to enable working remotely and yet stay in touch will all team members. Although a very large corporation, they pivot regularly in IT to stay aligned with the business."
good,"I worked for AT&T for 33 years before retiring in 2013.  The company was in the process of eliminating long time employees in order to eliminate some health care coverage and pensions.  Overall, they are a good company to work for."
good,"AT&T was a great company to work for. The work place was good comfortable work conditions. I'd worked at home for 3 day a week. The majority of my day was spent  on account reviews and billing reconciliation, I learned end to end billing, office procedures, management skills & practiced leadership The hardest part of my job was learning new billing systems.I enjoyed researching the root cause of billing defects"
good,Good place to work and good benefits. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement because there is not a lot of turnover. Culture is relaxed and fun. Opportunity to learn new products and upsell when necessary it is not forced.
good,It was a good experience the treated you right. It was high paced and high sales oriented. Pay and bonuses were easy to understand and you received ongoing training.
good,The Hardest part of the job is calming a customer down after being redirected and hung up on numerous of times. Management is consistent in keeping up with your performance to ensure company promise and no repeats.
good,Company has great benefits and a good training program. Also offer courses that can go on college transcript. Management could be a little better but overall a great place to work.
good,The job has changed. The company is in a lot of debt and going in a direction I don't think will make our jobs secure. The company upper management has an approach that I do not agree with.
good,Its ok to work at AT&T. I've learning everyday at work. Management is good. the hardest part of my job is the traffic on my commute. The most enjoyable for me is when I get home. Thank you.
good,Unsure of the future for prem techs. Possibility of more layoffs. if there was more job security this job would be a great job.  Good benefits and 401k.
good,"no comment. the time spent with the company was fair."
good,"Very structured, lots of conference calls and group meetings. Very busy typically. If you want to make a lot of money this is the job for you. Be prepared to work lots of hours."
good,Come into work at 6am review emails and any tickets that may be hot issues . Roughly anywhere from 3 to 8 meetings in a day depends if there are any issues . Stay on top of any possible fires and all escalations that come to my team.
good,"Great place to work if you have no skills and need some. Easy to move laterrally around the company but if you plan on moving up expect to be laid off or surplused. This company doesn't care much or show much enthusiasm for their employees. It is half assed at most. They pay is great, many of the managers are great. after 10 years and many tries at getting promoted it has come to my attention that if you aren't ""in"" with the hiring manager or someone in the department you are likely not going to get the job. But that is my one sided view. Still, great hours, decent pay, always can count on full 40 hours, easy job but very repetitive and can get boring. But then again all jobs are like that. Still, if you don't need the job of your dreams this is a place where you can sink in and just grind your life away."
good,"AT&T México es una gran empresa para trabajar siempre y cuando estés contratado bajo ciertas razones sociales, de lo contrario tendrás muy pocos beneficios, similares o iguales a estar subcontratado (outsourcing)."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work with really great people.  I would encourage seeking employment with them, if you can find a good fit and are looking towards the future of Telecommunications and Media Delivery."
good,"The flexibility was nice.  ability to work from home.  The agile was done poorly, I think I spent more times sitting around waiting for the next requirements to be submitted.  I liked it better when we had a pool of work we could just go and grab from.   The hardest part of the job was that no one comes in the office anymore so it made it more difficult to just drop in and talk.  The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfaction from work completed and deployed successfully."
good,"A typical day involves helping as many customers as you can and making sure you offer every customer every product every time. Even if you don't feel the product fits the customer, you're required by management to push every product we offer, whether the customer came in to pay their bill, buy a case or upgrade their phone, our goal is for them to leave with DirecTV."
good,"AT&T is a great company.  As a Client Support Specialist, I support my customers' conference needs in the area of sales and training.  I find the work very challenging and rewarding.  My manager (s) are very supportive and there when you need a hand."
good,"una empresa que te brinda la oportunidad de aprender,"
good,"Typical inbound, mostly, call center. Employees helped each other out. Management provided decent support to employees. It was face paced and but not overly stressful."
good,One of the great things about working for AT&T was the level of Career Advancement I received.  I also got to increase my skill sets with each new opportunity.
good,"AT&T Maintains a high tech laboratory with state of the art telecom equipment. The workforce is divided between contractors and AT&T"
good,AT&T is a good place to work.  The best part of the job is the people and their talent.  The hardest part of the job is that the processes change often and one needs to keep abreast of these changes in order to service customers satisfactorily.
good,"On conference calls all day. writing user stories, requirements, reviewing solution documents, creating test cases, test process documents, executing test case, reviewing test results, updating team daily, creating method procedures for the Billing Dispute team weekly presentation on each of the projects."
good,"A result driven professional with over 20 years of experience in IT, managing networks and projects for large organizations in telecommunications and services industry."
good,"Has issues, as all companies do. Some employees cannot read prints yes still hold a position. favoritism is rampant. union regulations are ignored frequently. management tends to pick on those they do not like no matter how good or bad their work is."
good,"This wireless part of AT&T company has since resolved as it was the start of smart phone, blackberries and 2 way pagers.  Purchased by Metrocall and they are no longer."
good,I’m really good with one on one interaction with customers. Helping customers find what works best for them is what’s important. If the customer is having some sort of complications we’re there to help resolve the issue as soon as possible.
good,If you put time and effort into your work daily you could be successful and have an opportunity to move up in the company. The hardest part of the job was to discipline subordinates. The customers and co-workers were the best part of the job.
good,if you are afraid of heights or cannot physically carry items this job isnt for you. also if you are not comfortable with approaching strangers in there homes job isnt for you
good,"Great company to work for.  I had a strenuous travel schedule.  Great people, great benefits!  They offer tuition reimbursement, certification skills in other areas like cyber security etc."
good,"Technologies evolve and AT&T does an great job leading in this arena."
good,Flex work from home - Great Company - hard to move on or out of certain groups within the company  once in that group for a long period of time - this is the kind of topic better covered in a interview than written essay
good,The compensation and available overtime is great.  Stressful at times but teamwork seemed to make a balance. The benefits are excellent and their is room for advancement to other departments.
good,Great Job and life balance and good benefits. Great on the job training. Good housekeeping.....................................You will love this job.
good,Seen too many good employees get laid off over the last 10 years.  Your constantly dodging surpluses. Its a 10 stressful environment with friends constantly getting let go.  Seen too many good people have this happen to them over the last 10 years.
good,"Working at AT&T was a great experience. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge in not only the cellular/communication world,  but also with customer service and sales. I have met many great people and made some great friends along the way. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the poor management and the way the employees were treated."
good,"Great job if you get the right manager...If you get a poor manager, the working environment can be miserable. Great benefits but not enough advancement opportunities."
good,with all the tech advances such as fiber and wireless phone they are really cutting back on employees . customer service jobs being shipped overseas .
good,"Good environment, very competitive,  to make money you have to work hard, managers from time to time are not the best, sometimes mediocre, but if you focus on the job and not on the coworkers or the manager you can make good money and there’s good benefits including 401(k) . If you consider yourself a rockstar you have the chance to grow on the company."
good,Great opportunity  to work for a good company learn a lot while out in the field great experience in the technology world aspect of it all needs better training
good,"all good for now and getting better."
good,"Isolate and resolve issues related to the delivery of Video On Demand service across the Microsoft/Ericcson IPTV platform"
good,Good benefits but constantly ducking layoffs. Wish I could stay. Company is in transition that could make it stronger but they are going to a more co-located workforce model via collaboration zones while the rest of the world is more mobile and uses remote work space.
good,I provide 24/7 support for clients  on products and services. Liaison for escalation and outages and provide process improvements as identify opportunities as needed.
good,"Interacting with 50+ calls daily assisting customers with a variety of concerns ex bill, payments,ordering, troubleshooting and online support. the word place environment was business casual. The hardest part about the job was policy and procedures constantly changing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees and incentives ."
good,If you are in the right division the way I was it is a really good place to work for a large company.  The work was challenging and politics were minimal.
good,"AT&T was perfect for me straight out of college, I had an amazing team to work with of passionate and caring people and a management team that was dedicated to supporting us all and our success. However, I had a lot of personal turmoil at the time and I needed to be closer to home with friends and family. That is what ultimately tore me away from AT&T and Lubbock."
good,"At the time of Employment, I worked 3rd shift. It was quiet most of the time but when busy, it was very busy. Then working was done when it was working again so if you needed overtime, it was there."
good,"The best example I can give is a pie."
good,Mejorar la administración y/o organización de la empresa
good,At&t is a fast pace and quick place to learn. You go to the garage and load your truck for the day and hit the dispatch button on your iPad and get started on either a repair or installation for the day. Managers at att are like any other some good some bad but mine was a good one always looking out for his team. At&t is union based and sometimes can be difficult for the field techs cause it seemed like they only looked out for the older techs and didn't fight as hard for field techs.
good,A friendly fast paced working environment with a lot of opportunity for growth within the company. Hands on training courses and resources available to take advantage of. Great management team and customer relationships.
good,I have been provided the opportunity to learn a great deal while employed. These skills will serve me well following my retirement. I look forward to the next chapter in my career.
good,the systems they use are outdated and frustrating. they push certain things as priorities but it is difficult to complete those objectives because of the system.
good,"AT&T is constantly acquiring companies and redefining itself.  This means their is always an employee surplus (lay-off) but also opportunities to grow and evolve in your career. You just have to be willing to ride the roller coaster. The compensation is generous as compared to other companies for which I have worked.  Even knowing this, I'm would work for there again."
good,"Company was originally Cellular One and then became At&t and moved out of the area.  Took care of customers cell phone issues and took payments and did credit checks ,Hardest part was rejecting a customer due to their credit .Great bunch of coworkers. If you did good on a call you were told what a great job you did handling that call. (calls were monitored.)"
good,A typical day at the work place meant answering phones and reviewing billable account and resolving issue for the customer. The most hardest part of the job is all accounts are alike but have to handle them individually for the best resolution. The most enjoyable part of the job is everyone becomes like family.
good,"Call center job requires very particular hours to be worked. It's reasonable to fulfill what is necessary in a call center, but potentially not so good for someone with a family. Advancement was definitely a possibility. Staff was always in good spirits."
good,"The business model are driven by automation, analytics, data retrieval platforms revolving around constant change...   In order to stay relevant in this company you must be competitive, upgrading your technical skills, increasing your education base on telecommunications concepts, i.e. wireless technologies showing improvement and the ability to adapt to change on a regularly bases. Strong Soft skills are a plus when performing functions demanding customer interaction, consulting and sales ."

good,Be prepared to work evenings and weekends. Sales targets are extremely high. Commissions can be great if you can hit the required targets. Hours are mostly evenings and weekends when starting.
good,"Working in Data Networking as a Service Executive provided stability because of the changes in the fields.  I was able to constantly expand skillsets in many different areas of data networking as well as project management. I enjoyed the interaction with the customers on a day to day basis.  As the face for the company that dealt directly with the customer in areas of design, support, project management and operations it afforded me the ability to build trust with customers and provide excellent services."
good,"I worked here for over 30 years. I had the opportunity to change careers, but not employers. I utilized the transfer system several times. I was trained adequately for each job."
good,"I loved AT&T Wireless....there was always room for advancement, and a Union. I believe that AT&T cared and was there for all employees. The rewards, constant career advancement was awesome. I advanced through 5 positions during my stay before I was layed off 1999-2013."
good,"Was an enjoyable job, very faced paced work. But the compensation was well worth it. My first 2 site managers were amazing till i was moved to a new site, and my manager had no clue at all, basically had less experience than our least experienced guy, which resulted in a terrible work experience and eventually with myself leaving."
good,This is a fun place to work with Great benefits and pay. Schedules are based on seniority. They have resting areas where you can purchase food and watch TV or use computers.
good,It was a great learning experience and worked with many different managers who were all eager to help you with your career.  Provided great opportunity to move around within the company.
good,"Plenty of job security"
good,I tried to pursue the customer service part of the BPO industry. In line with this growth. This company teach everything that you need to be prepared.
good,"I started at ATT our of high School in 1972 to 1983, things were quite different.  I was a Second level Secretary.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  The work balance was balance and free.  Once I relocated I seek a different path."
good,"During my years at AT&T I had the ability to grow within the company and beyond.  AT&T offers lots of training and development opportunities. As a mobility specialist, outside the box thinking was encouraged when securing new opportunities."
good,ATT was a great place to work. The culture and the people were really  nice. I worked in different territories and that was always exciting and new. Great place!
good,"My typical day included installing and removing CAT 5 cables/equipment for various buildings"
good,"Perusing sale opportunities, to improve the customer sales experience, while assisting customer with wireless cellular services and devices, while attaining sales goals."
good,enjoyed working with different departments to accomplish end result for customers. worked as outside plant engineer designing work prints for construction to complete in field. maintained budget and monitored to meet end results and stay with budget with no roadblocks.
good,"Good company to work with and build a long career."
good,Always a job with learning opportunities when it come to the advancement of technology.  Always asked opinions when it comes to overall company situations.  Wanted to make sure the personnel quality of service was maintained
good,"As a SM you will oversee upwards of at least 10-15 people depending on store size. Days can be long with conference calls, changes at the drop of a dime sometimes. You WILL learn a lot about Corporate culture and Leadership. Culture is fast paced as technology is fast paced. The hardest part is dealing with people and putting out fires. EVERYTHING is on you ultimately. However the most enjoyable part (aside from cool toys and tech and discounts) can ALSO be the people as I still have great relationships with many old co workers."
good,"Being more organized with day to day duties."
good,Room to advance with great management support.   Work balance with family time was difficult.  Transfers where common.  Great training to develop skills.
good,Good benefits and work life balance just hard making commision during slow months.  Sometimes hard tracking down technicians at jobs because so many jobs get rescheduled or cancelled before we even get there.
good,Enjoyable job with plenty of opportunities to grow.  Fast paced environment changing every day to meet the growing needs of entertainment and mobility.
good,"The hourly is nice, commission even better. If you work hard, go above and beyond your quota, get along with management, and don't do anything sketchy or fraud related, you'll earn a good living."
good,You learned how to communicate with people of different races. The hardest part was walking in the heat but the most fun was team night where y’all all would go to the club and have fun 2 times a week.
good,Awesome training and they stayed with you until you were confident. It was a call center so it was difficult to get any breaks between calls. It was a bit stressful because you had to be quick you had to continue good rapport from first to last even while you were strategizing. Very quick paced
good,"The cafeteria was okay but they changed it and it went to the birds. The company was great as DirecTV! Since at&t took over it went downhill. Cutting out benefits, the technicians went to h e double hockey sticks and the customer service went overseas. It went from excellent job to the worst job ever."
good,n/a - Beyond saying that at&t is a decent place to work with great benefits and a good balanced between work and home life I am not willing to write anything else.
good,my first manager  was pretty cool really optimistic an push me to eventually become a manager of a struggling store which I turned around using his blue print of the store I came from but we had different district managers and mine just happened to be a bad leader setting unrealistic goals for a store with low traffic which I eventually changed but once I reached his insane goals for the store he asked me to fire one of my employees because she wouldn't sleep with him which is where I drew the line a resigned from the company .
good,Good step - Frequently allowed to use our skill sets to solve complex system integration issues.  Used access and UNIX to write SQLs and remedy ticket.
good,Always down sizing and out sourcing jobs. People were great but CEO and upper management money hungry and no longer cared for the lower management.  Job security at an all time low.  Expected you to correct errors for people getting the job over seas.
good,"I enjoyed working there.  The environment was friendly.  However, their sales goals were almost schizophrenic, for several months they pushed one type of sales model, and then they would change everything."
good,"Whether you are a salesperson or in management, coaching and development is always the priority. While in a fast paced environment daily objectives and goals are required to be met. Constant face to face training and web based training are required providing for a first class learning environment on how to handle customers, deal with your business and stay up to date with products and trends. The retail environment is a younger crowd enjoying the perks of having the latest and greatest technology available. It is certainly a great place to develop your sales skills while having fun and enjoying great company benefits. Only downside as to any retail line of work is work life balance which can be a challenge."
good,"If you have the opportunity to work for AT&T, then you should go for it. I worked sales in a corporate store and it was an amazing experience. Great pay and great benefits. The management was atrocious though. That is the chance you take with any employer though. So with all of that being said. Definitely go for it if you have the chance!"
good,Great people and very diverse workforce.  Worked here for over 10 years and had the opportunity to move into multiple positions with different products which really helped me to learn a great deal.
good,Fast pace and always challenging but rewarding place to work at.  Most positions at this company are commission based and requires sales experience and the ability to capitalize on every opportunity.
good,"A nice place to work.  Colleagues are knowledgeable.  Managers are supportive.  Salaries are competitive.  It had the good old Bell system culture, but is becoming more business driven.  Many jobs positions are out-sourced to foreign countries and some US-based locations are being consolidated for cost reduction."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Very fast paced which I loved. You work many hours but you make good money for your hard work. They invest in their leadership with excellent training and continued training throughout your career.
good,"Very thorough training program.  I started out knowing about 5% of what I needed to know about technical issues but by the end of training, I knew about 90% more."
good,"While AT & T overall was a good place to work considering pay and benefits,  it was becoming g harder to keep giving exceptional customer service when there were time constraints involved they expected at the same time."
good,"During my time with at&t I experienced different positions.  The first as a bilingual customer service representative for 3 years, and during that time I manage to perfect the spanish language.  The second was as an Outside Field Technician repairing and installing phone service.  I did enjoy learning different trades with this company."
good,It was challenging but was excited to work there I went out on the field talk with new business about AT&T products and what it had to offer and benefit to there companies
good,A day at AT&T was something new everyday. Meeting goal was always first.  Managers were there to assist in meeting your goals. Benefits was ok.  Good place to work.
good,Overall I have been very satisfied working for AT&T. They have provided me the tools I’ve needed to improve in business and in personal life. Awesome company to work for!
good,"Good company, been here for 20 years and was impacted by surplus. Company is going on a major workforce transformation and will be actively downsizing some areas but there are opportunities in others."
good,I loved to work in att. I learned a lot. This is my first project after out of my college. I learned how to work in team and how to manage work life balance.
good,"Great place to work for 17 years from the early days at Bellsouth, Cingular and and several other business units.  The company is huge and offers allot of benefits"
good,"If AT&T had positions available where I moved, I would have transferred. AT&T has excellent benefits. Their time off policies are more than fair. Policies are ever changing, as is the number of bodies needed to process different job functions. The workplace culture isn't the best, but based on employee feedback each year, AT&T works to improve the areas that need work. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new processes and my coworkers."
good,AT&T was a great company to work for.  It offered opportunities for career advancement both locally and across the country.  The only issue with the company is that they often have layoffs when they do mergers or re-organizations.
good,The most enjoyable co workers and customers. Loved making customers happy and delivering good service. I miss my job. I was very good at it and was a go to person for my peers.
good,"Didn't want to leave the company but had to due to moving across the country. Great pay and benefits in the Missoula, MT area. It was a call center based  work environment but it went well!"
good,"If you want to work and be busy all the time this is the company to work for . They always have overtime which is great to make more . Also , they have great benefits"
good,"Un muy buen ambiente de trabajo dentro del centro de atención, comisiones vinieron a la baja con los constantes cambios de adaptación de la empresa"
good,"They pay well, benefits and discounts kick in quickly.  Advancement is always there. Same as anywhere management can find a way to get you out if you don't get along."
good,"Great benefits, competitive pay. Ongoing training and refresher courses throughout the year for all levels of employees. Overall a great place to work."
good,It was okay the environment was better with Directv before AT&T bought them out. I too much on numbers and they appeared to not care how it was achieved a lot of employees cheating
good,"I enjoyed helping my customers and working with my technicians."
good,I love my current job with the company and I am sad to only be labeled as a Temp. Wish I could make this a career with the company. They also require a lot of training thus making you a better employee.
good,The location I worked at wasn't super busy so we had time to build relationships with our team which made us strong.  There were certain people who wanted all the customers and others who would take what they got but no one stepped on anyone's toes. The company's compensation for commission continued to drop with higher and higher requirements before a left. When I was leaving new employees with no industry experience were getting paid what I was after four years of working there.
good,"As a mega-company, AT&T offers excellent benefits, including full healthcare benefits with low monthly premiums.  My last 2 jobs offered telecommuting part-time, which was a huge plus for me and my family."
good,Good place to work with great salary and benefits.  Lots of training available.   Promotions are too political.   Management is taking the company in the right directions.
good,"AT&T offers great benefits such as medical, dental, and vision. AT&T has great short term leave which is accommodating when needed to take care of yourself or a family member."
good,"A typical day at work was showing up to the shop, having an informal gathering to discuss current and upcoming projects, dispersing to local projects and performing outstanding work for the day!"
good,Working as an CSR at Alorica for ATT was great. The pay was not enough for the accounts that you had to work and all the Power points that none of the customers read.
good,"Fue una buena experiencia trabajar ahi , muy buen lugar para trabajar"
good,Worked in a small teams in multiple locations. Management was very understanding and flexible with work/life balance. Pretty good benefits compared to other companies.
good,You will work hard but there are a lot of perks. Worked in all environments and traveled at times. Good insurance benefits. Decent stock options. Also good discount program.
good,"This was a good job, I just didn't like the customers always being so rude. It goes without saying that most of the time the customers are calling into complain about their phone or bill. I did not care for the negativity that I received constantly. I like interacting with customers and helping to resolve issues just not always getting yelled at. I understand that was the nature of the job so I left."
good,It was a great place to work with lots of good benefits. I would recommend it to any professional. Company places a high value of training and diversity.
good,Great company overall and good products - just do your research before accepting a position to determine if the work-load and stress level is a good fit for your tolerance.
good,Nice job friendly people good work environment something new everyday secure building. Great parking nice lunch roon best breakfast and lunch services
good,"Great benefits, slow advancement, persistent risk of re-organization affecting employment status or forcing employees to ""start over"" with a new business unit/organization."
good,"overall good company to work for. Good pay, but not very much work/life balance. Also company just went through a bunch of layoffs in the 2016-2017 year so not too sure about job security."
good,"Loved my time with Att.  Only down side for me is, you must be able to move from one job to another to stay relative.  Jobs seem to appear and then dissapear frequently.  The days of working one or two jobs for twenty years seem to have expired."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work. Typical workday changed from day to day. My learning spans 43 years. The workplace culture is good. Every job probably has a hardest part. Most enjoyable is my career was a pleasure, benefits, employee assistance with life an work balance."
good,Would be nice if they had better opportunities to transfer within the company. But overall has always put good on my table. Great insurance and benefits to consider
good,The work experience I gained with AT&T has been used to further my career in every field I’ve been apart of since. AT&T invests in itself every year to be better than it was the year before.
good,"I worked from home and in the office, working with many teams handling the life cycle of servers and applications.  Visibility with upper management.  Was able to move into many different job positions throughout carrer."
good,"Daily meetings."
good,Está muy buena la empresa yo formaba parte de wimo
good,"AT&T provided a clean safe working environment. A diverse cultural experience. Mot enjoyable part of job, we were a family. The hardest part of the job, was the schedule changes impacting life"
good,"My job is mange a team team of 22 Network Support employees. I have an excellent and very competent team, who performs their job to the best of their ability. "
good,"great place to work, but a lot has changed with technologies. not the same place i was used to. cant recommend to anyone looking for a longterm job..."
good,"If you enjoy a fast-paced, competitive environment, you will love working for AT&T. You generally work hourly plus commission but your commission check is what you really need to beef up your salary. So you have to really hustle every single day to bring home the big bucks."
good,"It was a great time to be able to work with customers and find out what they need in terms of service for their mobile, tv, and home security needs.  As a Retail Sales Consultant, our job was to meet sales quotas across all products and services that AT&T provides."
good,Had an awesome Team Manager who always inspired us to be better and driven. Always met expectations and more. Flexibility was also a big part and we always helped each other out as a team to get our sales goal met.
good,I worked for them for 44 years. The company is significantly different than when I started. I was always treated well and respected. They have changed their business model to be relevant to today's needs and have opened other opportunities for revenue.
good,"Great benefits, good pay, great work environment, poor communication between different departments.  Strictly numbers based. Poor job work/life balance"
good,"Worst place to work, I would not recommend anybody working for AT&T unless you are only going to stay short term and only wanting to make quick money."
good,Most of the managers were decent guys but they were still managers. No big complaint other that it is hot in Texas. Compensation was good and pay increase came annually overall good job.
good,"Very fast paced, great place to work for the money, can be very tiring at times as you are running through attics and working in all kinds of weather,"
good,Enjoyed my years working AT&T. I spent 25 years with the company and the company gave all the opportunity to improve my skills and to be viable outside the company.
good,The company is always changing. Which provides a new type of work experience each month or so. There was little to none work advancement as times are changing and everything is going to streaming.
good,I worked at the company for almost six years. The company laid off all employees. It was okay while it lasted. Nothing further to say in regards to the company.
good,"I worked in the call center, the customers were great. It was an easy job and the pay was decent at the time. I worked there for about 3 years, picked up a lot of skills. Only downfall the management is terrible."
good,If you enjoy working with people and technology this is a great place to work.  Great benefits and fun environment.  I would recommend this for any of my friends and family.
good,Manager was fair to me and respected my technical knowledge. Had a good ending there and was able to get along with the team members and had a good duration length there.
good,Att is a great company and very sales driven! However you don't have a work balance life in the retail position. The company is very professional and you have the opportunity to maximize sales.
good,"AT&T is a comfortable place to work with good culture and plenty of benefits.  They offer employee discounts and perks on a lot of products, the people are smart and good intentioned and the salary is about average for the industry (at least for junior software engineers).  I've enjoyed my time at the company, and the relaxed (almost hesitant) pace of the work.  That being said, there is a silent understanding among the younger employees that this is not a place to build a career.  First of all, the salary does not increase much with promotions.  That is a big turnoff for people at all levels of experience.  Second, the work isn't challenging enough.  I am happy to excel at my job, but not at the expense of losing my competitive edge in a fast paced industry.  Telecoms generally lag behind tech companies, but AT&T is especially slow, mostly due to it's massive managerial beauracracy, hesitant budgeting and the general complacency of people who stay at the company long term."
good,"Our sales team made this job a lot better to deal with. It could be rather cut throat because it was sell or die...overall I had a lot of fun, met interesting people, and learned a lot about marketing"
good,"I haven't worked here for a long time."
good,"I don't have any negative opinions on AT&T, as they try their best to teach their teams the basics of their infrastructure to the point they can help a standard end-user understand the business. It would be nice if they regularly had meetings to ""catch up"" on the goings on and the types of calls we'd receive that day, but that type of communication usually came in way after the incident began. Their tools were amazing, but few people knew how to navigate them properly. The system used to be RIO meaning Rolled into one, but then they started breaking up the company and they wouldn't allow cross-training as much which limited your ability to move from one aspect of the job to another and feel effective. They worked diligently with their reps to make sure they understood the position and their tasks, but they never showed you how the ""sausage was made""."
good,At&t is a good company to work for and the pay is great. Not much of a work life/ family balance when you're working in field operations. If you're looking to get a lot of overtime then this is the lace for you.
good,There were many opportunities to available at AT&T. I was able to work several different jobs ranging from administrative to technical. There were many opportunities to learn new skills and grow.
good,If you like sales you'll love this job. Fast growing company with latest technology. Sales/Customer Service. Learned how to service the public with telecommunication needs. Workplace culture is very diverse.
good,Loved working with others and meeting the needs of the customers. . New challenges every day and very exciting to bring customers our services and/or repair their issues. Very gratifying with a sense of accomplishment with evry job completed.
good,"It wasn’t to bad of a job , I knew the manager that’s how I got the job we did great in my department our numbers were pretty good I would recommend it."
good,"AT&T offers excellent benefits including health, dental, ,vision, life insurance, company match 401k plan and pension plan. I'm not sure if that has changed since I left there in 2015. Management definitely has it's challenges. I think the company needs to listen to the employees more. This company has a lot of pro's and con's. It can be very stressful."
good,"I had fun while at ATT the only complaint for me was the pay and the attendance structure, but if you are interested in sales this is an amazing place to start, you wont make a whole lot based on what you sell but you will gain a ton of valuable contacts and get a valuable glimpse of what sales life is like."
good,"Great place to work, Sales driven environment. Many opportunity's within the organization. 40 + hours weekly. Early morning late nights the normal. Leadership involved in most process."
good,I was employed at AT&T through a 3rd party company. The company offered great work/Life balance and the management was very understanding. The company worked as one team.
good,"This is a fast paced, timed call environment. The bonuses are great and the benefits as well. There are a few team managers that are hard to work with and will make your life miserable if they dislike you, but the other managers and upper staff are excellent. You also have the option of joining the Union and they help protect you from most mischievous managers. It's a lot of fun, working with your team to meet goals and get rewards."
good,Great company to work for. I enjoyed the 9 almost 10 yrs that I've worked for the company. Great management. Most enjoyable part of was being able to help our customers.
good,"AT&T is a great place to work, especially if you are on the inside, management ""FAST-TRACK"".  You are expected to learn, to produce, and achieve a status of ""excellent: on all your quarterly reviews.    If you are just an average employee, that is O.K. too, but like most places, you will not advance."
good,Great team atmosphere with supportive coworkers and management. Great benefits but could use some improvement on work/life balance. Hours are long and include evenings and weekends in most higher positions.
good,"Call center work with time and attendance adherence matrix's."
good,Is a good company to work for they care about their customer and product. They help you get the most out of your customer service. Attached cares.  Better than Sprint.
good,plenty of opportunity to grow within the company. Must like working with people and have lots of patience. Have the ambition to sell the products and execute your quotas.
good,you never know what time you're shift will end and its hard to make plans for any activity outside of work. supervisors are good benefits are good and pay can always be better
good,The company has great benefits. Make sure to take advantage of all the free training to increase your skills.  Best to be in management right now as craft positions have been decreasing due to automation.
good,Job was great but with the continuing changes in the business security became an issue. Would recomend to a friend. Work was constant and good and always changing.
good,"Some managers were fair and 1 in particular was kind of hard to work with.  I was not the only employee on our team who thought so.Our call center closed so no one is working there anymore.  Our team manager was cold and too driven for process without regard to customers. I am about customer service and customer satisfaction, yet my metrics were always exceeding expectations."
good,Overall the company is on the cutting edge. If you don't mind the sales goals you can make a very decent living with them. At times it can be stressful when you are challenged to make your numbers.
good,Lots of fast growth opportunity here. They like to promote from within and also encourage training and advancement of skills. Management was often unavailable due to heavy workloads but very pleasant and friendly to work with. At the time there was also mandatory overtime and long days but the pay off was well worth it.
good,Overall rating a good company to work for. Employees are friendly and work together for the interest of the company and its' growth. Online and internal training available.
good,"horarios quebrado que para mi en lo personal no te dejaba mucho tiempo, pocas promociones"
good,Everyday was a different job or jobs so it wasn't boring doing the same thing everyday. The best part was working outside on nice days and the worse part was the rain and snowy days. Worked with great people willing to help if needed.
good,"Great place to work and very productive, very collaborative and excellent employees and contractors to work on a daily basis."
good,"AT&T was a wonderful place to work.I brought my knowledge of instructional design to the position and gained from them a great deal of knowledge about eLearning  and about current technology."
good,"Workplace has ping pong table and 2 break rooms with free coffee. My office has 2 4K TVs, 3 flat-panel monitors, a large whiteboard and ergonomic chair."
good,Pretty much a great job if you did not have to deal with the entitlement of Americans retail customers. I like the company as a whole but I will never work in retail again.
good,Great place to work. Senior leadership is what makes this job stressful or no longer a fun place to work. Benefits are great. Awesome PTO! The longer you work for the company the more days you get!
good,un exelente ambiente de trabajo y una muy buena capacitacion lamentable mente tardan demaciado en proporcionar seguro entre otras prestaciones
good,Ive been with AT&T for almost 5 years now and it is a great company to work for. My vurrent role is more in the field but it is very sales oriented even though initially it wasnt described as that. I dont mind because the compensation is fair and is well paid considering the fact that we are working for a wireless company  and the cellphine industry is saturated. What i like about AT&T most is that the find the way to stay up float and relevant by venturing into entertainment and home security which essentially provides job security for everyone in the company. Promotions are more of an individual emplyee opinion. Some people are promoted because they know the right people and some because they actually have the ability to lead the time of fulfill that role. It is a great company to work for overall but you dont have much of a work life balance because at times your qork comes home with you and although having work life balance is promoted by management it isnt implemented.
good,"Mi experiencia con AT&T International fue muy buena durante los 6 años y pocos meses que estuve trabajando con ellos, aprendí mucho e hice una gran experiencia. Lamentablemente año tras año fue cada vez menor la carga laboral que estuve recibiendo por parte de la empresa hasta que vino una inevitable reducción de personal y he quedado por fuera. Un aspecto muy negativo de AT&T en Argentina, es que nunca se podrá como profesional hacer carrera dentro de la empresa, los puestos existentes no tienen inmediatos superiores a nivel local y a la empresa no le interesa que estemos involucrados físicamente con las labores que desempeñamos, es todo a distancia. Recursos humanos en Argentina son prácticamente inexistentes."
good,Es una empresa que otorga libertad de moverte con el fin de lograr los objetivos
good,"Mostly learned new technical knowledge, mostly database management and administration in UNIX environment."
good,Great job if you get a good boss and keep him you work alone and the pay is pretty good and upfront.. long days and you can never do anything right.. But if you like change then this is the job for you
good,"Would be given workload the day before.  Need to be at first work location at 8 a.m.  Install or repair internet and phone services for customers at premise.  Problem solve and trouble shot any customer issues on going or new.  Complete all tasks while working in a safe and timely manner as to follow all company rules.  Make sure before you leave the customer that all there services are working correctly. "
good,"Big telecomm is changing, making the employees obsolete and making contractors more evident. ATT is making a stand for the shareholders which is understandable but employees....do not skip on your free education reimbursement. you will need the certifications real soon ( remember the 2020 plan?)"
good,"Was great job, high stress worked on various special projects re tariffs multi state.  Great company to work for and many training opportunities.  "
good,"i worked for Sera4 and we worked on a project for this company. They are great to work with, no fuss and good orders - our most loyal customer. Thank you"
good,"Upper Management often basis corporate decisions on politics vs. ""hard"" facts.  Often ""corporate standards"" outweigh best practices. However, day-to-day decisions are often left up to managers."
good,"I worked for directv before the merger with at&t. I don't know how much has changed. when I was there you got almost immediate health care coverage, they provided a gym, and tried to make it a nonstressful work enviroment"
good,"At&t is a huge company with many career opportunities. I was given a chance to do a job and career that is hard to break through. It is very high pace, sink or swim. The benefits are really good. Overall it's a great company to work for."
good,"Es una excelente empresa, capacitación constante y motivación. Facilidad de crecimiento."
good,business is business but the find ways for you to relax on your break.
good,"AT&T allows for an individual the ability to maximize their talents and abilities on a daily basis, in relation to their daily responsibilities, the opportunity to grow and be successful."
good,The work atmosphere  was very relaxed. even though we tracked anywhere from three to ten technicians at a time it was very relaxed and fun. We had a business casual dress code.
good,"It was fast and stressful but you had your peers to,help you and most the answers were at your fingertips. The call volume could be crazy and it was call after call after call but you had your scheduled breaks you had to take and clock in and out was right at your computer and the fixed schedule was nice and gave some sort of balance to my life, I honestly miss it."
good,"Great job with great benefits, my only complaint is that the amount of work either being contracted out or being lost to technology is scary. The future for the technician doesn't seem bright for AT&T. It is recommended to get as much training on coding as possible since that seems like it will be prominent in the future for technology. Consistent work and good pay for a entry level position  with AT&T, I would recommend as a good starting point for someone interested in the technology field."
good,"The company was very professional and at the same time was fun. The management was very helpful and open to ideas. The training was good, but as in anything could improve. I did feel that some things could of been better explained."
good,I loved working for Directv/AT&T I Am Glad I worked there because now i have more options with what type of work I want to do ! They always compliment and reward the employees on what they do well and help to improve their weaknesses.
good,"There are too many layers that slow things down, and not enough accountability at mid-manager level. Decision making can get drawn out. Good culture, good people, decent pay with good benefits. Opportunities exist to do different type work and expand your skillset."
good,"Good organization, and well known brand. Looking forward to make my mark here. My initial impression so far has been good on wide range of areas. Good team spirit so far."
good,"ATT is a good place to work but didn't care for the scheduling and getting time off. It went by who has been there the longest. Also, ATT has purchased more companies then just phone, so when they do that, they eliminate advancement jobs."
good,great place to work for work at home agents if you enjoy having the comfort of at home and not having to commute and have a job that is rewarding and gives you new skills this was the place.
good,I am detail oriented and love to solve problems.
good,working at AT&T you had to be able to learn fast and pick up on new things as you go. Everyday is different so you are never doing just one thing. I loved this Job
good,Typical day would be making sure I'm at work by 8 or that is disciplinary action. Next morning meeting either with crew or on call where either every one did good and it wasn't enough or a few people didn't do well and we get chewed out. Short of the pressure they try and put on techs for numbers every day if you've got tough skin like I do its a great place if you like to work alone and not be confined to a cubical. I loved my job all and all it's definitely a job I would go back to I started working there rite out of high school so you can say I learned plenty and still have more tricks to learn after 6 years.
good,Att is not as flexible as most companies. But pay and benefits were great. Everything went by seniority to be fair.. union job. Benefits also made this job one of the best companies to work for
good,"AT&T Yellow Pages was a great place to work.   Great staff and learned a great deal for 17 years.  I was able to learn a great deal by working in several different positions in the Finance department.   Auditing,  testing new systems,  billing,  revenue reports and so much more.   It allowed me to grow.  I started here right out of college.  Very stable company, at that time, and provided financial security."
good,"Productive work environment with a dynamic and smart team. With a large, complex organizational structure, the team environment was ideal which helped to make for a positive and successful experience."

good,Very fast paced and stressful but manageable . The only reason I am separated from the company is due to my inability to relocate. If not for that I would still be  with the company.
good,"los dias son agradables, gente muy amable y con buen clima  laboral"
good,"I am happy to have worked for ATT however in the later years after all the mergers, we became numbers instead of employees.  Having started with Southwestern Bell and been part of the transition to SBC and then ATT, I saw this change as the company got bigger.  With more and more layoffs, and additional outsourcing - you were expected to do more with less.  Many hours and a lot of stress.  If you are able to work this way then a good place for you."
good,AT&T call center typically consists answering calls to help customer with customer service with billing or technical issues and then offer integrated home solutions. I learned good interpersonal communication skills. Management was very micromanaged. Workplace is very accommodating. Hardest part is keeping up with certain metrics. Most enjoyable part is having found a great customer solution.
good,I enjoyed my time working at ATT . I was given several opportunities for growth within the company and the pay and benefits were great. I would recommend the company to jobseekers
good,its a nice place to work very productive. you will have to meet a goal and its fun you want feel like work besides on inventory or when the day is going slow.

good,Fun and fast paced environment in which colleagues and customers are very diverse. Administration is very understanding and helping. Flexible hours and lunch breaks.

good,working with AT&T is a fun mostly if you are a person who love working more hours. its difficult if you will want to work and the same time trying to go to school.
good,I have learned how to effectively sell and find integrated solutions which puts more money in my pocket. The job is very simple in my opinion and if you do your job you'll do well.
good,"I was excited to go to work each day. I worked in a corporate location in the top producing area in the midwest. The more hours you put in, the better your odds of reaching the required goals. Everyone was very upbeat and I would recommend to many that this is a great place to work. The negatives were advancement within the company, lack of proper management, lack of a work/life balance and lack of available sick time. For being a customer facing environment, I didn't feel it was right to tell a representative that after 3 sick days they are unable to apply for any higher positions in the company until they are off probation. We were instructed to shake hands with customers and talk face to face daily. My coworkers and I were always sick."
good,"apply and try it, When needing to make good pay with minimal degrees. I would definitely recommend at&t.  I was employed there for almost 5yrs within that time paid off my car completely and purchased a home."
good,Employees are very interactive and fun. Good work life balance. Frequent team shuffling. No work pressure and very helpful team members. Less professional growth.
good,Es una empresa que cuenta con muchos valores que siempre te motivan a salir adelante y creser
good,"I was working for BellSouth when At&t acquired BellSouth Advertising  and Publishing.  I didn't have to interview for the job, I was already in the position. I learned the value of teamwork and the role of a manager.  I learned at At&t that a manager means you want to do more and lead by your example.  A great place to work is when your employees feel valued and appreciated.The hardest of part of my job  was seeing the gradual loss of employees due to attrition.  The easiest part of my job was the work, i.e. talking with the customers, negotiating to 'yes'."
good,ATT is a very Advanced company would like to stay there until retirement but because Changing Times it's laying off a lot of folks I think I need to keep my options open.
good,"Huge complex corporation, steeped in process/bureaucracy is trying to remake itself as a hip trending tech leader that also does entertainment.

There is almost always a place for you somewhere in the company as long as you continue to be a valuable team member.  The technology is like nothing else and steadily advances with an amazing technical crew at its disposal."
good,"The compensation and benefits were amazing and the other techs were great, but the push to make metrics seemed to overshadow the stated goals of safety and customer satisfaction."
good,"Good place to work. However, job security is up in the air right now. Local management is great. Company does micro manage all aspects of the day to day operations."

I am responsible for coordinating departments to resolve customer problems.  I am a senior team member.  Therefore, I'm training team members and I am responsible for learning new information in order to provide clarity on methods and procedures. The environment is open to suggestions.  The environment encourages collaboration between departments as well."
good,"Due to the various positions, AT&T is basically 24/7. Most clerical is 9 to 5.I learned that there are various people in the world with more of less powerful attitudes than myself. The job itself was a cake walk, the real test of ones constitution was dealing with those people in a way more conducive to work production.It is very easy to become angry, but controlling it enough to perform your duties builds real strength in character. The various employees ae from all walks of like and cultures. I learned to appreciate them in order to learn from them. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see every one put aside those differences and come together for a single purpose. Whether it be to support a fellow employee in distress or complete a specific job detail. That is when I discovered that we were all just people and not so different after all."
good,"Plenty of Opportunity, knowledgeable staff, great employee benefits. Environment of constant change in leadership and direction, leading to fair job security"

good,"Perform opening procedures, make sure your cash handling is correct for each drawer that you are opening for that day and make sure your drawer is balanced out correct each night before you leave. You have to stand at least 8 hours a day unless you have a doctor's excuse. Smile at the customer at all time and great products with the phone they purchase. I learned to treat customers like you want to be treated at all times. Our manager have meetings each week and sometimes during the day to make sure we strive to meet our goals. Sometime the hardest part of the job is when your goal is not met for the day buy you strive to make it up the next day. My most enjoyable part of the job is to help meet the customer need and answer all their questions before they leave."
good,"A good company to cut your teeth in or hone your craft. Used to be a company to stay with for your entire career, this has changed in the past couple years."

good,Pay was good. Mandatory overtime always enforced . Very stressful. Management cutthoat. Training good. Had to meet quotas and deadlines.Good benefits.
good,"My typical day at work is coming in and taking calls for 7hrs, Sometimes the day can get stressful with irate customers but I continue to handle my calls in a professional way and try to collect as much as possible and soon as possible. I don't have a problem with my manger because I do my job.The most enjoyable part of work is lunch, breaks and team meetings."

good,I have had a long and prosperous career with AT&T. After many years I decided to accept early retirement to pursue other interest and career objectives. It was a great place to work and provided me the tools needed to move on in life.
good,"Just  wish that i still had the job"
good,I enjoyed selling Cellular phones. I enjoyed working with B2B and corporate management. I enjoyed building business relationships with my clients and being a part of their business being a success.
good,Company was originally a good place to work for.  Mangers for most part were good people.  things took a turn for the worst after acquisition of Direct TV.  Pay was too low for work that was demanding.  Still a good company.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this job I advanced within this company learned and grew I handled contract batching, bank deposits,shift scheduling,and an array of other things"
good,This was a union job.  Good benefits and good pay for many years.  Your job function changed constantly.  Too many people giving instruction and no one stating the same thing.
good,"I was on the phones assisting customers with their billing and other customer service issues.  I also excelled in sales with AT&T, selling additional lines of service and other entertainment services we had  to offer.  Management was very supportive."
good,"This job i believe as a technician is pretty good. However pretty hard if your coming into the company as a noobie."
good,"Great opportunity to wear many hats at one time."
good,its a great company to get in with and work your way up to top pay and chill around 25 an hour. but if a better opportunity comes up don't hesitate to take it. AT&T is not the best company ever.
good,"The culture at AT&T is great. I learned a lot with the department I was in and the pay was good. The only con I would say is since they are such a large company, it is very common for lay offs to happen annually in your departments."
good,Coming into work theirs usually a line of people waiting to be helped. 
good,"they are a huge company that continues to take away from the employee and its retirees. For example, AT&T raises the medical benefits very year when 5 years ago HMO was free."
good,"Need to get to work timely. Get your workload on the iPad and dispatch and be on your way to 1st job in 1 hour and keep moving from one job to another. need to close out job progressively and company track your progress with GPS. All job requires good knowledge and use of company records and hand held diagnostic tools and plenty of physical work. 1st Level Management keeps track of your work performance and will only confront you if numbers don't meet predetermined expectations. Most jobs to be done in about 2 hours by yourself unless extremely difficult task that requires help of a companion or because of safety concern. Safety is top priority and safety gear required on all jobs. 28 Ft extended ladders and mid spans and extensive drops and irate customers are real challenge."

good,Being front line of customer service while handling a multitude of tools can be a challenge but can also be fun with the benefit of meeting new people everyday. Not for everyone but i would rather recommend the position than to not recommend it.
good,Service provider company that incorporates R&D into it's daily business.  Works only if management has an R&D background.  Many things are dropped on you with no warning.

I learned communication and empathy skills that have helped me even after my experience at convergys. I think my favorite part of working there was how structured the building was."
good,"Many good people there, highly qualified.  Interesting problems, major impact on network and new product design.  A bit heavy on executive demands and overhead."
good,Generally speaking job growth at AT&T seems to be centered in Georgia. Most talented and upwardly mobile managers need to be open to relocating to Atlanta.
good,A typical day at work with group sales department consisted of making a spread sheet of a companies current cell phone usage and creating a new spread sheet with AT&T savings. Charging phones to be sent to new companies. Handle individual account complaints.

good,"AT&T now, but a great company. They cared about the end user and made certain service was working and dependable. Management and techs worked as a team to insure this. Upper level was good and cared about all aspects of the company, which was the customer."
good,you get to manage your day with little supervisor interaction. sitting around and waiting for other departments to resolve issues is annoying. happy customers are the best part of the job.
good,Comission structure is changing every month. Every month At&t takes a little away from your pay out. Company has not come up with an agreement with the union.
good,"A typical day working with AT&T would all be determined on how much confidence you could keep through the day. Every morning was fun because it was high energy atmosphere, practicing what we needed to work on from the day before. Management was okay for an ICD, very systematic and super helpful in times of need. The hardest part of the job was building ""bullet proof"" skin for the sales world. Being able to handle rejection and negative feedback appropriately were some of the main things I had to learn. The loving and very helpful environment was the most enjoyable part of the job because I knew everyone was there to help out and grow as a team!"
good,"AT&T is a good place to work. They are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Paid training, customer service is high paced, call after call. Benefits are good. Pay is god also."

good,"Great place to work when I was there. They had an hourly plus commission pay structure. Had to hit numbers or could lose job, but that is sales. Great benefits"
good,This company offers excellent pay and training but needs to do more to balance work with home life. I was very fortunate to work with a great group of co workers and had an excellent manager
good,There so many opportunities working here in AT&T but you have to work for it to get in the program. I have a great time working here and I highly recommend this place for my friends. I will surely miss this amazing place.
good,"This position no longer exists.  However, company was fair to employees.  Diversity encouraged, management was fair and pleasant. My job was management and gave me an opportunity to travel."
good,A typical day would be account reviews.  The workplace culture was virtual as i was a remote worker.  The hardest part was being a liaison for issues that i had to relay back and forth.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers resolve issues and streamline their accounts

good,Have a great boss and enjoy many of the people I work with. Enjoy the challenges but get frustrated from lack of upper management support. Learning something new everyday is what I search for.
good,"At  the end of the day, its not about the people, its about the numbers. Everything is micro tracked for performance. Opportunities for advancement are few and far between."
good,"Well working in the installation/Technician Field is very exciting and challenging, as you determine your financial pay. The more work you complete the more you earn. This form of salary can be difficult because you don't get paid a hourly wage. Just by job completion. Meeting customers satisfaction is the main goal of my job and I love it."
good,"AT&T is a huge global company and you feel like a worker bee that doesn't really know what the other worker bees are doing. They pay fairly, but expect long hours."
good,"In my own opinion, working at this company requires you to maintain your skills and to have a plan to increase them. To stay, you must work. Slouching or being dead wood is simply not acceptable."
good,It was a family-oriented atmosphere when I worked there and I'm not sure what it is like now. I enjoyed working in the call center because of all of the good people there. Each supervisor I had was great to work for.
good,I enjoyed my time with Cingular. There were ample opportunities to learn new things. There was a good work life balance. Good work was always recognized financially and verbally.
good,The level of expertise from most co-workers was at a high standard.  The legacy DirecTV employees provided for a start-up atmosphere which the AT&T acquisition turned into a corporate bureacracy. Lots of Silicon Valley types with a mix of typical millenial corporate ladder climbers.  Excellent technology and systems.  Nothing seems to go down in terms of systems and software.  Excellent cafeteria food.
good,"Managers at AT&T typically spent their day conducting call observations, providing concurrent coaching. Additionally, there was a management staff meeting most days that provided current updates."
good,"Due to restructuring changes, I ended up working remotely (from all clients and colleagues).   This environment, although workable, is not that desirable, as all social aspects of working are removed."

good,the wireless industry in the 1990's was a market driven industry and it was interesting to watch the industry grow develop into a profit driven industry.

good,"Prestaciones superiores, excelente ambiente, cero discriminación, marca prestigiosa, lo único mal es que suben de puesto a personas que no tienen lo necesario solo tienen antigüedad"
good,Worked as a programmer for the AT&T wireless department. Was totally challenged everyday at work and had fun doing it and learned a very lot about programming.
good,This job was great. I would still be employed had it not been for hurricane Matthew. They did offer other job sites but I was unable to accept any of them.
good,"Most employees work hard to establish relationships and provide a high level of service, and some give/cooperation from management would go a long way"

good,"Very face paced at times, some days was heavy and others days no work at all. Temporary assignment, i worked a little over a year. Shipping phones all over the world on daily basis"
good,"I loved my years at AT&T, but chose to leave due to the every-6-month layoff schedule. They cut so deeply that even top performers like myself had to endure this evaluation. They finally offered severance to those who would volunteer to leave, an I took that opportunity."
good,"Selling third party products, and managing businesses' products on behalf of AT&T is a challenge, Every sale was backboned by high pressure, because each upgrade included a 2 year renewal plan per company. TMG, due to being a third party vendor was closed during my work experience with them."
good,Great company. I feel the management could be better for the department I worked in. There was slot of unanswered questions we as new employees would have. I must say they have an extensive sales training course that last 8 weeks I was able to implement those tactics throughout my whole sales career.
good,the job was great very competitive great pay great people family type atmosphere I wish I didn't leave it was there over 10 yrs and enjoyed it if it wasn't for management id still be there
good,Great job for those that adjust well to changes daily. Very rewarding income and advancement is all up to you. They hire up within. Just keep your metrics good and you can go as high as you want.
good,"AT&T is an excellent place to work even in these corporate times,..the respect their people 'more' than most XYZ inc's.  Excellent technical experience gained here."
good,"My first factory job.  It was hard to get used to at first, high paced, and not much communication with co-workers.  Everyone had a rate to make if you wanted to achieve bonus.  I got used to the high pace work after receiving my first paycheck."
good,"I managed a module of 10 large Fortune 1000 accounts that billed a minimum of 5 to 20 million to AT&T per year.  My typical day at work would be conference calls and face to face meetings with clients.  Following up on emails/ calls, scheduling appointments and calls, and participating in team meetings/ training classes. Putting together Powerpoint presentations, responding to RFP requests, updating our SalesForce app, and negotiating each client's contract discounts and terms with our ICB team."
good,AT&T is a good place to work. Pay and benefits are good. Work life balance is good. The only complaint is that IT jobs are being outsourced at a fast pace.
good,"I have worked central office and outside plant never saw aping pong table on site.NO free lunch, first level supervisor seeking to further his or her career by undermining his senior employees.It's not your dad's Ma Bell."
good,"identify the need of each customer in specific and providing a solution to each of their concerns, directing the customer with the area in charge according to their need and thus meeting the goals proposed by the company in terms of sales and optimal quality of service,"
good,"El trabajar en att es una empresa muy buena, las comisiones son. Bien pagadas, excepto que no siempre impactan en sistema."
good,"My days consists of follow up to previous work done. Working new work requests. 1 or 2 times a month, I am a service leader for our complex teams to assist peers when they run into issues with their work. When not service lead I am on one of our inbound ques to assist our end user and internal customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers solve their problems. By far the most gratifying when the issue is resolved.  Getting to work with great people to help and support one another makes going into the office a joy.
good,Very competitive work environment. Company changes often so its important to be flexible. The position is union so you are protected in many ways.  Generally a good place to work as long as you like sales.
good,"I've been working for at&t for two years now and I have enjoyed the work experience and competative sales environment. My co-workers and company create a family oriented atmosphere, that makes you feel appreciated and makes you want to work hard. However the recent take over of Management has given me an impression to seek out other opportunities for work. I really enjoy sales and customer service, but I feel the tasks we have recently been required to perform, are not appropriate in accordance to our pay wages."
good,It was a good place to work with great benefits but being a big company job security is lacking.  The manager I had wasn't always available when you need to get question answer while on the the job.
good,"As in most customer care call centers most of your day is spent explaining customers bills to them or educating them on how to use their products and services.  Many callers we irate and abusive because they had ""mistakes on this bill"" while, most often, the only mistake was actually in the customer's math..."
good,"A great place to work, but they need to increase the salary and commission. The company  profit vs Employee commission is very unbalanced. The work/life balance is good, but sometimes you get transferred to a store that is far from home."
good,I've been an employee here for 4 years. It has been a pleasure working for AT&T. The environment is friendly and they treat their employees well. I have enjoyed it.
good,"The Most enjoyable part of the job was providing the best cable services to new customers. The looks on their faces would be priceless. We call it the ""wow"" affect."
good,"it was ok, I would recommend it. management was fine, pay not great. unable to work from home in a position that would allow it. promotion was minimal."
good,The company itself is greedy and money hungry like all large corporations but the people you work with are great and go out of their way to help. Management and supervisors are also very helpful.
good,"I like the company is very flexible and great at keeping their employees updated in the upcoming skills. "
good,Great company that provides opportunity for advancement. Working for an authorized retailer we changed hands multiple times which in turn changed our compensation with each transition.
good,"I can't speak for how AT&T may or may not be running the show, I left before they bought DirecTV."
good,Working with AT&T as a premises technician was very difficult and very rewarding. A very fast pace and accuracy in work was always expected. The company had great benefits and paid very well.
good,"Rescheduling your shift every 6 months takes getting used to, but they are upfront with those details and with what they expect of you. As a Union shop, some rules and regulations can seem petty but as everyone adheres to them they are not onerous. Great employee/employer attitudes and fabulous management."
good,Working for AT&T was very exciting as they are a true leader in mobility and entertainment. Very competitive place to work but also very rewarding knowing the company was not going to fade away like others in the industry.
good,"This is a great company to work for in regards to wages and benefits. It is an extremely sales driven position, with frequent changes in products, goals, and the overall direction of the company, so employees need to adjust to change quickly. Schedules are 100% seniority based, so you will work nights and weekends for your first few years, and there's nothing you can do about it. Attendence is also incredibly strict, with disciplinary action taking place after 5 missed or late days per year, and you will be automatically fired after 8 late or missed days. This is regardless of sickness or emergency."
good,"I learned that in sales that sometimes no matter how hard you try, some sales will not close.  I worked for this company almost three years.  I was a great atmosphere and very supportive of their employees.  They trained the sales force in the products and the management was supportive in helping.  I learned that often times in sales, a person will have a good year followed by a slow year.  The monthly compensation was not met by me no matter how hard or how many hours I worked.  I included that sales manager in many large deals and we were not able to close the sales cycle.  This was a hard job to leave, but I had to recognize that the goals were not being met."
good,AT&T was a great place to work as it allowed me to better my skills on communication and tackle more responsibility. On a typical day I would be in charge of taking phone calls or assisting customers via a chat system.
good,"AT&T Corp., originally the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, is an American telecommunications company that provides voice, video, data, and Internet telecommunications and professional services to businesses, consumers, and government agencies. During its long history, AT&T was at times the world's largest telephone company, the world's largest cable television operator, and a regulated monopoly. Today, the company is a subsidiary of AT&T Inc. and its subsidiary AT&T Communications still provides long distance service across the United States."
good,The Work life balance is good. We also receive Perks at work. There is scope for learning new technologies. It is a nice friendly atmosphere. People will enjoy working here.
good,"Typical day at AT&T can be hectic.  Learned project management, telephony technology, AVPN Networks, Protocols, IGEMS, FFLOW.  Management was always fair.  Workplace culture professional and diversified.  Hardest part of the job unexpected problems and processes that could get in the way of the work you were trying to accomplish.  When you overcame these obstacles and delivered the solution to the end customer."
good,learned alot about tech support and what all goes into internet connection and the many varibles that make it work. management is great there real supportive. the best part of the day is getting someones internet back on or set up.
good,"Great experience working for AT&T... learned a lot, cutting edge technology, high sense of right.  This all comes at a cost.  AT&T is a company of acquisitions, so constant change is the norm.  If you can thrive in that kind of environment, AT&T will give you the opportunity and tools to do so."
good,"The typical call center environment.  1-hour lunches, two 15minute breaks and great people.  Frequent training.  Opportunites to advance, although not too often.  The most consistent thing there is CHANGE.  AT&T = at this time"
good,If you are fully aware of what it means to be a salesman then this is a fine job. Nothing actually wrong with it. It's fine. Just be ready to deal with customers like anywhere else and met certain quotas by a certain time
good,"This job is not for an average person. you must be good in alot of areas. You must have great people skills, be able to solve problems. Keep up with customers and there needs. Be able to handle power tools and maintain a safe working enviroment.Maintain a good driving record."
good,"We handled collection accounts from AT&T. The challenging part on the job is that, you need to turn every incoming call into a collection. Meaning, whether the customer called in to ask for his balance status or just asking for a simple inquiry, you must collect money from the customer or atleast make a payment schedule."
good,"I was very satisfied working for At&t as a customer service representative. The day would consist of talking with customers about their billing questions/concerns, At&t devices and related products, as well as selling them, too. I would find the workplace environment was rather quiet considering it was a call center."
good,"We were just a bunch of kids having fun and getting the job done. I drove lowboys, dump trucks, and even an end dump. all the equipment was brand new and well taken care of. We worked all over and was a great experience to see different parts of the country."
good,"Pay is great, benefits are great. Union rolls over for the company to do whatever they want with the ""Wire technician"" job title under the network addendum. Quality of life for core employers and employees under the ""network addendum"" is night and day difference."
good,"Working for AT&T has been a great learning experience for me since my career with AT&T started as a Freshman in High School by taking a Pilot Career Program. Great pay, great benefits and lots of continuation learning & self development."
good,"Superiores muy agradables, crecimiento laboral, buenos compañeros."
good,"buena cultura corporativa, mucho aprendizaje y muy buen ambiente laboral"
good,"AT&T is a telecom giant and excellent place to learn various technologies if needed, and excel your knowledge in your project. The management is very good and the managers are well aware of their jobs."
good,"Depending where you go in this company. In retail, I'd recommend this to someone whos in college or to someone that does not think college is for them. You can make a lot of money in the (retail) side. But I would not recommend this to anyone that has a family or any other things going on. This company will demand ALL your time. BUT IT WAS A FUN EXPERIENCE. If I were still single, and no kids. I'd still be with them probably."
good,Great Company to work for.  The management team is very helpful and is always available for any questions or possible training needed to help new associates.  The benefits were great also.
good,"A typical day consist of working in a call center speaking over 100 customer per day. I received extensive customer service training which enhanced my skills to details and listening. The workplace culture provide customers with communication devices, home entertainment, and home security.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the assisting customer"
good,I really enjoyed working at the concession stand. It was a fast paced environment where we had to greet customer and assist their needs.The staff members were very nice and easy to work with.
good,A work day at AT&T could be a slow day or fast pace. You do what you can to provide the customer with great customer service while also finding ways to provide them with promotions and new services that might benefit the them as well.
good,"When I began my journey with AT&T, the management was eager to assist and there was great training tools for each job offered. As management changes, management styles change and so does the atmosphere of the company."
good,work is enjoyable and all team members used to work together and helps each other in critical issues at the release time. Great benefits and pay.  work culture is great
good,Es muy buen Lugar para laborar y ganar experiencia
good,"Managed and develop installation project plans and timelines, assist in tracking milestones, supports escalations and available to supply job status in project meetings. "
good,"There was no typical day at AT&T. Each customer provides a different issue from device understanding to network problems. The job requires a compassionate understanding, active listening, and conflict resolution to be successful."
good,"From what I do remember, the job itself was good. It was a customer service position. Customers would call in to discuss there bills, services and available plans for them. It was a good job."
good,"High sales quotas, however give you lots of incentives to accomplish these goals. Managers always seem to be willing to help. Long hours can be difficult."
good,This was my first full time job.  My days went by fast because it was a call center with a fast paced environment. The benefits were great when I was there.
good,If you're interested in the telecommunications business is absolutely the best place to be. Is not only the #1 company of its kind but also the one leading the way for the rest of them. It's one or two steps ahead all his competitors.
good,Sort of stressful. Call volume can fluctuate and the pressures of meeting quotas can become overwhelming at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fun atmosphere most of the time and activities. The hardest part of the job was the frequent changes in   goals required to be met and sometimes the call volume became an issue.
good,"Due to the changing map of technology and its impact on productivity continuous product updates/revisions were expected on a weekly basis.  The impact of these changes affected personal selection, and often lead to reassignment of staff which could not manage the on-going updates, and their current responsibilities."
good,"CoWorx was a healthy competitive environment to work in, they provided good commissions and extra hours offered to work. I would have stayed if my Dept. hadn't transferred out from the company."
good,AT&T is a great place to work but there was no work life balance and there was not really room to grow . You could be put in a management roll but never promoted to actual manager. If you needed to take time off because of being sick there wasnt any sick times just points and a point system is never set up for people that have a family especially with little children.
good,Sales is the name of the game. You have to be on top of your game and know your sales tactics. Setting in the workplace really pushes you to be your best.
good,"A great place to work that embraces diversity, develops managers and provides opportunities to learn all areas of the business.  I like that we don't have a typical work environment.  We have open space seating where you can collaborate with your team, use of media that allows you to work remotely and meet with others outside of your location (ie. Skype, telepresence, webex).  The culture is very cultivating, it allows you to do your work, develop yourself via employee resource groups mentoring sessions, AT&T university courses and team building activities.  Your day and your journey is what you make it."
good,"In ATT we were working in team ans support help each other with realizing , its so natural and of course a lots of fun , we talk and to technical things and many more."
good,"I love my job. I enjoy the travel, and working to meat the costumers need and desires.  It is a great product that I install.  I'm always happy to sell because I know that the customer would like the end results."
good,"Very intuitive and constant development. An excellent support staff and with a positive atmosphere. For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be a Trainer. When I was younger, I pretended I was a teacher teaching several elementary school subjects to my stuffed animals. Working with many different types of people you get a new perception on how hard and smart people can be."
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T. I was a temp there and it was next to impossible to become permanent. So being a temp you always got the horrible hours. My last supervisor was good and supportive.
good,Lots of floor support. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Opportunities for cross-training. There is constant training so that you are always in tip top shape.
good,"At&t is a giant employer with many branches spread all over. There can be a lot of red tape when it comes to trying to get your job done and some of the decisions by management can be irritating. Overall, the job experience can be a positive one, and union membership guarantees benefits and hours."
good,"Project manager in charge of connecting, disconnecting and migrating data lines from SW Bell to AT&T. Worked closely with the technicians and gather information from various data bases and schedule installations, disconnects and migrations. Often worked with other out of town AT&T PMs and SMEs on bigger projects. Occasionally had contact with customers when an over night move was required. "
good,"I think a good place to work,  some work environments allowed unprofessional  conduct by employees, but  for the most part the benefits , time off , tons of training , and I thought stability but when SBC came in and bought out AT&T everything just came down to the numbers, customer service when out the window and so did thousands of employees."
good,Great place to work the culture is great regardless of your age your age! Work environment was very competitive but friendly competition which made you want to get the sales. My only negative thing would be the quotas. Sometimes the quotas were difficult to meet and if your customer would return the merchandise you would have a negative balance.
good,"Desde que entre a la empresa Muchas satisfacciones como empleada en comisiones muy bien  hubo varias etapas como Iusacell Grupo Salinas, Iusacell Televisa, nuevamente Grupo Salinas y ahora AT&T bastante bien"
good,AT&T once was a company you were proud to work for. Today that is not the case. They have been cutting people back on a very regular basis and the pay is terrible.
good,"Till now, my professional career is growing day by day with present organisation and also want make this continue with others top MNC companies."
good,"good companies and benefits, but the company is really sketchy and they dont value their employees, Treat them like they are easily replaced even if they are the best Technicians they have"
good,"was a great place to work at first, once the merge with dtv it kinda went down hill, you have to be acceptable to change and working in rough conditions......the job has easy days, but more times than not you cannot be scared to work because this job is based all on numbers as far as effiecency and quality and some metrics you will not be able to meet, some jobs you cant complete and you will be graded on that......if you have a good mindset and don't mind climbing poles, being in attics, or under houses and always being at or in complete strangers house you will be fine..... I made 47000 my first year with lots of overtime but that is long gone, no more overtime"
good,"A typical day includes, starting off with a training or pep talk for the employees, managing inventory, scheduling employees, handling complaints, counting money, helping the sales rep sale."
good,"This is a job that is good for people that like to work with other people. A very sales driven work environment but very good pay for retail job. If you do great sales numbers, you have the potential to grow with the company."
good,I really enjoyed my time at AT&T and had hoped to retire as an AT&T employee. Worked with a dedicated group of people who believed in the work we were doing. If offered the opportunity I would return in a heartbeat.
good,"I prefer not to answer this question.  Everyone experience is different, and I believe not to take advise from someone's personal experience, and suggest everyone take the chance of learning how they feel about the organization they choose to work for."
good,I worked with AT&T for 17 years and learned so much that has allowed me to continue to use my knowledge and experience. I had some great times and some fun times working at AT&T.
good,"great company to work for, i loved the culture and experience the only  bad experience that I can mention is more so upward mobility, its based off who you know and not entirely on your performance . customers in the wireless industry can very difficult and have an extreme sense of entitlement."
good,Favoritism was always shown but overall the place was a great place to work and the people respected the others.  Pay was competitive and fair. Easily.
good,"AT&T is very focused on teaching and training. There are many opportunities to learn new skills. Not only that, most of the coursework is free. Also there are many degree programs at different colleges that are discounted for being an AT&T employee."
good,Excellent place to work with managers who are willing to work to better their employees rather than blame them for their group's shortfalls. I would recommend anyone to work here.
good,"very nice place to work with good management, Worked with your schedule. Non stressful atmosphere.  The only reason why I left was that I was moving out of the area."
good,I lived in Greenville when I was hired on. I then transferred to Florida and I really enjoyed the job. I was with a great group of guys. I then transferred back to Mississippi. i left the job cause they did not care for the plant or the quality of service I became use to.
good,"It a job for the long haul.  Not much change, pretty consistent.  Lots of hard work but lots of good people........................................................"
good,"Responsible for the attention in the fixed point of the company attracting clients, offering mobile plans or fixed line with allied companies like Avantel, DirecTV, Tigo, Comcel and Movistar; Personal or corporate plans."
good,"Good company to work for healthy families; however medical  insurance isn't so good for those who get sick a lot. For example just to see a doctor in network, it's a 200$ per visit charge using ATT lowest deductible medical plan of 5K approx per year. So if you are looking for full medical benefits or you get sick often best to seek a company with full medical benefits with no deductible plan; otherwise if your family members healthy most of the years, it's a good company for family. Btw, deductible plans are cheaper than 0 deductibles; hence a company can save more money by providing deductible plans with large caps. However for those who must have 0 deductible plans, those companies may not be able to hire really good employees who seek the best coverage or may lose them later after a company offers better coverage."
good,The job is very easy and decent. Employees are awesome. Management wasn't too bad. You did have a few bad seeds when it comes to management. The hours weren't that great because you have to vote on hours and it was based on seniority. The pay is decent and you got bonus' and raises. The union contract time also stinks because you never know what's going to happen or if you are going to have to go on strike to have fair pay and time off.
good,Great job until closed due shift in telecom from copper landlines to VOIP. Outstanding pay and benefits. Local management and co-workers were awesome. Best job I've ever had.
good,"Here I worked at several stores doing training for managers,"
good,"Great work environment, professionalism, and benefits."
good,The way my manager jelled with me and helped me work with little supervision is commendable. She is the best boss ever in my life till date. The Project Head from AT&T is very down to Earth and helps to relieve my stress at work. Occasional team lunches were great.
good,I started at 17.75.....now finding that anywhere is hard. This company definitely invests in its employees even though advancement takes a while its still a great place to work
good,"I worked for AT&T for over 20 years. Overall, I'd consider it a great place to work. They provide challenging, interesting projects and the workload was manageable. The people are great. "
good,"While at AT&T, formerly SBC I had a great experience while working here. I met quite a few amazing people and the culture was definitely a great asset."
good,great product and I was able to relocate with the company several times. Other than retail hours the job is fun and you can make some very good money.
good,"Technical support was very fast paced and stressful. We had to provide remote support over the phone withou the device actually being there to put hands on. Overall, I really enjoyed the job and helping customers figure out their issues and resolving them."
good,Time management leaves something to be desired.  You must work in any weather conditions and rules for missed work are nearly impossible to meet without it being ruled unexcused
good,Enjoyed my time there i would still be there if not for some family issues that caused me to have to leave. I learned so much in my time there. This was the only sales job I have ever had and working there I would consider doing it forever
good,Great company to work for with a number of benefits and opportunities. The industry is changing and AT&T is leading the way so changes will effect every level.
good,"working for AT&T gives you the opportunity to grow in the company, to learn in your area of work and gives you important benefits. The management can improve as in many other places."
good,You will definitely earn your paycheck. Good benefits. Sometimes forced to work overtime. Enjoyed my time working there for a while but I have had my fill.
good,"Handled outgoing calls from policyholders, responding to inquiries, resolving problems and correcting policy errors. Collecting outstanding debts. Used consultative techniques to provide opportunities to close clients"
good,"Come in and have a team huddle so we get a good idea of any current issues and how to handle them before we start taking calls. "
good,"Great opportunities and workplace culture."
good,awesome company that use to have advancement opportunities but is currently going through a restructure so surplussed a large percentage of their employees.
good,"Great Customer Appreciation.  "
good,"Great to start building customer service experience, team work and sales knowledge. They give a friendship welcome since first day. Working here daily is tough, but if you have the correct mood you can learn a lot."
good,"-great place to move up if you are good at networking."
good,"You drive your career path and get what you put in. If you want a good work-life balance, you can do that and be successful, or if you want to put in a lot of extra hours, you'll be recognized."
good,Great place to work with wonderful benefits. Learn a lot about technology and they train you constantly. Freedom to balance work and life and potential to make as much money as possible with hard work and ethics.
good,"Lo que más me gusto del trabajo fue conocer  gente, aprendi a ser aún mas sociable con gente que no conocia. La parte más difícil del trabajo era estar bajo el sol toda la mañana con mucho calor..."
good,At&t has a productive work place where we work as an ecosystem which we all work together. We open the door for customer and is walked out and we have a sales structure that will meet most of all of our customers needs. We work on building a connection and make sure our customers Are satisfied
good,good company to work for - good health and insurance benefits offered - matching $2 for every $3 submitted in the 401k is a very attractive - discounts on cellphone and on DIRECTV
good,"Calculated rates for company’s products and  services, collected deposit or payment, collected overdue bills, detected discrepancies on  customer’s bills and  corrected, Examined financial documents, made  decisions, prepared recommendations based upon   research, provided customer service, Resolved customer complaints, sold products and  services, took  messages, Used computers to  enter, access or retrieve data. Answered Avaya Multi-line phones and inquiries transferring calls or taking messages when needed."
good,"You were able to help people with their needs.  Things were done by seniority, good benefits & retirement.  I liked being in a union and not having to worry about my job."
good,"People tend to stay at AT&T for many years because of the excellent salary and especially the benefits; the business is complex, encompasses an ever-evolving range of technologies and commensurate opportunities to work in many areas. The company has exceptional in house  training opportunities to enable career transitions. That said, the company is huge and therefore one may need to choose  becoming an expert in one area and developing laterally, or upward mobility."
good,This was a good company to work for. I worked here years ago so I am not sure if it is the same. The only issue was the salary cap and low pay. It was also far for me to travel.
good,"Only concern here was lower management being allowed to use personal issues to remove employees. Money was great, customers were great on most days. Advancement is usually blocked due to the lower management issues"
good,I owe at&t a lot when it comes to my sales skills. The training at&T provides is great. If you like long hours and great overtime pay than at&t is the place for you.
good,"es un buen ambiente de trabajo me quedaba cercas de mi domicilio, solo que el salario no estaba bueno ."
good,"Sales is never boring.  I get to help people with one of the most valued possessions in today's fast past world, their phone.  I enjoy finding out what technology fits their daily lifestyles and getting them the best packages and prices to suit their family or personal needs. Technology is ever changing and I'm able to stay on top of the latest and greatest items in the mobile arena. AT&T has a great workplace culture. The hardest part of working at AT&T is the retail ever changing work hours. AT&T pays well and offers great benefits."
good,Good place to work could have more flexible days set schedule weeks of vacation go by years of service mental and physical job great job security if you like getting additional work added to work load with no extra benefits
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. The training provided was adequate. I enjoyed working with the other technician. I worked about 10 hours a day.
good,"The work day at AT&T consists of receiving calls from customers, taking their payments, explaining bills as well as offering additional services to the customers. "
good,The management changes too often. Jobs are always surplused to a down graded pay scale. Job movements from one state to another. AT&T does have really great benefits.
good,"Fun new products and product training. Direct manager was awesome but upper management was not very friendly - at all. Used to be alot of fun, but once they started offering DirecTV employees just became about there numbers. No one cared to help you if you couldn't hit the numbers on your own - you became a target."
good,"Took inbound calls daily from customer with AT & T services or wanting the services. Processed payments, added services, removed services, technical support"
good,"PROS:"
good,"Given AT&T's size it's a stable company with good benefits because of the amount of employees enrolled. The amount of paid days off was very good. They do constantly shop for IT replacement, whether it be off-shoring or contracting. My position was one of many (30%) of the IT staff that was replaced by full-time employees in another country."
good,Stable company to work for  Non-management employees covered by union. Benefits are the best that can be found. Management is subjected to lesser benefits and job insecurity. Promotions very difficult.
good,"Typical day of answering all types of calls related to customer service with ATT. From angry customer to pleasant ones with many benefits and an atmosphere that cultivates excitement. Hardest part of the job as well as your main source of stress comes from the quotas of sales you now have to meet monthly. Upper management coaches to your numbers, if your performance is less than satisfactory and the type of job you perform can change along with your numbers. Career advancements is very slow."
good,It is a employee oriented company. Open to suggestion from the employee. Good salary and hike every year. Company policy is very good. There is one to one meeting with HR and you can speak about any of your issue.
good,The money is the best. the Full filment of products is very hard. Lots of training but it is hard work. They try to make you better but you have to be willing to listen and do the work. My main complaint is that it is too hard to get an order submitted and there are a lot of stupid rules on how items are sold. But the money is great if you are willing to work hard!
good,"overall satisfied with work & culture."
good,AT&T is a world leader in telecom and internet space. It is a great company to work with. I have learned new skills and professional skills working here.
good,"loved my job was fun fast work environment, technical, enjoyable, friendly co workers, would work again. possible pay increases."
good,"•	Assures compliance with all sanitation and safety requirements."
good,"Good place to work "
good,Fun and exciting environment and compensation was good.  Life balance available as it is a Monday through Friday job.  Great benefits and name that holds a lot of clout.
good,"While the jobs benefits were top notch, the quotas you had to meet to make really good money were, sometimes, unachievable. Also, they would roll out new plans and force their customers to switch to these plans."
good,My position at AT&T is a very challenging and Technical position.  This is the type of position I have always looked fort.  I am always looking for new and exciting challenges
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, a veces puede haber mucho trabajo y se pasa rapido el dia, aprendi a cerrar ventas con empresas y generar un contacto y relacion con mis clientes, la gerencia no tiene mucho tiempo laborando con nosotros pero nos mantiene ocupados y trabajando, buen trabajo de equipo, lo dificil del trabajo es no tener un area de trabajo para mi solo y trabajar con interrupciones debido a esto, lo que mas me gusta es la cercania y el apoyo para seguir estudiando."
good,Great place to work with higher than average compensations for entry level positions. I was able to learn a lot about leading a team and the telecommunications industry.
good,"Job is more strict than expected. While the flexibility is great, the company tries to control how you use your time."
good,"Have fun at work while being sales productive"
good,"plenty of training, nice compensation plan, all the mergers and acquisition left all the California people in a redundant position as the jobs kept leaving the state with the corporations decision makers."
good,I learned a lot here. Always changing and pushing technology to the next level. I like that AT&T doesn't force you to learn but gives you access and resources to learn. Self development is encouraged
good,I worked on business development opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean and the work was interesting. The work has changed as the company is no longer expanding in those areas.
good,"AT&T Order Management teams were run with liberal freedom, as long as your Team Mgr. felt that your were keeping up with the assignments, you were left to your own devices. There were a variety of reports that an Order Mgr. had to respond to. As long as you were able to address the orders reported with issues you were OK. There was some flexibility on off-premise work, which helped with the work-life balance. The hardest part of the job often involved the resolution of orders that developed issues that may have what seemed like simple problems, as corrective actions may involve several systems."
good,"I enjoyed my 10 years with the company. Great leadership. I would rejoin the organization again in the future. Diversity was great, but need more trust and vision for allowing it's employees to work offsite."
good,"Working at AT&T has been nothing but great. I have gained alot of experience in the home networking field that I will be able to carry with me forever. Experience that will carry over to new opportunities that await in the future. AT&T has been good to me. They do have opportunity for advancement but not so much in the Cisco Networking field. "
good,"A typical day at work is coming in and looking at daily calendars to be aware of what is going on with my supervisors.  Complete task and assist department with any needs they may have."
good,"AT&T is a stereotypical ""good company"". It comes with all you would expect based on the old American dream of go to school and get a get job paradigm."
good,"Good job for people that like to work outdoors. Hours can be long but the pay and you have to deal with the elements but all  around a good job. Management can be great or terrible, it just depends on your location."
good,"Wonderful company with great people.  Exceptional management training program!  The leadership and continually opportunities for advancement made this a great place to work.  I meet many great people that mentored me and fostered my success.  Great rewards programs, commissions, contests to help the competitive fun in sales and promote the desire to be the best!"
good,At&T was a great company to work for. The hours were consistent and they will work with you on school  and hours. I didn't work for at&T but I worked for a contract company with AT&T. I learned a lot about at&t products and company. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers but you have to learn the job and know how to have patience with the customers.
good,Very relaxed place to work and great coworkers supervisors management you learn a lot about sales management customer service communication computer and database great job if you like to work with the general public
good,"Worked closely with field technicians using company proprietary software to assist with At&t service installs. Duties included Network support, MS office products support etc."

good,Working for AT&T was an enjoyable experience. My coworkers were all treated like family with respect. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the interaction with the each other.
good,"loved the job, some of the people were just taking up space, had great jobs, but always had something to say about what they did not like about the company."
good,"I learned a lot working at ATT Digital life. The company helped me prioritize my life by having available schedules that were easy to work. Also, the benefits were great; being that I have an asthmatic son, this is very important."
good,only knock I have on AT&T is the job security portion. Every quarter was a worry if you were surplus. AT&T offered great benefits and good work enviroment. Strong leadership at the top but no loyalty to the everyday employee.
good,Definitely a challenging place to work . I've worked here now for many years and am now looking forward to the day when I can make a career change. My ideal job would be to work at a U.S. embassy. In particular I would like to assist foreign tourists and /or dignitaries.
good,Overall att is a great company to work for. My coworkers are friendly. The area I work in is east to navigate. Most customers are friendly. The only real issues I have are the micromanagement and lack of knowledge in our customer service team.
good,"•	Planning, organizing, controlling and monitoring projects "
good,it was a fast pasted job where you helped all sorts of different people each and everyday. Had to go over customers bills and phones if they had questions.
good,My work day at AT&T was busy most of the time. I learned lot from AT&T due the changes in the company is going thru telecommunication industry. My co-workers was great to work with and we worked good together to help each other out. The hardest part of my job that were we were being micro managed to much. I enjoyed with my co-workers due to it as like a family atmosphere.
good,"The management, culture, and amount of work is only made tolerable by the level of benefits, the ability to move up and around the company, and the pay rate at certain levels. If you are not driven and motivated, the work will be too much and the leadership grating; recommend applying for this job if you really like AT&T and what they do, or if wanting to just get a foot in the door on a Fortune 500 giant."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work. However, job security has been dwindling over the last 24 months. I appreciate AT&T for the invaluable work experience and hate that i have to consider leaving AT&T but they are eliminating my current position."
good,My typical day at work consisted of morning conference calls to discuss the prior nights events and what were the results. I learned all of the pertinent operating systems and programs needed to perform the job. My coworkers and I worked well together coordinating the schedule for the field engineers for the maintenance window. The hardest part of the job was juggling the various jobs and the wide variety of skills that each engineer had matching them with the right job for the evening. And the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction knowing that I was able to contribute to such a large scale operation.
good,A typical day at work would be go in have our daily stand up meetings. See if the developers deployed any new Function to test or any bug that needed retesting.
good,I have worked here for 15 years and I enjoy the people I have come across during my tenure. I have learned about the telecommunications world and also learned Microsoft Office as well as other systems used in businesses every day.
good,I enjoyed my time working as a contractor. The pay is very good and the schedule is flexible to be able to handle personal issues.
good,"Providing world class training and offering ongoing career development and advancement opportunity, AT&T is an excellent organization to begin and develop a career."
good,"I greatly enjoyed working here. There were always incentives and fun, themed activities that kept employees excited about coming to work. Our work day was always filled with small challenges among our teams with prizes for the top rep. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interactions with y coworkers."
good,Great please to work you get to learn a lot about phones and great new deals like direct tv or uverse .  The environment is a great place to work
good,"come in clock in and start working.  Pretty much on your own minimal interaction for help.  people are normally very nice, and supervisors interact well."
good,Must be able to meet sales quota as well as provide customer service. Enjoyable atmosphere but selling is utmost important. Sometimes the scheduling is conflicting since it changes monthly.
good,This was a and alright place to work. This call center had very friendly and hard working employees. At this location majority of the head people were really cool.
good,AT&T is a fun place to work! They are always at the forefront of technology and provide you with the necessary training to sell.
good,"Fast Pace work environment "
good,AT&T is truly a good company to work for. The monthly compensations are outstanding which is a motivation within itself. I would and have recommended AT&T to others for employment.
good,This has been a great company to work for. The benefits and perks off AT&T services is a great addition to your overall compensation package. The company has a great work/personal life balance in most areas of the company with the exception of retail store positions or customer service positions.
good,"AT&T is a massive company and thus has amazing pay and benefits. The compensation is outstanding for entry level sales people, making around $55,000 their first years. As a Sales Coach it was a very demanding position and didn't offer much room for career growth (despite what the company boasts). The management was okay and I visited HQ a couple times, all Sr. Mangers are very disconnected with the customer facing sales force."
good,Very powerful Company and name brand. The infrastructure for both wireless and wire line products are superb.  Very high energy sales environment that aided to an excellent sales environment.
good,Solo un pero y es el momento actual donde solo importa el dinero generado o rentabilidad y se perdió la calidad humana
good,"Challenging job, requires constant training and on the job learning. Dealing with customers at their premises is probably the most challenging part. No accepting of tips"
good,"As a lead retail sales consultant, I am lucky enough to have a well balanced store manager who is both understanding and tough when need be. As long as your are hitting your quota each month there should be no issues. But do make note, there are a lot of different services you are required to sell, not just phones. I have been there for three years and have not once dreaded going to work. On the negative aspect commission has decreased over the years and make it harder to make more money. Overall AT&T is an entry/medium level job for someone who enjoys learning and selling new technology in a fast paced environment."
good,Teams of talented employees in a fast paced environment. Work environment is team and project focused with processes-driven work environment. Company allowed employees to be involved in leading-edge projects and services.
good,I have been a employee for many years.  This company has provided great wages and benefits for me and my family. I have been a manager for some time now and have found the demands of the managers is difficult at times.  As a tech I found working for this company a good thing.  It can be hard on the body sometimes but it's worth it.
good,.learning experience working in different scenarios  travel around your area. every residence is different and must be very sociable
good,AT&T is an ever-growing company that evolved very quickly. Offers an abundance of advancement opportunities. Work life balance can be difficult in the retail environment but with the right staffing and coaching can be accomplished.
good,At&t does offer the opportunity to advance my skills that I can use for a future career. Also it gave me a chance to work with alot of different associates which always helps build on my communication skills
good,"AT&T is a good place to work overall; "
good,Independent work environment that allows a flexible schedule with a great wok life balance. AT&T has a great focus of customer service and strategic business plan. Must be able to work independently and be a self motivator.
good,I manage 16 sales representatives to reach sales goals. I have a vast knowledge of the sales process and customer service as well. I also have 16 years of managing experience in both a Union and Non- Union environment. The hardest part of my job is the high turnover and continually having to onboard new news. I love to see my team be number one and seeing my reps achieve more than they thought possible.
good,"Good place to work, strives to be about the employees"
good,"How to  work under stress and manage people with structured based coaching tactics, "
good,On a normal day I would start by answering calls from customers concerning their services and features. I would proceed to address their concerns and solve the problem as well as look for best offers to help them with
good,Es una empresa muy buena  el trato con los empleados es excelente
good,"Every day was different from the last. I learned how to troubleshoot and figure out the best and quickest way to install telephone and cable wires. Management was willing to coach and teach anytime there was an obstacle deterring me from completing a job. Co-workers were friendly and also willing to learn, as I was the lead technician. "
good,AT&T is a good company to work for they have great benefits. There is not much of a work/ life balance. The hours we work vary everyday. There is no certain time that we get off of work each day.
good,"Work hard but enjoy your time off and your time with family.  They want you to hit your goals and they reward you for your results, not just with compensation but with trips.  They are a great company to work for."
good,I was a Customer Service Rep. for AT&T.  I answer phone calls for customers. I placed payments. I helped customers trouble-shoot certain problems. I really enjoyed working for this company. I enjoy helping the customers
good,"The usual day at work start with planning and prioritizing what needs to accomplish, generally the top 3 key item. Then perform health check of the critical applications "

good,"Typical work day is fast paced, juggling priorities and management of territories as well as relationship building in all aspects of the job and industry."
good,"A typical day at work is usually never the same day to day. Everyday provides a new challenge, group collaboration is highly encouraged. Working as a project manager I've learned what management style best fits me and have been allowed to development my management skills. My co-workers are enthusiastic creating an atmosphere of learning and development.The most enjoyable part of my day is resolving issues, providing a seamless experience for my customers. The most challenging part of my day is taking on products that have been newly implemented."
good,"I enjoy working at Directv. It's a fast paced and fun environment. The benefits are excellent. Recently we have merged with ATT. This has changed the dynamics of the day to day routine. I take a wide variety of calls. Some are as simple as adding HBO. Others can be more difficult. If a customer has technical difficulties then it is my job to ask probing questions to determine what has caused the problem and then find the correct information to resolve their issue. The goal is to fix it over the phone but sometimes a service call is needed so I schedule it. The best part is fixing a problem that my customer was sure would be difficult. Reassuring them that they can do it. Then when it's resolved they are very excited. I try to give them the credit. Say things like, you did a great job, see I told you we could do it!! As a team we have fun by playing games in our chat forum. We also help each other by asking about things we're not sure of. I can honestly say that this is the only job I have ever had where I learn something new every day!!"
good,buen trato laboral y remuneraciones acorde al trabajo y trato muy satisfecho.
good,This job was fun and definitely requires someone who is outgoing and is not shy!! This job does has a lot of stress but you are going to have to deal with fast pace and requires most of your life. And this job can be great and can be bad just depends all on management. But the benefits are great and so it the pay.
good,"Total Quality Logistics has the most up to date, newly remodeled computer system. It will help any sales representative grow there book of business with no exceptions. With everything at the click of your finger. Failure is not an option."
good,"I learned a lot while working for AT&T, they have an excellent training program, which helped me to be great at customer service. Sometimes, I felt the sales pressure was to much, but overall it was a great experience."
good,"Really enjoyed working for this company. similar business structure as Apple another great company. Altough training was a little a little long, they offer a union, and push you to advance within company. Great benefits and pay."
good,"Good company, Good Benefits, Good people.  Although you could be micromanaged the end result was positive.  Management provides limited direction. The extensive size and age of contracts can be a bit  overwhelming while you learn them."
good,The job can be challengiong  at time. More support from management. Pay is good. I would reccommend job. Desk and phone job.
good,"Have held several different management positions with the company varied from web hosting, network operations, System Admin, cloud solutions. Day to day work depends on product being launched, management is very supportive and empowering."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work. It is challenging, along with fulfilling. A typical day of work involves upholding companies rules, and regulations to ensure my employees achieve their daily. I am also responsible for growing, and furthering my employees careers. Customer service is an essential part of my job. The customer is the biggest asset that we have as an organization. It is imperative that they are taken care of at all time. I am an expert in customer service, I take pride in it, and love doing it."
good,I have worked at a few call centers before but this place wasn't just rows of cubicles and you weren't treated like just a employee number. the cafeteria was a nice touch.
good,"A typical day at work for AT&T was fun. It was fast paced and always brought a new problem to the table for a new solution. Outside of the box thinking and attention to detail was very important. Management helped as they were hands-on with sales and solutions to problems. Peers were influential at work and out of work, good people, easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with slow days with no customers. Having a lot of down time with nothing to do besides training and cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job was the commission and dealing with new technology, constantly learning and growing."
good,A typical day at work was speaking on the phone be a problem solver. What I have learned is that every customer will not be satisfied with the customer service provided for them. Management and co-workers were always busy. The language barrier was the hardest part of the job. Solving customers issues was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,good place to work where you need to keep up with technology to be able to offer all product. Sales goals are attainable. AT&T is selling security tv among other every day needs
good,while working for att most of my experience was actually pretty good but as the work began slow down things started to change for the worse. I acquired quit a few skill while working for att including wire work for housing and and a understanding how internet services work
good,The sales team received incentive laden challenges and contests to ensure productivity. Strong sales management team helped achieve sales goals and objectives.
good,"Great money and plenty of room for advancement. Long hours especially during the summer months. If you are not a part oft he union which the wire tech position is not, you miss out on some perks."
good,"Growth and Advancement possibility's. Overall It was a great company to work and grow with. No micromanagement, nice and spacious campus. Would consider coming back and working with them in the future."
good,"Responsible for putting generators on live cell sites w/o dropping them."
good,"As a manager, I lead a crew of technician who install and repair network services. Performance Manage employees."
good,"My time at AT&T was some of the best times of my life. I learned so much about myself and business operations. AT&T has no shortages of challenges to offer someone that wants to work hard and grow with the company. Customer service is always the top priority, but the employees are a close 2nd in regards to value to the company. I do miss my AT&T Career..."
good,The productive and professional yet relaxed environment made it a great place to work. Co-workers were great and made going to work enjoyable every day.
good,Great managers at ATT.  Nice place to work with balance with family/career.  I have worked here for 20 years and it overall has been great.  More in person train would be preferred instead of everything on line.  Management is involved on a daily basis.
good,"I have been working with ATT Mobility for a few years now and have for the most part enjoyed working for the company. It has its good days and bad days just like any other job though. For the most part, everyone is just trying to make ends meet and get through one day at a time. Direct managers are the first line of management and many of them are freshly promoted from floor reps so they know the types of situations we deal with firsthand, but the more tenured managers do not have the same experiences that newer managers and regular reps do. Regular workdays are spent just sitting on the phones for about 7 1/2 hours dealing with customers' complaints and questions. Many customers are a great pleasure to work with and resolve issues but some customers are just out to complain and nothing we do satisfies them, and unfortunately there is no way to just end the conversation with those types of customers, and as another downside, the way reps are scored is through ""random surveys"" that are sent to customers in a text message with 3 questions: How likely are you to recommend ATT; how did you like the rep; and if you had to call once, more than once, or still isn't fixed. The real complaint most reps have is that out of the almost 500 calls taken each month by each rep, most reps only see about 30-50 surveys come in, so the scores that dictate our bonuses and even our job security, so about 10% of a reps' calls mean their job is safe or they are close to being walked out. All in all, it is a challenging environment because it is difficult to tell when someone is yelling on the phone"
good,"The experience was great. The ability to meet new customers everyday, and not have to stay in a cubical, but rather go to their house or place of business made the job fun."
good,"Mobile QA testing on various iOS and Android devices includes testing on new features added on the apps, functionality and Omniture testing with the help of Charles, Wire Shark, Bloodhound and review Omniture logs for Video on Demand and Live TV Streaming."
good,"My normal day with AT&T usually starts at 0730 for five of the six days that I'm on duty. I leave my residence in my company van to the first assigned destination that was received via phone. For one of the six days of the week, I start at 0600 to turn all paperwork in, perform inventory, pickup and load supplies and /or equipment  into my work van. During a normal day I might repair communication equipment or cable, etc., If the company has numerous installation jobs pending, I might be assigned 2 or 3 installs and then after lunch I usually complete service calls ending my shift anywhere from 1700  2100."
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day,"
good,Here growth is possible but you must be willing o work and be consistent in all things not just the things that you want.... And be able to shift with change because AT&T is a very innovative company and on the rise and ready for 2020 .
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for. Lots of training available, fixable working hour and good work and life balance"
good,"At&t is just like any other salary commissioned job. It is whatever you make. You put in hard work, you'll reap the rewards and life is easy. You half do your duties and life at work can be real tough."
good,"I have worked for At&T for 1 year.Had a very good rapport the team mates.Njoyed working with them.Learnt a lot ."
good,Limited Job Security and Advancement. Craft Jobs should be based on Seniority and skill set but not always the case during a surplus.
good,"A typical day at work fun, friendly atmosphere. I learned how to resolve technical issues with cell phones, ipad, resolved billing issues, created technical cases. Co-workers were nice and helpful. Hardest part not being able to resolve the customer issues. Meeting new people celebrating success."
good,"I would recommend that anyone who is looking for a position with ATT understand that many groups are able to work from home while others mandate that all employees be in the same building and work a minimum of 8-5.  "
good,Great company that offers great benefits but is solely concerned with only the numbers you can produce.  A lot of people to work with who have different and enjoyable personalities.  Received monthly discounts on all At&t services.
good,This has been an exceptional opportunity to work in a high pressure environment supporting wireline data networks for large clients on a global stage. The teamwork accomplished between persons and teams dispersed around the globe was remarkable. I have grown an incredible amount with the past few years experience in operations and vendor management. Unfortunately due to company restructuring the UK division we represent will be off shored and therefore mass redundancy is taking place.
good,"Fast paced position "
good,Received a promotion and then there was a reduction in work force. Great moral and the management were great. Would love to still work here.
good,The hours really are taxing plus standing all day but can make good commission if willing to be aggressive and take lead in getting sales from customers.
good,A dynamic and positive atmosphere that encourages research and   innovation. Extremely engaging teams that are tireless looking for more efficient ways to serve its customers.
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T. They have many advancement opportunities, good pay, but commissions are hard to achieve. Just be ready to have a constantly changing culture/ products. If you can get use to that and go with the flow, then you will enjoy working here."
good,Great company to work for and have a long-term career.  Great benefits and fair pay.  A large corporations with fair localization and management.
good,"Working with AT&T taught me the art of sales.  Helping customers find exactly what they need while introducing them to the latest tech was such a gratifying experience.  My co-workers and I made such a great team, and went above and beyond what was required."
good,"Attend multiple meetings with Peers/Directors/Sellers."
good,working for AT&T helped me to understand that if you want to be successful in the work place you have to stride for success.
good,"DIRECTV Latin America was a wonderful company to work for, filled with spontaneity, fun projects, and camaraderie. Although it operated for 20 years it never lost its ""start-up"" spirit.  The management team felt ownership and pride in the company.  Now, about 8 months into the AT&T's take-over, the culture is changing, as expected, and becoming the old corporate US based company which AT&T represents.  "
good,"the most important aspect i learned was perfecting my patience and learning to treat everyone the right way. management was a little scrambled. there had been 3 different managers in my time working there. my coworkers were great people i am happy i got to know them and even out of work i still maintain contact with them. the hardest part of the job would have to people doing multiple upgrades for phones that were not entitled to the upgrade. the most enjoyable part of the job was actually fulfilling the customers wants and needs with high expectations, leading them to return to me for my expertise and service"
good,I really loved working at this company because I had a tremendous boss.  Everyone for the most part worked together which made the job more enjoyable.
good,Every customer was different and it was exciting get to use all of the different skills to assist customers.I learned to increase my people skills due to all the different personalities I came across.Management was always very helpful w/all the extra training classes. the hardest part of the job was working late into the nite. the easiest part was really being able to relate to build a nice rapport with customers
good,"Solid compensation, although it changes every season (Commission structure).  Once you pay your dues, so to speak, and build a solid rapport with your team, they'll bend over backwards to see you succeed.  Dealing with customers on a daily basis can be difficult, but rewarding."
good,"It's a great place to learn and grow technically.  You have to be willing and comfortable embracing change.  But if you don't like the way things are going, don't worry...it changes again in 6 months."
good,Great place to work for but the company needs to have a better way to get employees into management and on good shifts. The company would also benefit by having local human resource offices for employees.
good,Loved working here was a great career only left for another opportunity that was more promissing at the begining then it turned out to be.
good,"Me gusta brindar un buen Servicio al Cliente."
good,it is a good place to work and with a good work experience. the people that work is just the same place with a nice relations and good skills.
good,Definitely no free tickets there but if you work hard depending on where you are located there are lots of future options.
good,Working here does take a toll on your personal life because you work late alot of days - not knowing when you'll get off. But the coworkers make it an enjoyable job.
good,"Es una compañia grande, con buenos incentivos de venta,solo falta valores a colaboradores."
good,"The job was extremely diversified due to my tenure with one company. The workload was heavy. However, I was able to rely on  my experience and instnicts to overcome each and every challenge."
good,"I spent 8 years working for att and learned a great deal about how to treat people, not only the customers but also the employees. I learned how to manage from some great managers, as well, as some not so great managers. Overall it is a wonderful company to work for with a lot of room to grow."
good,"sales consultant assisting customers with trouble shooting and solutions for new product and services. great co workers I work with every day, we are like family. sales goals are challenging but can be obtainable. I enjoy the customer interaction."
good,"Typical work day you come in and just start cleaning or organizing until a customer shows up and from that point you help resolve there issue or you help them purchase a device. I learned to manage, sale, prioritize, and treat customers with respect. With every job you will have a bad manager once in a while. I had bad and good managers nothing more to say. Co-Workers were always great unless you sparked issues with them regarding commissions or customer order. Hardest part of the job was hitting key objectives that the company has set for you. Most enjoyable part is watching customers leave satisfied with not just AT&T but with you and how you did your job."
good,"flexible hours and awesome to be able to work from home. "
good,This is advertising sales and can be a very hard sale with so many different medias out there. I was an outside sales rep so I was beating the streets every day knocking on businesses doors. If you cannot accept NO for an answer this is not a job for you. Compensation is awesome and is rewarding when you help a business succeed.
good,"I was a very loyal employee for 26 years. Most of the years at Pacific Bell/SBC/AT&T were good years. I loved to work with my peers and had wonderful managers, for the most part. However, with time came a complete turn around of job requirements that became very difficult for most employees to adhere to. Our jobs had to gear towards numbers rather than quality. And as with almost every competitive market, numbers come first. Although I always met my numbers, I had to question what it is that I had to do in order to achieve them. I was originally trained that our customers should be #1 and then realized in todays' world, that was not the case. I enjoyed staying busy and learning many managerial tasks. The part I did not enjoy was getting abused and screamed at by our unhappy customer base who were not being taken care of properly by our company."
good,"Daily customer interactions bring challenges related to both technical troubleshooting and building the human connection while solving the technical issues. Call management, key skills to make customers happy, and problem solving skills through thoroughly investigating issues at hand. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable which is the customer. In my given position the customers only call in when they are having problems and the challenges I face is to properly fix and set expectations for my customers so that they are please with AT&T as well as their experience on the phone with me. Happy and  rewarding are two keys words I would use when describing how I feel after successfully helping a customer through their difficult technical issues."
good,"The company pays every one of their employees very well. Sometimes the commission structure seems a bit odd for the amount of sales you make, but overall the pay is great and provides enough to support a family. The benefits are also great, the group plan for the health insurance is the best I've ever had. Still, there are some downfalls. The least enjoyable part of the job is that you can definitely end up working every single weekend, depending on how long you've been at the job. Everything with the schedule is done on a totem pole/hierarchy of seniority...so new hires get screwed. The schedule and vacation time is a bidding process. It is kind of nice to pretty much be able to pick your own schedule, once you're not the ""new person"" anymore...but management can go in and change the schedule literally 2 days before said day. It's really easy to rack up attendance points too because you can't be late, not even 5 minutes late, or that's a fraction of a point. Doesn't matter if your car broke down, child was sick, nothing matters. The only thing they will waive points for is if someone in your IMMEDIATE family dies. No other exceptions. The union is a bittersweet thing, because the union is why the attendance policy is the way that it is. It would be better if the managers of each store actually made the schedules, but AT&T is a huge company so I can understand why they would need a better way to control what's going on...but it's overkill. "
good,"AT&T is an enjoyable company to work for. Great people, Hard working management in a demanding, changing industry. AT&T offers a diverse and inclusive work culture and offers many opportunities to learn new skills and different aspects of the business."
good,"PM'ing for apps, involves calls most of the days and doing reports for managers who could probably pull the info themselves"
good,"If you wanted to learn and apply your skills in the Information Technology field this would be the company to do so.  Work environment was great and you were learning new things about yourself, and your job."
good,long hours in the summer. Great to help people. I learned how to deal with a wide variety of people from many different backgrounds. I got along with all of my co-workers.
good,Lead groups of twenty or more people of all ages and diversity. Management was open to ideas and suggestions. Team members worker good together.
good,"I liked working for AT&T. They offered competitive salary, benefits, compensation and time off. Most of the people I dealt with and worked with on a daily basis were exceptional."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with fun, laughter and hard work. My major focus on the job is handling high profile accounts and satisfying our customer requests. It includes billing, promotions, scheduling and making sure services that have been disconnected are reconnected in a timely manner. "
good,"I have learned so much working for this company. AT&T has taught me how to excel in communication skills, searching for sales  opportunities with any type of customer and to hold value in your career."
good,a typical day at stream global services was to have a required meeting before any shift started to obtain daily goal and to see what/ who met outstanding goal the previous work day. go over monthly goal and incentives
good,"Company recently acquired by AT&T. The fate of my department is unknown and nothing is being communicated. What once felt like secure employment, no longer feels so."
good,"Installed new and repaired services. Done sales and customer services.  Learned how to install TV, Internet, and Telephone services.  They provided you a service van/truck and all tools needed.  Would pay you to do work out side of the standard area of services."
good,Great job with great benefits.  You work for by yourself and get graded on how many jobs and how fast you can do them correctly.  You have to improvise constantly to get the job done.
good,"* Most days dealt with answering a number of phone calls and fixing each customers problem or upgrading their u-verse service "
good,"I learned valuable skills in providing and managing security for a corporate business.  The hardest part was transitioning from a 'hard' security mindset, to a 'soft' security mindset.  All in all it was a very good learning experience."
good,gosh you need to look into managers who fires 4 or more people  those people are insane daily routine was not bad people are friendly coworkers are awsemo
good,"Work life balance is not something you should expect when going into a retail job especially one that is union based. Discounted service's, Fun environment, great competition for sales."
good,Great place work! Wonderful Work/Life Balance with Telecommuting options and the great people you get to meet and work with! The compensation and job advancement needs improvement. Top-tier company!
good,"nothing different about working in a call center, costumer always wins, and a few useful computer skills, management was great in my area, coworkers were all different in all aspects it was great, the best part was going home after some one in a different country was telling you that they were going to find you and hurt you knowing that they were never going to find you, the hardest was the fact of going back again to that place and the same thing was going to happen again."
good,"It's a sales position, and there will always be customers that just don't understand or shouldn't be allowed to walk into any retail store at all. However I had a really great team of people to work with, despite the few crazies we all despised, and no matter the hardships or stresses I thoroughly enjoyed my job. I have a genuine attitude towards helping others and problem solving for customers. I thrive when people come into our store and actually enjoy their experience, but I have no patience for ignorance, impoliteness, and classlessness. (is that a word?) People need to use their common sense and know there are certain expectations when walking into a retail environment. There will be a wait if there are more customers in the store than sales people. It's an telecommunications store, not freaking Toys R Us CONTROL YOUR KIDS. Don't be rude. Yes, that phone really costs that much because it's replace every bit of technology you own besides your car! Wait your turn and if you don't have the time you can make an appointment or simply come back later AND WHEN WE OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU AND TELL YOU TO HAVE A GOOD DAY YOU NEED TO POLITELY AND HAPPILY SAY THANK YOU!!!"
good,The company itself is a good company to work for. Good commissions and everything. The rate of pay could be better for all the work you have to do.
good,This was one of the most difficult jobs I've had to date!  I had great benefits I received a blackberry and a computer to work. I had excellent insurance and excellent pay.  Unfortunately the manager was unwilling to teach me how to sell the product.  I consider myself able to sell anything to anyone willing to listen but this particular product was extremely difficult to sell.  It wasn't so much as the product it was 20 line phone lines and WIFI which was new to the marketplace and systems to sell for all computers and phone lines to work together in the business.  I had to sell this to businesses that always already had contracts with other companies. So I would walk into a business and explain that I worked for AT&T and many times people would ask me to leave just because I worked for them not because I was selling something.  I went to work for the company just after AT&T was allowed to come back as a whole company.  Years ago they were considered a monopoly and were made to sell their lines to other companies in order to establish more to offer in the marketplace.  So AT&T broke off into many what they called Ma Bells such as Bell South and here they were considered the best but obviously the company was overcharging their business customers or they felt they were and so when I would come in many had bills that were difficult for the customers to resolve if they had a problem.  My boss explained that I wasn't allowed to workout those problems for customers as that's something I great at.  Quality Care is something at which I excel! Unfortunately the manager had no interest
good,"A typical day at AT&T was a fast paced professional experience dealing with customers from all different walks. "
good,Great company. early morning meetings are bad. but other than that. not much to complain about. good money good discounts. free company phone. face to face with customers cool job
good,"A typical day at work with be filled with customer and account team meetings, conference calls, processing requests, and meeting deadlines.  I've learned a lot about process, account management, stewardship, team work, and results. Management ultimately was a volatile place because of the changes of leadership, processes, and the acquisitions of several companies. My co-workers are really hardworking, committed, and great assets to the corporation. The hardest part of the job is pushing for results for the customers and you into roadblocks due to contracts, construction, and provisioning delays. The most enjoyable put of the job the is the continuous learning, adaptability that is required for the ever evolving changes in technology within the domestic and international telecommunications market space. AT&T is really a Global communications company and I enjoyed my tenure there."
good,"One of the best jobs I had at AT&T.  I worked remotely out of my home for 8 years which was great for my work/life balance.  I did have to fly or travel to visit customers, but only a few times a year."
good,"Great company to work for- big company, great brand- but was very innovative and nimble.  Not sure about how the company/brand will progress under the new confines of the company that acquired DIRECTV."
good,good place to work great culture and great benefits. Att has alot of room for advancement and growth. i would recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,"I had an excellent experience at this company. "
good,"I had a great career at AT&T Bell Labs and AT&T Solutions.  Hopefully, the environment has not changed too much since AT&T became at&t..  The people I know at the company say its still a good place to work.  Naturally, its a large company in a changing environment - few companies provide better job satisfaction and security"
good,"You received a job well done both in your compensation and recognition for above average performance.  There were often office celebrations for a job well done.  Employees knew each other and the milestones they were achieving in their lives (i.e. new baby, graduate. etc.), The politics of a large company had to always be dealt with."
good,"The schedule at AT&T wasn't the best to say the least. When you're new of course your schedule is whatever is available. But, it may change if/when a new hire arrives to bump up your seniority. So, y schedule was basically Tues/ Weds off working 10-7, 11-8, or 12-9. I have two girls in grade school. This wasn't conducive to their schedule."
good,"Over all i think this company is doing well, as long as they stop outsourcing the work. "
good,"Heavy phones, inbound calling, learned several company programs for customer service for telephone services offered. Co-workers were all unique, usually hard working and reliable, customer service was our focus to develop and maintain good customer rapport and relations, company image was important. Easiest, most enjoyable  and hardest part of the job was the customer contact. It could be an easy service call or it could be a disgruntled customer who needed a little something extra to redirect their attitude and make them a happy consumer."
good,At&T was a very good company to work for. My position was eliminated but while it was in lace it was a very good atmosphere and my team was a joy to work there.
good,we worked as a team. it was great place for growth.There was plenty of training also everybody was courteous and respectful.
good,"AT&T is a good company. The people are support and collaborative. The management believes in its people. But because it is a big company there is a lot of red tape. "
good,"Fun to work for but it is a fast pace atmosphere. The only downside is the demanding hours. The upside to this job is that, with the right attitude and great salesmanship skills, anybody can make great money"
good,great jobs with benefits numbers game great job stability a lot of red tape a lot of change on the weekly overall a big great company but a lot of internal issues
good,"A typical day at Dtv would include taking inbound calls from customers in regards to bills, plans and equipment. Making valid offers to every customers on every call."
good,"Good place to work, but the current corporate culture is cutthroat. Morale was relatively low, which required a lot of my energy to overcome. My boss was particularly intense, which affected my stress level."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. It is a big organization that has its own share of corporate challenges."
good,AT&T was very fast pace with alot of phone calls and talking with customers. The hardest part about the job was trying to explain things over the phone with non computer savy people but I enjoyed it.
good,Good company to work for. If you are looking to start a career in sales this is a great place to work. Career advancement is very possible.
good,Great for those who want to work in a warehouse environment. Great hours and pay during busy business needs. Layoffs during times when business is slow.
good,"Had a good time working here. Good, relaxed work environment. A good mix of veterans and civilians. Manager allowed both contractors and permanent employees an opportunity to maintain work/life balance. Good opportunity to work with multiple customers. Downside was that there was a lack of employment stability."
good,Great training and opportunities for advancement.  Enjoyed working in several departments to understand the big picture on how all types of communications work and interact.  Good employees for support throughout the country
good,"Fun job, great pay and benefits. fast paced environment, Managers take the time to invest in you. Lots of different departments where you can advance."
good,"Everyone wants to have the newest phone but need a little guidance in choosing since there are several options. Helping customers choose between different operating systems and phone models was a big responsibility. Also helped manage cell phone bills, set up uverse TV, internet, and even home phone."
good,"I already knew most of what I was trained on from School and previous jobs. I can definitely see the importance of this department and running such a huge campus. I really enjoyed working here otherwise, the people were very nice and it had plenty of perks."
good,Work hours are usually flexible and there is a good chance of advancement with the right skills. On the job training is very nice
good,"Great place to work. Fun atmosphere, lots of money to be made if you are good performer. It's great to work for the #1 TV provider and the work is challenging, but rewarding."
good,"AT&T is a wonderful place to start a career. AT&T invests a lot in training college graduates and in supporting them. The main reason I'm leaving AT&T is because I feel like the upper level executives are out of touch with reality when it comes to setting attainable targets. Also, I feel that AT&T could provide lower-cost healthcare options to all employees. A positive aspect of working at AT&T is indeed discounted cell phone, TV, and internet for your home."
good,"Work day goes fast & you learn something new everyday. The Management could let the tech's do there job instead of bothering them so much. The hard part is when you have to stand on the ladder for a long period of time splicing wire. Meeting new Customers everyday would be the most enjoyable part. Good place to work, everyone is friendly and fun."
good,Diverse group of professionals dedicated to providing the best service in the telecom industry.  Knowledge base of employees is most likely the greatest asset.
good,"Enjoyed transitioning from a manual web portal to a more state of the art content management system. Partnered with peers and management to develop streamlined customer solutions through pre-launch beta testing. Embraced the challenge of learning HTML via Dreamweaver, which strengthened my core skills and enhanced my ability to professionally author web content and manage multiple projects, based on the team styles and standards. "
good,It is medium to high volume inbound calls daily. I've learned better communication and problem solving skills during my time with the company. I get along well with my co-workers and it's a nice atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is when we can't solve a customer's issue and have to redirect the call for further investigation. The most enjoyable part of my job with AT&T is when there are recognition awards given for hard work and dedication. It makes you feel good and appreciated as an employee.
good,"I made many lifelong friends working at AT&T. Management is demanding, but I believe they have the best intentions at heart. The work-life balance can be challenging. Although they do not require employee's to work past 5pm, the phrase ""this is not a 9-5"" was thrown around on a daily basis. Management even went so far as to get rid of employee's who were not seen going the extra mile. "
good,"I enjoy my position, and I enjoy the people I work with.  Working with technicians all over the US and fixing complex fiber optic networks and video circuits becomes challenging yet rewarding.  I always strive to be the SME of the facility and the go-to guy.  I enjoy working with the other technicians and I get along well with management."
good,Presenting cell phones to customers. Showing different plans and choosing the correct plan for the customer. Learned a large amount about technology. The management was good. The co workers had  a great time serving their customers. Seeing repeat customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"This is the same company I reviewed already. I have nothing else to add from the first time i reviewed this company."
good,A very fast pace environment with a lot of atmosphere. At the same time can feel very secluded when taking calls and helping them about their issue that they called in.
good,management is tough to get along with but as a local dealer for AT&T there are a lot of perks that go along with the job. very understanding about family issues
good,The people made this job worth while. Even though I was there for a short time I was already be prepped to get promoted to a better position. I called for more work but I was up to the task. As long as you apply yourself and steer clear of the drama you will excel.
good,"I had really good time at Directv. Got to meet a lot of really nice people, and see places in my area I've never been. they pay decent and provide a truck."
good,"Started with At&t and got spun off to Lucent, then Avaya. But spent 15 years total with these companies and learned a lot and made great money. Benefits were the best."
good,"A Good place to work for,Nice management and Hr Team, a good environment for a IT employee, Weekly , Quarterly and Yearly Refreshments is a + to this company."
good,"Definitely was an experience having to consistently keep up with the pace of work load no matter how big, but still doing a great quality job. Management wasn't willing to work with you and help you understand things. More of a team job, relying on co-workers at the end of the day. Safe was a very big subject on a daily. Definitely learned excellent problem solving skills when it came to how to wire a house or business. Most enjoyable time would be driving from job to job alone. Hardest Part would be the weather."
good,"Maintaining an organized area, helping customers with any questions. Excellent helpful team, our managers were always around for any extra help. Toughest part of the day was closing and application with a perfect satisfied customer."
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T in the Business Receivables Department. The caliber of employees was stellar. Management was open to new ideas and new solutions.The majority of the day was making contacts via phone and email to collect outstanding payments. Management was willing to step and offer suggestions to resolve customer issues. We were empowered to provide many services for our customers and could work through customer issues from start to finish
good,My days where very informative I assisted customers with there accounts. I learned from management to follow first mind on certain situations. My coworkers where awesome. the hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with difficult customers. The easiest part about the job is making a difference in a customers account making it affordable.
good,"Very good company to work for - excellent training, flexible work "
good,At&t is an exciting place to work and they do different things to help the moral at the work place. Advancement is not as something that is able to achieve if you are not willing to relocate. I think that the pay is great and benefits are great and reasonable.
good,AT&T is a Unionized Company and correspondingly offers employees about average salary and benefits relative to other employees. A Union is essential in the current economy to maintain standard of living for working class people.
good,"When working at Directv, it was nice. They had a awesome lunch room, weight room, and a wellness program, that help you keep and feel health."
good,"Good company, very strict rules. Great opportunity for advancement if you can get through the pre-employment training, etc.."
good,Wonderful opportunity to learn call center culture.  Appreciate the training I received at Michigan Relay which prepared me for the outreach and marketing work that I currently do in the field.
good,"Great company to work for, can be very demanding, the pay was good and the work environment was very busy. Provide great training and tools to work with."
good,Great place to start or finish your career. Its almost like working for yourself. You have a level of independence that allows you to work at a comfortable place while putting to good use your skills.
good,"Great experience, great team I learn a lot about the development of the industry, Great leadership and very good and stable work ."
good,Great place to work. Though some managers tries to bring in some variations the strong support from the Top mgmt helps you feel comfortable
good,"Thriving in an industry where you establish the type of culture in which you work, there is a potential to make some serious cash and meet some amazing people.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very high-pressure, fast-paced environment where knowledge is key and attitude is essential.  The company is extremely progressive in it's benefits offering and active involvement within the frontline community and the rewards can be very enticing."
good,"I was always learning on how to adjust to circumstances, especially going from craft to management.  I had awesome leadership who helped greatly."
good,"A typical day at work would be to show up on time and immediately get to the sales floor because the store is always understaffed. expect to rush through all your clients, but not too fast. you are expected to demonstrate and discuss virtually every service the company offers. this sense of urgency can make or brake a sell. you are constantly being introduced to new things so keep up. enjoy technology and fallow the newest thing. management is usually good. but when sales drop their management gets on them and the heat makes its way throughout the entire store. so bend over because they are going to give it to you like an American loves to be screwed over by corporations. that would be the hardest part about the job. is being forced to do your job to the point you might be screwing a customer with more than what they can afford. but who cares, its not your wallet. right? that was some advice they past on to be to continue being successful with in this company. don't get me wrong, this company can make you lots of money and they offer rewards and benefits. what more can you ask for to support a family?"
good,sales is the key to your success at this job. if you are not making sales then your position is at risk. you are praised for sales and they are understandable when it comes to family and needing time off.
good,Manage 25+ employees everyday. Drive and exceed high sales targets in a fast changing environment. Quickly adapts to change and maintains poise.
good,"A typical day was like an exercise route due to the nonstop walking. I learned how to pick and wok at a steady pace. Their management was very professional. The reason I say they were professional is because we had group meetings, daily checks, and great communication. Coworkers were friendly or should I say very sociable. The hardest part of the job was trying to work and talk at the same time, it's easy to get distracted. Along with fixing others mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job was being rewarded for all of our hard work throughout the week."
good,"loved being able to work from home. Fast pace, but kept changing handbook daily. Pay was ok but when you were waiting for a call you weren't being paid or when you were transferring a call."
good,"Daily challenges, small to large projects assigned and weekly reviews.  Management are very helpful and provide guidance at all levels.  Hardest part of the job is being able to learn new tools without formal training.  Most enjoyable part of job is being able to work with extremely smart people and learning from them."
good,"I learned with no experience how to be an excellent technician. Able to troubleshoot, install and repair all uverse products. AT&T paid for myself and all technicians who chose to take the course to become Fiber Optic certified technicians."
good,"i was a uverse prem tech manager. "
good,"great company, a lot of opportunity. culture is great. would recommend. you can take control of your career with this company.. Great training and learning every aspect of the wireless industry."
good,"This was a great gig!  They was always a threat of lay-offs. Management was very good and easy to work with.  Good incentives, pay, and benefits.  I would absolutely apply again if a position became available!"
good,"did not appreciate the office closure which lead to the lay off of over 400 people; did enjoy working at at&t; good benefits, and union protected; overall satsified"
good,As far as the repercussions go if someone does anything out of line or that they need to be written up for. They let people get away with too much for certain things they are not. The pay is good but it could be better compared to what Verizon pays.
good,"Working for AT&T tech support is pretty straightforward. You show up, log in to your phone and you tools, and begin taking calls. It's pretty strict when it comes to the rules. Either you follow them, and you advance, or you don't, and you leave. The management of the call center itself is pretty great. They are willing to listen and work with any issue employees had, no matter where you stacked up in term of responsibility. It's not the easiest job though, and it requires a very particular mindset. There will be days where everyone who calls in will want to bite your head off. But on the flip side, there are plenty of customers I won't soon forget, because the time on the phone with them was enjoyable. Overall, I think as a starting place to get experience in a call center environment, there are few places better."
good,"A typical day was taking inbound calls from customers who had questions about their bills, their phones or the technology of their phones.  I learned how to understand the technology of cell phones and other services that are offered under wireless care. Management was pretty good especially with the level of management that dealt with the workers but the CEO was not personable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the irate customers that could not be satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job was with so many people there was the ability to meet friends and there was always some kind of party."
good,AT&T was a wonderful place to work. I was able to gain professional experience and learn how to function in the work force. I'm glad I was able to be a part of their team. I recommend definitely applying for a position with the company.
good,"Managing a ATT was a challenge, I was in charge of  20 employees and 20 different personalities. Being able to drive sales with each rep had to be tailored to a successful approach but that same approach won't always work with every rep. What worked for me was my experiences as a rep and feedback from reps with their success.  My job included maintaining and exceeding our sales goals through the work of my sales  team."
good,"They had great benefits, and we had the ability to work with cutting edge technology.  Great bosses, and co-workers to make the job enjoyable to work with."
good,I have learned a lot at AT&T. Management has been stellar and approve of their work ethics. I recommend AT&T to any new employee.
good,"Typical day we walked around (door to Door sales) was what part of the job i was in. I wanted to work at the desk I'm Good at answering phone taking messages. Making Notes making good reviews, But I have learned here that you have to start at the bottom and stay there for a while before you start making big money. Its Hard The First Few Weeks and it seems you have to put in a-lot of hours to see a check with your name on it. management seems fine. Hardest part of the job was making sales. As much as i loved the people and the work setting. I was just making the money that was so hard about it. Make sure when they put you in teams someone in your group has a car or you will be using the train or bus. The Most Enjoyable part was my team my group. Until everyone started to quit."
good,"Handle calls and requests from 22 states, as well as work closely with peers and management from all departments of company"
good,With everyone having great relationships with co-workers and management made for a less stress environment while the job requirements itself could've been a bit overwhelming.
good,I enjoy this company's continual growth and ever improving technologies. It is a great place to work overall with plenty of opportunities to develop your skills.
good,"A typical work day is coming into the Office.  Reviewing my things to do list.  Go over what needs to be done first. Follow ups, get sales contracts prepared.  I will see what needs to be done to get the sale or close the sale. I go out and see customer's, review their bills, their present , future needs, and to close for the next step or sale."
good,"A new class of students every Monday set the stage for the week ahead."
good,It was a good place to learn a lot about selling. Good friendly environment. I had a lot of fun with my team they were all great people. There was a lot of favoritism from the district manager. It felt like a highschool environment. There were definitely separations in groups.
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"My years at BellSouth/AT&T/YP were very rewarding and I learned how to handle simple to very complicated situations.  "
good,"Call center style work, with majority of the day being spent on selling telecommunication products. I learned that the customers concerns always comes first."
good,"Take incoming calls, take trainings online, give training to peers , hardest part but doable comply with company expectations, when customer left the calls completely satisfied"
good,I enjoyed my time with BellSouth/at&t. It has afforded me the opportunity to gain vast business knowledge and work upward mobility.
good,"My workday's went by quickly, as an employee at AT&T."
good,"Very good learning opportunity and good experience overall.  good opportunity for advancement.  Sometimes there is favoritism at higher employment positions, management and above."
good,making cold calls to small to lage companies selling onlines advertisment across the web. the hardest thing about this position. trying to overcom the objective that the website does drive more of a profit to your company.
good,"I'm not at liberty to go into much depth of my work with AT&T, it was brief but enjoyable. I am now working under Verizon Wireless."
good,They helped me pay my way through school while teaching me to enhance my customer relation skills. I was able to work under pressure and multitask.
good,"Customer service skills by receiving calls at a non-stop pace"
good,"Typical day at work would coming in on time, start on audits for previous days work, creating data and respective tables, provide coaching sessions and building rapport with team leads and team manager"
good,On a everyday basis required to coach and inspire sales reps to help achieve location and company sales goals.  Maintained merchandising up to company standards.  Assisted members of management team with store operations.  Handled customer escalations.  In charge in overall training standards for location.
good,"It's been wonderful writing for a national brand. The hardest part is getting used to the culture. All of my collaboration is done through instant messaging and email, as most contacts work in Seattle, Austin, and Atlanta."
good,Work was easy and fun coworkers were nice and pleasant compensation was decent hours were manageable training was fun and interactive
good,"Working for AT&T was great with the exception of the work life balance. Manager are required to work a minimum 45 hour work week and more often than not you exceed those hours. With most stores closing at 9:00 p.m. this made for for long days. These hours were not conducive to the lifestyle of a singe mother wit three  young children. "
good,fun and good management also great trainning with benifets  and enjoyable place to work and co workers are friendly to work with .
good,Best part of AT&T is being able to have a career and not just a job.  As long as you do your best and reach for the top your efforts are normally rewarded.  NO SLACKING allowed!
good,"I enjoyed working there very much, the hardest part of the job was learning not to trust anyone, the most enjoyable part of the job was able to do overtime. I learned how to stay calm when customer were irate."
good,"As far as call centers one of the better ones. They are union and have the better benefits. they pay a better wage, but do seem to like constant upheaval."
good,"Days include working face to face with customers of varing knowlage "
good,"DirecTV is a company that has great engineering group, and produces the best technology in its field. It has presented me with constant challenges in both technical and implementation with tight time lines and constantly updating technologies"
good,"Worked for them for 6 years and not impressed with the direction Wire Technicians are heading. Only had 2-3 managers, out of about 10, to manage the way a true manager should manage. Their numbers, and leadership skills reflected."
good,Great company to work for.  Received several cash bonuses and rewards for achieving monthly goals. Hard to attend school and balance work and family working morning to evening here.
good,Talking to customers and getting them to switch to directtv. I also helped with installing and any other technical problems they have with their service.
good,"This was a company that had good benefits, the job was hard, the work was demanding, we had little time for a personal life.  We had a lot of overtime and I depended on that income for ten plus years until the office I worked at closed."
good,"Great company looking for better hours currently working retail hours.   Selling cell phones, home smart security, home television internet and phone service."
good,very good place to work as far as pay & benefits.  C0-workers are great. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"Very good place to work if you want to learn how to lead, develop & train a sales team.  The sales team are represented by the CWA, so you will learn directly how to work with a labor union"
good,"A typical day at work for me would start at noon with a team meeting. Then out to the field to do door 2 door sales."
good,A typical day at work is busy and I have an opportunity to meet new people everyday.  I have learned how to communicate with people from all different backgrounds.  The hardest part of my job is the long hours in retail.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and introducing customers to new devices and services that we offer.
good,"AT&T is a well regarded telecommunications company.  It strives to serve both customers and employees as best as possible"
good,"Filled with learning, knowledge all around in form of colleagues. Great break times with team between the discussions."
good,"A typical day at work was answering calls to help customers with their wireless needs. Management was always there to help, and co workers kept eachother's morale up.

good,"AT&T jobs can swing from good to great.  It largely is dependent on what the employee invests into their job.  Highly technical and complex jobs can leave ambiguity and uncertainty; however, when one asks for direction and assistance, it is usually there for you.  Training on new technologies is slim and is barely more effective than learning it with outside resources.  This is mainly because the technology is more advanced than can be defined at that time.  If you choose to work at AT&T. you will not be bored and you will find your work challenging and fulfilling if you make an effort."

good,"Management started each day with recognition of the top sales rep from the day before and encouraged other team members to do their best to overcome their sale numbers from the previous day. While having this in mind, it always motivated me to put my best foot forward not only dealing with a diverse class of customers but also working with a differential group of co workers. The hardest part of working at AT&T was handling irate customers. Being able to think swiftly and accurately while calming and fixing a customers needs not only showed me how to multi task but also how to relate to all types of customers."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for with ample opportunity for advancement. A typical day as a Retail Sales Consultant would entail helping customers with billing questions, upgrades, & activations.

good,The company although a separate entity of AT&T at that required a good deal of transitional support.
good,I go in to work we go in the training area so we can get a little rounds in before we go to the stores. After we do that or manager give us what stores we need to go to for the day and we sit in there and go to all the customers we see and do a side by side comparison from the cable to our satellite.

good,"Good people as far as co-workers.  Great pay for a days works. Management team is the same as any other job, you have the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  Hardest part and the day is dealing with the internal broken lines of communications and failure in certain areas to work as a team. Employees in pass years was considered an asset to the Company, now looked upon as a liability to their profits. Over all a good company to work for, can be better, only if management above will work to make it so.  We know the customer is #1, but a happy employee at work, will produce a happy customer."

I learned that every individual is different and unique in how they treat the people on the other line. They have bad days just like any other individual and as a Customer Service Representative, we have to understand that they may cuss us out but they are just frustrated with their own lives. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the the job would probably be how the customer rated us during our calls."

I served as a mentor, trained and guided the work activities for many of our India data center coworkers that had little or no experience(new hires with high attrition rate that moved on after they were trained).  I presented brown bag session on many topics for less experienced personnel.    The hardest part of the job was a lack of immediate accessible peers for consultation and being assigned jobs that other people had failed to complete with no one to answer questions about the assignment because they had moved to other assignment's.  Management tendency was to withhold advancement opportunities for employees acquired via outsourcing and keep you in the same job if you were real good at it."

We got assignments in the morning to verify copper telephone lines. Majority of the time we would work in a team. It was very challenging between each individual as you were scored by how much work you performed in a day. The hardest part is dealing with residential housing.

It was a great experience, I learned a lot of things I can use in my future jobs. My co-workers were great, they often recognized me for speaking loud and eager. The hardest part of the job was trying to calm customers whose addresses we could not locate on the map. Therefore, we needed to create a ticket to get them installed that would take a week or so. Still, I tried my best to leave the customers at ease. One of the things I mostly enjoyed about the job was getting to meet a lot of people, it's always great to expand in my opinion"

Your manager would sometimes show up on your job site, but if you were where you're supposed to be and doing your job, you wouldn't have a problem. Working outdoors was great if you didn't mind a little heat or cold now and then. Except for minor issues all the techs got along ok and would help each other when needed. If you can't handle an occasional angry customer, then this job isn't for you. Respect and the ability to listen are important."
good,"was a great job until new management came in and took over. then a month went by and all the NEWBIES were canned. including myself. Wasn't fair for us newbies.

The management was great, they believed in every sales rep they they could hit the goals if they put there minds to it. My co-workers were fun to work with yet very competitive.

The most enjoyable part was knowing that a customer left the store satisfied with you customer service and the products."
good,Worked 8:30a-5p. No weekends. Learned daily reports and how to handle difficult situations. Some of the management was okay to work with. Loved my co-workers. Having to see someone fired that I had worked with for a long time. Day to day challenges were the most enjoyable.

good,A typical day work would involve the phones ringing off the hook.
good,A typical day is learning and meeting daily call center goals.
good,"Took inbound calls for reasons ranging from sales, customer service, and some technical support.There were about 2 knowledgeable supervisors.Aside from what is obvious some supervisors were not helpful on how to overcome objections or how to develop as a rep because they had not been on the phone for 10-15 years.The hardest part was dealing with some of the customers who were getting advertisements but not in the AT&T area.For me because i had 1 of the 2 good supervisors i loved work and i loved the pay as well my team was a family and we all helped one another"
good,a typical day at work would be taking about 50-80 calls each day retaining explaining and taking care of of customers.
good,"A typical day at AT & T... fast pace enviroment, with constant change. 'Ive learned that in the Sales world, to Assume EVERY Sale and Always Be Closing...Management has a open door policy and my coworkers like winning! (and potlucks...:-)"

good,"This was a great place to work for! You get to meet and talk to a lot of interesting people, and you also get to learn a lot."
good,Working at AT&T is very typical call center work. Answering calls all day.
good,I Really enjoyed working for at&t I loved my coworkers I was the senior Rep I really liked training new reps. I loved pushing myself to go the extra mile a challenge business deals were the best my customers were great you really got to meet and help so many different people. I loved doing manager duties when my manager and assistant manager were out of the office it was overall a very satisfying experience. Overall I loved that my crew was like a big family you gotta have fun in your job and we all got along.
good,Upper management at times seem to not always care about employees working under them.
good,"Good benefits and most areas are good to work in. Some managers are good, but some need help. More emphasis needs to be on the employees and their needs."
good,Work was always something new. Different experiences with different customers. I learned how to listen to customers problems and how to help them solve them. The management was decent. My coworkers were always trying to help customers. The hardest part of the job was the way they tried to teach us about new products. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers and being able to learn and teach each other new things.
good,A typical work day is usually crazy because you work split shifts and it is very hard to manage your day by doing so
good,This is a very enjoyable and fun company to work for. Very good management. This is a very customer driven company when it comes to taking taking care of the customer
good,"Typical day meant project management teams on multiple software implementations virtually and in group settings. Many meetings were virtual as project staff worked in multiple states/cities across the Nation. Our Management team provided good feedback on expectations. Co-workers worked hard at their tasks assigned to them. Hardest part of the job were the 60+/hour work weeks at times; especially when working on high-profile assignments. This challenge made the job not feel like work, more like productivity. Accomplishments made."

good,A typical day at work consists of normal hustle and bustle of the sales world and meeting quotas. I have learned a lot about accepting change. The upper management (4 and above) level is disconnected from the level 1's & 2's. The organization as a whole would be better if people worked their way through the levels of the company. The hardest part of the job is change occurs so often it is hard to keep up. You have to be very opened minded and self motivated to learn new things. The most enjoyable thing about working for this company is that you are selling a product that actually truly helps people succeed in their small to medium size business.
good,Good multicultural work environment. Great to develop your Spanish speaking and writing skills.

good,"possible micro-management, commission structure changing constantly therefore being able to adapt to changes is crucial to make the same salary or increase salary"
good,"A typical day at work would include assisting customers with their Directv needs to make sure that they were provided with exceptional service. I learned to be a productive representative so that the company could be represented with a positive outlook. The managment was there to help. My co-workers were also very supportive. The hardest part of the job was taking responsibility for something that I had no control over, for example when a customers tv was not working due to a storm. The most enjoyable part of the job was pay day."
good,"Working at directv really set a bar as far as what to expect from with good employers. This company awarded you for the smallest things that really made a big difference. Always some sort of activity to do, whether a picnic or just the staff area filled with tables of treats and more. I learned so much working there. I learned how much tone and attitude can go along way. I learned how the right team can make a positive change in your work ethics.

I had a great manager, that I could discuss any matter with. My co-workers were my family. The upper management has issues. Doing my last 5 years on the job I had more asthma attacks that ever. I was the Correspondence rep from before other rep in 2003. I was good at it. I called customers, discuss their issues and concerns: and had a resolution rate of 99.99 %. They open the job to all due to someone thought they had been shorted. The person they had doing it got the job not from the test I had to take but becuase he has more senority that us. He was just therer for the money. He the just would go to the account an mark it. It would state: account in write off or there was an outstanding balance due. This is why the customers were writing for resolution and he just did not care. As long as he did the qouta for the day: He did not take the time to look for issue or error that others had made or anything to resolve the issues. I used to communication with the office of the president for assistance. I always for a resolution. Sometimes the customer had to pay so me amounts and change things to get service. This was handled in a professional manner. The Offlice of the President now had issues with the job not been done."

I enjoy being on my feet, being able to walk around, talk to people all day, and sharpen my interpersonal communication skills by offering technology solutions. I am required to sell, maintain an accurate count of inventory, and submit deadlined paperwork daily."
good,I enjoy my current employer and have moved up and around in my time that I have been there! Learning different aspects of the company which is what I enjoyed the most. I have been promoted serveral times while being there so advancement was something that I also enjoyed. I can honestly say that if you apply yourself and work hard you can go anywhere in the company within customer care! The people that I work with have made the job fun and exciting to be there an addition to what I do on a daily basis!
good,"A typical day at work would be to run reports and reconile monthly general ledgers, concerning any states that I had the responsibility of preparing the monthly, quarterly or annual returns. This was a very intensive fast paced learning environment. With a lot of emphasis being placed on the ability to use Excel in an advanced manner."
good,as long as you have computer skills and can answer the phone you can do this job
good,"Can be stressful, but a friendly work environment. My managment is very helpful and respectful. Hours on work are ok but not the greatest. Training could be better. Many systems to use in daily basis. Pay/benifits are good for my area of living."

good,"AT&T offers superb benefits, work/life balance, and truly takes care of their employees."
good,Excellent training tools and room for growth in this company.
good,"I am willing to relocate to any state to work as a Technician for this company, simply because I love the work. The problem is, everywhere in New York City there are contractors and with the economy the way it is there is slight room to progress."
good,This was a great position because it was very team oriented and the company's resources for information was readily available. ATT offered training on a regular basis to gain product knowledge on cutting edge technological advancements. The management on all levels were motivating and helpful and the initial training was very informative and helpful concerning the sales process and engaging with customers to establish healthy business relationships.

good,"Great work life balance. lot of learning on new technologies. "
good,So heres the thing. If you have worked in a call center in broward county or anywhere in florida then you should know what to expect. The only difference is they really pay you what your worth here. They just ask you to do your job. As long as your not late and doing stupid stuff while your taking calls then your job is secure. You have metrics that are set as target goals every month and you must aim to hit these goals. You cannot talk to customers just any kind of way and ABSOLUTELY NO HANGING UP ON CUSTOMERS. They would walk jesus out the building for doing something like that lol. Help is a little lack luster but once you get the hang of it you are good. This is retention so you have to remember that our main job is turning customers around who are not satisfied. The pay is wonderful. Im almost at 20 an hour and thats not including commission. I can basically tell yall this. BEST CALL CENTER I HAVE WORKED FOR POINT BLANK PERIOD.
good,"Working for AT&T is a plus. It's a place where they give you the training, skills, and opportunity to succeed. They employ some of the best trainers in the business and a place where they show you what looks right. The customer is at the forefront of everything they do and at times, do not get enough credit for that."
good,"The center is growing, and taking on more and more tasks. The managers try to keep a good work environment but they can only do so much. The turn around is much more than they would like, but those with tenure generally are there a long time."
good,"A lot of politics it is a number game and constantly reducing forces in white and blue collar. Great pay and benifits, can be long work days and in all kinds of weather."
good,"Was happy to work with great individuals in my district. If you get this job, work hard to get promoted, or make it a temporary job to support you while you're setting yourself up for your future career."
good,Good company to work for and the management team really cares! Days can be on the long side but its all about how hard you work! I enjoyed talking with the customers the most!
good,I had no problem adjusting to the call centers priorities and work flow and found it fairly easy to communicate over the phone about customers billing and helping them with their needs.
good,"Overall AT&T is good company to work with. work life balance and good culture, diversity.  The work environment is good and modernization to current technology."

good,Wonderful company with health work environment. Good salary with perks and benefits.  Have opportunities to grow horizontally and vertically. The benefits given by the company are exemplary. The value of work is definitely recognised.

good,work hard and you will get results if you work hard you will make a good amount of money its all up to you how much you can make at a commission based job.
good,"Overall learning was good. It was fun environment. People were nice. Loved working at this company. If given a chance, I would love to go back and work for them."
good,Was a great place to work before the SBC acuision. never could get client billing correct regarding large accts. Sales  Supporting staffing was strong.
good,"Overall, AT&T is a good place to work.  However, upper management changes course several times throughout the year, which can make it difficult to reach your goals from earlier in the year.  My job focused on finding new business within the AT&T account portfolio.  Difficult to sell to unhappy former customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom I had as an outside salesperson."
good,It was a very educational experience working for them the communication with the supervisor was excellent they were very understanding and hard-working it just wasn't what I wanted to do
good,"Large company with good benefits and an overall good work environment. Dedicated employees many of which stay for their whole career. "
good,"Very good health benefits. Needs to work harder on being more current on their corporate policies. They have made many changes in the recent years, but I feel nowhere near what other leading companies have."
good,Overall I enjoyed working there assisting and helping people with concerns with their account. The atmosphere is a call center setting and very respectable and professional at all times.
good,"Altamente recomendable y gran empresa, pagos puntuales"
good,Make sure to hit your target metrics and goals to keep your teams on track.  Great benefits and multicultural company to work for. Great overall experience.
good,This job that i had was fun and interesting to learn about new products to sell to customers of differnt places. I also learned a lot of new computer skills.
good,This is a great company to work for ... their senior leadership lives the culture and work ethics they expect from all employees.  I do not regret working for this company.
good,When you are not management it is definitely difficult  to manage life /work balance especially if you are under a year of employment. If you are over a year then you have some flexibility . But if you have children it can be hard with scheduling vs family time especially during holidays. Really dig into finding out more information on the job you are applying.
good,Una empresa bastante agradable para crecer en el ámbito profesional
good,AT&T has various perks and benefits that are competitive but allows it's employees flexibility.  Enjoy working with various people who are in the same industry as myself.

good,The job was very easy and your really had to have people skills and computer skills to be successful in the job. You also have to know how to  multitask slot in order to handle your calls.
good,"As a Retail Sales Consultant for AT&T, you can move anywhere within the company or outside of it. Whether part time or full time, the potential for growth is limitless. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to apply."
good,When I worked for and the people I worked with I had a great experience working for AT&T and although their were goals / qoutes that needed to be met in order to not lose your job as a salesperson the team I worked with would make sure we all had what we needed and we ate as a family and just had a blast. I loved it.
good,I am happy to work for AT&T as a contractor for 6 years and contribute to the the bottom line. Pre-sales outsourcing seems to be the place I am more efficient than my other skills in post sales.
good,Great time working there couldn’t transfer when I moved so had to leave the company they paid good got pto and other paid time as soon as you hit the floor
good,There is rarely every any slow time in a call center. When taking call after all the day goes by really quick. Managers are very supportive of your job and questions on how to best assist customers. The most difficult part of the job is angry customers and trying to find a way to turn around the situation and restore customers faith in the company.
good,"The more motivated you are to sell, the more money you will take home. Employee must be goal-driven and able to achieve sales goals each month while also providing a great customer experience."
good,Assisted AT&T Business Units with the measurement and understanding of its Information and Technology risks and oversaw those risks through Risk Management Framework processes
good,"A particular day would often start with a group meeting, where the manager would check in with all the group members' progress. The rest of the day is flexible for us to schedule necessary meetings or focus on coding sessions on our individual project. Lots of meetings happened because there were a lot of collaborations between different groups, which bring insight into our work, but also took out a good chunk of our work time."
good,"The job is easy as long as you show up, but can be toxic with collections. I suggest working here to build skills then move on. I do enjoy the good benefits and what I have learned so far, but there is no advancement in my job. It can be monotonous at times."
good,"It was a great company to work for. I learned so much about cell phones, customer service, and inventory. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the trainings since I was going to school full time; but my manager and coworkers made my time with AT&T very enjoyable."
good,"If you get the chance to work in a AT&T call center, definitely take it. The pay is great but a few down sides are the call quality is not always the best.. there are A few times that I have had customers escalate the call to a member of management for their bill raising 12 cents for taxes.. you get your typical credit seekers who constantly find something to complain about, there is not a lot of movement aside from breaks and lunches to get up and move from your desk."
good,"The training is all paid, which is fantastic. You will NEED that training, and definitely absorb it all, and learn how to multi-task, they pile it on and on and on. You have a great support network of management and team leaders that really bring up the spirit. Also plenty of snacks for sale, of course, to keep the mind busy."
good,I enjoyed working at ATT. The work was challenging and the work atmosphere was pleasant until the company changed direction and conducted many layoffs.
good,Learned a lot of niche technologies and got to communicate with a lot of experienced persons which boosted my confidence and gave me a chance to proof myself.
good,First off as a company and the people I was pretty happy. A couple of rotten eggs in upper management is the only reason I am still not with the company. Would go back to the same position if I was younger. Only thing I really did not like was forced Saturday work family really missed me. I felt like an important piece of the company and that drove me to make sure that the quality of my work was the best.
good,Would definitely Go back to AT&T great paying job. LOVED the customer interaction and making my customer satisfied was satisfaction for me. Working alone as a technician was very nice.
good,"A typical workday would be to come in and get started on case management.  Assist others when having problems, question unusual medical claims, ask for help if necessary, subject matter expert who was appreciated and dependable to the work and people I worked beside.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and their loyalty to the job and to one another."
good,"I like AT&T because they have rigorous training. They train in how to use the tools of the trade like ladders, and power tools. AT&T also takes safety very seriously I wore safety equipment and used safety precautions everyday."
good,"Good company to work"
good,AT&T is a good retail/sales job that gives you an opportunity to advance in the workplace with good performance and skills. If you put in the time and effort it will definitely show and the higher ups are usually pretty good at taking note of your good performance.
good,"Not a great family friendly employer but a great place to make great money if your sales driven. The typical work day was 9 to 5 with back to back phone calls. Management wanting to get the most out of every phone call that comes in to sell every product that the company provides. They some times loose sight of what is most important, keeping happy customers or getting to spend top dollar with the company."
good,"The last few years featured a number of conference calls and remote web-based meetings. I led a talented and committed team of technical managers as though we were a family, so in many ways, it did not seem like ""work""."
good,Had a good experience working for this company. Coworkers were a blast and management was helpful. Would recommend for people with outgoing personalities.
good,"I am being surplussed after 20 years with the company, it was a good job while it lasted.  It is a union company so it is all about seniority.  The pay and benefits were good."
good,Only worked there for less than a year and overall it was purpose filled. Had to stay on point in my position and no slacking at all because it would show. It is almost impossible trying to get hired permanently but I was making more money as a contractor than a lot of the permanent employees.
good,"You have to learn to be patient with customers and personable; love to talk to people. Management is awesome, always got your back and very down to earth."
good,Good I liked it. Stressful but pays well.friendly environment. Good I liked it. Stressful but pays . friendly environment. Nice people. Good pay.......
good,Good work atmosphere here.. Good discount on company services. The union makes sure employees are treated fairly .Managers are easy to talk to because they promote within.
good,Very strong company. Opportunity to grow. Training is outstanding.  Flexible hours opportunity for a higher education.  Opportunity to excel. Great job to have to raise your family.
good,I learned how to multitask on multiple open computer program. As well as take care of customers over the phone and resolve thier issue. Once I have helped the. whether or not it was a tech going to thier residence or it was fixed on the phone. Customers were happy the calls didn't take long.
good,"All in all, I had an excellent experience, I gained valuable experience in a myriad of different functions and areas within my tenure and as surely helped to develop me into a better professional"
good,"Muy buena empresa para trabajar, dependiendo quien sea el líder del centro de atención"
good,Good benefits and worked with my schedule. The workers are in a union and they don't give you a choice to pay union fees which was unfortunate but they gave a raise every 6 months.
good,The people were amazing to work with but there is a lot of red tape to get through so things move slow day-to-day.  The culture was fun and you felt good about working there through all of their outreach programs.
good,"Great place to work, Provided me and my family with a great quality of life.Was employeed there for over 15 years and it always felt like family.  A++"
good,"Changes in technology and policy is creating need for less employees. "
good,"Great leadership group when I first started working for the company but a year later higher management in the company decided to shift managers around the different stores. This changed the moral of the workplace. Overall, very much enjoyed my time at the company. Learned very much about sales and how to make sure the customer is always satisfied with the service."
good,ATT offered quality products and services to customers and a network that was superior to most.  It was a competitive place to work and you must meet your goals.  ATT also had good training techniques
good,"We provide 24x7x365 Network Technical Support in the DNS, DHCP and IPAM arena. I am an Area Manager supervising Tier 2 and Tier 3 DDI engineers located globally around the world."
good,"Start at 8am work till about 5 to 7pm. Go around jobsite to jobsite installing, repairing or upgrading AT&T equipment. Often forced to work six days a week and choose schedules that don't fit your life. Managers can be over-demanding and pushy. Safety is the number one concern but efficiency is always calculated and pushed."
good,Great place to work and depending on position can have great advancement possibilities.  Other positions are not as advancement friendly so just be aware of what you are applying for.  Also the company is going through tremendous upheaval and surpluses.
good,"Too much work for too little money."
good,"Twenty years ago, I found my career at Ameritech, which later became SBC. I absolutely loved my position at work. I would work overtime if needed. Helped my coworkers."
good,"Great managers that are under extreme stress to hit the numbers."
good,"Advancement was the reason I transferred to Houston I had the seniority and the skill but was looked over and strung along. AT&T was the best thing going I learned ISP and OSP, install and repair of cable and fiber, splicing and install and repair of Direct TV. I really enjoyed my time with the company up to a point it was a team atmosphere even the training was a pleasure to be apart of."
good,Good job but they do too many layoffs every Christmas sending work overseas and or to other offices so they keep closing offices resulting in layoffs.
good,"At AT&T there was always something to learn that increased your knowledge."
good,No regrets working for AT&T for almost 30 years.  Wonderful people and atmosphere for learning and career development.  The best part of working there were the employees.
good,"1, Multiple scrum calls, troubleshooting prod issues as Tier4, coffee, lunch and tea breaks - afternoon walks."
good,Company encouraged  problem solving through work groups. Readily engaged Learning Services for our assistance with product training design and facilitation which led to exciting work projects. A communication company that actually communicates.
good,AT&T was an amazing opportunity. They definitely train you and make sure you're in a great position. It is a fun and great place to work! Really need to buy into the culture. Great company for the long haul.
good,Working for AT&T has had many highs and lows. You can tell they want you to have a good job experience but after being under multiple divisions of the company you see they try a little harder for some people over others. Most positions are union jobs which means you get the short end when it comes to healthcare.
good,"Awesome environment. I learned a lot at AT&T, the company helped me become the great leader I am today. Allows the opportunity to grow and excel. I would refer a friend or family member!"
good,"As a Sales Overlay for 16 years in 2 different roles, AT&T is a fine employer and service provider despite the challenges encountered working there. Good pay, benefits with lots of intelligent, talented, hard working peers/mgmt. Enjoyed traveling aspect as well. As a Sales Overlay, you're at the mercy of the company to place you/change your territory wherever they deem necessary, sometimes at your detriment. While in Los Angeles, my territory changed 4x in 4 years, each time requiring me to ""start over"" with new accounts and associated account teams while enduring rising quotas that went with it (they don't usually go down). That was the most challenging aspect. Working within AT&T's business process flow to get services implemented and life cycle supported could also be very challenging. Additionally, the client portal (Business Direct) had its own issues with faulty inventory, no real-time reporting, and portal availability plus client and associate training on the portal that was poor. The AT&T brand counts for much and it is generally a good place to further your career, with many 3rd party partner-provider services to resell on top of their core services. Just beware of the challenges mentioned should you pursue a career there."
good,"It was a very productive and family orientated environment. I enjoyed the discounts with the At&t services, and working with the newest models of technological devices."
good,Ability to work with virtual team members is important. Many opportunities to work with others on various projects. Open space environment encourages collaboration and discussion with others.
good,Good experience working there as a summer intern. High level employees who get things done. Felt comfortable asking people for help and learning from them.
good,"I would highly recommend AT&T for a front line sales role.  They treat their teams well, the pay is decent and liveable versus the job level, and although there is pressure to perform and complete tasks, it is significantly more manageable than the competition."
good,I was with ATT for almost 5 years. Management and workplace culture was a 5 of 5. Company provided van and tools to do the job. Day starts off at 8 and ends at 4:30 with optional overtime. The only reason I left was because I was surplussed. Not the best place if your looking for job security.
good,A great place to work where individuals are respected and treated fairly. Mature PMO in place and when new processes are introduced training is provided sufficiently across the enterprise.
good,"AT&T was one of the best careers I have had, and has advanced my knowledge in technology not only from the Network to server admin data center, and user support."
good,"Only worked 37.5 hours per week.  They had split shifts that were divided in to 3 hour mornings and 4 hours evening or 4 hour and 3 hours.  We received time and a half for working Sundays.  Double time and half for holidays exempt Mothers Day, Christmas eve and New Years eve it was triple time.  Paid vacation depended how much service you had as to how many weeks you received."
good,AT&T is a great company for telecommunications they offered many benefits to both part-time and full-time employees the pay breakdown was hourly rate plus commission

good,"good compensations, great pay, management not great, great workplace, good atmosphere, great chance to advance, fun job, sometimes they could micromanage"
good,"Thank you for the life this career has given me. "
good,"Been with the company for almost 5 years and seen ups and downs, just like every company. The first 2 years as a prem tech is hard and tough, once you get the hang of the job, it's get easier. Benefits, discounts are awesome."
good,"While in the B2B Sales program I learned the basics about selling solutions to small/medium businesses. A typical day consisted of making calls int he morning, meetings throughout the afternoon, and classes at night. Overall an enjoyable experience and a great way to learn about corporate life and gain sales experience."
good,"Job environment was very employee friendly and technical tools were very efficient and helpful to resolve customers issues, supervisors were very much knowledgeable and equipment to assist employee"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of multiple calls helping customers with any issues regarding the company's service. While tending to their needs, I would also engage and connect with the customer in order to discover the best product I was able to offer them at the best price. Every sale was noticed and it felt great to be around such positive energy."
good,"The training at AT&T is good, the pay, benefits, perks are great!  The company is amazing and you will be compensated for your work!  There is the opportunity to be promoted if that is something you are interested in.  I would recommend AT&T as a great place to work."

good,I enjoy my time at AT&T  I was A level 2 manager.  The work cultural was relaxed and stressful at times.  Employees are expected to work in the office. Good benefits and excellent pay.
good,"I spent 14 years of my life with this company. The pay was great. They offered classes to help you move forward. Only left to follow my dreams. Otherwise, I would still be working for AT&T."
good,You are just a number among the thousands of employees and very easily replaceable. They dont consider someone who is close to their retirement age and will easily lay them off
good,Es buena solo que ya hay muchas trabas para colocar un plan
good,"AT&T was a fun and challenging place to work. As a former Bell South employee, the corporate structure of AT&T was very difficult to adjust to as they did not embrace many of the positive aspects of the company they purchased. This led to employee dissatisfaction."
good,"coworkers are fun. pay is average for the area. the busineess climate is lowkey, semi-professional and mostly a younger age setting. they have company events every so often"
good,"While my specific case of working here was different than most people's, I can say that the work culture was quite friendly and pleasant throughout my entire time there. Benefits and amenities seemed nice at the Bothell location, and the employees all seemed happy to be there. Management felt slow at times, but that's really my only complaint"
good,"Fairly laid back environment with great pay, but every year the layoffs, pay, benefits and office environment worsen.  It's a shame.  Southwestern Bell was a great company before it bought AT&T."
good,I would recommend this company. I advance my career quickly. I had the support I needed to become the strongest leader I could. There were maby options
good,"Job was good for many years, constant reorganization and mass layoffs.  While I wasn't personally impacted by layoffs, many of my colleagues were as they shifted business focus almost every year.   Budgets were challenging as timelines were shifted and cut short, then would use that as justification for layoffs.  Large investment in training that would never be applied for much of the staff."
good,Prefer not to say. It was a contracture job and everything was fine while the contract lasted. there is nothing more to say to go on and say blah blah blah great company to work for.
good,Great place to work at and great benefits. Management were gods to work with and are willing to work with your schedule if need be. Lots of great things within the company that are great as well.
good,"Overall good company money is great, i recommend it if you're going to school cause they do work with you're school schedule and have opportunities for better careers with in the company and they will pay for education. Only reason i left was the commute was to far especially when having two jobs. Also hiring process is long you through like 3 interviews before you get to do the drug test so don't worry if you feel like they aren't calling you back they just take their time."
good,Salary depends on how much you sale so you can make some great money working for this company. Very easy going depending on the day. Fun and fast paced environment to work in.
good,"Every day i learned something in regards to billing operations. Each fday i grouped with experts, engineers, and developers that were with the company for over 25 years. Each co worker supported me throughout my best practices to effectively commit to solutions planned ahead."

good,Business focus with market appeal. I was offered the opportunity to manage a base of eighteen accounts throughout the mid-Atlantic. My module generated over $14M per year in revenue. I used a consultative approach with a focus on customer business needs and our ability to offer the best solution.

good,"Love to work on at&t so Koch fun u have work go there do ur job "
good,Loved the people I worked with. Teams were always wonderful and always felt supported. It was tough most days but always had the people to look forward to seeing each day. I feel the pay was reasonable and the opportunities for advancement were wonderful. However it wasn't the best situation when I left as they were changing over from DirecTV to AT&T. There was a lot of issues with Management changing and they were pushing people to quit or they were laying a lot of people off. Over all i worked there for over 3 years and had a fairly good experience.
good,"Building closed after working for almost 20 years, great pay and benefits, exams to transfer were too challenging and unfair. It was stressful but good work environment."
good,"Installation Technician.Work independently under strict timeframe requirements for both installations and repair of high-speed internet, phone, and both IP and satellite television in both home and business settings, while providing excellent customer service. Conduct and assist in training of new technicians with varying levels of experience."
good,Great work environment.  Paid training as well.  The people were awesome to work with.  AT&T also provided discount school assistance as well.  Nothing bad to say.  The only thing is the layoffs do come so keep your education up.

good,"We had to troubleshoot various AT&T products, systems and follow AT&T guidelines. Supplied customer support to very upset customers. The level of support we supplied was the highest level for AT&T. When other departments couldn't figure out a solution to a problem they sent the call to us."
good,Buena empresa mejorar prestaciones y ambiente laboral
good,"Every day was a new day at work at AT&T. Customer service was at the back of my mind and how to help and drive sales. With the right management, the workplace could be a lot of fun and competitive"
good,"Organización."
good,"Very Independent and made to be self accountable. In charge of your own hours and own motivations. You don't make money if you aren't hungry, very easy to slip into complacency."
good,"team work es muy importante en esta compañía"
good,I love helping people so the retention department was for me. I didn’t start off making much in the beginning but my bonuses made up what my hourly lacked. However over time they found ways to reduce the bonuses but add onto the workload.  With that change I had to move on.
good,Not a bad job but a very competitive environment. Some of the Managers can be petty but some are awesome. The main thing I did not like was the shifts they had available and you would have to have seniority in order to get a morning shift.
good,"Pros: Pays well and is unionized so it's near impossible to get fired unless you super mess up."
good,"Fun and exciting place to work.  Very fast pace, with lots of pressure to produce results.  But there is a great deal of training and growth opportunities."

good,Involved in complete software development lifecycle (SDLC) of the client's business process by using their current system and continuous client feedback
good,It’s a hard working job if you don’t know how to sell. But not a hard trait to pick up. Practice selling if you don’t know. Once you master that you’ll do perfectly fine with the company.

good,"Typical work day is meetings every hour with very little to no personal or free time, include very little lunch time due to meeting overload Excellent education"
good,"It was a fun job, stressful at times, quotas were annoying, and management in my area could've been picked better.

good,"Enjoyed the workplace fast paced professional call center We’re all about bringing people together and making our customer’s worlds even easier – from tech to communication to entertainment."

good,"Typical workday involves helping clients with their att services. Such as mobile, home, business, and more. Discover customers needs and lifestyle in order to position different services. Management in At&t varies from great to terrible. The workplace culture depends on management but overall it is casual. Hardest part of the job is dealing with pressure brought down to meet sales goals."
good,"This was a good role for getting experience in the IT field. I felt valued as an employee, receiving several merit raises while there. Management was  very supportive and encouraged opportunities for advancement."
good,"It's a call center. You take calls, and are graded on key performance indicators. They train you pretty well as long as you can pay attention and follow instructions."

good,"Very good place to work , you must be able to tolerate micro management . Excellent pay and benefits. They do have frequent lay offs ,  geographically."
good,"I was in an engineering support role, for AT&T Labs --Research for almost 15 years. I received so much opportunity to grow and learn, in that position. My experiences in the role allowed me, when the job was eliminated, to move on to new roles that utilized the practical knowledge I had gained. This meant I did not leave employment with AT&T at that time, something that was crucial for improving my preparation for my retirement years. "
good,I learned that working for AT&T is a very fun but stressful job. The company since taking over DirecTV have been very transfixed and oriented towards selling that product over the actual phones that we sell. The focus has been very tough due to the fact that customers are switching to streaming rather than cable services.

good,This is a great company to work for when the stores are staffed correctly. I have learned a lot of leadership skills and how to think on my feet. The best part of the job is being able to communicate with customers and have them leaving the store extremely happy with the customer service that was provided.
good,"Autonomía para cumplir el rol como jefe de ventas"

good,"I was a splicer IN/OUT House Tech."
good,They have treated me fairly and compensated me well for past 18+ yrs. My only complaint is they are more concerned about the numbers and care less about the individual's they help them go. I am scheduled to lose my job in 6mos due to job relocation.
good,Great job with awesome benefits.  The work load became lighter and we were laid off.  Last 2 managers were awesome and the work is very intense due to you working by yourself.
good,I was a flex worker which means that i could work from home and i did most of the time.  My boss asked that i come into the office at least once a month.
good,AT&T is a great company to work for.  Like any job you will have your ups and downs. The benefits are excellent as well as the hours. Only complaint I have is the weight restrictions for premise wire techs are
good,There is something super exciting about being in the world of technology and entertainment. Working for a large company provides lots of opportunities to those committed to ongoing learning and hard work.

good,I enjoyed working for AT&T as a account resolution specialist provide accurate and professional customer service. I enjoy building rapport with my customers while offering promotions and offers as well as communicating with the field techs so on and so forth.
good,"A typical day at ATT is regimented with specific job functions that are delivered to me through a tracking app. That app delivers the required task/ticket which I open and the proceed to read and open the apps that are required for me to work the task. Sometimes it is as simple as committing cable and pairs to a living unit. Other times, I am required to resolve complex wiring problems within apps and determine what is wrong and fix that. During the day, I will interface with engineers regarding ERRORs they have on their jobs and work with them to repair these so that customers may receive ATT service. I enjoy this the most, that is, working with the engineers and resolving their problems. As an ATT employee, I am required to be thorough and fast at my work. Learning is definitely required at ATT. I learn every day and am grateful for that. The work force is diverse and I am grateful for that. I am a far better person after working for ATT."
good,you develop a lot of skills that will come in hand. Ive learned how to create a personal relationship with the customers and sell myself because the products sell itself.
good,A great place to work with good pay and benefits package. Can be stressful. Depending on the position may be required to work outdoors in all kinds of weather and environment.
good,My time at AT&T was a good one with a few hiccups along the way. I really enjoyed the team I worked with and also my direct manager. However some of the senior managers were a little less professional. Overall I would recommend this job as long as you know it’s a sales job and nothing more.
good,"- large break room"
good,"answering calls inbound from customers who are looking for payment options."
good,Great place but did not allow me to finish school. I enjoyed the daily competitions but was let down when I performed very well and asked to have time to finish school since they offer tuition reimbursement. When I met with the site director i was told going to school was not an option if it was not after 9pm.
good,it was an ok place to work for it paid well I enjoyed the time with my coworkers and the supervisors and they would normally work with my schedule not too bad

good,"Good Pay, Good Environment. Different work opportunities that allow you to grow and move around. Important to build relationships with your mentors and peers."
good,"From the very beginning, the job wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.  I started in technical and worked my way up quickly to take supervisor calls.  There wasn't a whole lot of advancement opportunities beyond this though.  Overall not a bad place to work, lots of overtime available, but it is a call center so it doesn't always have it's benefits in that regard."
good,"Fun place to work good co workerThe job pays very well and the benefits, 401k and pension were good. The job is very sales driving as it will be in the industry. Vacation time and raises were a big perk."
good,everyday It was a new job. At the time I was working it was new jobs and duties that I didn't receive training on. Managers with them you have to leave a paper trail to keep them in the loop.
good,Nice place to work especially the people. work /life balance is manageable due to the availability to work remotely. Time to complete work assignments is stressful due to the sometimes unrealistic time tables given
good,I worked remote for 19 years as a project manager.  My customers could reach me anytime for issue that they may have with their telecommunications service.  I was able to take the services sold and enable a successful installation at customer's premise.

good,"I worked through Implementing Partner, I was dealing with PROJECT "

This was very upsetting, and the store I moved to along with my promotion had very high/unachievable sales expectations. I would definitely love to work for at&t again, but would prefer to be in a call center roll as this is what I have the most experience in."
good,go in to the office in the morning for morning meeting head out around 11 to get to your store to start pitching to customers end your day at 7:30 star over in the morning

good,"I started with Cellular One in 1993, and was able to advance and keep my job through several changes.  The company offers flexible work from home if needed, and one the job training."
good,"I will not bash AT&T. They provided me a good income and good benefits that allowed me to provide for my family. I unfortunately was laid off due to inverse seniority when the company had to surplus in my position. I am looking for work within the company still as well as outside, but I would love to stay with the company. I do feel my position didn't have a lot of room for advancement, but if you are wise and continuously check the job postings, there are more positions available within the company that pay well and allow room for advancement. Are there areas to improve in my position, yes. Things like equipment and tools available, to methods of managing and how metrics are calculated. Overall, they are a good company to work for and I am grateful for the time I spent there and hope to work for them again if the opportunity presents itself."
good,"I really enjoyed the Company's Culture I had a very pleasant interview and hiring experience, I would recommend this company to anybody. They also a part of the  Union."

good,"I worked for AT&T and some of its entities (CIngular, Bellsouth, Bellsouth Mobility, Bellsouth Mobility DCS) over a 10-year period. I enjoyed learning to do various jobs and I felt that the support and training were exceptional."
good,My customers were awesome. The strict scripted statements that must be said on each call was a challenge. I was able to accomplish their requests by posting the statements on my computer.
good,it was a nice place to work fun easy and just a relaxed place. some of the managers at the time where not good. was an outside hire and wanted us to commit fraud to make sales numbers.
good,Great place to plant your roots and make a career out of it. The hardest part of the job is just showing up because once you are there you do not even realize that you are working.
good,Great Company with awesome benefits. Great hours and management. Awesome rewards and training. Open door policy. Opportunities are available. Awesome products.
good,"Good Environmant to Learn and Work "
good,I have learned different culture and tradition of the people that we cater and also how to be patient at all times for irate customers by being more understanding so that I can provide the right and appropriate solution for their concerns. The hardest part of the job is when I need to overtime just to avoid lost hours of my co-employees since they don't care about their job more than I do. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer felt satisfied in the service that I have provided. Best feeling ever.
good,non stop from the time you come till the time you leave must be on time every day do not call off sick require a very good attitude towards att customers share holders in general
good,"very supportive and excepting culture. Excellent internal support with overlays, sales engineers, and outside venders. Sales team were true professionals in dealing with both internal and external customers"
good,"Typical day, check computer to see if there are any jobs due for today.  If  there are jobs due today, look up cable records, make a field check for facilities.  visit the customer to check for acess to building."
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T, but I enjoyed it less that BellSouth, It is my opinion that BellSouth cared more about their employees than AT&T.  I just felt that AT&T could have done more to protect employee jobs, especially seeing as how the office that I worked in was much more productive that the other offices that did the same work.  I think they also could have worried less about automating the work and more on keeping people employeed"
good,I enjoyed my employment time at at&t i like working with people and solving problems just to make their day. There's a certain satisfaction one gets from making people's days easier and less confusing.
good,"AT&T was a great place to work, the people and manager was nice.  The atmosphere  in this call center was fun and enjoyable I would recommend this job to anyone"
good,"The job pays very well and the benefits, 401k and pension were good. The job is very sales driving as it will be in the industry. Vacation time and raises were a big perk."
good,"A typical day at work was usually a pleasant one. I pretty much was able to do my job without any problems."
good,"Training, Atmosphere, Culture, Teams, and Upper Management made working at ATT an incredible experience at all levels and there is plenty of room to advance."
good,The company did a huge layoff when I work there. I was a good company to work for though. I had great benefits and work environment was great. I also was paid pretty for the time.
good,"My role with AT&T was as a customer service billing representative. My duties included, receiving incoming calls from customers and to attempt to resolve their problems concerning their bill."
good,Good place to work but changing. Technical staff is quite capable and knowledgeable about the areas they work in. Good cross section of technical talent.
good,I was blessed enough to have work for an awesome manager and worked with a good group of people. That combo made coming to work not feel like work at all. Group selling made everything easy

good,"Typical day at work was anwering incoming calls, assisiting cst with inquiries on products and services, answered billing questions and order products and services. The hardest part of the job was cross selling, most enjoyable part of job was working with co workers."
good,"Your starting pay is based on what your employment record is like. You don't start receiving medical benefits until 6 months in, and schedules are made based on seniority. They tell you it is a customer service job, but it is honestly a sales job. They do not care if the customer is dead, if someone calls, you have to make an offer on services provided by AT&T. Otherwise, you are gonna be fired quickly. Also, please do not have anything else going on with your life, because this has to be your main focus."
good,Great place to work but there were times when the company failed to meet the needs of the employees. This was by closing centers and pushing jobs overseas.
good,I was proud to work for AT&T! I was proud of a company that not just promoted diversity - but walked the talk. AT&T opened 'learning channels' for which I will forever be grateful. I was a believer of AT&T's 2020 focus and fiercely embraced all learning tracks made available to me. I wish the adventure had never ended.
good,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo, una buena empresa con un gran esquema de prestaciones."
good,The company provides better production as well as the employees in terms of building results.The working-environment was great and happy people progreesed
good,I would go out on assignments with a team and we will work together all day until the job was complete. We did a lot of teamwork and communicated between one another periodically. The hardest part of this job was dealing with some rude customer if we had to complete wok in their neighborhood and they did not want any work done in front or around their house. The best part was doing the same job but going to a different location everyday and seeing a different scene
good,"I worked at AT&T for 17 years.  The company provided great stability, the management was vey supportive.  The work/life balance was awesome.  The culture was very inclusive."
good,"I no longer have job security, I use to think At&t was a place I can retire in but they are showing me that’s not the case. I would love to move to another area."

good,great company wonderfuk environment to learn and work great learnibg environment wonderfuk leadership great managers prrfect work life balabce no stress
good,At NCR/AT&T I held multiple positions in account management and financial planning.  During my 7 years at the company I participated in the McDonald's Worldwide Account Team and helped drive business in the US market.
good,During my time with AT&T it was a great experience over all there were a few things i would say needed improvement such as computer systems. The program would crash all the time or be unreliable.
good,Great company with lots of opportunities. A lot of training  and career development. Diversity is one of the main reasons i like the company. Well structured and stabilshed working environment.
good,A typical day at AT&T is customer call volume. If there is a power outage an the customer is not sure what to do. Assisting customers with tech support and setting up equipment.
good,I liked the people I worked with and management was very motivating to help you reach your goals or helping you with new sales techniques to be better on your next call
good,"Great sales training.. Even though the trainer said I wasn't a good salesman, my manager hired me.. I was always one of the top 10 salesman at my store.. lol"
good,"NA. Fantastic company. Great training, skills and work/life balance. Can't ask for a better experience. WOW is all I can say. Great vacation accrual over the years."

good,"good place to work at , great to help build communication skills. You are able to learn many things from peers who are willing to mentor and offer help."
good,AT&T had one of the better call centers that I've worked in over the years. The trainers were very informed and passed the information on to the associates.
good,"•Track, follow-up and resolve customer issues in a timely fashion. "
good,"This was a good job if you want to learn about the wireless industry."
good,"A typical day at work depends on if there are any issues in a certain area. If there were service outages due to storms etc, you can expect the call volume to be very high. If it is, the calls come in one after the other with really no room to breathe until your scheduled break unless your manager puts ""time off the phone"" in your schedule.  If the call volume is slow and they have to cut labor they will send out an email and you have the option to leave early. What I learned in this job was to really put the customer first. That has translated into my current job where I put the employee first. Any problems that they are having I always look for a way to assist in fixing the issue, really going above and beyond, as well as anticipating their needs on any future questions. Management was okay. The hardest part is when you know something works or doesn't work with customers because you're on the phone with them all day, and corporate comes in with something that we know will upset the customer but they push it anyway. The workplace culture depends on the people that you work with and the type of center that you're in. Before I left they put in a game room with pool, ping pong, a basketball game and an Xbox. It was a great place to relax. The hardest part about the job is the customers. I've been called some of the worst names and had some of the worst situations wished upon me by them. Even when the mistake is something on their end or even if I've resolved their problem. The customers also get surveys which can effect on your overall standing in the company. The most enjoyable"
good,Other than the current Downsizing AT&T has been a great place to work. Management listens to employees and we are able to work independently on projects with minimal supervision.
good,"Good place to work based on salary and quality of life. I had the opportunity to travel to other countries because of my position and that was my favorite part of my job. However, the job was very easy, making my career development difficult."
good,"It’s one of the best companies I worked for a lot of benefits  all the coworkers were very helpful, they have a lot of goals that we had to accomplish that was my only con"
good,"If you are with a good time, you will enjoy your job. I do not like that you are constantly pressured to reach certain sales goals. I like to do sales but not when I am constantly pressured to preform."
good,"I began as an employee of Directv right before the merger with AT&T took place. Initially my experience was quite pleasant and although Directv was a large company it felt small. I had lots of valuable opportunities to grow and learn to be a leader not just a worker."
good,"I was a contracted Technician. so i was not working directly for them, i was working for directv when the bought the company out and i didn't like the way they were running the company"

good,"•	Assisted with Data Integrity and Cost Recovery project plan development "
good,"I was brought in for AT&Ts first attempt at their Autism hiring initiative. We went through 3 weeks of basic corporate training to understand what was expected of us and what our jobs would be, and then we were assigned to a manager and got straight to work. We were treated just like any of the other interns and It was very professionally done. I learned advanced skills with Microsoft excel while I was there, which is something that I did not know before the internship. The hardest part was adjusting to corporate culture, since i`m a very out of the box thinker and very blunt, but the staff got used to me and we worked extremely well together. My only gripe was that none of us were invited back and the program was cancelled after we left. I sadly think that some of the lower functioning members of those brought in for the internship must have left a bad impression of the higher ups calling the shots."
good,"ATT is going through an organizational change.  I chose not to relocate to one of their Hub cities and, therefore, my position was eliminated.  Worked for ATT for 12 years."
good,"Call current/potential business customers, set appointments and provide solutions to those customers based on their business needs. Freedom of working from home, but also the challenge of self-motivation. The more effort you put in, the more money you can make. The company has a strong sense of culture and will help you learn and grow as a salesperson."
good,"you never know what your gonna get in a typical day in sales at ATT.  The challenge was giving every single customer you interacted with an extraordinary experience every time. It was exciting working with the latest technology and even more exciting to work with the amazing people I worked with. Being a great team player, I was very comfortable leading a great team"
good,The work experience was good at AT&T. The team and the work environment made it all the better. I would definitely recommend working there to anyone that asks.
good,"If you like controlled environment, this is  a good place to work. The pay is good you received an  increase every 6 months. You pay union due which is the only bad thing with the company, because they do not support the workers as much as they support they pay."
good,"fun friendly fast pace work environment .True to mission statement company. Good money plus daily bonus. Friendly managers ready to help staff, treats customers as priority."
good,"Starting the day off with a motivating team conference call (7:30a) where we would review sales goals, previous challenges and corporate changes.  We dispatched to new or current customers regarding sales products/services"
good,Many mart and dedicated people.  Great culture and lots of opportunities for motivated self starters.    Most enjoyed the collaboration with peers from many different teams and organizations to develop fixes for complex business problems.
good,"I worked for this company for 15+ years and really enjoyed almost all of my time there. Management's shift to a collaborative (which to them meant face to face) environment and a one-size-fits-all approach should have been the writing on the wall for me, though."
good,I enjoyed the experience. I learned alot and worked with great people. Customer service is easy and i learned how to help irrate customers when dealing with accounts.
good,Spring mobile was a great company. It was a shame that my store closed down. They give you the skills necessary to advance within the company. Very competitive.

good,"It has been over 22 years since I worked for AT&T.  I do not have anything to comment on with this company, other than I really enjoyed working for them.  The only reason that I left the company is that it relocated to Atlanta, Georgia.  I did not want to relocate."
good,Enjoyed my time with them. Typical day was placing phone calls and working with customers on their problems or requests.  Spent most the day selling new programs.
good,There is good exposure to different technologies. The benefits and pay were fair. I had good experiences with management but I know many other who did not.

good,"As a manager for AT&T, I have a great wealth of training and certifications that will be beneficial to my next employer. I was able to work my way from a warehouse associate to manager of 12 years."
good,It was a good place to work and a very good company to work for.  Great colleagues to innovate with and challenging projects in latest technologies.  Greatest team leadership.
good,This is and has been a great place to work for over 30 years but they like all businesses you have to please shareholders.  The company is changing and nothing is a guarantee anymore.
good,AT&T is an amazing place to work. The leadership is always strong. They have a fun and energetic culture.  I appreciate what I have learned working for the company.
good,they tried to give us a lot of training on how to sell their products and those trainings were often very fun typically we took about 40 or so calls a day which were very easy just resolving customer complaints or doing a quick sale which the customer had called in for.
good,"There was  no such thing as a typical day at AT&T. I  had dedicated customers that had a multitude of different of services & needs. Many customers required a weekly conference call for updates to their on going needs while others would contact be only sporadically. It was necessary to estimate the length of time a request could take  organize accordingly. "
good,"•	Executed systems planning, business information analysis and process improvement initiatives."
good,I'm lead technician side it was self paced you had your list of work to do throughout the day and you had to follow all protocols as well as drive to the client.

good,It was demanding and allowed me to grow in my management experience.  I was located in old technology and they were downsizing their workforce there. ATT is moving into more of a digitized workforce.

good,"Great company as far as customer services and growth is concerned. "
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for, but once you're in the door it is ALL about politics. Hit your numbers and it doesn't matter unless you know someone higher up who can get you promoted. Dont hit your numbers, you're screwed either way. CYA at all times and always have the union on speed dial because the mobility managers tend to create their own laws for you to follow that may or may not be a part of the COBC Handbook. All in all it's a  great company that can become a great career, just be prepared to do alot of networking with upper management and relocation in order to move up because the company does not allow you to move up in the same store."
good,"AT&T is a good place to work for."
good,More challenging work. i have hardworking nature.if i solve anything complicated problem i felt the best. ......................................................

good,"Working for AT&T was great:  good benefits, good pay, mostly good management, 401K, etc..  My position was bargained for (union representation) which offered many protections against firings and layoffs. Unfortunately, my division was sold off."
good,"AT&T was a decent place to work. You do, however, need to ensure you have a thick skin to do deal with angry customers. I had the privilege of having a manager who was excellent at diffusing angry customers, especially when they were upset over things beyond our control as sales representatives. As long as you're willing to put yourself out there to folks you will be successful but you have to be able to be 100% at work and perform 100% otherwise it will wear you down."
good,We had flexible schedule was able to work from home 3 days an week. The company made sure that we were kept up to date with all the changes and training for the company.

I was also responsible for keeping track of inventory stock and also being the key holder at each assigned location when needed."
good,"When I was hired it was by Pacific Telephone, pre-divestiture. Over the years, depending what job/ department I was in, the workplace culture varied. Most of my years were as a Customer service Representative; at different times I handled residential, small business, and Government/ Healthcare accounts where I had a dedicated customer base. In almost all positions work was fast paced, with a lot of multi-tasking and the pressure to meet deadlines. While stressful at times it was very satisfying to be able to resolve problems, or have an irate customer become satisfied. Over the years Pacific Telephone became Pacific Bell, SBC, then AT&T. This is a company that partially due to FCC and PUC regulations, has many rules and regulations for the employees. This required self discipline and staying motivated in the face of the frequent changes that is inherent in telecommunications. It was a good company to have a long term career with."
good,"As an independent consultant, I have served a broad range of companies in the B2B and consumer technology, digital advertising, retail, ecommerce, finance and games and entertainment sectors, delivering proven results in public and analyst relations, executive training, event planning and marketing communications. Key to this success has been my exceptional and highly professional verbal and written communications skills."
good,"It's a great place to work at. Management was great. It was at times stressful, because we had goals that we had to meet every month. And if we did not get our numbers by the middle of the month, then we would have to push harder at the end of the month to succeed."
good,"Worked at AT&T until merger."
good,"Job security, benefits, opportunities for career advancement abound. The ability to stay at the company and move locations was a plus for me. The corporate culture however can be difficult in any large corporation."
good,AT&T provides great career opportunities and benefits.  Great training and career advancement.  Work culture is very supportive for new and senior employees.
good,"A typical day includes a morning huddle to present the daily goals we need to meet, go on the sales floor and assist customers. Part of assisting customers includes asking the right questions to try and offer them products they may need. The company is transitioning to a focus on entertainment so a large part of the job is selling DirecTV. It can be high-pressure at times and management makes it very clear what they want. They do a good job at helping you if you need it. Your co-workers are your team members and you make pretty good relationships. Most of the time we get along and it makes for a great environment."
good,Muy buen trabajo solo que son muchas horas las que te hacen laborar
good,"First time working at a call center, met nice people, good working environment. Supervisors were good, others not so good but I got to work with good people."

good,"AT&T Has been a good place to work. "
good,"Management suffered when it was not done locally, but regionally.  Following 15 years of local management, our office was governed by regional managers who visited the location 2-3 times per year and performance suffered."
good,Working with this company trained me how to troubleshoot effectively and how to provide immaculate customer service experiences. Daily situations enabled me to display my ability to problem solve and successfully sell products and services.
good,"At the time the company was AT&T Broadband, it was fun to work there, they gave out prizes and gifts. Having free service was also great . The shift was nice Mon-Thurs.10-8"
good,"A typical day at work for me was making sure I started my day off with a positive strong mind and provided my customers with great positive energy and great service on each call.  I learned that every customer is different and so are their needs, so show empathy and understanding to every situation. My experience with management was okay I had managers that engaged with the team, which resulted in top performances,  Workplace culture was nice and we received a company lunch once a month.  The hardest part of the job sometimes was reaching the projected sales goal  because the calls were not coming in.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fulfillment that I had knowing I was able to truly help my customer and resolve their concerns."
good,"Empresa que respeita os funcionários, com uma visão inovadora do mercado."
good,Great place to work.  AT&T is a great place to work and provides lots of career growth opportunities.  I enjoyed working there and would recomend to others.

good,"I've worked in several positions with the company: tech support, retail, in home solutions. Each has their pros and cons. Overall, solid company to work for."
good,Working for AT&T or any cell phone company in a retail environment is challenging.  New promotions almost weekly and constant training for new equipment and customer issues.  I love these kinds of challenges.
good,"a typical day at AT&T starts with the manager giving you a run down on what the focus metric is for the day.(I.E Directv, FirstNet, New Lines, Accessories, Pro-Tech appointments, iCloud subscribers) Whatever it is that we are not doing well on is usually the main focus. Outside the usual main focus which is Directv, AT&T is switching up how they view themselves not as a cell phone company but as a entertainment company that also has cell phones. We get our iPads and things we need for daily work to function normally. we greet customer whether they are new or existing customers go over the benefits and try to find a way to sell new products or services even if your only coming in to pay a bill we look for every opportunity to sell you something. now the business is commission based and numbers driven. But I have worked with great people for the most part so they do know how to hire some quality people but I have heard differently in places I didn't work"
good,the people at AT&T are fun to work with and very friendly. if you need help they are there all you have to do is ask. but my over all experience while I worked there was fun and I learned a lot from other employees and friends.
good,"AT&T was an excellent company to build professionals, develop leadership and promote from within. AT&T provided structure as well as latitude to install your own business plan to be successful."
good,"As with most telecom company's there are always busy days, I worked on the network side of the business. There is constant change and growth trying to stay update with new technologies and process ideas to run an efficient and error free network."

good,"My experience as a Prem Tech is amazing, so many job functions  to embrace and learn, I like the challenging aspect of the job.willing to advance to other departments, very difficult."
good,"Environment really depends on what location you're in. some stores have a very relaxed store mostly because of the type of traffic. It can be very hectic, but at the same time you could go all day without doing much. As long as you sell the way your managers want you to sell then you should be safe."
good,I had the pleasure of working for AT&T call center. The coach leaders were very supportive in promoting hard working employees. They like to promote within which is a plus. It is very competitive with over 100 reps per center. Great tuition reimbursement program and benefits
good,"Productive and fun place to work with a lot of fun things to do coworker were really friendly and understandable  unfortunatly the company was bougth out and went to a different state regardigng ATT Yellow Pages, one of the cool things was that you had free breakfast every day, no limit in regards of food or any other type of eatable things"
good,"Learned a lot about countries qualification to enter, learned about passports and visa's, learned how to schedule an appointment to go to a passport agency."
good,A typical day at work a customer call very upset about their bill advised charged for something they didn't order. The hardest part is to trying to  calm them down when they are very upset.
good,"It was a great opportunity and taught me a lot that I still use today. AT&T was big on promoting from within, and if you put in the work, you were given the opportunity to further your career."
good,"While working for ATT, I was a full time college student. I made my own schedule and did my own hours. I became a bit much to keep up with class for certification with ATT with me being a Full time college student."
good,"The people were not as good at collaboration as IBM and Federal Reserve Bank. People were less than helpful in providing training and education and ""lay of the land""."
good,att offers good job security depending on the role held at the company. I worked in the resolutions department which dealt with a lot of irate customers but it didn't  bother me any.
good,"Call back policy was unfair because if you made sure to check everything before ending call such as making sure emails can be opened- passwords saved, wrote down &  sites accessed and customer called back because they forgot they're password after you made sure they could get in a knew password b/f ending call and customer called back you were still penalized."
good,All in all it was fair...........the amount of characters needed for this review is a few too many for me........................I'd work there again.
good,"just bad manager problem but I don't blame AT&T, I love the company. my commission and the stipulations in my favor. They also paid for my flight to and from the paid training and my hotel was paid for a shuttles was provided to training facility. I also. hada great time in training"

good,Great place to work.  I have learned a lot at AT&T.  AT&T has granted me the opportunity to grow.  I have also completed two degree programs at AT&T.  AT&T has great benefits including a tuition reimbursement program...
good,Overall AT&T has been a great place to work.  Compensation and benefits are good.  Leadership affords you flexibility to do your job.   Most leaders are great and care about the direct reports.
good,"depends on the department and manager, can be wonderful or terrible"
good,"a typical day at work involves receiving customer calls and answer questions on their bills, review current services, and try to either upgrade their current services or try to discover opportunities for the customers to take advantage of more services. very easy for those who are very good at building rapport. environment and management are fun to work around. overall a good place to work."
good,"AT&T equips employees with extensive ongoing education and development of current and upcoming products and services. The training and development provided by the company is world class and readily prepares its employees for success. The area of opportunity is with advancement opportunities. There is an extreme lack of options for growth within the company. This is not due to a failure to promote, job openings are just extremely rare and infrequent."
good,Great company  to work for at first. Being low seniority and it being a union job security is always a worry. Was getting layed off and got new opportunities to move up on a limited term contract but away from home.
good,This is a job review for Indeed.com even though it is for a job that I have not ever attained so they are forcing me to write something so here you go.
good,"It was a very nice environment to work in the Walmart that my kiosk was positioned, the management was very encouraging, always helpful almost the way"

good,"Great place to work. "
good,"The department I worked at is now closed.  However, it was a nice place to work and we had a very good work culture.  The most enjoyable part of working here was the teamwork that we all worked towards."
good,"The experience of working there provided me to be more goal related, at&t motto was one and done meaning they like to solve all issues in one call by asking the relevant question's and allowing the customer to say all their needs at that point we come to a resolution"
good,"This was a job where you had the opportunity to assist customers in all manner of cell phone issues, including billing and retainment.  I enjoyed it because I had the ability to take care of the customer and solve all manner of problems."
good,It was great to work with this company I enjoyed the corporate training and how kowledgeable they made me toward there products. I loved the family closeness we had with the workers
good,"Great people , great atmosphere but no upward mobility just lateral and you peak out depending on economy at 45k. Several employees have been here over 4 years."
good,Working there you take calls and help your customers reach what they are calling in for. If you run into a problem management is there to help resolve the issue.
good,Buen ambiente laboral horario muy bueno y accesible y cercas de mi casa
good,"I was sent to a full course on how AT&T operated. This took 4 months to complete. I then was given a company truck on my completing the 4 month training courses, that I got paid for. For as my every day job, I drove around the city and met great people and fixed there internet, t.v or cable. Whats not to like about this job, really?"
good,"AT&T is a fast paced, high pressure sales environment.  Pay and benefits are very good as expectations to perform are high.  There are opportunities for advancement.  Relocation options are available."
good,Excellent experience at AT&T and would love to work again if an opportunity comes.  Leadership leads by example and the company missions and vision drives company direction.
good,hay oportunidades de crecimiento. y mucho aprendizaje.. exelente ambiente laboral.
good,"Working for AT&T is only a job for selective people. You have to be able to handle situations under high pressure, be able to multitask at all times. It could be very stressful at times but I feel like AT&T went above and beyond to support there employees with everything."
good,"If you are a technology specialist, leader or innovator, its a good idea to work for a technology company who on average spends a large share of operations, investment and profits on IT and technology.  This substantially helps with affecting change, making improvements and competing against national and global markets.  AT&T fits this paradigm well.  I certainly recommend AT&T for technologists."
good,"I enjoyed my time at AT&T/SBC/Ameritech, all regional telecommunications companies merged under the umbrella of AT&T."
good,"The job pays very well and has great benefits, and perks . But it is a very demanding environment and you work most holidays and weekends unless you have seniority. Even then you still work most holidays.  You're under a high pressure environment and deal with angry customers. You also meat a lot of great people."
good,"I liked working at AT&T, and would work there again."
good,"While the pay was good for the work performed, the days were long and sometimes hard. There were various inconsistencies from above making it difficult to always please the bosses."
good,"● Assisted with the developing a cohesive, sensible organization standard for the warehouse, allowing for time saving when locating products through the recommendation for the use of a bar code scanner for asset tracking. ● Audited records and documents to ensure that information is complete, accurate, and up to date with 100% accuracy. ● Entered, manipulated, and analyzed data to generate reports for decision making purposes. ● Created, implemented, and maintained a record keeping system of facilities, equipment, circuits, and capital investments."
good,Att is a good place to work and pays good with good benefits but has its up and downs like every job. Has it's good days but everything is based on numbers.
good,Unfortunately the department i was in has been down sized several times over the past few years and shortly will not be a department anymore.  Which was a sad thing to see so many people lose their jobs.
good,Benefits were amazing and they do give you a lot of options to build yourself.  Issues  I would say are due to size of company which are typical.  Slow movement of projects and decisions.  Also company so big management really has no idea what is really happening on a day to day basis.
good,"Fast paced; managers always helpful; hardest part of job was change because it happened daily without notice,  co workers always friendly and willing to help"
good,When working for any company it is up to the individual to set his or her goals.  There will be management that help you reach those goals and there will be management who will hold you back you just have to keep in mind what you want and don't let anyone stop you.
good,I loved the time I spent working for AT&T. I had the opportunity to be mentored and developed by great management. I would likely still be with the company if job eliminations hadn't been made.
good,I enjoyed the work but the manager at the time was unreasonable. AT&T switched us over to Direct TV and lowered our salaries that played a major role in my leaving the company.
good,"Es Muy bueno porque se cancela todas las prestaciones de ley y ofrecen ascender al empleado y el ambiente laboral es excelente , éso significa el filtro que realiza cada empresa Para contratar al empleado."
good,Working at AT&T Mobility is idle for people who seek to further their technological erudition  and people skills. Its set-professional atmosphere promotes achievement and accountability among individuals and appointed aggregates.

good,"Worked with this company for more than 13 years, its one of the big telecom companies in USA. Jobs I did with AT&T were all great, had a chance to play different roles and it was a good learning experience"
good,"Fast pace work environment , with good management. Pay is comparable across the industry. The company seems to be moving in the correct direction.  It is a solid company with a great future."
good,AT&T train employees and prepare them for big opportunites. the company is more than a university . great company to work for but sudden layoffs are discouraging. Good benefits though.
good,"Fair wages  - Union based company.  Sales is a grind - but persistence will help you win.  Treat customers with respect and help them and they will love you."

good,ATT was a health work-family mix.  my family grew while working for ATT and I was able to move forward in my career.  We were always well informed what was required of us.
good,"I worked part time for a short period of time.  Management was flexible with my hours. Good company to work for. I had to leave to take care of my children, otherwise I would have stayed.The training was on the job, managers and employees were very helpful while undergoing the training.  Always answered questions to help you learn the technology."
good,I loved working there and I would not have left but I had to relocate to another state. Co-workers were always willing to help each other out when someone had a question. Management was relaxed and easy to talk.
good,I worked there as a contract to hire.  AT&T had to lay off much of the employees in the POTS BU so the contractors were let go and the current employees were reassigned to those positions.  The company showed faithfulness to their employees.
good,"It was really fun working there, great co-workers, the pay was ok, and most importantly you get to learn a lot of new technology in a way to help provide a great customer service."
good,"typical day included saving accounts, upgrading equipment and definitely deescalating clients. i learned how to empathize with frustrated clients to build relationships"
good,"I enjoyed my job a lot! I started as just a sales representative then advanced into managing business accounts, then manager and training and finally into running my own store. I accomplished all of this in about 4.5 years. Then when there was a change in upper management I decided that the bogus things he was bringing down on my head wasn't worth the stress. If it had not been for him I would still be with the company."

I learned to make air reservations for domestic and international travel.  Learned to submit receipts to accounts payable for expenses.  The most enjoyable part of the day was when you have completed all task assigned daily. The workplace culture was comfortable.  The hardest part of the day was when task were not completed on a timely basis. Salary was depending on who your manager was."

good,"I enjoyed my experience at AT&T for about 9 years, my problem though is that the room for advancement is very minimal with leaders staying in their role for 20+ years."
good,"Can't speak for other companies, yet it appears to me that AT&T is a pretty solid place to work.  Decent pay and benefits, high quality of people.  Glad I had an extensive time to work there."
good,I often look back at my time at AT&T as when I refined my contract skills in a way that I have not seen any other company match.   The professionalism at that company is second to none.
good,"I've been with AT&T for over 18yrs and for most of that time I've had to deal with the threat of being laid off, and now it's finally happening. I have 60 days to find another job. I'm off the payroll October 19, 2018"
good,"I was a top performer so management really tried to work with me for career advancement. The culture was fun, coachings seemed more like casual conversation.  It's a sales job so you have quotas to meet but there was no micromanaging as long as you were on target to meet your goal. There were fun incentives. They give you a company phone which was nice and some other nice gifts when you start. I really enjoyed my time there"
good,This is a great company. I love the fact they take me as a customer into perspective. I feel like going to to att is like going home and I can do encounters on a daily basis. I love being around the atmosphere to the point I do not want to leave. They have great phone deals that are unimaginably great towards new or existing customers. My last visit were met with warm welcomes and great expectations of sales. I will forever go back to the store for just the warm experience brought upon me by workers there.
good,The company was Directtv when I worked there. The work from home program was great and allowed me ample time to do what I needed to do because I worked a split shift when I first started.
good,"The typical work day can be very competitive even on slower days, and monthly goals can sometimes be intimidating, although for the most part attainable. The pay is more than worth it, however, and there are nice perks beyond the normal benefits."
good,"we had a great manager, she was fair, she allowed us to grown in our jobs, but also demand that stuff get done on time, which wasnt a problem. we were a 24/7 shop."

good,This job was cut throat and very hard to keep up with it if you weren't a quick learner. Promos were constantly changing. The co workers were fun and there is a lot of down time when customers are not in store.
good,"A typical day at work consists of ensuring I have work, proper tools, supplies and equipment to complete my days assignments.  Contact each customer prior to arrival and explain what I am going to do.  Address any concerns that they may have when I am doing the job.  Manager may call me about a damage claim from a job that I have done or another technician had done.  Contact the customer and talk to them about the damage.  Go out and inspect the damage, determine if it was done by myself, a technician from our group or someone not affiliated with AT&T.

good,The job was decently decent but some things i just really had to gripe about for which i could go on and on and on. The hours are long and longer during the holidays
good,"The job is what you make it with lots of opportunity to contribute.  The company is currently transitioning from a telecom company to a telecom + media company.  This will be great for the long term evolution of the company (Wireless Engineers should chuckle at that); however, is causing personal restructuring that will last a couple of years."
good,Being apart of the AT&T team was a great experience for me and i really enjoyed the training and the management. I would recommend anyone who is new in sales.  They were definitely a stepping stone.

good,"Sales location and good benefits for employees"
good,"Easy position the work can be repetitive at times, the atmosphere is very relaxed. i enjoyed the activities for the employees and the people i worked with . Just wish i enjoyed time with my family more , time of process is a joke if you ask me, you can only use time on pre approved time slots. you get to bid for your time at the beginning of the year which makes no since because you dont always know in advance when you need to take a day off"
good,I worked from home for att through another company. We went from getting paid per hour to pay per call so i had to find another job. The company seemed fine.

good,"Pros: "
good,"It was a good working environment at the Directv shop, when we pick up in the morning before our shift starts we would have team meetings and everyone was in a good mood ready to work or informed each other about problems they experienced out in the field. We would try to help each other to get the jobs done as soon as possible."
good,I worked on several teams over 3 years. Some of the teams were supportive and a lot of work got done. One of the teams was being taken over by off shore contractors who did their best to shut out the full time workers. I understand this is being corrected.

good,"This is more of a work while going to school type job. The hours are flexible, the managers are easy to work with as long as you have coverage so it gives the possibility to work on your degree while still working a full 39 hours. The commissions combined with the hourly can really stack up, as long as you are meeting quota and putting in the effort to hit numbers. Overall, i would recommend this job if you  are a sells and money driven person who can manage its own time. Work environment is slow paced and very friendly co-workers."

good,Great pay and benefits.  People are great to work with and the work is interesting and fun.  If the center was not closing I had hoped to continue working there.
good,"After clocking in to the computer, most days we would have a 15 minute team minute to talk about previous days accomplishments and new things going forward. Start taking calls, some time the call volume was heavy and sometimes it will be steady. Some calls were tough and some calls were smooth, If we had any questions, we had floor support."
good,"Buena capacitación, buen ambiente de trabajo, excelente compañía"
good,"Freedom to innovate and try new things make this a good company to work for. I've become a master at CSS because teaching other help you learn even more of what you are teaching.

good,"They pay is amazing. Good base, good commission. Long retail hours. Weekend and holidays. Managers want you to sell a lot so it can get very stressful. Overall worth doing for 1-5 years"

good,Would work for AT&T if there were opportunities in my area.Had to relocate to Roanoke Va and there was not a U-verse location in the area. This was the only disappointment i experienced with AT&T.
good,"AT&T is evolving to become a more futuristic workplace with collaboration workspaces and flexible work hours.  AT&T's campus in Middletown, New Jersey is set in a beautifully wooded area which is convenient to major thoroughfares.  The hardest part of my job was managing a truly global workforce (i.e., time zone differences).  My two best managers were women who knew more about our work than anyone in the organizations.  I met many people at AT&T who have become friends I will have forever.  I traveled the world, representing AT&T with partner carriers, while I worked on International Service development."
good,It was fast paced but not stressful.  Very informative and educational.  It was rewarding being able to help customers with their services and their payments

good,"I have started with this company 2 years ago and have already been promoted twice, once to outside sales and my current position of assistant store manager. I enjoy the team feel of this job, it's encouraging as well as fun to meet quota's together as a team. It can at times be stressful but I feel any job with a quota at a time when the economy isn't doing well can be stressful. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my team grow as sales persons and see them advancing their careers and reaching their goals."
good,"Great Company, I have enjoy my time with company over the years."
good,"wonderful worklife. worklife n personnel balance is the atmost prioirty here , worked on amazing client facing role and got lot of support from them.."

good,Great place to work  Would highly recommend.  Professional environment with valuable work assignments.  You feel like you are genuinely contributing to the company's objectives and goals.
good,I was an opex machine operator i worked the mail extraction machine the opex 50/51 Opex 150 I also ran the transporter machine which the payments went to the bank directly

good,The job was great I meet great people and I worked with awesome co-workers. I learned a lot about sales and technology. The schedule was too demanding and AT&T didn’t  offer adequate time to be with my family. I also had I high overturn in managers and assistant managers in the 2 years I was there so I didn’t have a sense of real leadership at the location.
good,"Pros: Great coworkers with varied and extensive knowledge. There people who work at AT&T are what make it a great place to work. Great health benefits. Flexible work location/ schedules."
good,Nice up to date offices. Everything moves slow and has a process. Discounts are a very nice perk. The culture is in a an awkward stage since it is currently going through a transition.
good,"I was one of ATT model agents so i handled collections for all lines of business they were buying out at the time i loved it! they were always eager to teach you new skills and offer new discounts, promotions within only available to the agents. frequently our site director would get bonuses from ATT and we would have food pushed up and down the isles and ATT is all to happy to even give you a percentage of your collections if your meting metrics they essentially throw money at you haha 10/10 would probably go back if my site wasn't closed down."
good,"It’s was a great experience to work at! this company unfortunately there contract was taking away , I had to continue my future somewhere else . But I appreciate the opportunity and the experience they gave me."
good,Great place to work for 11 years. The pay was great! The benefits were awesome! The most stressful part of the job is the fact that we had to maintain a very high quota which some months were hard to do.
good,I started first as a provisioner and moved up to a CSR from there I was able to change position in the company be it lateral or upgrade. I finished as a Loyalty CSR.
good,"Well my review of this place reminded me of a place in transition of the time I worked there. Alot of change going on, and in the tech field they were always trying to reach first place. Along the way they made strides, and management was great in terms of motivating the employees. A great place to work. Pay was good, offering yearly wages. Unfortunately the management team was often getting replaced due to constant change in the tech world and ideas were not getting through to upper management before sudden change was made to avoid constant shakeups that didnt work out."
good,AT&T was a nice place to work. Management was helpful. Company educated you on the updated technology. I developed life long friend while I was their.
good,"I worked for Direct TV. Typical day was installing and setting up Direct TV, The management was always around to help if we got into a spot we couldn't figure out."
good,"fun connecting with customers an get them all setup learned a lot when i was in training an learning how to install phone, internet, cable.  The worst things about the job was the whether but overall the jos was great"
good,"Job is very stressful. You have to meet various goals each week, and your numbers are posted on a public board. Schedule is rigid and is based on a bidding system. You are given tools to succeed in the company. Company has great benefits and awesome incentives."
good,"Siempre con ganas de ir a trabajar por el gran ambiente de trabajo, aprendi mucho en servicio al cliente interno y externo, solucionar problemas en menos tiempo, canalizar las dudas con las personas  indicadas, la cultura muy buena, la parte mas dificil es saber que la empresa esta catalogada como de las mejores empresa para trabajar pero si le falta  un poco mas de valores en ese especto."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Business as usaal, learned so much from being at this company, management was a rollercoaster ride but everyone put the needs of the business as  first priority. The hardest part of the job was the stresses and demands to be great. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling accomplished at the end of  the day, the team work to accomplish the goals that were set for by the organization, and most all the level of knowledge and education that was received. The learning was fanominal."
good,"Great job and work culture! Regional and area managers are great, but store management needs more training in dealing with the diverse workforce. Work schedule sucks for new hires unless you like closing everyday and working weekends. You do not have a choice unless someone is willing to swap with you, due to the fact that the schedules are company generated and the schedule bidding process is based upon seniority. Vacation days are provided after 90 days, but no sick days are available without penalty. So basically, you can call in and get paid for the day, but you will get penalized with a point. Once you tally up 4 points, you get a write up and once 8 points, termination. Instances of being late, .25 of a point up to 1 point, depending on how late you are. Aside from the scheduling proces and time off policies, there is not much to complain about. Great place to work with a wide variety of career advancement paths!"
good,AT&T is a good company to work for.  As long as you hit your goals you are good and keep doing your job.  Goals are set with the market growth taken into account
good,"I learned so much and worked with some amazing co-workers.  But in the end it was upper management that created a dislike for my job.  The covering of their backside at the cost of good employees was all "
good,AT&T is a great place to work.  The company pays well and gives raises every 6 months.  You work the same shift for 3 months and then you bid on the shift you want.
good,"Productive work environment with challenging assignments. "
good,AT&T is a business that provides great educational opportunities as well as training to be successful in the field in which you work. AT&T also provides opportunities to advance in the workforce.

good,"Great company to work for, lots of perks of working for an American conglomerate.   Had a wonderful time working there, the teams all over the world were very friendly and easy to work with."
good,"fast paced,"
good,since this is a big company running many critical telecom apps. It has a fast paced and competitive environment. There is stress and lots of pressure to do your work as quick as possible.
good,My work day is busy and fast paced by rewarding. My team of managers work well together and support an Area Manager that covers the entire state of Georgia.
good,"Overall a good place to work and long term employment. If you are looking to stay with a company for 30 to 40 years and retiring from there, ATT is a good choice for you."
good,At&t was a great place to work. The best part of my job was meeting many different people. Working with a team that is motivated and dedicated to serving customers the best possible experience was one of the greatest gifts I could have received while working for At&t. I highly recommend At&t.
good,Not particularly fond of a unionized job.  Sought other employment due to pay not being as competitive as other companies.   Would work for them again in the future
good,outlook on employee morale has changed over 10 years. seems like bottom line is to get rid of high salaries and replace with less salaries. job performance and longevity doesn't matter anymore.
good,"Good company to work for until the yellow pages division was sold. Provided low cost health insurance. Fun place to work, not a micro managed company."
good,AT&T has always been great. A typical day for me was to find the root cause of why the customer was calling in or chatting in and help them resolve their issue. I learned that you can have fun and work at the same time when you are in a great environment full of people who have integrity and respect for each other. The hardest part of the job was the availability during holiday and breaks. Most people would request time off and I'd be working alone. I love the people I worked with. It was one of the highlights of the job.
good,Overall it is definitely a great job for anyone just getting into the work force but it is not the place I would retire from given my experience! Definitely apply today!
good,AT&T was a great place to work.  It is large with many different opportunities to find what you are looking for.  The management and culture are good.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Fast-paced selling with continuous knowledge of multiple products and services. Sold DirecTv, Tablets, Security alarm systems, accessories with each cell phone purchase."
good,fun to place to work but also the location I worked at saw a high amount of culturally different clients  For me as a bilingual rep I loved this.  Many of my fellow workers to the manager level where not open to this and I saw lots of racisim  One reason I left the job
good,I left because I was offered double the salary to go open QOS in latin america and simply couldn't walk away from that type of offer solid company except when CEO took stock into a nose dive
good,"Excellent salary and benefits. Work schedule could be grueling at times, but overtime was beneficial. Vacations were chosen by seniority, wont get holidays off until at least 10 years on job"
good,I would work for this company again if I had the chance to work there again.  I would want to retire for a company like that. Leader of technology and inovation.
good,Because this web site will allow me to continue unless I review this employer. Also it requires more characters than any ordinary human will use on a review.
good,Fun innovative environment with good pay and benefits. Great support from all levels of staff. Great rapport in the community. company gives you all the tools necessary to complete each task.
good,"It was ok I rolled over from a temp job to full time, pay was  ok and hours where good. Hours was great and the work place was alright not to hard not to easy. I enjoyed working there."
good,Good remote work environment with good tools and collaboration with leads and management.  Very professional teams and leadership with plenty of resources for success.
good,"Over the course of the past decade through much merger and acquisition, job roles and functions are constantly changing. Overall a great place to work and advance, should you be able to navigate the shifting corporate initiatives."
good,"Great company. Great coworkers. Up to date on applications needed to work seamlessly. Management is fair. Benefits & pay are higher than average."
good,I was a sales support rep.  I had to help the sales people. It was great satisfaction to help people solve their phone issues.  I also helped put up store decorations.
good,Buen hambiente de trabajo seguridad social estabilidad laboral escelente trabajo constante
good,Working for AT&T was definitely a great move for me. It allowed me to save up enough money to begin going to college. Gathered a lot of experience working there and had fun as well.
good,"I really enjoyed my team and the professionalism on campus. Depending on your role, there is a lot to learn at AT&T. There is a bit of job insecurity as many of the roles are contract without being many opportunities to become permanent."
good,Each day at this company is based on what you make of it. Stay positive and energetic and the customers will feed off of it. When the customers are happy the company is happy which comes down to making your pockets happy.
good,"Once you learn the processes and systems it is a great place to be. Management works much like the military chain of command but will help get problems solved. The only negative is that being so large, it does take time to get things accomplished."
good,Good experience good management and people to work with fun and competitive good bonuses flexible hours good training laid back good career opportunities
good,Empresa en desarrollo. Buen ambiente de trabajo y buenos compañeros.
good,Most of the departments were pretty good.  Unfortunately they moved my call center to a different state.  I enjoyed my time there and would probably still be there if I had the chance.
good,"I loved working at At&T, i was a customer service support technician. They were very flexible with my hours since i was a full time student. Managers and coworkers are super friendly."
good,"Wonderful atmosphere for single individuals. Not a great place to work if you have a family or if you plan on starting one. Long hours, overflow of overtime, standing on your feet the entire shift, competitive workplace, sales incentives, awards and bonuses. Great opportunities to network."
good,"AT&T was Pacific Bell Wireless when I started in 1998, and it was a pleasure. I loved my job. By the early 2000's it became Cingular Wireless, and it was still a great company to work for. A few less perks, but still generally, open minded and fun. They welcomed ideas and individuality. By the mid 2000's, when Cingular ""merged"" with AT&T, we were all assured that it was Cingular doing the merging. Not so. AT&T took over with a vengeance. Gone were holiday parties, bonuses, they eliminated roll over vacation time and honor-system time sheets.. and all ""non-bargained"" employees were forced to become unionized. Then came the ""Cookie Cutter""store set up.  No more individualized seasonal store marketing. Personal time and vacation time was lumped together. Write ups happened if you called in sick. I stuck it out for 6 years. In that time, the stores I would get assigned or transferred to, went through dozens of managers, and I would have a great rapport with most, even given the fact that I had more experience, and I saw most of them get hired as Sales Associates. For the most part, I earned more, simply due to longevity, and it was an especially sore point with the last management team I worked with.  Plus, I had a stellar reputation amongst every store in our region, so that didn't help their cause.. Long story short, we mutually parted ways, just when my future husband needed an expert office assistant!"
good,it was years ago so i dont know exactly how its ran now but when i was there it was a nice laid back environment i never really had a bad day working there
good,I am interested in pursuing other opportunities in the insurance industry. ATT has opportunities in the Information Technology industry. Big Data analyst opportunities.
good,I work for directv before AT&T bought it out. They treated you well if you were a good worker. I had an injury from a fall in the winter and they took care of me but they never took me back.
good,"Take calls all day from customers inbound customers about billing, txt messages or phone not working.  Troubleshoot phones, go over bills with customers if they do not understand the bill."
good,Every day at AT&T was Productive and never missed Work Life balance. There was lot of team work and management support through out the product life cycle.
good,empresa muy buena en el tratoa la gente cumplidos con el pago
good,"Very competitive environment, great career both as a Technician and Field Manager. Extensive training and experience and exposure to sales and customer service"
good,"The people were great the atmosphere was dirty at our office we had no assigned desk and sometimes not at all. The hours were not flexible enough, and had major language barriers with foreign phone calls."
good,"* Flujo fuerte de clientes para atención, clientes difíciles, con poco que ofrecerles, pero tratando de rescatar un buen servicio, eramos medidos en todos los aspectos."
good,"Not a job for people with excessive allergies, pay is pretty good,  but I have never heard of anyone being transferred to corporate like they wanted even after 7 years of service, you can go to higher level tech positions but you will still be working outside."
good,"You're working for a Government Agency and requirements can change at a moments notice and must be able to adjust as per requirements.  Friendly people, good benefits."
good,"If you are willing to put in the time on/off the job for training and education the company arranges for you, you will do well.  The company has many training classes and partnerships with technical and online classes to help build the skills the company is looking to emphasize."
good,Great Bonus and Benefits.  Exceptional Management.  Flexibility.  Easy to balance family and work life.  Great stock options.  A lot of opportunity for growth.
good,AT&T is a great place to work.  The people are top notch as are the products.  Competitive pricing pressures have caused the company to have to cut back on the service and support resources making it harder to service customers.
good,overall a good company to work for. benefits and compensation are as good as any comparable company. management has always been fair with the work groups I've had experience with. avoiding the layoffs in the ever changing job roles is the most difficult part.
good,"This job is High stress and 2/5 of my managers were horrible."
good,un buen lugar para trabajar con un ambiente ameno.
good,At&t is a very good client to be working with. There are a lot of opportunites in AT&T. It has balanced work culture. Overall AT&T is a good client and I am enjoying my tenture here.
good,Really enjoyed all of the years I worked for AT&T.  The pay was good for my position and the benefits were great.  I would defininately recommend AT&T as a place to work.
good,Yellowpage advertising and marketing .  Extensive sales training was provided.  Managemetn was excellent.  Expectation was extremely high and the pay was not compensatory for the volume of sales expected.
good,Good work environment that provided the flexibility to manage your own time and projects. Highly collaborative culture focused on developing technical solutions for corporate clients.
good,I left this company because the schedule was inconsistent and you had to work every single weekend. Sometimes you would close one day and open the next. I personally like something a little more routine.
good,"The team was a well accomplished combination of multiple disciplines, and great collaborative characteristics."
good,"I worked for Primm Communications, which was a franchise of AT&T."
good,AT&T was very structured.  Loved the aspect of having a union for employees though not favored highly with management.  Management communicated well and adhered to staff requests.
good,Very fast paced environment. A lot of deadlines. Very good teams at att to work with. this job was very knowledgeable and learned a lot from here which will help me in future.
good,"Typical day was setting up a work schedule to visit locations within assigned territory to meet with sales managers/sales representatives to teach about AT&T products and services to that knowledge with their customers to purchase AT&T.  "
good,"AT&T has been a great place to work.  If you are willing to develop yourself they will give you the tools to do so.  The range of work, from clerical and call center jobs to the high end technician jobs are there.  I relocated twice to work in the outside plant jobs that have been my career.  If you develop yourself and your education, if you can move to where they need you there are not too many employers out there that compete with their compensation."
good,Learned a great deal in the variation of the product testing teams in the labs. Learned how to navigate with managers and executives. Good place to work. I enjoyed working with other collaborative team members.
good,It is a cool work place. You can wear comfortable clothes and shoes. The managers and superiors are friendly and very supportive. They are helpful as well.
good,Nice place to work. A great place for people who thrive under pressure. Extremely fast paced and competitive. The best part of the job is the free lunch and baked pie
good,"Daily, I was a commuter so I prepared myself mentally for the hardest part of my job on my drive in to receive high call volumes  and having an ""I can help you with that attitude""...worked as a team to assist in resolving customers issues. Management was the absolute best, my mgr in general always inspired our team to follow the Golden Rule pretty much...made us tap into the empathetic portion of being a call center rep.  The most enjoyable part was our team meetings...we were able to candidly discuss the good, the bad and the ugly."
good,"Loved working at att,made great money met wonderful people and had a great management team . The job itself was stressful but the commission made up for it."
good,"La oportunidad de trabajar en DirecTv y conocer más sobre los productos y como se manejan es una experiencia enriquecedora que se queda para toda la vida, un muy buen grupo de trabajo"
good,"Limited job advancement in current organization.  Fantastic health/401k benefits with company match.  Overall, positive culture and great company perks."
good,I found working at AT&T to be very challenging but fulfilling. AT&T has a career platform that is rich in opportunity. AT&T provides many areas of interest which allowed me to work in very different and challenging roles throughout the entire time I was there.
good,AT&T was a good place to work overall.  They had a robust IT department with plenty of training opportunities.  There is a great deal of advancement opportunity in the organization.
good,I think it was an awesome job to be at. I do think management could have handled situations  little differently but other than that i think anyone should tryto work at at&t.
good,At&t was a fun place to work. I worked in the corporate building in Cerritos California. I was a credit and activation specialist so id help people get approved for phones.
good,At&t treated me ok. I worked at entry level job and within two years had been promoted twice. Of course they were a union shop so I was layed off because I had less service than most anyone else.
good,"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams. My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option."
good,"Balance work place enjoyable good benefits and friendly environment "
good,"A typical day at AT&T is coaching and developing my team of 17 direct reports, what I leaned as a coach everyone is different and you learn to coach  each reps personality weakness and strengths. The hardest part of my job was gaining my team trust , once I accomplished that task it made my job easier. What I enjoy most is seeing my team excell and rewarding them when they do something great and that success comes with acknowledging the good and bad behaviors."
good,"Great Place. Fun environment, very nice people."
good,"Awesome company to work for, eight hours days, ability to learn is up to the employee, work place is pleasant, laid back, the hardest part of the job was the traffic getting there and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers and outside organizations to meet the task."
good,ATT was a fun place to work.  I was only there for about 6 months and it was 15 years ago so do not remember too much.  I was a customer support rep so on the phone all day.
good,Working for AT&T is what you make of it. It can be fun as long as you stay focused and have fun at the same time. It's not an easy job and not everyone can handle the demand of being a sales consultant.
good,"i enjoyed the art of the hustle and bustle .i loved to come in contact with a customer, who only came to window shop, ,but after coming in contact with me, and allowing me to show them the value in which our products had, and how it would simplify, and maker their lives much easier ,gave me such a huge rush"
good,"Working for a company that is very large poses issues:"
good,"My first 5 1/2 years I spent as a directory assistance operator.  I also worked on the error correction team so that listings could be found easier by operators.  Management was supportive and made the workplace comfortable.  Hardest part of this job was the customers who didn't know an address for a location.  Being w/ coworkers and the fast paced calls were the best part of this job.  "
good,I had great co workers and it was a great place to work. Very enjoyable only thing i didn't like i traveled and hour to work so it was far for me but other then that great company.
good,If i can go back to this job i def would although sometimes it gets overwhelming with the customers calling and complaining about thing i had no control of
good,"Great place to work, they teach you everything you need to know from the ground up. All supplies and materials provided. Very competitive so makes for an environment where mistakes carry a big penalty."
good,"Great company to work for although in the past 20 years things have changed dramatically."
good,Work there for 40 years. Been thru a lot of change in technology. I did relocate to remain employed. Multiple opportunities within the company allowed for experience in multiple technology disciplines.
good,I thought working at AT&T provided me with excellent on the job training. I also thought AT&T was good to women employees. Overall my experience at AT&T was very positive.
good,"Great place to work that is competitive in a fun way. "

good,"AT&T has continued to be an excellent place of employment, although the company is not as large as it was decades ago. I can only relate to my time there and aside from the constant fear of layoffs, it was a great place to work"
good,I was a general contractor that worked for AT&T. Their project management team worked well with our troubleshooting team to clear cell tower sites of issues.

Management does it role as you would expect they will listen to you, teach you but will also ensure they do their least favorable jobs and take disciplinary actions as needed.

good,Typical day at work was designing networks for DSL line and T1 communications lines for big companies. learned how to design circuits for communications. Management was a great asset to the company.Hardest part of the job was commuting to work.
good,AT&T pays well they just change up the commission structure so much that the amount you make per year can change at any time. Most people would bring home 60-70K a year and with a snap of a finger it changed to 50-60K just like that because they changed the commission structure. Its very corporate minded meaning there are no ways around their rules if you do anything wrong.

Our management team is friendly they help when you ask or if they are listening to your call and see that you need some assistance. This is the first place that have many different cultures. The hardest part of my job is not being able to restore some of the customers phones. I appreciate the most about my job the managers are definitely there to help.
good,I enjoyed working for the company. I worked in technical support and enjoyed helping customers. Advancement was not an option in the department i worked in though.
good,Great company to work.  If you are mobile and willing to put in the work you can advance.  The pay is pretty good and in line with other companies.  Benefits are ok.
good,I find that working with AT&T allows you to have a great work/life balance. Even though I was a contractor I was given time off if the need arose.  Management and peers treated me like an employee would always consider AT&T for contract opportunities.

The enjoyable part of the job was being around pleasant co-workers, assisting customers, being able to manage all things without supervision."
good,"My experience with AT&T Wireless was very positive. However, I worked in finance within a sales channel that had a great family oriented culture. I am not confident that culture exists everywhere in the company as I have heard much different stories from people that are or have recently worked for them."
good,"excelente empresa, que te brinda oportunidades tanto para aplicar los conocimientos que se tienen y para aprender nuevos procesos, en conclusión es una empresa muy recomendable para trabajar."
good,"i actually enjoyed my time at AT&T."
good,I enjoyed speaking with customers to fix their phone issues and later got to do the same with Spanish customers.  I eventually got promoted to Operations Analyst which I enjoyed.
good,A typical day of work when the week starts  very slow but in the weekend sometimes it was really hard to handle the costumers but the managers teach us how to handle this situations
good,"AT&T Was one of my favorite places to have worked. The only down side was with upper management. They were so disconnected from their customers and it showed in their work policies. When store managers were left to take care of their stores, everything was fine. But when district managers started to micro manage store managers chaos would shortly follow with ridiculous impromptu policies that were considered hazing by Union guidelines."
good,Produced reports daily to help Account Reps to sell SBC communications products. Maintain database of products everyone already have so Account Reps can sell more items.

good,great working environment not much required fun pot lucks and group activities and not much of an advancement opportunity besides floor support which is not much of a higher pay.
good,La gerencia es demsiado agradable el ambiente de trabajo es muy grato.
good,I've not been at AT&T for 20 years but when I was there it was a good company to work for and was cutting edge in it's pursuit of business goals.  The ongoing change they've experienced and growth in their portfolio would be consistent with my previous experience in the early 90's.
good,"- work day will be very balanced , flexible"
good,AT&T provides great benefits and pay but little on the way of advancement and once you advance out of the union and into management little job security
good,"Developed, managed and maintained a comprehensive Business Continuity Program. The program required the annual delivery of the Enterprise Risk Assessment and Vulnerability Study, the Business Impact Analysis, the update/rewrite of the Enterprise Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan. What was most important was the freedom I was given to implement plans and conduct training.  Always had full access to senior and executive management"
good,I don't know how it is to work there now but when I was there it was in a call center It is very hard work dealing with people over the phone. I thought the other employees were great. The management has pro and cons. They were pressured a lot by upper management so that put a lot of pressure on them to push us more
good,"Working as Customer service and sales "
good,i have been working for this company 4 years as premise technician. definitely a great company to work. Every day is a difference experience to work in different house and interacting with different costumers. great opportunity to grow skill showing off  on how to own your job by working on your own most of the time with very little surpervision from management
good,"I had great experiences working for this company. But like many things, jobs are not forever so I had to leave the place. I really enjoyed working for this company."
good,"Duties included the installation, maintenance and repair of telecommunication services for local businesses and residential areas. This included the set up and break down of phone systems, splicing of phone cables from 25pr to 600pr. Daily data inputs and documentation as well as customer care services."
good,At AT&T you are highly trained to use critical thinking and soft skills. It is a very fast paced environment and you are liable to speak with up to 50 people per day to resolve issues on any service that AT&T provides.
good,"Great people at all levels of the company - joining makepositive is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together"
good,"A big telecom firm which seems to be run better than other comparable telecoms that I've worked for.  They strive for best project management practices, not succeeding perfectly but always trying to improve.  My work includes primarily IT support and infrastructure projects, but more recently some software development.  Colleagues are both knowledgeable and professional."
good,"I am a self directed employee who needs to know the goals or mission and then I will make it happen.  No day is like the previous day due to customer interfacing and solving problems.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers.  The workplace culture is open with communication, generous with compliments and work to help me achieve my goals."
good,I love to assisted customers with wireless needs. Cell phones tablets and home services. At times it was very hard dealing with customers bills and issues with phones.
good,"Daily I work for 9 hours"
good,"This experience was in a large office setting.  We had well over 75 people in our group.  It was a very good learning environment.  We were a maintenance group for the state of CA.  The times for locating and correcting problems was very fast paced and exciting.  I really liked working in this type of environment where we had various groups of people for each aspect of the job.  The environment was perfect for me.  I was able to work with other people for ideas, and training to help each other to isolate and correct problems for our customers.  This environment did handle the very basic telephone needs all the way up to the most important network needs for the state of California.  I can say, it was a very good experience for me."
good,The best part of this past position is the availability to work from home and visit clients as well as my channel partners.  I would recommend this to anyone who does better on the move vs sitting behind a desk all day.
good,This company invested in the staff and the marketplace.  They set us up with a pension and a 401K...what a wonderful thing.  And great communication for our higher management.  Great co-workers.  HR staff was challenging.  Many of our mid-management was brought on from an acquired company...so seemed out of touch in many ways.  I felt that AT&T cared about my future!

I had a very good sup and the management cared about you. Hardest part of the job was learning how to compose ads a different way."

good,Good company. Call center environment. A big group of employees answering the phones all day to assist customers with and issues an concerns they have with their phone or service.
good,"A typical day at AT&T as a technician would be a morning meeting at the base station for a briefing and to go over individual and team metrics. Once the meeting is over the equipment for the day is picked up. Then routes would be checked and the installation and repair tickets are checked and the trucks would ""roll"" to the address. Installation duties would consist of greeting the customer, verifying the order with the customer. Then, we would gain permission to drill wires if there were no existing wires. If not we would install cat5 or/and coaxial cable from the denmarc location to the designated location. Next, the equipment, (Set-top Boxes and Modems) were installed. Internet, TV, and VoIP services were tested. Once testing was successful, appreciation would then be shown to the customer. Then the process would be repeated. Management would often do field visits and do quality checks on the team members installs and repairs. Management was knowledgeable and motivating. The hardest part of the job was working in extreme weather conditions but it was all worth it after you were proud of the quality of your work and the services that was installed or repaired. The most enjoyable part was leaving a customer satisfied."
good,I liked the job. The manager was very nice and always willing to help if you had questions. The hardest part of the job was being on the phones all day long.
good,"Worked for 4 years as a telephone operator and spoke with people all over the world.  Managed to learn alot about different cultures, accents and even traditions and cultures."
good,a typical day at work is working with engineers to get their jobs posted. The culture is about teamwork... the hard part of the job is dealing with so many personalities
good,AT&T was a great first customer service job to work at. I enjoyed learning from the managers and learning about how to actually assist customers and help them with just getting through the day if they needed a listening ear.
good,"Help customers choose new phones and plans."
good,Very fast paced. Have to be able to pick up on things quickly. Management is excellent when chosen right. Great company to work for. Pays really well.
good,The day to day working with customers and partnering with teams on bringing wireless applications and hardware is exciting and fun.  Managers are excellent at leading teams and individuals to success.  The employees work close and build long term relationships outside of work.  It is demanding and hard meeting all the quota's to be successful but worth every bit of it.
good,"Project used latest and greatest technology space for application development"
good,I learned a lot and feel very blessed to work in a high tech job.  The company push training which was hard to do with a busy work load.  The pay and benefits are good.
good,"Lo que más me gustó del trabajo anterior es o estar tratando con los clientes no hubo nada difícil en el trabajo los colegas o compañeros no había trabajo en equipo "
good,"Learned skills like: "
good,"I enjoyed working for at&t. there was no one really breathing down your neck, the benefits were good, and the pay was pretty good as well. The main down sides that i can think of was working in any weather, the unpredictable hours, and dealing with going into some dirty homes. If you can stand the weather, and do not mind not knowing for sue what time you'll be off every day this would be a good place to try to work."
good,Working in the Sales Operations team was a great opportunity.  The management team empowers their subordinates.  Workplace culture is great.  The most enjoyable part of the day is we can telecommute two or three days of the week.  It is a pleasant company to work for while building your career.

I also understand the need to work safely in an ever changing environment. I continue to enjoy customer education and interaction.

good,"Good company to work with."
good,I loved working at AT&T. The position that I work for for the 5 years I was there fast paced and I was always learing.  The management was great and always working with us to do better with the ability to move up within the company.
good,"Same as the review of AT&T, same company just went through a merger of Southwestern Bell and AT&T.  Workplace culture is stressful but exciting.  Making customer's happy should always be the top priority."
good,"A typical day at work for management is a 10-11 hour day.  I have learned a tremendous amount working for SW Bell/AT&T and will always be thankful for the time.  It is on the cutting edge of technology and always changing to keep ahead of the times and you have to change to keep up. Management varies per department, as with all companies, some are better than others with their leadership styles.  The hardest part of the job would be working with objects that are out of your control like long wait times to get a hold of internal departments, while being pushed to install/restore service in specific amounts of time which are usually less than the hold time. The most enjoyable part of the job are the daily challenges we have to make things work, also enjoyable are the people you work with, watching them develop, grow and building a team to handle business as we see it."
good,"Perform routine inspection, testing, and repair of smart phones and other mobile devices."
good,"I liked working for AT&T, in my position as a network field service engineer/consultant. My manager allowed my team to oversee our own work responsibilities, for the most part. Our team was spread all over the country and got along very well. The hardest part of the job was finding/setting up self-paced training courses that would come into play on a regular basis, on the job, when we did not have on-site calls to do."
good,"I worked at Teleperformance full-time"
good,"Despliegue de red de internet de acceso inalámbrico LTE-TDD en la banda 40, bastante interacción con el vendor de equipos LTE."
good,"As an architect and manager - was responsible for development teams working on legacy transformation project."
good,Productive and fun place to work with great co-workers. The only down-side would be the late shifts and weekends (new hires will work late nights and every Saturday).
good,Great place to work at the right time. The growth of wireless was perfect and Cingular/AT&T management very supportive.  Built life long friendships while working at AT&T.
good,"Provided insight as to how a professional environment operates, and taught valuable professional skills. Allowed for initial mistakes as expected from young, unskilled employees. Made corrections as needed, and allowed agents to grow as professionals."
good,I have learned to deal with a high paced high call volume atmosphere. The Managers of the departments were very encouraging and help you though tough task to ensure high quality level customer service was met.
good,Inexperience mgrs. With no idea or knowledge in leadership position.  No issues with the technical aspect great company. Great enviroment and plenty of room dor advacement .
good,"Great company to work for if you don't mind working a lot of hours. Well worth it for the amazing benefits and compensation. Fun environment with great co-workers, and a few great managers."
good,Benefits are great but the position that I'm in is very stressful. They expect us to do one thing but act another way. Direction is not very clear at times
good,Moving forward in technology and global network. Striving for exceptional customer satisfaction. Leading the industry in the evolution of mobile services.
good,"I did warehouse logistics and shipping/receiving coordination.  I drove a forklift and helped determine where material was stored.  I took extra work with other departments whenever we had any downtime, because I love to be busy.  My management pretty much told us what needed to be done and then let us figure out our own way to get it done.  The team I was on was like family, and I still talk to most of them on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job was learning how to motivate some of the employees who had been there longer than I had been.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my hands and seeing the progress that we made."
good,If you are looking for a company with a good work ethic AT&T is one of them. Very diverse and well developed product that is made for all type of consumers in mind.
good,AT&T provided me with multiple opportunities which included technical training on telephony switches. Provided managerial expertise for 4 different groups and technical support for data center personnel. Enjoyed most of the assignments during my tenure with Ameritech / AT&T and finally with the new at&t company.
good,"Typical day working at at&t is a constant change. Everyday you will never know what will happen all you need to make sure you are prepared in every aspect of the position. As a manager you are there to guide them to the right path in order for them to succeed. You develop your employees so they can be successful but while you develop them, you develop yourself."
good,"I would love to describe this to you in person. I apologize if this comes across as dismissive, but I simply don't want to come across as ""hokey"" in my description. Work consists of a huge portion of our lives and cannot be given justice in a couple of paragraphs."
good,Great I enjoyed working here. The schedules were a little messy but I liked the people there and the atmosphere. It was a good job to start out in Tennessee wth
good,"Typical day is busy with new learning experiences , detailed fast paced, full management at all times, assistance readily available.."
good,Growing Business with a lot of potential for advancement. Very fast pace environment.  Deal with all different sort of people with all sorts of issue with cell phones.
good,"This was a great place to work, you had workers helping each other when management was not available. As a trainer you were exposed to all different cultures, backgrounds and age groups. You had people that came with experience to no experience. The Training team worked together individually and collectively and we spoke often although we spread out in different states."
good,"Large Call Center, Lots of action all the time. Close supervision and lots of help in Training.. Always someone to reach to when you have a troubling issue. Benefits"
good,It has been a pleasure to work in one of the world's most prominent industries. The changes I've seen in this ever evolving wireless world are nothing short of amazing. I've learned so much on how to be the best sales person I can be while also leading a team and building lasting relationships.
good,Gave me the opportunity to learn and grow. Excellent leadership. Guided me to a path of success in sales and made sure i excel in what i did. I enjoyed the part of harnessing my customer service skills.
good,Overall good company to work for management at times Could be a little overwhelming. Fello employees always have each other's backs at least in Sherman oaks we did. Customers are always different but company policies and union help you out when work is unsafe.
good,Good job with approachable management. Compensation could be better. Paid Time off is hard to come by and advancement is really tough with such a small Authorized retailer. Overall a good job in the short run that has good people.
good,"A very and decent place to work, enjoyed my time working with att. So much new things to learn.. nice office space,,  loved the office climate,, but 24 *7 support,,"
good,"Convergys is the Cedar City, UT company partially responsible for AT&T's combined billing dept. Inbound calls for light cellular troubleshooting, bill payment and explanation as well as product pitch and explanation is the name of the game. "
good,helping people all over the world and help them troubleshoot their phones. sitting on the phone all day is the type of environment like an office. the pay is very decent with great benefits.
good,Working for at&t was a great experience and would definitely work for them again. It's a fun and friend environment to be in. It's good to have customer service skills.
good,It was a great fast paced work environment with good compensation and benefits. The hardest part would be the retail type hours.
good,Its fun and you learn something new ever day. I enjoyed the benefits and overtime while it lasted although some days was got frustrated fromt the speed of the calls coming in back to back but I learned to adapt and got better with time.
good,Best in class service providers. Provide with chance to work on lates technologies. Work life balance is satisfactory. Management can be tough with deadlines at times.
good,Everyday would build the technicians loads.  Make repair tickets and take  incoming calls from inter company employees.
good,"a great company to work for, great benefits, and management that cares about their employees. company that cares about its employees and customers and takes care of both."
good,AT&T is an innovative company with emerging technologies. The benefits and compensation are among the industries finest. One drawback is that AT&T makes is very difficult to advance from within. I would recommend AT&T as a place to work for someone to get their career started.
good,"A day at AT&T was accomplishing all your daily duties.  As long as you are doing all that needs to be accomplished, managers will not interfere in your progress of doing your duties.  AT&T gives you the opportunity to learn and progress in the field that you are experienced to accomplish.  The environment gives plenty of opportunities to manage projects solo as well opportunities to work on team projects. AT&T creates an environment where professionals can collaborate for best result solutions."
good,I managed whole store inventory counts and incoming and outgoing merchandise. and manage sales and see the cash flow of the store.
good,Fast paced and constantly changing.  A fun atmosphere but weekends and nights are expected. I would recommend this job.
good,the call center is no longer open in midland but I didn't like the hours worked. But did like my manager and team I worked with. overall ok place to work.
good,"Professional workforce."
good,It is a great company to work for you can make a career out of this company but opportunities are tough to come by unless you are able to relocate to Dallas or Atlanta.
good,"A good company to work for.  Depending on the department, determines the atmosphere.  Worked in various fields and department. Some departments were rigid, disciplined, 0 tolerance. Others had a comfortable environment, listening to your concerns and suggestions and exploring  your creativity."
good,"On typical day we log-in and take in calls to resolve customer issue."
good,Its been more than 5 years that I have been working with AT&T and everyone that I worked with was awesome. Loved the technologies they used and the framework and the way they think ahead.
good,ATT was a great company to work for. I loved the diversity within our department and the close family knit that was shared between each of us. These guys were family in more ways than one can imagine.
good,"I'd like been around people and interact with it was a great experience, best of all i was doing something i love to do, a different experience every single day."
good,A great company to work for because of the work environment and giving the chance to learn. They encouraged schooling and certification.
good,"The job consisted of repairing, installing and sell stress pit products that the company had within its inventory. Additionally customer service was paramount in the performance plan in which you where graded upon."
good,"I enjoyed my job and my co-workers. I enjoyed building relationships with my customers knowing they could depend on me to help them. I learned a lot and would've retired if I wasn't laid off. Job security is not like it use to be. Management led by reports and didn't always understand the hands on process. With every job there's always room for improvement. The threat of losing your job on a daily basis became overwhelming as well as inconsistent guidelines that some followed and others didn't. In the end, I was blessed to work for a good company."
good,"A typical day would include  driving to customers locations to restore services, I learned how to deal with customers and diagnosis problems,after 35 years management contact was minimal, the workplace culture was positive, there was not many days that were difficult, I enjoyed working by myself most days"
good,"same as I wrote about teleperfomance"
good,this company has its growth to do and has many opportunities to produce better training for their employees. Not great training and expect you to understand all
good,"Career advancements specific to hub cities only.    "
good,"My typical day was very consistent with many others. Though the company experiences many changes, my team and I usually step up to the plate and face them. It's a great place to work, but the opportunity for advancement in retail has a specific focus that not every position can qualify for."
good,"AT&T is a very good place to work.  Most of the people are very collaborative and friendly to work with.  My manager has been the best manager I've ever had.  Sometimes, there is too much bureaucracy, but that is to be expected from an organization that is so large."
good,"The hardest part of the job was sales for me.  This was my first and only sales job.  The culture here was awesome you had mangers and supervisors that encouraged you to be the best professionally and personally.  I learned that you really have to be a team player that is how we worked.  This was a call center so we were on the phones 85% of the day,"
good,Great job to be you'll learn a lot during the process and your customer services skills will get greater. Management awesome.
good,Help customers within a retail environment and provide great customer service. Training is ongoing and is designed to keep employees knowledgeable about the latest technologies.
good,"The managers above me were great people. The folks in the Atlanta wireless NOC were also great people to work with. Above that, things got iffy. The hardest part of the work I did was getting advanced tech support assistance to critical tickets resolved in the time allotted. They were understaffed at the time. Hopefully things have gotten better since I left."
good,Overall 4.5 Good place for career minded individuals. Job security excellent. Chance for advancement somewhat limited due to corporate structure.
good,i do not want to do this i am going to type till it allows me to pass forward on this. i would appreciate if you guys removed this requirement from your website.
good,"The company makes sure that you are effectively prepared to assist customers who call into the call center with any of their troubleshooting needs. The company provides 6 weeks of paid training and a host of helpful ""quick-click"" tools to assist you throughout the call."

good,I liked the culture of the Team and company. The benefits are a plus. Management took care of their employees. I enjoyed most working in the Field.
good,Empresa que te da todas las herramientas para hacer tu trabajo de manera efectiva.
good,Very productive and supportive work-life balance.  The corporate campus is filled with amenities suitable for today's employee needs.
good,with att you have endless opportunities. great compensation and does not require a degree to make $50000-$70000. It is a company that is time entitled for the majority of decision making.
good,"Overall, AT&T is a great company to work for. There are a lot of areas of opportunity for advancements. With all jobs there are changes that everyone must be able to adapt to."
good,"Great company to work for. Gained lots of experience and training."
good,"Day starts with morning meeting, after meeting assigned job via computer, installs and repairs services, and helps previous and current customers. You must manage your inventory for your truck daily. Be able to ask co-workers for help and advice. Do your work calm and steady. Speed will come with experience."
good,The training was very informative.  We received the proper information to handle our calls effectively. They also worked really hard to insured that we worked the same shifts as the people whom we trained with to ensure that we would have support on the floor.
good,"No two days are the same, job never gets boring. Enjoy the freedom of the job, scenery always changing. The comradery with co workers is great."
good,"Healthy atmosphere"
good,"Great environment to build in retail sales. Customers come to purchase phone, but you have to learn to adjust and sell other items than a cell phone. The company is becoming more of an entertainment company as well. Great place to experience new technology and devices."
good,"Management was amazing & was always open to listening & working with your schedule and any questions that you had."
good,"sales driven"
good,"The job itself was mostly fun and new everyday. Calls varied from happy customers just saying they liked the service, to irate customers that had issues with their mobile service. All calls are welcomed no matter the nature."
good,The hardest part was when a customer wants a product and can not give it to them. We became a team and then career progression comes into play. Change is good. happy to see the one one who have progress at AT&T. When the customer leaves the store with a smile. Customer service at it's best!!
good,Overall great place to work with sufficient compensation and benefits. Dealing with people from other companies and field support made the job fun. A clean and comfortable place to work in was provided.
good,Great global brand company to represent for employees. Overall customers receive quality services. Working and leading a team with good support was helpful as well.
good,"Great company to work for many benefits including medical, dental, vision, 401k, and education. Global brand recognition for service to clients a plus."
good,Great place to work and I had a great relationship with the upper management. I was able to learn new sales skills and achieve goals that i never knew were possible. AT&T has a wonderful sales training program that advanced my vast knowledge of sales skills. Some of the most trying parts of this job was taking an unskilled representative and turning them into a selling machine. THis was also the most rewarding aspect of the career as well.
good,This company was a great place to work for. They treated me well and I would advise other people to work for this company. The employees and staff were great. The management was phenomenal
good,"I really enjoyed the two positions I had working at AT&T/Bellsouth Internet Services.  The only thing that was not fun was worrying about the layoff's that happen every 1-2 years, seems like they are always streamlining things.  Now, this opinion comes from someone who was in a declining part of the company for my entire career so my opinion may be a little slanted.  However, it just seems that as soon as the new hot ""thing"" comes along the other sectors of the business immediately take a back seat and start feeling the heat of another possible lay off.  Other than that I really enjoyed my time there!"
good,"This is a job you want to stay at. They top out your pay within 5 years. Benefits are great. The problems are the ever changing policy's and expectations. you're expected to do a lot of extra things. The work does suck a little bit. You work in the elements. Attics, Crawl spaces, ladders, poles. You get muddy, then have to go into customers houses. Deal alot with unhappy customers with service problems. All in all though it is worth the money and the experience. Can't transfer until 2 and half years. But once that's over you can go anywhere. It's nice in that aspect."
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for if you're very motivated and want to make money, but you spend many hours there. The commission structure changes often and they push very hard for sales."
good,"Worked for Directv before they were bought out by ATT, and the changes were pretty drastic as far as compensation goes as well as benefits in a negative way. ATT definitely pushes their employees to excel at everything they do, which is understanding considering the competitive market they exist in. Overall it seems like a decent company to work for even though the changes that were made were negative."
good,"Change is the constant at AT&T. With that change comes challenges and continual learning. The people are fantastic; educated as well as reliable for the most part. I learned all about home construction and wiring and teamwork with AT&T. My business sense has been developed greatly by the latest title I have held. The hardest part of working her as non-management, bargained for employees is that you can be bounced around and possibly lose your connection with the company from no fault of your own, as is my case. There is an environment of unstable work security in general. There are many things to learn at AT&T and the training is usually of good quality. I always thought I would retire from the company and am very disheartened by the process that has led to my separation from the AT&T family I have come to love."
good,Very skilled representatives. Extremely fast paced. Very strict rules and dress codes. Very professional. Management gives very good training. Staff is friendly
good,"Last year alone, my organization was affected by 3 surplus actions. The work life balance is wonderful. My position was flex based. I was able to work from home certain days of the week."
good,"enjoyed working with the staff, liked solving the cust problems being able to upgrade to a better phone helping the cust with any issues regarding there account."
good,"Very fast pace environment, typically rules changed a lot. Great on the job training, and advancement opportunities for employees. Company is expecting of your new ideas and willing to input them."
good,Always inspect what you expect and treat your job like its your own business! I have learned so much in my career at AT&T due to the leadership mentoring I have been given and have taken advantage of in order for me to continue to learn and grow in the Telecommunication industry.
good,Great name and reputation in the voice and data business. They had a good hunter-Famer system. Laid off when the system changed to an private agent system
good,working for Alorica for their workforce is an experience but I am ready to look for an other company. there are things that the company can improve on but no company is perfect.
good,"work is very physical, you will be required to work outside in all weather, hardest part was working aloft on telephone poles"
good,"Hiring manager for the site for about 2 hours, OCP mentoring, training the trainers. My Coworkers are excellent to work with. I have had many travel opportunities with this company."
good,"Una empresa muy buena para trabajar... "
good,Great working environment. I work on sales and received hourly pay plus commission. I really enjoyed my time with AT&T......
good,"Overall, a great place to work with amazing perks and benefits. Sometimes dealing with the customers that were clueless with technology could get frustrating."

good,was  convenient to  travel to right off the highway. no weekends. pleasant people to work with and there was a union to help you if needed.
good,"I took inbound customer service calls for people who wanted to adjust there cable package or add or change.  We would then offer them 3 free months of Showtime, hbo, and Cinamax. We got commission if they excepted the package. Then got to be a part time supervisor who walked the floor for those who needed help."
good,I have enjoyed over 18 years with the company.  It has been a very rewarding career.   Always ever changing which keeps you on  your toes and always learning.
good,"Great place to work, retail environment with fast paced learning to assist customers. Stressful at times due to less traffic. The time goes by making it a fun environment"
good,"A typical day at work includes listening to customers, caring for their concerns, creating a positive experience.  "
good,The key to working well at A&T is to adopt to change quickly. The company has large goals that it wants to fulfill and thus there is a lot of requirements and moving of goal posts to get to that place.
good,"typical day at work is showing up doing normal activities then leaving and going home, not to easy not too hard. is this 20 words yet?"
good,"Trouble shoot with vendors, maintain cell sites"

The hardest part of the job would be trying to get an elderly person to follow the troubleshooting steps. The most enjoyable part of the day would be resolving a customers issue and making sure they were satisfied when the phone call ended."

I am constant sending updates on how the market is doing. I keep my co-worker alert for any possible outages or degraded issues. The hardest part of my job is when there is a major outage is getting technician from other groups to join a bridge.It is like pulling teeth. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers.

good,I really do like working for AT&T.  It gives a great culture to surround yourself with at your office or wherever you call home.  People want you to succeed and move on to where you want to be.  The only issue I find with the company is the lack of cohesion.  People in different departments don't like to work together very well and that makes it very difficult for customer facing associates.  Fix that and AT&T couldn't get much better.

I learned that not having a college degree would hold me back even when I knew the work. The hardest part of the job was the racism I encountered. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to work there for 16 years, the pay was decent, there was a UNION that protected me, and also being able to show my children that work pays off (we were able to buy our first home and move out of the Projects).

La empresa estaba constantemente preocupado de que nos alimentáramos bien y nos ejercitáramos. También siempre estaba innovando y relagalandonos premios por logros. Lamentablemente no formé parte interna de la empresa, sino que pertenecí a otra ya que me ascendieron y logré ese puesto, pero fue muy buena experiencia.

It’s hard to find that environment today because so many people just don’t care about honesty, hard work & integrity"

good,"Our team at AT&T is quite experienced and everyone knows their work."
good,Day to day responsibilities include utilizing advanced selling techniques and solutions-selling to succeed in data and wireless voice penetration for new and existing accounts.
good,Great company to work for but always a struggle to get all the work done in a day because of other employee's trying to work as slow as possible to get the most overtime possible. I was very satisfied with my hourly pay and had to work twice as many jobs as most techs just to get to go home. We had to complete at least 4 jobs per day and I was working 10 just to make up for the other employees almost malicious attempts to make as much money as possible. I quit AT&T to start my own subcontracting company burying drop wires but didn't work out.
good,at&t was a great company to work for. they gave me great training working locations and good pay and benifets people where like family
good,"A typical day working for At&t would be greeting and assisting customers by giving informaion on new plans and devices, assisting them with their already current accounts, and help customers also recieve DirectTv and home security in their own home. I also handled daily stock counts, daily deposits, and daily cleaning. My favorite part of the job was the joy I'd see in customer's faces when we'd teach them all the things their new ""toys"" (as we would say) would do and how excited they'd be to be walking out with something new in their hands. A lot of the customers were not aware of the great packages their Digital Life Home Security also offered so seeing a lot of them feel more secure when they'd walk out of our store after setting them up with it was also a satisfying feeling to have known we made them feel that way. The hardest part was probably that when we changed locations, a lot of customers were not aware of where we were so it had become difficult for all of us to reach our goals due to our traffic change. I learned a lot of what I had no clue about when it came to choosing the right cable service and/or home security for when working with T-mobile we did not offer those things. As far as management and my co-workers, I loved how everyone took the time to get to know one another so that we'd feel more like a team and we'd know to better communicate with one another."
good,I enjoyed my period at AT&T (Formerly Pacific Bell/SBC). My typical day at work was making sure the customer got their request met & trying to resolve their complaints.  I learned that others believed in me more than I believed in me.  My co-workers were knowledgeable and always helped me if I didn't understand a certain system. My manager was honest and a real role model for labor-management relations.  The hardest part of the job was When I just could not give the customer what they wanted.  The most enjoyable was when the customer would write a commendation and I could forward it to the manager of the employee.  Commendations are rare.

good,"I work in the Tech Service Center for DirecTV.  This is a phone center where we primarily provide support for our technicians.  They call in to us when they are unable to manipulate their work order with their handheld devices and also when they need help contacting customers or need to put jobs on hold or cancel or reschedule.  I also make outgoing calls to customers who have called in.  Customers often call to ask when their technician will be arriving or will call when they are having issues with their DTV and had recently had a technician out.  We assist customers with anything they are needing help with such as ETA's and creating service calls if the technician had recently been out to their residence. "

good,"Dealing with people everyday was a great experience for me. I learned so many different personalities and how to work with each one. In the warranty center a typical day was about 50-80 customers unhappy that their device was malfunctioning. The days consisted of assuring and reassuring customers that their devices were in good hands and that they will be taken care of to the best of my ability. The  most enjoyable and the toughest part was assuring customers that their device was in good hands because many people believed however many did not, which made the job a bit difficult at times."

Supervising dispatch was a very enjoyable challenge due to the constant change and updates.  Home Service Provider offices are unique in that the average employee is given a lot of opportunity to diversify.
good,"Every day was different but I sent a lot of time on calls with customers, project managers, field technicians and others. I had a lot of oportunity to learn new things specially how to comunicate with people from around the world and I have got a lot of technical skills. It was a place where you can meet funny people with possitive attitude. I met a lot of interesting, skilled and funny people who will be missing to me. Managers had highly professional approach . Hardest part of my job was that I needed to do shifts rotated every week. My the most enjoyable part of the job was that I could speak with a people around from different country and I could learn a lot of new things. I can really recommed this commpany."
good,"Nice place to work, nice people, great hours, great benefits, great training, lots of support from management, awesome open door policy"

The management team was a good team to work with, very easy going and knows how to manage the store and its employees, I had a great team working with AT&T, a very driven team that strive to success.

The most enjoyable part of my job is admiring my teams great workmanship and being able to complete the site within the deadline."
good,"I worked for 28 years at AT&T and although I am thankful for my time there, they were always cutting back on jobs, salary's and benefits. I was finally let go in late 2009 and although they gave me a package, I do not think it was appropriate for the loyalty I gave them over the years."

good,Top notch sales organization - with perk and incentive to compensate for sales.  Has good product and never criticizes other company but focuses on promoting their products.
good,"The military is a place to shape up a young person as college right out of the gate is not for everyone. The military instills strong principles and values that tend to push people to grow beyond their comfort zone. Simply put, it takes boys and creates men and I do not mean this to disrespect our women in uniform. I had some of the best and worst times of my life in the ARMY and I would not trade any of them. Everything made me better."
good,The company has good pay and great benefits.  I have learned a lot in communications and customer service skills.  The office I am currently working in is relocating and I am seeking other opportunities.

good,"Each day is spent assisting incoming customer contacts with a variety of requests including but not limited to change of service, bill payment, purchasing of equipment and troubleshooting. Continuous training provides all the knowledge needed to successfully complete these requests. Management works directly with employees to insure success. Employees also provide  knowledge and support for each other. Perhaps the hardest part is the repetition of tasks and requests. The most enjoyable part is the continuous recognition from the company for successfully meeting expectations."
good,Best part of this job was going to different customers homes to install product to their satisfaction and providing very good customer service

good,"Dealing with lots of responsibilities, could not stop, on my toes everyday.  The hardest part of the job was to be forced to work late at night and then report to work the following morning to continue a another day's work.  Our crew always had different managers, they came and left it was hard for them to manage the outside forces dealing with other utilities-saws,gas,cps and customers."

good,"It was okay.  I enjoyed the job and learning about all of the new technology.  I also loved my bosses and made some great friends, but corporate is terrible.  The goals are unrealistic, and it really brings you down.  Not a good structure as far as goals"

good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all senior colleagues .Because with their help it gives you confidence .

good,"Great first job out of business school"
good,"I worked with this company with no regrets,"
good,"Being a Revenue Management representative, you have several opportunities to assist customers.  A typical day in the office of the RMR is simply assisting customers, by educating them on the importance of reading their bills.  Processing payments/ issuing bill credits on accounts after verifying that the credits are actually warranted for services rendered or not.  Just making sure the customer is getting the products and services that they are asking for.  Sure we do get those that try to cheat the system, but you can really tell those because they call in every month with the same excuse."
good,"Great place to work!  Had the center not closed due to the SBC buyout of the AT&T brand, I'd still be there.  Fantastic and caring management team."

good,"Analyzes problems techinal and non techinal provides best resolutions"
good,This position was a multilevel marketing position so due to that their was no typical days. I learned a lot about being a real go getter because it was pure commission therefore if I wasn't managing my time and always at my best I was not going to get paid. I was my own boss and my co-workers were people I brought in to the business. The hardest part was staying motivated when things were slow for me. The most enjoyable part was the rewards for my hard work.
good,Woke up each morning excited to go to work. You don't find that often in a work atmosphere. Management treats you well and the executives make you feel that what you do matters.
good,"Had a great time with promotions and most of all sales. I found great pleasure in customer service and closing deals for myself and colleagues. In fact, closing deals is the only nature of the business i enjoyed."
good,The average work day was challenging and rewarding and each day was different.  Teamwork work was a plus and done without blinking an eye. The hardest part was not being able to service all of the customers within an eight hour work day.  Satisfying the customers on a daily basis gave me pride and feeling of accomplishment.
good,Good place to work. There just needs to be more advances within the company. Its a huge company without enough growth opportunities.
good,"Good place to work with team mates. But management always put pressure not the company."
good,Working for this company may be different at other centers or positions. This job is trying on all aspects. The management staff changes how they would like you to do things CONSTANTLY!!

good,had fun working with directv but it had its ups and down. the good side was the pay was good but the stress level was to much they required you to do more then you were capable off doing like if costumer had a issue that did not had to do with a dirrectv issue we had to try and fix it. we had to make directv look press teen.
good,I liked working with the people at AT&T. The supervisors were friendly and easy to work with. I moved to Delaware so had to leave.

There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from different tasks with dealing with people that where challenging and exciting."

good,"I am indebted to AT&T for taking in all the IBM employees from the IBM Network Services division when that area was sold off in 2008.  AT&T provided a very supportive work environment until they outsourced many jobs to India in March 2015 (including mine).  Most of my co-workers and all of my customers and projects were IBMers."
good,My typical day included me contacting accounts and scheduling outside appointments to discuss advertising programs that matched the clients needs.  I learned how to organize my day with attention to details and multi task with giving each customer excellent customer service and follow through for their advertising needs.  Overall management understood what sales where needed.  The challenges were working with inexperienced sales managers.  My co workers respected my experience and often sought my knowledge of how to handle their challenges with accounts and navigating their day.  The hardest part of my job was having a manager who was not skilled in customer service.  I enjoyed meeting the customers needs.  I enjoyed getting feedback from customers that they were happy to have me as their representative.
good,"High volume call center environment, customer service and aggressive sales. Great pay and benefits. This was a union company. Fast Past."
good,"It has a good working environment where people interacts with each other, working as a team. We have various performance bonuses which drives each one of us to be more effective in doing our tasks. Hardest part is when team members get to move to a different team. But, of course, each one can easily adapt to it when time comes."
good,"With over 16 years of experience at AT&T the company has proven their ability to change with the market place remain a leader in the field.  Every day I am given the opportunity to connect and work with individuals and teams not only within the borders of the United States, but in countries around the globe.  The most difficult part about a job here is connecting with people that are not physically present.  AT&T provides many tools to bridge that connection and break down the barriers that distances create.  At the same time, the most enjoyable part about a job here is that same distance and connection with so many people across the country and around the world.  A job with AT&T has provided the opportunity to experience business with many cultures and people with varied backgrounds.  Embracing those differences is what has allowed AT&T to remain and industry leader."
good,Loved everyone I worked with and for. AT&T really cares about their associates. It's a great place to work. They have a great amount of new products and services to offer.

good,"gives great benefits and pay. you are in control of your daily outcome for the most part. as with any job, do your work and you are fine"
good,"Good company to work for, known name in the industry. There is a chance to make money here if  you sell phones. If not then you won't it's more commission based."
good,"If you like to learn quick and move fast, AT&T is the place for you.Productive fun place with collaborative/open work environment. New challenges every day keeping you on your toes and making your job fun."

good,"DIrecTV was a great place to work. While the position may not have been the most exciting, the people in charge did the best they could to make it more fun. The team was small, but great care was taken in the interview process to make sure we all had compatible personalities. Working there gave me a great experience into what working in the corporate world would entail. I would recommend this company for someone looking for employment."
good,We handled customer inquiries very effectively and proficiently. There were many times through out the days to learn new skills. It was very fast-paced and there were a lot of bonuses and opportunities for commission. The most enjoyable part of the day would be working with co-workers.
good,Would start my day getting logged into all the systems needed to do my daily work. Listen to calls that reps had with our customer's and reviewed if the work and their job was being accomplished according to strict guidelines and policy.
good,A typical day at work entailed placing outbound calls to prospective GE Modular Space customers. What I learned most is how modular space units are utilized by small  and medium-size businesses. Co-workers were always pleasant to interact with and more than willing to assist when unknown information was sought.  The hardest part of the job was being frustrated when potential customers didn't answer the call after numerous attempts to reach the point-of-contact. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that it was a self-directed work environment where minimal supervision was required to oversee team and individual performance.
good,Working for a spring mobile authorized dealer was necessary in order to break into the wireless markeT. i am now looking to branch into more established companies and make a splash.

good,"awesome place to work, people are always there to help you. only issue i have is that when their isn't any work, That really affects your pay check"
good,"Very fast pace environment thinking on your feet with many split second decisions. As part of the management team initially there were a lot of sacrifices to incentivize and mold the team to deliver a product that would be worthy of the service advertised to our open public. Numbers were our key to driving a productive team in the direction of success. "
good,"The work at AT&T is interesting. The company provides opportunities to learn and train regularly. The position I currently hold allows the platform to gain some exposure outside engineering, but it essentially limited to the engineering department. Overall it is very good company to work for and they treat their employees well."
good,"The culture has changed from the days of Michigan Bell. Meeting numbers surpassed customer service, taking care of the customers. Numbers look good on paper, but excellent service keeps your customers coming back"
good,AT&T offered many options for advancement.  AT&T offered training and tools to move within the company to advance your career.
good,"Typical day at work consist of helping Business customers with business accounts (Global and Small Businesses) with account maintenance and device troubleshooting. I've learned a lot about cell phones and as the technology expands AT&T has done a great job in teaching me and my coworkers about it and also how to educate our customers as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, but for me it's not that hard because of my background I can de-escalate situations easily. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning and then educating the customers knowing they are better off going forward with their account with AT&T."
good,Nice place to work. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking to make a decent living in a fast paced environment. Lots of contest and easy ways to make money. Free phone too!
good,AT&T has definitely groomed me to be the individual that I am today. I've been with AT&T for 6 years. From taking full responsibility of our shipments to engaging with customers on a day to day basis were some of the many skills acquired.
good,"The company is a great place to work, however, my job is being eliminated due to the acquisition of Cricket by AT&T. "
good,Installed Uverse triple play services. Management varied a lot. I would have stayed longer if they were more flexible with school schedules.
good,"Job functions change with the progressive changes in technology."
good,AT&T is a great company that offers great pay and benefits. Also employees are covered by the Union who fights for these benefits. Management can make or break the job depending on what department you work in.
good,"Challenging work"
good,"Fun workplace. Had a gym, computers, video games and massage chairs. Stressful at times so it was good to have these readily available to us."
good,it was a good place to work and had good benifits due to union environment. did seem at the end to be overly harsh about issues that would not be an issue with other companies
good,AT&T is a great company to work for.  Unfortunately jobs are limited to areas and was severed due to inability to relocate.
good,"i love working under that management"
good,I am worked both onsite and offshore locations and its great pleasure to work for at&t. A lot to learn technically as well as IT process. I had my longest career at this organisation and its my  pleasure. I would always recommand to join this company.
good,"Great co-workers"

good,"Lot of learning's everyday"
good,AT&T is a good paying company but very challenging. I worked for ten years with the company and enjoyed working with all my peers.
good,"I loved working with my hands. The only downsides to the job was my manager and having no time to do anything after work hours. Other then that, it was an amazing job."
good,I loved going to work and being around co-workers.  I enjoyed assisting people with trouble shooting their phones and fixing their bills.
good,really enjoyed working here enjoyed learning and seeing what att had to offer the manangement team was great and coworkers was too
good,"Overall a great place to work, management is a little to much of a hands off approach, and the job isn't challenging enough. But the atmosphere of the company and the co-workers are excellent. The hardest part of the job is keeping everything straight within the system which is absolutely not user friendly. The most enjoyable part is the freedom to get your work done and not have someone peaking over your shoulder every 5 minutes."
good,"AT&T is a terrific company to work for if you like a fast paced, ever changing career. The communications industry moves at lightning speed and AT&T is always striving to be way out front."
good,It is good to be a part of this company. Company provides good knowledge terms as a source of seminars group chats. It has a very good atmosphere to work!

good,"Great place to work. I spent 22 years at AT&T, 13 in Bell Labs.  The people I worked with were all professional, the management team was customer focused with emphasis on getting the job done.  Working at home because the kids were sick was acceptable. The company embarrassed diversity and management styles and rewards were kept in balance with good policy."
good,"The pay is very good for the job.  Good training.  Good Benefits.  Pension, 401k, Union (CWA)....  Had a few expectations that were unrealistic...."
good,"On a typical day,I assist employees with questions about policy and process both over the phone and with in a chat room.  I assist customer that ask to speak with a supervisor in regards to their service subscription and equipment.  Everyone seems to care for what they do and the impact they have on customers and employees."

Maintain knowledge of competitive offers and provide critical market feedback to the Store Manager regarding local competition and product/service needs.  A typical day at work was face-paced and helping each and every customer that comes through the doors of AT&T. I've learned how to interact with customers on a face-to-face daily basics and sales tactics.  The management team made sure we exceeded in every metric and excel within the company. They made sure we had every tool we need to function on a daily basics. The co-workers, we looked at each one as family. We help each other out when there is an area.  The hardest part of the job was to exceed in each and every goal on a daily basics.  The job was very challenging but it was rewarding at the end and that's what was enjoyable about working at AT&T. You work hard and it pays off"

good,Ideal for newly working professionals to experience a call center environment. The benefits are excellent which allows for tuition reimbursement for anyone seeking to further their education.
good,"This company treats its employees well. It's full of energy and team value. You can take your work vehicle home with a gas card, free DirecTv service, full benefits, pension, tons of bonuses and you can make a ridiculous salary if you're willing to work hard. The only complaint I would have is that it's a demotion to get a promotion. You can make 30% more pay as a tech rather than becoming a supervisor. Also, its not worth being a technician if you do not live in a populated area because there can be a lot of travel involved for little compensation. The less populated the bigger the area, some sites cover hundreds of miles of territory and some sites cover only fifty miles."
good,Work isn't hard wages and benefits are good just no life outside of work cause you never know when your going home. They are always looking for a reason to fire you and just overall make life very hard. this could be a great job if it was managed right by the higher ups
good,I didnt care for the always being called off and constant management  changes. The benefits were good but u had to be considered a full time employee to take advantage of them.

good,"When I as hired they did a pretty good job training people on a breadth of networking knowledge. The people who I worked with were very experienced and always were there for help."
good,"My typical day on the job starts off pretty fast paced. Based on the business needs, I would either have to oversee the sales floor and manage the sales reps by making sure each one is taking care of the customers. Then I would start on all of the back office work which entails of many different duties. Physical counts, merchandising, many different reports, data entry, cash handling, and much more. I have been given the oppurtunity to expand my resume and skill set by entrusting me with manager duties such as opening and closing the store, performing audit checks throughout the year per independant of company's procedures and policies, cash handling, dealing with escalations, and being in charge of merchandising. I am able to get along with all coworkers and maintain a positive attitude each and every day. The hardest part of my job would be completing challanging tasks at a very limited time but also putting the business needs first as far of taking care of customers in store. I am able to always get the job done perfectly on time. What I enjoy most about my job is being around a latest and greatest technology, having hands on experience with all the new devices out there, and the work and life balance aspect with AT&T. I am looking to obtain a career in an organization that fosters growth, creativity, flexibility, and offers challenging job responsibilities"

good,"I worked 12hr shifts on the GSM-O contract working in a transport NOC. There was room for advancement if you worked with routers, but not really much else. Management does not really provide opportunities to stand out, but they are possible to find if you are looking. The work is not hard, but there was some dead weight on the team. Would have liked some compensation for working the 12hr shifts, but that never happened."
good,"the pay was okay. sales made your check. it was nice always interacting with new people. the environment was very fast paced which I loved. there is great opportunity to grow. some associates were too competitive, to where the work environment was tense do to some people relationships."
good,"Working for AT&T was fun, fast paced. I would still be there if it weren't for the fact that my children were struggling in school and needed me to be home taking care of them. The managers were understanding and were willing to accept my resignation rather than firing me when I gave my two weeks notice."
good,"Fast paced multitasking customer orientated company and position."
good,i had a great time with the company.  att took real good care of me financially so i have no complaints.  its a union job with great benefits and cool management.  i never any issues getting requested time off and my work life balance was just right
good,"If you are a person that is motivated by money, and have a great work ethic you will like this job. Hourly rate is not much, however the more you sell the more you will make. Commission is fairly good at this job. With that said, prepare to have a not so great schedule when you start. You will be on closing shift everyday that you work and you will most like work every single weekend. The time does fly by, especially if you're with an enjoyable customer. It is an individual job, every person works for themselves, what you put in is what you will get out of it. Good Luck!"

I take escalations when customers want to speak with a manager. I love my coworkers! I most frustrating thing about the job is having someone really upset talking to you because what they say is never nice! You have to kind of have tough skin to work here. The most enjoyable is being able to talk to all sorts of people and helping people. I had to save a marriage once!!"

I worked with multiple billing systems and handled billing inquiries, retention, cancelations, new service, sales, and moving customers service to new locations to name a few things. I definitely learned to maintain an I can help you attitude and resolve varying types of issues by putting the customer first and promoting customer loyalty. The call center is quite deversified and everyone works to promote a good environment to work in including the management team. The hardest part of my job was always the retention, people would call angry wanting  to cancel and I would ask qualifying questions to figure why they were wanting to cancel and then respond to there answers by showing value of our products, changing packages, and finally offering promotions to help lower their bill.

I also worked with an offline team and had to respond to email requests from our internal sales team, so this helped me learn a lot about the company inside and out.

good,"I learned a lot about the telecommunications business with my time at AT&T.  They were a real pleasure to work for.

The worst part was not being able to make each and every single one of them completely happy."
good,"Love my company and job, but am wanting more opportunities."
good,"A day at AT&T can start out great but can quickly turn into a very tuff day.  Some days some jobs are as easy as plugging a phone into a wall jack to get dial tone, but then in the same day you may have to hang a service wire across four lanes of traffic.   Management help if needed but if it is something simply they would rather the tech figure it out.  My co-workers were great to work with, and the hardest part of the job was trying to sell a customer something that has everything. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer smiles and said thanks for fixing my services."

Everyday, I was always looking forward to installing the company's phone, internet, and television services in a local residence. Every home was different therefore a challenge to conduct the installation. After about a month riding along with experienced installers, I was provided my own vehicle and equipment and given my own assignment.

good,great place to work lots of different career paths to choose from

good,"Being an AT&T RSC was one of most fun experiences I have ever had at a job. A positive attitude will get you everywhere. This is a job that requires a constant motor because you will be constantly busy with customer interactions. As any retail job, the hours may be the toughest thing to get adjusted to but if you work hard, you will be rewarded with greater commissions"
good,"In 13 years there have been many changes and adjustments to my daily routine.  However, the company still remains a place where a hard working individual can succeed.  If you have a reasonable amount of common sense, and are not looking to do as little as possible, this is a job where you are compensated handsomely.  From time to time there can be personality conflicts between management and the craft employees. However I have personally found that any difficulty can be resolved with open communication and respect for one another.  The same can be said for co-workers.  Any difficulties, or differences easily resolved.  The hardest part of my routine would have to be that every once in a while management makes adjustments to daily priorities.  Most times all this requires an adjustment to how I approach jobs and using different forms, or test systems to ensure service.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that it allows me to spend time with, and support my family."
good,"Fast paced office environment.. positive atmosphere."
good,"Working for AT&T is like working in another country all to itself. The culture is all-consuming, and the work-life balance is a little skewed.

I learned that I can be a great manager, lead, coach or project coordinator distributing the work load to completion enhancing productivity.  My peers and I we worked well together sometimes in a team environment always willing to share my knowledge and likewise.  There is great satisfaction in knowing that I helped resolve problems with internal or external customers.  My job is business not personal so therefore I always had a great day,   The hardest part of the job was training when peers did not make or keep good notes for productivity and when I went to work ill.  I didn't mine assisting however we all were paid to do a job.

good,"A typical day consist of coming in and huddling up for a quick review of yesterdays statistics. Then 8 9 or 10 hours depending on your schedule of being on the phones with various customers. The customer's is the easy part of the job (my opinon). It is all of the stressful metrics/goals that I hate. This job tracks every single thing that you do. How many times you click the save button. How many times your entered and exited a billing system. How many times you logged out and went to the bathroom. Funny but I am so serious. My coworkers are cool. I am lucky, I have a very good supervisor and she is very helpful when needed. Can't say the same for all of the floor supervisors."

AT&T has more benefits than I can even tell you about. Unfortunately, it's also a war zone between the company and the union. It seemed that just after the members decided to ratify the agreement, AT&T went about trying to destroy the union. They blamed the union for many issues. The union has countered that AT&T is indeed doing this to themselves based on the new policies it put in place without talking to the union. So, if you can take that, the job itself is actually really great. You get to talk to some really amazing people on the phones and really get to help people."

good,"Working for AT&T, you meet a lot of people from different countries and with different business ventures. On average you had two customer issues to deal with for every sale. However, working with those customers you got a chance to build a bond with them and your co-workers. This is a place where you have to be willing to work with others no matter what.

good,"I worked in a mall selling phones. My customer service experience helped me with guest satisfaction. I like being hands on with customers, and this job was all about the interaction with employees and customers.."
good,"Directv customer service, as well as most customer service jobs are concerned, is nerve racking. That being said the company does make an honest effort to provide a laid back, and comfortable physical work environment, with casual dress, a cafeteria, and a recreation/exercise area. The rate of pay is competitive, and the benefits are outstanding (great insurance, and free unlimited directv service). As far as management is concerned, there is room for improvement. There is a lot of pressure put on the CSR to meet or exceed call requirements. Although this pressure is due to the demand for excellent customer service, some of the penalties are harsh, such as 3 mistakes, and that can be from the time you started with the company, and you are automatically terminated. This puts added stress on the employee with every call that they recieve. I hope they have changed that policy by now, seeing that its been a few years since I worked there. At least let the 3 penalties roll off after a few months, I mean who wants to have 2 on their record and go into work every day in fear of leaving something out on a call, and getting fired for it. All in all Directv is a great employer, but being tethered to a computer by a head set, for 8 hours, and listening to customers take out their anger on me, was not my idea of a pleasant work day."
good,"AT&T has been a huge part of my life. It is part of the reason how I have been able to maintain no debt throughout my undergraduate career and have been able to finance other things such as cars and townhouses. The people you meet and work with are some of the most diverse and fun people ever who will always leave a footprint in your life. On the flip-side, you do work in retail. So you are treated that way even though you are a working professional and making just as much if not more than the people your helping. Your superiors and customers hold you to very high expectations (which as long as you can meet you will do excellent), and I have definitely become a more tolerant and patient person because of my experience. Your management team can be very important and a driving force in your success as a rep in retail. There are a lot of challenging goals everyone is weighted with and can become a stressful environment extremely quickly. One negative person in a retail environment can really impact the success on everyone else, the flip side states the exact opposite. As bringing together everyone's strengths and pushing positivity will ultimately yield the most productivity. Leaders are important in the management role. Most enjoyable part of my job is working with people and maxing out the goals and obviously making more money, AT&T's compensation can be very generous especially if you hit certain metrics and crank up your commission. Hardest part of job can be dealing with stress from either your peers or consumers, and having a balance between your work and life. Also moving"

The managers don't breath down your back, your benefits kick in the day you start, and everyone uses the internet so I'm sure we will be around for a while! The schedule is great! I get to keep my weekends! After 3 months you get to do other things and help other agents in the center and after 18 months you can promote if ready. The location is great!

Most of them had been on the phones before, so it helped to know they understood what you as a representative for the company was going thru. The hardest part of the job, I would have to say be required to sell to angry, unhappy customers who were just calling in the lower their bills due to losing their jobs or love ones and you had to find yourself selling in spite of.

good,good place for young people to work can make lot of money work on commmise and on holdays
good,Good pay have to work 6 days a week some weeks to stay ahead. Would be great if we had more personal to carry the load seams like we try to cut back to the point we cant stay ahead.
good,I do not have anything else to add to the context of my ratings.  There is nothing worth while I have to add that would make any difference to a reviewer on this site.
good,my experience over all with AT&T was great. There were some bumps along the way but the over all culture there was amazing. If I could go back I definitely would
good,Great place to work. Love the people. Great to help customers. Fun environment. Just be positive. Try to get some sales and be polite. I think it's a great place.
good,"The culture of AT&T is great!  I have met some of my closest friends from this job, and it has always been a wide variety of every race at all times. It was nice to have a diverse culture where everyone got along. "
good,Working at AT&T provided excellent team building activities. I learned a lot about critical thinking and problem resolution. The hardest part of the job was the schedule change every 6 months. The most enjoyable experience is helping the customers.
good,AT&T Great company you’re work for. Fantastic benefits room for advancements. You get lunch breaks and 15 minutes breaks. Fantastic training staff. Paid vacations.
good,I enjoyed my time at AT&T and it provided me and my family a great life and a great benefits and perks.  It provided my family with a good life and able to support my family alone as a single parent.

good,"I enjoy my job, however; I have been there 5 years and there really hasn't been any substantial advancement or wage increase,  That is the down side.  I am a very hard worker and I would like to be able to grow with a company and be compensated for my worth,"
good,"The place and company have attractive environment to stay in and work ."
good,Once you reach a certain point its not much room for growth and they have been reducing the work force. The training that they provide is good and effective.
good,"It’s really a good job, good pay as well. I never made under 50k. Benefits are good as well and company discount better than most. I recommend it as a career"
good,"Reviewing business AT&T and DIRECTV accounts renewing, adding services taking inbound calls and making outbound calls, Great Family orientated place to work!!"
good,Colleugues are very helpful and become a part of your daily life. I have met some of the sharpest and friendliest people while working there. They are a comany who truly believes in work life balance as we were allowed to work from home two days out of the week.
good,"Paid by the job so its defi itly not for everyome. Ans they are expanding what they do so I say guve it a shot, you might ljke it and some of the benifits. Hours is kind of the biggest issue."
good,"Is a good company to work for but they are downsizing right now, so job security is not there. "
good,"I liked the hours I worked  and the pay that I was getting, and the vacation time that I got. I also liked the vacation time off. the pay was also good for a time but my last manager sucked."
good,Had a crew of techs who I'll follow to go see customers to check if customers who satisfied with the service. Also made on site sales if customers wanted to switch over from there previous carrier.
good,I was there for about six months and I two managers so this made for an unstable work environment. Especially since they had two different managing styles.
good,This call center had it's challenges at times. Our goals changed quite frequently which made it very hard to maintain at times. Standards seemed to change weekly with new customer interaction tools to make the customer feel more valued. This was a wonderful addition. Management was challenging at times with little support unless you had done something incorrectly. But overall I did love the job.
good,AT&T Business Solutions is a great place to work.  They not only have great people and a great culture but you're doing some really exciting and cutting edge work.
good,Teach employees to sell at&t products and services while also being aware of technology and apps outside of the scope of this position. Must be a team player and a pro at conflict management.
good,"My responsibility was to assist in the development of a new organization that was charged with performing various functions to support the Business and Residental Sales, Warehouse, Engineering, and Customer base.  "
good,"La cultura laboral es buena, hay capacitacion constante y el salario fue bueno. Solo tuve problemas al dejar la empresa tardaron más de 4 meses para darme el finiquito"
good,Everyone is super nice and everyone is very nice and trainers are amazing as well. I would totally recommend this place. Specially Mesa office is great
good,"If you want to work for a corporation that is all about benefits, pay, training and work/life balance AT&T is the job for you. I love working for AT&T!"
good,"Muy buena empresa para trabajar y desarrollarte, trabajo por objetivos"
good,"One of the best turning points in my career, probably the best team have worked with. The team was awesome and cooperative in all phases. Best place till date."
good,"AT&T is a best place for people like me who adapt changes quickly and get along with new strategies as it thrives to provide best Customer Experience and determined to stay one step ahead in Technological advancement. "
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with AT&T.  It was a very positive experience and I feel like I got a lot out of it in even my short time.  The environment was fast-paced, competitive, and even at times stressful, but still you are apart of a team and feel a great deal of satisfaction when dpgetting the job done."
good,Average phone work.  A typical work day was average for a call center from day to day.  The management could have been a little better.  The training was average.
good,"AT&T was a great company to work for, but their seniority based scheduling provided more of a strain on my home life than I was comfortable with. The compensation and benefits packages were wonderful. "
good,"A lot of benefit such as, College tuition, certification tuition. A lot of training to progress.  Very good Benefits for wireless discounts and accessories"
good,"Fast paced and fun. lots of opportunities. Good pay, good hours, fun environment,  friendly coworkers and innovative thinking and business sales. comfortable place to work."
good,AT&T has great benefits but it is a very fast and stressful job environment.  You will get plenty of upset customers who have already called in to the call center or even gone to the store who have gotten told different things.  The company make you personalize to try and get on the same level as the customer so they don't think of you as a robot or reading off a script.  If you don't personalize they mark you down on your statistics.  You could be great at trouble shooting but if you don't like small talk your manager will have to get on you about it will affect your statistics.
good,Great pay and benefits. Meet interesting people and see exciting places. Not for someone that has young children who have weekend ballgames though. Plenty of opportunities to make great wages.
good,"You go to the office for the morning meeting, get your equipment then head to your first job. What I've learned was job security is a myth. The most enjoyable part of the job is your out in the world with no one hovering over you."
good,"I had a great experience with AT&T besides a few bumps in the road here and there. They were friendly, my supervisors were caring, friendly, and helpful, and the benefits were nice."
good,"Trabajaba jornadas de 10 horas en la oficina más los tiempos de viaje, casi imposible otras actividades, pero buen trabajo, buen ambiente, buen dinero, buena ubicación, excelente gente."
good,I would work there again if possible. I had great managers and great team members. Their training programs were excellent; managers were always there to lend a hand.
good,AT&T was a great environment to work in. A Typical day consisted of greeting and interacting with customers. Learned something new everyday. The most enjoyable part was when we did our store resets. The hardest part was the counts that had to be done monthly. If something was missing we had to do it all over. Management was overall okay. Overall working for AT&T was a great experience and I would definitely recommend the company to a friend!
good,Love working at ATT. I've learned so many different skills and lessons from my career and enjoyed all the different ways ATT was able to provide training and feedback.
good,Great place to work with superb management and great colleagues. Location in Redditch is easy to get to from the M42 or from Stow. Excellent facilities.
good,Expectation of being on time and ready to work at appointed time. Not a place to work if you are a slacker. Excellent benefits. Great place to retire from.
good,"Many departments with many opportunities...for the most part, it's up to the individual. Access to training and education while working, at your pace."
good,Was wishing to retire from AT&T down the road but unfortunately the doors closed first. Fully enjoyed my job. It had a lot of different job functions which made it enjoyable.
good,I learned alot from the company in my many years of working there.They allowed me to utilize my skills and simultaneously learn new ones.I gained valuable insight in day today operations while  working there.
good,"Facilitation of meetings( sprint planning,daily Scrums, sprint review, sprint retrospectives), conflict resolutions, coaching team members  and management on agile and being available for the team members ."
good,decent place to work.  struggle with moving up into management.  but if you want a place you know you can have a career with little chance of being let go this works.
good,"Retail sales associate is the best job at AT&T for average people working retail that can make over 50,000 a year in a fun safe environment. Yes it gets stressful at times but what job does not. There are a lot of benefits out side of the good money you make .... WARNING>>>>DO NOT GET INTO Management at AT&T for it is a cut throat doggy dog world above retail sales . Stay in sales and live life happy"
good,"Great compensation, great benefits, co workers are a joy to work with they become like a second family. As long as you show up to work and do your job you are sure to keep your job! Customer Loyalty Reps are basically the last stop for customers so we do get customers that tend to be somewhere between confused and irate more than other departments. Most situations that happen are because the customer doesn’t understand their billing or because they did not take the time to understand what they were agreeing to"
good,If you are going in as anything other that telephone service you may be able to stay and retire. Those that came in on telephone service only were pushed out without training to move to other areas with comparable money.
good,"I enjoyed my time there,  but it waa time to move on.  The pay was good,  and some of the managers was nice.  But other than thar,  it was okay ......"
good,"I really like working at AT&T company very diverse, they hires the best supervisor well trained to do their job and how to relate to employees and still meet the company goals, offers the best benefit package for employees (medical & dental) less out of pocket expenses and deductible. The best part of job really like helping customers, making sure that all concerns and issues was resolved in a timely manner, customer satisfaction get great survey and a customer for life."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. If you're good at sales, you will excel here. I was top in sales across the country and in my district, and got paid accordingly. The hours are long, and you can get overwhelmed if you're not apt to dealing with stressful environments."
good,adapted to skill level and training. very informative members ans staff. Was a great environment to work in and pleasant. Learned a lot from the Manager but followed my career path to Medical.
good,"There is great pay when working for this company but you dont feel like the company really cares about you, you are just another number to them you can always be replaced"
good,Great pay and benefits also room for advancement. People there are great to work with. Depends on department you work in which could be an issue with work/family life balance.
good,Typical day at work means going over the numbers to see what we need to exceed our goals. Then relying that message to the team and coaching them on how to hit their metrics. After that you will sit in on interactions driving sales.
good,The Technology Development Program is geared towards new hires and allows the employees to try different roles at the company before graduating the program.
good,"I’ve worked for the company for 6 years and it’s been good. They have pretty great discounts and compensation for the work we do. As a sales rep you are represented by the union and it provides job security. The culture has significantly shifted over the last year and it has become somewhat cut-throat. Overall, I would recommend it."
good,"It is a fun place to work with great coworkers with amazing personalities! It's so fun always staying up to date with the latest technology that comes out (new iPhones, watch gear, etc.). It is always busy and fast-paced, but the helpful management and friendly coworkers are very helpful at helping you handle the workflow. Can get a little overwhelming at times if customers grow impatient with wait times or impatient with wanting a certain piece of inventory that we were out in store. The only thing I would have to complain about would be time off to request. It is based on seniority, so employees that have been with the company longest get first pick on schedule as well as time off. You cannot call in sick, you have to have a healthcare provider submit paperwork if you miss a day due to illness and wait for it to get approved. It is based on a point system, so if you call in sick, submit paperwork and the paperwork gets denied, then you accumulate points that add up and may lead to termination. Other than that, it was a very fun place to work. I would definitely work there again."
good,AT&T has amazing benefits. I love what I do and would refer people to apply. I really enjoy what I do and have learn alot of different skill pivots. Thank you
good,Good job to be at don’t know why you asking me to rate this company anyhow but since I must was a good job to work will not have weekend off based on time there
good,You get to work with a lot of people with different backgrounds and meet amazing customers.This is a family atmosphere where you can express your ideas and feelings.
good,"Not a lot of people work in the office- that's government work for you. It's laid back, you are not micromanaged at all and the work life balance is great!"
good,When I worked there the commission was great. I have heard things have changed a little kore but the guys in there say the hourly is good. Benefits were amazing because it’s such a big company. If your in the right store with the right team it is a great place to be if you are good at sales.
good,Taking inbound calls assisting customers. Job can be stressful during busy times when calls are back to back with 100s of callers holding. Monthly metrics/goals per call evaluated.
good,Over the last 10 years a lot has changed. I will say when I 1st started I loved it enjoyed coming to work. Over the last 3 years they have added new things and have made it very stressful and less enjoyable.
good,At&t is a great company ! The Chicago call center has a lot of opportunities for advancement since it is a new 2 year call center. Everyone’s views at the company aren’t aligned so don’t be surprised if your told one thing and the next day it’s another version of the previous information. Company is growing rapidly. There are some messy co workers but there easy to spot. Stay away from messy people and you’ll be fine. Even though there are 500 plus people everyone knows each other.
good,A very versatile place to work at which is not necessarily for AT&T but a contracted job for AT&T to manage customer's accounts.  The scheduling is great when the right schedule is available.  There is 100 hrs worth of bucket time that you can miss from work before you're deemed terminated and there is a process that allows you to make up most of this time while it happens.
good,"During my employment with AT&T I learned a few things about the company. For starters it’s not going to be easy to balance your gross ads with accessories now with other retail giants like Amazon and eBay, however if you use the tools that the company provides you with and really give it 110% and educate your customer  they do a great job to compensate your hard work after closing that tough sale. The best part in my opinion the company has great friendly staff  I have met most of my current friends from working with AT&T. In my experience at my store and meeting many people from other stores, I have to say if your looking for a team that works together and help each other succeed and make a good living AT&T is a great place to start your career."
good,Constantly getting calls from people who are extremely angry and the company constantly expects better and better performance. Management is never happy (for long) with how good you are doing. They keep raising the bar and pushing expectations so that it's always a struggle to maintain good performance. This is usually resolved by reps cutting corners and finding loopholes to meet expectations giving customers a worse overall experience.
good,"I learned a lot with AT&T, although it pretty much took all of my time. Nights, weekends, holidays are not my favorite times to work, although for single young folks without families would benefit from the experience."
good,"Great team environment with a very diverse culture. Fast paced, non stop phone calls from the moment you login to your phone until the end of your shift. May be the perfect job for a person who likes this type of work but ultimately not the right fit for me."
good,enjoyed working on uverse systems and plant until uverse was supplanted by directv. great benefited to include uniforms and company truck. very well compensated
good,"Typical Day- providing efficient customer service to customers. Regarding billing inquiries, problem solving, and information about different products and services."
good,to answer light to heavy phones to help solve all the customers wireless needs for billing to technical support.  Also to take advantage of the opportunity to sell U-verse TV and internet
good,Working for an Authorized Retailer has been a great learning experience. I recommend it for anyone interested in sales or for anyone that wants to get into sales.
good,"I retired from AT&T with 43 years service...."
good,"The AT&T Environment was very Competitive , but enjoyable workplace to work in. I learned how to sale and work well with others and provide good customer service"
good,"its a great work environment love the people on my team, the manager is very understanding.. Helpful, makes the job more fun.. My team is a whole are outstanding people"
good,"was a good place to work. some of the downfalls was working in the bad weather, but in the turn about it was nice to work outside when the weather was nice and others where stuck inside."
good,"At AT&T you will have the opportunity to learn quite a bit and I recommend you take advantage of all the training and educational opportunities.  Management encourages self development and will give people the chance to grow and and expand their knowledge.  "
good,AT&T is the number one telcom provider for a reason.  They do so much right.  Great experience to work there and I was sad to have to leave in order to move to an AT&T free location and take care of my sick parents.
good,"Very great place to work and advance. Great for a dedicated sales person.  The incentives, insurance and hours were great. I loved working for the company and training was a breeze."
good,"I haven't worked for AT&T for awhile. They were a great company with lots of benefits and a good salary. Management was typical for such a big company. Overall, my experience was positive."
good,"Good place to work but the days of having a bowling leagues,, softball, golf leagues and company picnics are long gone.  Basically just go to work - do your job and go home.  If you wanted a Christmas party you had to do it yourself."
good,"AT&T provided great training and support.  I would arrive and log into my computer to answer phone calls from all types of people with various questions.  Sometime they were very mad and sometime they were just looking for information or answers.  I became very good at controlling al call with inflection and empathy.  In the end, they closed the office."
good,Great experience.  Enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis and working with emerging technologies.  Would like to use the experience gained on a new job in the industry.
good,"I personally loved working at AT&T, the only reason why I left was because the managers I had were terrible.., but other then that it was great workplace environment and a lot of fun working there."
good,It was great experience to work at ATT. Company has processes aligned well and management is great. Work life balance is great as well. Since it is a large company there are many opportunities to move from team to team.
good,"The company does try very hard to keep you in the loop with whats going on and keep you updated with any changes. The compensation did fluctuate, but over all was paid well."
good,I'm a project manager working with AT&T Mobility projects. I have experienced a fast phase environment that help me developed my analytical ability and growth.
good,"Overall the work life balance was great at the location I previously worked at though at times the moral would be low, I would attempt to make every day better for myself and coworkers as well."
good,Answered calls from techs to reschedule new home install appointments. Participated in group activities and also team challenges where challenged each other with daily
good,"A typical day at work with AT&T was many sales, customer acquisitions, and problem solving. I learned sales techniques, customer service skills, and about the new technology we had to offer. Our management at AT&T was very friendly, organized, and well trained to help with any issues that may arise. The workplace culture was very positive, high energy, and fun, while still being professional. I would say the hardest part of the job was the customer service aspect, dealing with disgruntled customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and teaching customers about their new technology."
good,except attending meeting and working on project we used to have lot of team building activity. you can approach any employee to get some help in different technologies.
good,"Working for AT&T gave me the oppurtunity to build relationships with good quality people. I am grateful for my time working for AT&T as a sales consultant because, it allowed me to realize  what I want to do in life."
good,At&t is a good place to work. they are just undergoing layoffs. The culture there is progressive depending on what department you work in. The hardest part of the job is the day to day politics. The most enjoyable part of the job is instructing technicians on how to be a great employee.
good,"Sales environment can be stressful for sure, however, the company provides store leaders with ALL the tools required to delight customers and reduce CHURN.  Take care of your sales team and be fair, legal, and consistent and the sky is the limit with sales.  Received the Summit award my second year with the company, this award recognizes the top sales leaders by spoiling them for several days at a resort.  "
good,I have always felt very fortunate to have worked for AT&T. The benefits were good. I had options for advancement and training. I did enjoy my training to become a training assistant and to be involved in the LEAD program and had a very encouraging mentor.
good,"Overall, it's a good company to work for. It can be challenging at times because of the workplace culture brought on by constant downsizing. The constant headcount reductions, despite the company flourishing, can be somewhat disheartening. Your immediate supervisor/manager values you as a person, but upper management does not. The company expects you to be loyal to them but they are not loyal in return."
good,"Selling cell phone contracts, home phone and DirecTV contracts. Busy on a consistent basis. Learned a lot about ins and outs of cell phones, and wifi products. Hardest part is saying No to customers who want you to accomplish a task outside your job title."
good,"Great place to work, management was poor, they need better skills and training overall a great place to work learn and grow. On the job was fun and exciting"
good,Great and fun place to work but you must be able to perform if not it's not the best place to work at. Commission and goals are not the hardest to obtain but you will eventually hit a wall on how much you can make considering AT&T is the #1 cable provider in the U.S.
good,Every day was filled with opportunity and advancement. The work load was overwhelming at times but the compensation and the commitment to teamwork made things great. The culture was fun and refreshing.
good,"Excellent opportunity to move forward but, it is not a permanent job. They should create more jobs to meet the demand for services they offer. Nice workplace."
good,"AT&T had great pay and benefits. As a RSC you were union, so after being there for a while, you had great schedules. Very good about working around schedules."
good,Quick pace/ Didn't like working weekends or holidays / Management was okay/ work environment was nice. Overall I enjoyed the job. The company doesn't mind spending money on training there employees.
good,"High-pressure sales, but they provide a lot of training. I saw a few instances where HR acted in the best interest of the people in corporate rather than lower-level employees, but other than that, they are generally very well-ordered. There is a lot of structure as far as processes. Schedules and time off are based on seniority. Compensation is fair, but decreased every year I spent there. Management was mostly excellent, with a few poor managers here and there, but they tend not to last long. Workplace culture can get a little ""locker room""-esque, but it isn't the worst I've seen. Hardest part of the job is just the grind of the process, but the coworkers and customers make up for it. Generally a fun place to work."
good,"This job is no place for lazy people.  You spend all your time helping customers out in the field.  You have to climb service poles, go into extremely hot attics and deal with more so than usual, unhappy customers."
good,"AT&T is a wonderful place to work. I worked in both the call center and one of the retail stores. The pay and culture are excellent. However, I left the company due to the lack of advancement opportunities related to my education. While I worked in the call center, I held a bachelors degree in Corporate Communication. While in the retail store, I held a Masters in Marketing Communication. "
good,"I worked at their warehouse for a little over a year and it was fine for the most part. There were very few hours spent with anyone else, about an hour each day. This led to many hours working while listening to music or podcasts and was very relaxing. Once a quarter there is inventory that is an incredibly hectic weekend (2-3 days). The supervisors and everyone else were always very friendly and the work was never very strenuous. It is a good part time job all things considered and even though it was 6 days a week it still allowed for lots of free time."
good,"Good entity to work with, growth potentials really high but most importantly it provides a learning environment. The organization culture encourages self organization, team innovation and creativity. stakeholder are involved with the transformation process and participate in sprint reviews."
good,You must learn to manage up as well as down in order to navigate  your way through the corporate environment.  A mentor program is available and you must be persistent in your efforts to find one.
good,En general es una empresa que impulsa mucho la inclusión y el crecimiento personal.
good,A typical day was some what routined. In office work in the morning and field inspections in the afternoon. I learned how to be organized and accountable. Management was very supportive. The work place was relaxed and encouraging. The hardest part was working with Contractors. The most enjoyable part was collaborating with my colleagues..
good,"Fun friendly environment,  very informational training environment so need to be ready to retain a lot at once.  You have to be willing to stick it out and understand your going to probably spend more time there then at home."
good,Very strict standards with little flexibility or individual control.  A lot of time spent on review of standards and repetative reviews on safety and job standards.  Good pay and benefits.
good,"Company concentrates on customer satisfaction, employee inclusion,and a safe workplace. Management also has an open door policy. I learned to use my listening skills and applying to customer needs."
good,I enjoyed my job and was very good at it.  I am a very fast worker and got more accomplished in a day than most of my co-workers.  There is no micro management in engineering.  We have a flexible work schedule and can telecommute when needed.  The discounts are simply amazing!
good,"I was able to work for AT&T for 39 years.  The jobs over the years were good and the pay was great.  We have very good benefits with health, dental, vision and 401K.  I was able to learn a lot of new things and was able to take courses through the company.  The last few years were harder with the direction of the company is going."
good,"Frequent updates from executive leadership team so employees are very clear on company goals, performance and direction. No frills,  budget conscious company. Great learning opportunities through AT&T University."
good,"Loved my career at AT&T. Opportunities for advancement, training, travel and challenging positions. "
good,"Leading edge technology, but very stressful. Constant workforce reductions lead to a very stressful environment. Some jobs were challenging, some were not. Some were interesting. Some were boring"
good,AT&T is a good starter job if you're looking to do sales. even though sales isn't my best area it did help me gain the confidence i need to be able to communicate better and be a more outgoing person.
good,You get a raise every 6 months until you cap out. Which is very good. Also very good amount of hours to make very good money. Bad thing is the work/life balance. Work hours for the needs of the company. Never a set time when you get off work. Good management.
good,"In the ever changing metrics of retail, I wish there was a little more viable information in pay structure changes. I am easy going guy when information is given up front. I enjoyed my time with AT&T Wireless. I made tremendous connections that I have today."
good,This was a great place to work until it closed its doors and the jobs were then moved overseas. Benefits were great. Would love to work there again just in customer service only.
good,"AT&T pay and benefits are among the best in the country.  Health, Dental, Vision.  On the job Training.  Paid vacations.  Tuition reimbursement.  On the forefront of technology and wireless innovation."
good,Pull first job usually and install in the morning. Contact customer and head to premise to do the job.Once finished pull another job depending on how long the first job was I may pull another install or repair.
good,"AT&T is a stable company with many opportunities for growth. If I have the opportunity to go back to work for them someday, I will definitely consider it. They offer great benefits and a healthy work environment."
good,Really enjoyed my 19 years of service. Nothing more to say when you simply enjoy what you do and who you work with each and every day of the year.....
good,"I answered incoming calls from AT&T customers who wanted help with their bills, equipment or to add features to their service.  Management was okay, it was hard to get any of them to take a call when the customer would ask to speak to a manager. The culture was very widespread, we had so many different people from all over the world it was great to get to know their culture.  The hardest part of this job was making sure that you answered all of the questions that the customer had so that he/she would not call back.  I really do not think that there was an enjoyable part of this job."
good,This was a great place to work. It was a sub store for ATT. I enjoyed the fast pace and learning about the different phones. Work with a diverse group of customers and meeting their personal needs was always a great challenge.
good,Good company to work for but does have a lot of the big company issues. Most jobs are performance based as each department has goals and metrics to meet. Depending on the position it can have a poor work life balance. Very rewarding pay and benefit scales. Company is transitioning so there is quite a bit of uncertainty in various job titles.
good,"Great work environment. Friendly and positive work environment. Job can be a bit challenging at times, but it is worth it. Coworkers are willing to help when you are troubled with an job."
good,great workplace culture and team oriented company-focused on making profit but cared about the employees who worked there.  I would recommend working at AT&T for a great career.
good,"work on the office, "
good,wonderful place to work. great oppurtunities to grow into a better  worklife and  learn great and exciting new things everyday. would def recommend to others
good,"great pay, work by your self , work hrs were long and you work until you are told to go home. Hard to make plans during the week because you never know when you will get home"
good,"Management was great, helpful and desired success of the workers. The only thing about the company I did not like was that their was no opportunity to transition into a corporate position due to the headquarters being located in Dallas."
good,"AT&T is a great company with great benefits, and a fast paced working environment. If you're good with people, and making sales then you'll thrive there. Please be advised though, that you not only have to be good with customers, you also have to be good with the people you work with. Many of the Managers are young, and it can lead to butting heads with equally young Sales Reps. Also with everyone in a tizzy to get their sales quotas, it can become a ""shark in the water"" environment. But again, REALLY GREAT as a company"
good,"This section to ""Write Your Review"" about working at AT&T will be left blank.  I have chosen not to include any confidential/information about employment at AT&T"
good,I loved my job at ATT but had to take care of my sick sting grandmother alone too for a while. Until I got to move back to TN. I would of loved to continue to work there but driving after I moved back to TN was very unrealistic for 2 hrs travel timeline way
good,"You can learn depth of Telecom Domain sector with AT&T, Good Client for multiple companies."
good,A very busy job. Travel daily. Car allowance. Traffic. Great Manager. Good Coworkers. Monthly sales quotas. Collection of past due advertisers. Chargebacks!
good,Fast paced environment. The position was not cookie cutter. Things were constantly changing. As technology changed our focus changed right along with it.
good,good job to have with growth in a growing field. highly stressful. If you are looking for a career in ITor telecommunications this is a great place to start.
good,"I’ve been with AT&T for a little over 2years now. The job itself can be stressful at times. A lot of it boils down to you. If you’re good at talking to people, your work ethic, if you can handle someone screaming at you. Typical workday is taking 8 hours of calls. Some days were in que busy day. Other days we have 10 minutes between calls. The issues range from you replacing phones under warranty, easy known issues, crazy off the wall issues that you have to reach out to multiple coworkers and utilize lots of tools for, bill breakdowns, changing plans, selling, tech for android and iPhone. We also recently started helping with international. Most enjoyable thing is you really do get taken care of. They’re always having an incentive for something. Your managers care about you. They’ll give you food or gifts a lot randomly. Phenomenal Pay and benefits. Just come to work expecting the unexpected. Taking calls all day sometimes gets old but every call is different. Also make sure you have good work ethic because the attendance policy is pretty strict. If it snows, a lot of us end up staying the night near the center in a nearby hotel. It doesn’t matter how you get to work. Just that you get there and on time. Another thing that a lot of people tend to not like is they’re always looking at certain stats with a microscope. The basic ones are always important “friendliness, did you resolve the issue, have they called back in the past week” etc. but then you’ll also have to make sure you provide them with self service options, tell them verbatim you can fix their problem and also verbatim"
good,"At AT&T I felt like I was part of a team. I always knew that there was help if I needed it, and that no question was a ""dumb"" one. AT&T provided employees with a gym, a cafeteria, and a nice and clean smoking area. We had adequate break times. The job is mentally straining due to difficult customers, but the feeling of accomplishment is well worth the trouble of the job."
good,Physically active position with the requirement with the thirst to learn and advance in a fast growing well known successful company with lots of room for advancement
good,A typical day starts at your home and you are required to be onsite at first customers home by 8 am everyday you are scheduled to work. Your job can consist of all Service Calls 1 day and then a mix of service calls and installs the next...Make sure your able to work in all different kinds of climates as this is a MUST!
good,"AT&T puts a lot of effort into making sure its employees are trained and prepared for the future. It is a union job, and has all the benefits and difficulties associated with that."
good,"ATT had a great work/life balance with flex time for telecommuting and work from home benefits.  However, the company is now going  back to a more structured environment and many new job openings are in Atlanta, Dallas or El Segundo.  Chicago used to be a headquarters however over the years the offices closed and moved to one of the three main hubs."
good,"AT&T provided for my family and me for 17 years. While many changes occurred over that time I always had good managers, reward for my work ethic and productivity, good benefits and an excellent salary. If you work hard you will be rewarded."
good,"A typical day at work was knowing what needed to be done, and expected of you  to be a successful Sales Associate/ Team Lead "
good,Directv was a great environment to work in. Everyone was friendly and the coaches were amazing. The culture was very chill and laid back. Like any other call center the work life and home life balance was horrible but all in all if you were going to choose a call center it would be at&t Directv
good,Es muy buena empresa para laboral el ambiente laboral en muy bueno
good,Stressful at times working the late shift. Great pay and benefits. They are not hiring for legacy CSS techs anymore but are hiring lower paid service techs.
good,"ATT offers great benefits to its employees, service discounts, and pay compensation. ATT does a good job at making an effort to keep morale high in the work place. They sincerely care for their employees."
good,Enjoyed my time here. great pay and benefits. Given the flexibility to manage employees and contractors with little interference. the only bad part was pulling duty.
good,"Everyday was a learning experience. Can be extremely fast paced, but helped the day go by. My only issue with my specific location was the turnover of our store managers during the time that I worked at my location. I went through 4 in two years. My coworkers made the job the most enjoyable as well as satisfying our customer needs. The hardest part was learning new products and how to implement them in a bundle sale that it every customer."
good,You have to be able to adapt on the fly.  Customers come in all varieties and you need to be able to interact with them on a professional manner and get their issues resolved.  Empathy is a big key to success at ATT and if you have the right skills you will go far in this company
good,"Things were really good when it was DirecTV, I feel the love for my job started falling after AT&T purchased DirecTV...And now the technicians in the field, and in the customer's homes have to jump through hoops because of other's inadequacies..."
good,"a company with good salary, good benefits, and also give the ability to develop better knowledge, about customer service,also an excellent school to layer sellers, not only with them but for a future business of their own"
good,"Very Competitive Company to Work for."
good,"Worked with many contractors, vendors, telecom providers to provide Ethernet services to various cell sites.  Required negotiations, thinking outside the box to accomplish work on time and under budget. "
good,I loved my time at AT&T as a Retail Sales Consultant! I had the best work family anyone could ask for going all the way up to our Area Manager. The company was great about being transparent with employees about long term and short term goals for the company.
good,"Company offers great benefits and advancement possibilities . Great coaching and help in customer"
good,great job fun loving able to see things graet benifits great time off easy workdays great atomsphere good workers good benifits good relationships with super
good,Poco sueldo y mucho trabajo para el puesto de servicio técnico
good,Pay was great and job was flexible for a 20 year old with no skills. Honestly probably should have stayed there longer than I did. Albeit this was before they begin switching most of the corporate locations to dealers.
good,great place to work that provided me with the tools to manage a workforce effectively as well as polish my coaching and time management skills. I would recommend at&t to anyone interested in a competitive sales environment.
good,"El trabajo en general es muy bueno, es gratificante cumplir las metas y ademas la posibilidad de progresar dentro de la empresa y de ir escalando poco a poco. La cultura laboral es lo unico que no me gustó, la linea dentre lo legal y lo fraudulento es muy delgada, pero no es del todo culpa de la empresa, es mas bien culpa de los supervisores y team leaders. La gerencia es genial, tienen contacto constante con los subordinados y dan mucho apoyo."
good,Provide advance training.  Teach you how to deal with all sorts of people.  Management made it fun and challenging at times.  It was a family culture in the customer care center.
good,"I've worked for at&t for the past 8 years. The pay is good, the compensation is also great depending on your performance.  Commission structure is always taking a hit as the years go by since the wireless industry is taking a dive (everyone has smartphones now), and since the company is buying out other companies.  Management can be stressful if you don't hit your numbers. But all in all, good company to work for... thus far. If you're new, don't have your hopes up for a good work schedule (work weekends, and night shift most likely if you're a new hire... Will take YEARS to get a good schedule such as opening shifts, and weekends off)."
good,"Work is challenging but weekend work is not really required in my current position.  The compensation at AT&T is very good."
good,"It was a good competitive nature company to work for. The managers were great to work with. They made it fun, relaxing, non stressful, and very competitive among sales teams."
good,AT&T is a great company to work for overall. However the Retail Sales Consultant position can be very stressful. As in many sales positions if you are not hitting the proper numbers you risk being terminated. I learned a lot and grew proffesionally from working for the company. The stores I worked in during my time with the company were amazing. I've built life long friendships there. The job culture is definitely family oriented.
good,"I loved m position, Great place to develop"
good,"Bonus are great., like my coworkers, fun place to work. worked 12-9 and that was the hardest part, can work those hours but would rather do it from home"
good,Great company that allows its employees to move across any business unit easily. The learning opportunities are endless and one can truly change their career without losing current pay or status.
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T call center in Little Rock, Arkansas.It was a brand new call center and employed I believe around 200 people."
good,"The quickest way out is either lay out of work or get promoted. Senior management will use you as a scape goat to take the blame away from them. Aside from that, follow the guidelines set to assist customers and you could work here forever. You will need lots of patience to deal with frustrated customers."
good,I would recommend a job with this company . working outside everyday is challenging and not for everyone so that must be considered.  The union structure is sometimes challenging because the best person doesn't always get the promotion it's seniority based.
good,A typical day working at AT&T differs based on what business unit you are in. AT&T is a huge company that has multiple business units but at the center of all of them are finding ways to connect our customers where they live work and play
good,"Due to time Warner merger, AT&T is undergoing budget cutbacks resulting in surplus.  This hopefully will be resolved in the future. I liked the flexible remote options."
good,"Multiple levels of management were accessible and helpful. Training programs in place made learning a priority. Job task was a t times unclear, gained a lot of networking and real-world experiences."
good,"the management were very helpful and more than willing to help, typical day to day was challenging and different, great way to test my skills and problem solving skills, only problem was that the higher ups would send new guidelines and procedures regardless of complaints, occasionally felt like just a number"
good,"You're busy mostly all day and in most cases getting overtime. Days are usual very hot in the summer, attics being even hotter. You learn to run cable/wires into attics, walls, pipes/conduit, and bury cables. You will learn to splice, crimp, make ends, on various cables. Hardest part of the day is combating the heat midday/afternoon outside or in an attic. Most enjoyable was seeing new people and learing some of their experiences."
good,"Productive work environment that requires innovation, collaboration, and ability to work in fast past paced environment.  The hardest part of the job can be accessing critical information in a timely fashion with multiple legacy databases."
good,"The experience was great, but I know that a lot has changed since I left my original position with  AT&T. To this day, I regret leaving my original position with AT&T. I thought that I could evolve my sales skills and in that sense I accomplished that goal. However, I have yet to work for a business that truly allowed their reps to flourish like AT&T. I attempted to go back after working for YP marketing, but the game had changed or my experience was altered by the fact I chose a different location for better hours. I wanted better hours for my new marriage and chose the different location that unfortunately seemed more directed towards customer service than sales. First, I'm highly motivated by commission and I actually landed the top rep in the country during my first run with AT&T (located at data drive, Hoover AL). The new location that I chose used archaic systems that I know were on their way out. I have a lot of respect for the reps that work that location and by no means am I promoting negativity on the staff or management. However, I was so turned off by the sudden change in expectations and I knew that I had made a mistake. Again, my first run with AT&T paid well and I over exceeded my quota and was recognized for my accomplishments every day. The training staff were wonderful (Celeste) and the environment promoted healthy team building along with great incentives. If I could go back in time, I would stay with the original call center at AT&T and tell myself not to look a gift horse in the mouth. I have no doubt that I would have made floor manager. I would have continued"
good,I had a great time wroking for this company. The people there would threat you like their own family. I would recommend this company for any one looking for a partime.
good,I received a wonderful rate of pay and stay there for two years and after 30 years we realize that our office was closing due to corporate restructuring so I chose to take my retirement and relocate from Michigan to Florida due to the fact that I could no longer handle winter weather
good,"Was a good company to work for, but could be stressful at times. Management could vary as far as support and guidance. AT&T salary allowed me to pay my bills and live comfortably."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work. Great benefits and salary. A lot of changes in focus over the years, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It doesn't take long to realize why they have so many long-term employees."
good,"SO long story short.  I'm disappointed in the way the company handled my case.  I fell down with my ladder,,, company investigated,  I had all my protective gear on, only thing they found wrong was that i didn't sweep the ground before placing my ladder. got suspended for 5 days. I've never gotten hurt when working , i've been doing cable installations for more than five years.  I now know the reason why people refrain from reporting an injury.  either way they will find something wrong to suspend you."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work, I enjoyed my job. the only part for me was the drive everyday, I have try to move a Fort Worth office but no opening and advancement in my position was not available. That is really the only bad thing for me."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work and build your career.  They do have too many layoffs and restructuring but if you can survive that and do a great job, they will pay you well and you will have a career."
good,"Recibiamos capacitaciones constantes, reconocen nuestros logros y en general todos llevan una buena relacion, tienes oportunidad de crecimiento."
good,"AT&T managers are great to work with .However, this job requires you to prioritize it because it is commission and hourly based. I left the job for personal reasons, I couldn't manage school and work, but it is very possible. The managers work with your school schedule. I recommend it!"
good,"This is a good company to work for. The only issue was that it was extremely difficult to get released from that call center. The compensation including quarterly bonuses, recogntion for your work, the continuos education were amazing."
good,It was a great place to owork at despite having communication problems with the managers it was a great place to move up and express the socirty changes
good,"An okie assisting a very fast pace New Yorker was not a good mix. There were steps and procedures to follow but they wanted thier cell phone fixed now! i did billing first and then moved to cancellation department. The coworkers and supervisors were very helpful and the instructional computer programs we followed were accurate! The caller though would be really rude and discriminating at times, in which the supervisor would take over and assist but still not fun to hear 40 times or more a day."
good,A large group of very dedicated people. Customer service is top priority. The hardest part of the job is being very polite to someone who does not deserve it.
good,"I had a very good workplace, my coworkers always made me feel like I was at home. I learned how to feel people out and find out what they want as well as see what else i can get them to get but I knew not to be so pushy at the same time we worked off each other to always get the sale."
good,muy buena empresa para empezar en el mundo laboral
good,closing and maintains a leadership role to my team with outstanding enthusiasm and excitement on a day to day basis promoting excellence and communication with outstanding results..
good,You can learn and grow with this company. Always changing so you have to be flexible. I worked with a great group of people that treated me like family.
good,"The company was good to work for, great environment. The employees really banded together as a team. The hours are long and ever changing so you may not know when you will be off in a day."
good,"Great for those that don't mind sedentary work attached to headset, assisting customers with troubleshooting and billing, handling escalated customers, meeting stat requirements, micro-management, always being told what you could have done better"
good,"Great place to work, especially if you know how to sell. Great pay and the employees are very welcoming. You get free breakfast/lunch from time to time."
good,I started at BellSouth Advertising and Publishing and LOVED every moment of it. It was different with At&t. Do not have any bad things to say about At&t but I was a Bell baby and prefer BellSouth any day over At&t. The one thing I will say is about At&t is I felt I was unimportant to the company when I was forced out in 2012. I was let go abruptly and I did not have  a plan of how to move forward. It hurt me financially and I am just beginning to recover. I saw many co-workers who were called back to work as contractors but I was not fortunate to have that experience. I gave 24 years of my life to a company who in my opinion let me go without hesitation. Lesson learned but it was painful.
good,"When I worked there, they offered a pension, and often employees will spend lifetime there. No because they were forces or had no choice, but it was a great company for family values that took care of their own."
good,As a National Accounts Rep I would prioritized my work to first get all East Coast Customers done and work my way towards the West Coast. I have learned that dealing with customers on the phone is not as personal and dealing with customers in person. Management was very comfortable with all Representatives to work on their own to get the job done. Management were very easy to get along with and very helpful with any if not all our needs. Everyone of my peers were very nice and easy to get along with which makes a very comfortable atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is when you cannot get a hold of all customers before the deadline because they try to avoid any billing that needs to get paid or any advertisement that needs to be completed by the deadline. The most enjoyable part is working with my peers.
good,"AT&T great company to work for, weekly activities. Also provided town home meetings. Also management was great with employee, for as updates on products. Dislike I have for AT&T was the Surplus Layoff."
good,aprendi mucho sobre lidiar con padres de familia y alumnos adolescentes y sobre la atencion al cliente
good,Fun place to work. Can be overwhelming as hours are sometimes inconsistent for closers due to helping last customers who made it before store closed. Competitive environment with great rewards and discounts.
good,"es un buen trabajo y te llevas buenas ganancias siempre y cuanto te esfuerzes para vender y llegar a la meta que se te pone,"
good,"It's been a long time since I worked there. Outside of having worked for and with some wonderful people, it was a typical corporate job: holidays off, regular vacations, good benefits."
good,At&t is very diverse ..it has great benefits....just a Very high paced and somewhat stressful company.  Good people to work around...Different schedules and offers on the job training ...
good,"Usually an 8 hour day.  Not a lot of overtime.  Good pay and benefits package.  Unfortunately the company has been downsizing for about the last 15 years, and new employees are paid less than the older group was.  Less benefits now as well."
good,hardest was handling a call when the customer was irate with at&t being transfer from place to place and I can only do so much to help the customer when the call didn't pertain to me to help because I needed to get that customer to the correct department I tried to help mush as I can from keep transferring that customer again. I love what I do I love to collect and offer best solutions to help the customer get on the right track of paying their bill on time or work out a good payment plan with payment arrangements. the environment was great .
good,"A lot of the Retail Sales Consultant position will involve simple technical assistance. The expectations however involve the employee truly engaging with the customer to find sales opportunities where they did not exist before, opportunities the customer may not even realize they have walking in. AT&T is not so much about hard sales as much as it is about offering all their products and services to every customer who walks in."
good,Have had the luck to work for att and have managed to pick up plenty of new skills that can be used in regular life and other jobs. Every one has great attitude and have awesome to work with. With the only downside of having such few permanent job oppurtunities.
good,"Very good place to grown and learn about customer service, the pay was good and so was the benefits. My management team was good, they made sure you understand your role in the AT&T world."
good,"help customers with daily activities such as selling phones, bill issues and even phone problems. Big focus on small business sales so weekly business cold calls is part of our agenda. Creating appointments is a big goal as sales representatives."
good,"Addressed customer questions, concerns along with billing inquiries with courtesy and professionalism to         ensure one call resolution. Rresponsible for addressing escalated customers with the objective of customer retention."
good,Fast paced work environment. Team orientated. Contests to win prizes regularly or paid time off. Management had open door policy. The hardest part of the job was maintaining your canvass.
good,Bever worked in an environment where the management and co-workers felt like family. The job itself wasn’t always great but the people you work with is what keeps you sane sometimes. The pay was lower than other wireless companies but still higher than what you will find in the job market.
good,Blessed to have worked for the company 26+ years.  Helped me to provide and see to the needs of my family.  Worked with a great group of people through the years and thankful for the opportunities my employment with AT&T afforded me.
good,it was a good experience and it was a very good training ground for people who wants to work in the customer service industry. it was fast phased but well compensated.
good,Productive while working. The company offered great benefits. AT&T had a great work culture. I learned how to collaborate with other departments. AT&T takes care of their employees
good,"Fun job. I enjoyed my time there but pay was just OK, and like with all sales positions the way to make your money and hit your numbers were constantly changing."
good,"My office hours where 8:30a to 5:00p.  I took inbound calls, emails from both external and internal customers.  My job required after hours call outs based on the customers needs.  The hardest part of my job was leaving after 29 years, due to office closing.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customer to satisfy needs from installation of service to ensure correct billing."
good,AT&T is great place to work.  They offer great benefits and a decent salary.  This is evidenced by how many employees they have with very long tenures.
good,"I have learned that  when you stay at the same place for long time you are framed to the skills of that environment , but to grow profeesionaly you need to go out"
good,fun envirement like a family. Always had a fun time and always helping everyone out. you can tell them and concerns or questions that you had and they will look into for you.
good,"Company is stressful to work for, due to competitive nature of Telecom.  Good Management and caring for the most part.  Good pay and Benefits.  Quotas are very hard to obtain."
good,"AT&T doesn't give you promotions for being good for just a couple months. Consistency is the way to advance. You must want to be better every day. If you aren't comfortable with challenging yourself, this is not the job for you."
good,I'm thankful to AT&T has it helped me to grow into a strong salesmen and leader in the telecommunication industry.  The company itself will give you great opportunity but must be willing to relocate and work difficult hours if following the retail track.
good,AT & T provides good steady work pay and benifits. They also provide good training. Co-workers are nice people to work with. Safe work environment. Lots of out-door field work.
good,Great place to work if your a regular employee  And can take advantage of all the discounts and benefits  When people can retire from place they seem to be in a great mood
good,"This job is/was a fast paced environment.  I would help with billing issues and help resolve issues.  and in the sales process ask questions that fit the customers needs to get them into the right phone, plan and accessories.  We have goals we would have to meet each month.  "
good,I worked at AT&T over 20 years ago and do not remember many things at AT&T.  The culture has changed and the industry has also evolved in last 20 years.
good,Great place to work - plenty of opportunities for learning new skills. Benefits are good. Regular communications from senior leadership. Opportunities to provide feedback.
good,AMAZING PLACE TO WORK WITH GREAT PEOPLE. It was a true family and I hated the circumstances of my separation from the company. The benefits where great and the company does a great job of promoting from within.
good,"Mi trabajo consistía en realizar numerosas llamadas a los clientes para ofrecer nuevos planes que se adecuaran con sus necesidades."
good,Find solution for every customer that walks in. Break down pricing of phones find out who they use for tv. Make sure the customer leaves happy and always keep a good rapport
good,"Initially I had planned to retire from this company, however I developed health issues that forced me to resign. My health issues has since been resolved."
good,Opened store and checked/responded to e-mails. Made sure employees knew agendas and goals by holding meetings. Up-sold accessories and managing customer service issues.
good,It's a good place to work and very friendly nature and good place to learn and learned more and manager is good at workplace and people there are super cool
good,"hello, how are you, att is a good company to work for. they are good at training and safety. I would recommend this company to anybody. pay and hours are good"
good,Stay out of management. Relaxed atmosphere other than in management. Great equipment for use and never questions about tools.  All in all. A good place for a career
good,"A typical day at work was preparing sporting events for on-air broadcast, and any request for"
good,"Worked several different jobs during my time at AT&T. Learned a lot about customer service, both the wrong way and the right way. It was like most large companies, had a number of good managers with a few bad apples sprinkled in. Overall, the work culture was enjoyable with an occasional high stress event or task thrown in. The hardest part of the job was probably keeping up with the constantly changing technology that makes up the communications world. Fortunately, AT&T was good about giving us the necessary training. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be my coworkers. Like the managers, mostly good employees with just a few sprinkled in that made you appreciate the good ones even more."
good,Es una empresa con sentido de pertenencia por sus empleados y sus familias.
good,"My job is different from day to day, and that is one of the best things about it.  Always challenging and interesting.  On a daily basis you will interface with multiple persons from various departments and resolve numerous issues that arise in relation to sourcing and provisioning materials for many and varied persons/projects. I am not really looking for mobility from one title to another because I'm happy in my position.  Unfortunately, it seems there are no more permanent positions available, only Term positions (1-3 years)."
good,"Standard work day was clocking in, hear high energy music playing throughout the day. Goal was to overcome any/every objective and probe for customer needs."
good,Great benefits package and paid time off. Diverse work community. Peers work together as a team and willing to assist one another when needed. Hard to move up into senior level positions.
good,Duties: answering telephone; Handling any issue the customer facing on a computer or on any device which connects to the computer we will be able to fix the issue. Good at configure Wi-Fi issue and virus issues on the computer etc.
good,"Pasante, Unidad de Control y Mejora, Departamento de Servicio Financiero y Portafolio de Crédito."
good,"Att is a great company. They are driven and very down to business. The only downfall is selling Directv. Also, working for an authorized retailer sucks because they pay you off of their commission structure, not corporates."
good,Progressed through roles - enjoyed recognition of work through advancement. Experienced and fair management- high level of autonomy combined with team collaboration.
good,It can be very stressful to work here. There are a lot of stats to keep up with. I  think that is why they make a point to bring in the fun.  The mood is usually good.  Managers help a lot because they want their team to do better than anyone else's.
good,"Work Life balance was good."
good,"Gerentes y empleados profecionales , buenas instalaciones y capacitación"
good,Working here at AT&T Government solutions is a good environment with good people but the work is boring and repetitive with not a lot of opportunity to do what you want.
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for.Great benefit. However as an assitant manager you will have much better work life if you under the right management team. Been with AT&T amost 5yrs, i think a good management team is very important."
good,"do what your supposed to do, stay safe, meet a bunch of different kinds of people, dont worry about taking your work home with you. hardest part is probably either getting a dirty house install or not making your numbers when its out of your control."
good,Good job with steady work as long as the services are available. Service Tech are required to work in all types of weather and must be is good physical shape
good,"Good place to work and great pay and benefits but sadly a lot of prem techs got laid off due to new contract with AT&T.  Was hoping to make a career out of it. Gain a lot of experiences and made a lot of friends throughout the years.  Union was a big disappointment.  Paid union dues for nothing. The Union promises techs that our job security was safe when techs got hired but when got laid off Union said nothing they can do about it. Anyways, it was a great experience and I wouldn't mind working for AT&T again."
good,"World's Best Job Site · Find Reviews and Salaries · Easy CV Upload · New Job Postings Everyday.System architect with solid experience in ISP and Data Center Ecosystem. Worked with all major Telcos across the globe, made strong understanding in service outline and multi-path service deliver"
good,"On a day to day basis, I had to go into different customer homes to install u-verse/ DirecTV equipment. Managers always tried to guide you on the best path to get the job done correctly and efficiently. My fellow co-workers always tried to help with information if they could. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting so many different types of people from day to day."
good,"If you want a good career, benefits, good hours, can put up with some stress/pressure to do very well on the phone, & take a chance of either getting a great manager or a really bad one, this is the job for you! You don't really know anyone who really owns or runs the company."
good,Es una empresa muy centrada en la estabilidad de sus trabajadores
good,Provided a great opportunity for growth and career development.  Managed employees based on metrics and hosted team meetings and huddles.  Provided support and troubleshooting to local area.  Developed employees and provided career path assistance.
good,"We almost had no breaks because calls kept coming in after one ends, it was challenging for me because I would spend almost the whole night hungry and cranky."
good,this is an very interesting experience and takes an person with independence and drive to be succeed .Making  your appointments early in the day but 12 hours days are very commmon
good,"In my latest role, a typical day included attending meetings for the work that was assigned to me for that particular sprint (agile environment).  "

good,It was a quiet relaxes place  the other employees work as a team willing to help one another out when needed. The people are willing to wait and trust you to get the information and run it.
good,Good but stressful work is about all i can say. Typical sales job but the part time position there was probably the the best thing I've ever seen. Really gave me ample time to my self and kept me happy to work there. BUT the health care went up to 240 a month for just me because I was part time...
good,AT&T was a great place to work it is stressful but the benefits and the work environment are pretty good the managers are awesome and there is a lot of room for growth in the company.
good,Had always been one of the best jobs I ever had. Really enjoyed going in to work in the group I had been in since being there.  Like any company there are ups and downs. Dept. grew over time with changing technology because of the nature of wireless industry. The people became your family. Although it was laid back atmosphere sometimes you would get your stressful seasons but they would pass.  Lots of changes as new technology came out. Loved that courses were available to increase knowledge and skillset. Enjoyed handling the tickets. Testing and resolving the issues. Hardest part would be when getting an issue that had never been seen before and sometimes taking a length of time to figure it  out and getting resolved. Another hard part was when good tools were taken away that really was helpful for getting a job done. The enjoyable part was finally figuring out the hard part and getting it resolved. With Management just like anywhere you have a variety of personalities so you had to deal with the not so pleasant ones as best you could when they would come in. For the most part Management was pretty decent. I learned so much over the years and looked forward to learning even more. We live in the greatest age of technology it is mind blowing.
good,"AT&T Slovakia is one of the best corporate company I've ever worked in, but the review differs from team to team. However, in general I can say there is friendly atmosphere, great colleagues and easy to adjust your life to the work  (I had 4 days a week a home office)."
good,"Great place to work. Good managers. Great crew to work with, Stressful at times.Had to work with internal groups and external customers.  Lots of satisfaction when the problem/issue was resolved. We had a great amount of training. Could always count on my manager for help when an issue was needed to be escalated for resolution. Had a great feeling at the end of the day when the issues were resolved."
good,Taking incoming calls from existing customers going over billing issues ordering new service cable internet home phone and wireless cell phones customers are irate because there issues are not being resolved the first time
good,"A highly regarded company with a focused and smart leadership and management team.  Employee leadership and professional development is strongly encouraged."

good,"As a Customer Service Representative we dealt with customer problems about their ads; and with Sales Reps to accommodate their ad requests.

good,"I worked for AT&T for 25 years.  I started as a clerk and worked my way up to a management position.  I did various tasks over the years.  After a few years I was able to work at home when needed.  The company was very flexible about virtual office.  I would not have left, but after 25 years, I was downsized."
good,"if you like changes, this is the place to work.  good managment skills, lots of training.  very competitive.  great benefits such as free or discounted tv service.  great discounts on their cell phone service."
good,"Es un buen trabajo para alguien que lo quiera como primer empleo, lo que me enseño AT&T fue a quitarme el miedo a contestar el telefono."
good,"I have learned a lot and I enjoyed working with the public. I love  to help the customers to solve their problems with the Internet connectivity. It's an excellent company to work with. The reason for my resignation was due to my Mother had cancer and I had to take care of her."
good,"Great place to work.  Teamwork, and managers all willing and helpful. Great pay and benefits. Most days start at 8am, with meetings on fridays. Company vehicles are provided."
good,"I loved my 25 years there and I am not leaving of my own accord.  I am subject to a downsizing or focus on collaboration zones which strikes me as odd given the culture nowadays.  I've had some good managers and some bad ones but through it all I did excellent quality work.  But for the last 6 years or so, we have always wondered when the other shoe would drop...looking over your shoulder as to when it would be your turn to get the axe.  Finally my turn."
good,AT&T is a good employer. They are continuing to go through a major transformation from an old-style large enterprise to a new-style technology company. This entails major culture changes and ways of dealing with the new world. some of this is being handled successfully and some is not. There are many excellent opportunities for someone to get in on this transformation.

good,"Get to work get the systems opens and start takin calls. I learned the different troubleshooting steps, Most management was great some gave off a vibe they didn't want to be there. Hardest part of the job not being able to resolve the customer issue. The most enjoyable speaking with customers from different states."
good,"Came to work on time, attendance is number one with AT&T. Learn a lot of new things, and training is continuous in your job to be the best you can be."
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T. Great pay and benefits. Way to much micromanagement it made going to work a pain but some people don't mind that. High sales quotes which makes taking a vacation nearly impossible.
good,AT&T is one of the largest employers. They offer good benefits. They have lots of locations for job opportunities around the world. There are many career options available.
good,"This job was a medium-fast paced job.  Sometimes the store would get very busy and stressful,  other times it was a slow paced workday casually greeting and talking to potential customers"
good,you need a lot of drive to actually make money.  retail is a hard life to live but if you can do it then the fruits can be very good.  the commission is good when you put effort to making the goals. goals are sometimes set too high so they don't have to pay the commissions out.
good,"A typical workday was how you wanted it to be: fast or slow, i learned how to deal with internal customers as well as business customers and learned how the telephone works from the inside out. The workplace is always going to be what you make it, the hardest part of the job was making sure your customers lines were working properly in all situations"
good,Not a bad company to work for. The union ensures fair treatment and compensation. The company training is excellent. There was a theme of frustration between premises technicians and wireline technicians that could be solved by placing both positions within the same union contract.
good,This company offers competitive salaries and compensation and offers career advancement opportunities.  Has more job stability due to being a union workplace.
good,"I wished that company still exist.  We were bought out because higher management was all about self and not the people that built this great company."

good,"Difficult, and hard work to be accomplished in as short of period of time as possible....your time is monitored. You must perform so many installs per week. Quality and safety is stressed. Your satisfaction has to be from a job well done, not from management."
good,At&t was a start to my life's journey. A wonderful journey that lasted more than 30 years of my life. It allowed me many opportunities that helped shape who I am today. An experience I wouldn't trade for anything.
good,"Everyday was different, I had the responsibility to train and ensure all AT&T employees were in compliance with our safety policies and to work safety everyday. I learned that people don't come to work to have an accident, they become complacent and that's when they are more likely to have an accident. "
good,Highly skilled technical organization which values diverse opinions and possesses individuals who always step up to support corporate goals and people. Enjoyable workplace culture with people willing to discuss experiences and ideas to assist in performing job function.

good,"Flexibility"
good,I had a lot of fun at this job! Everyday you learn something new and they wanted you to succeed. It was a lot of fun to be in front of customers and the management was good!
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,my current employer values team works and comments from employees to keep employee happier. It has implemented plans to engaged employees to network and served in local community as volunteer.
good,"Overall great company to work for. As you may know, AT&T is trying to become a leading competitor in entertainment, so DirecTV is a huge push. Mostly every goal, bonus, incentive, a new idea is wrapped around DTV, so you better love DTV."
good,I worked for AT&T for over a decade.  I can tell you that many of my coworkers are like family to me now.  I was given a difficult choice during a re-org.  I didn't want to relocate my family.  Had to leave. I loved my job most days and the people I worked with.
good,"I work in the call center. As long as you do your job and perform well then it is easy to advance. There are stressful days but the managers are nice and will work with you as best they can depending on the situations. They do have different events to try to keep work morale high. It's great job to have if you're looking for stability. The benefits package is great as well as the discounts. If you don't mind the stress from the customers, the job is great."
good,"Great pay and benefits, excellent pay and benefits,good place for advancement ,good insurance,lots of locations to work at,wonderful coworkers. Lost job due to surplus."

good,It is a good job but it is difficult to meet the sales goals at the store that I am working at.  It is a small volume store.  My managers have been amazing!

good,"enjoyable workplace with fun times and activities for all the different owners"

good,"Working with AT&T is a great experience. They have a warm office culture and are flexible with telecommuting. Although they are a large, multinational company, they value their employees."
good,Powerhouse of a company who is the pioneer in telecommunications. Great company to work for who offer great jobs with great pay and benefits.I really enjoy the atmosphere and the freedom I feel to do my job on a daily basis and know I am not being micro managed. The on the job training is awesome and I've learned a lot. THe company really invests in your knowledge and really tries to cater to their employees.
good,"This was my first step into a real sales environment, with some marketing involved.  My manager paul guided me from a sales associate to replacing his position when he moved to higher position in the company. At this company I learned the true meaning of meeting qoutas, and making your paycheck bigger and bigger. I loved the experience as I grew into the assistant manager position, and teach sales associates the same tactics, and mistakes ive learned in the past. :)"
good,"Tremendous opportunity.  The position contained a great deal of resources and personnel to management.  Despite a large annual budget, financial resources were still under-funded.  Staff members were some of the most committed and passionate members I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  Upper management should do more counseling to ensure guidance was provided and work performance was rated.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent in this position."
good,"I joined DirecTv prior to the AT&T acquisition. It was an amazing place to work with tons of potential to grow within the company. After the acquisition, our site changed drastically. Some changes were okay but the culture was no longer the same and the opportunity for growth reduced as our our site changed to one department. Overall, it was a great experience but I'm happy to move on to bigger and better things."
good,I worked for the company over 28 years. I have nothing negative to say. My time there was enjoyable and learned a lot from great work staff. I would recommend this as a place to work

good,"I have had plenty of opportunities to learn new things here at AT&T"
good,"Productive positive interesting day.  The calls are like a episode of an action movie mixed with a thriller.  Not only were the mangers great and down to earth at the parramus call center,   but they made the atmosphere feel like one big happy family,  and that helped relieve the stress of everyday call duties."
good,"positive: customer interaction and ability to represent a well known reputable company with good training "
good,"I worked in the Field Service Administrative Center and all ran surprisingly smooth, employees seemed to work in unison without conflict. Supervisors were instrumental in keeping the flow of business in the Center and in the field operating smoothly"
good,"Typical day at work begins with a safety huddle. I grab supplies from the supply room, stock up the company truck, dispatch on my ipad, call customer and tell them you are on your way to the premise. I mainly do fiber installation and repairs on the area i am at. The thing I like about the most in this job is that you get to meet different people, work on different wiring inside house and at the end you see customers being satisfied with my service i gave them."

good,great job able to manage time as well as life issues only bad part no company benefit as well as only personal equipment required you would have to pay for ur own car fix and tools

good,i love working for att. hardest part of job is the security they are always laying off. other than that i have no complains about the company. they invest in their employees.
good,"Good place to work if you don't get laid off. You could be a good worker, but if you are in the wrong dept, you could still get laid off. If you are not such a good worker, but in a safer dept, you may not lose your job."
good,metrics constantly changing -good ppl to work with; i love the benefits; read other reviews; i dont have any more to say than that; read the reviews from others;
good,It's a nice place to work and I would highly recommend this company in the future. All of the people I encountered were very nice and very knowledgeable.
good,nice place to work. you had to be there on time and couldnt miss but the compensation made up for it completely. also the satisfaction of helping customers
good,great benefits and location and the management team was always willing to help. Advancement if you were will to relocate to meet the needs of the company
good,I did not work at AT & T it was directv..  And I loved my job there. it was a great atmosphere and we all care about our job there. I had to leave because my husband had cancer and we had to travel to seattle for his treatment.
good,"Good place to work, management wasn't the best in the 2.5 years I worked there. Compensation was great but that came with a lot of pressure from upper management."
good,"AT&T is a very good place to work if you can handle the stress of a very demanding work place. The company compensates it's employees well with competitive pay, benefits, and discounts on their services. The company attempts to advance its employees be providing training and advancement opportunities. "

good,Typical day at work involves interacting with customers on a daily basis by installing new subscribers with satellite cable installations as well as service and business accounts.
good,Once my day started it would begin with helping a co-worker out with a customer. I learned how to handle different personalities in the workplace. Our management team kept us alert and our workplace culture was always easygoing. The hardest part of my job is seeing good employees go and the most enjoyable part of my job is helping our customers.
good,DirecTV provided a great culture for young and old people alike. Incentives were great and management is competent. It is a call center and the nature of the work itself can become repetitive and boring.
good,This was a great company to work for. I had a good opportunity to learn and grow but I felt hemmed in by the corporate culture and the companies tendency to cater to the stockholders over the employees.  I was laid off without being given to realize my potential at the company.
good,AT&T was a great employer that offered many advancement opportunities that were customized to an individuals strengths. Hours could be relatively long from week to week but the company culture more than made up for that. Compensation was aggressive
good,This job involed receiving and sending out troble tickets for repair of telephone services.  There were down times and very high times of business especially during bad weather.
good,"Good money for the work you do, travel to many parts of the state. Opportunity to move up in the company overtime most weekends and staying late to work in a hot job."
good,"very organized, great benefits,  learned alot, too much to learn, you will never learn everything , being you rown boss.. workplace culture is very structured and that is why they have succeeded."

good,Working for AT&T was a wonderful place to work and I would still be with them if I hadn't been working on a degree in a different field. I found AT&T work place to be a great place.
good,"society is complex, difficult to find a job right profession you love. I was one of them, graduated with a degree better, but unfortunately until now I still do not have a steady job to care for the family. blatant scammers too much, and maybe I need to accumulate experience, hone and grammar knowledge, hopefully my chance will come. zealous labor, luck will come"
good,"Working for AT&T is stressful at times, but overall it is a fantastic place to work. Here at the Dallas location they have a plentiful amount of pros; like a cafe, pool tables, ping pong tables, open work spaces, private conference/huddle rooms."

good,Technology driven... If you're located in the Bellsouth region it may be prudent for you to learn skills strategic to legacy T.  Further your knowledge base as it relates to technology.
good,"ATT Mobility is an excellent place to work as far as benefits. I can never complain about compensation, insurance, 401K and pension plans opportunities. I was expected to work long hours and always be available. Over time this could take a toll on life outside of work.(rules changed and they don't allow more overtime). However, you had many opportunities to change positions and fields within the company. Great place to work, fun environment .Merger benefit company but was more difficult to keep up with changes. regret I left such a great corporation.Not fan of Union specially when needed didn't help."
good,"Learning, Workplace Culture, Work/Life balance, Freedom everything you get here along with nice salary package. Ofcourse there might be few projects with usual faults either in project or management. But that happens in every company, the difference is the percentage is less in here."
good,Very enthusiastic company that provides good benefits. But i need other kind of work environment with a standard hours from monday to  Friday. Also I need more tranquillity and more experience on the studies that i have. Need to expand the horizons on other ways besides sales and numbers.
good,"8 to 12 hours a day working from home on my company provided laptop or in the office in Midtown.I learned a lot about the wireless portion of the network and how it interacts with the wireline network.I also learned a lot about the changes with 4g and how the technology was supported differently from 3g or 2g. I learned how texting, translations and data work.  Management changed quite a bit and that provided some difficulty at times with culture and work/life balance. The pay and the benefits were very affordable as well as the ability to work from home and avoid traffic were the best parts."
good,Great work life balance and advancements. I love working at this company and all the many people I've worked with over the years. The benefits and discount are plus as well.
good,I worked for AT&T for 19yrs in various roles and levels of management after starting out as a rep on the phones back in 1998.  It is a great company to work for and to make a career.  I highly recommend to individuals who are looking for a company who looking for great place to work.  A ton of opportunity for advancement and you build great relationships that last a lifetime.
good,"just depends on what manager you get placed with at the garage. good hours. all workers help one another. good training. set schedule, union worker, good raise"
good,"Our team lead would start the daily meetings with a short note on the previous  day's best worker appreciation. That would motivates the other team members to put more effort to get in there for next day. We learned about new products, features, employee plans,"
good,"Muy buena empresa en la"
good,"good working culture, learnt a lot, kept progressing with continuous training sessions and loved the company for providing work life balance and freedom to operate."
good,"The job in Yellow Pages IT was fairly straight forward with the goal in assisting client sales and field operations with the best processes while interfacing with the vendor programmers to ensure system requirements met AT&T (SBC) requirements.  For a time, there were competing interests within the IT organization as some in the hierarchy worked towards replacing the vendor programmers with in-house or other IT vendors.  In the end, the Yellow Pages IT stayed with the vendor until the decision was made to outsource the company IT group to the vendor."
good,"Good company. As field rep, Working independent scheduling appt & following up wit customer is great. You will learn so much about telecommunication from installation & services. Transport signal services, how to test wiring & fiber optic lines and connect devices. Run various cabling from SAI, Terminals & Ariel. Safe is key foundation & customer satisfaction. Setup customer 3rd party devices. Company will give you all the tools you need to get your job done. However working with various dept of the Co can be frustrating at times, slowing your productivity. Workplace & co-workers are great. Tier 1  field managements are sometimes overwhelmed. The hardest part of the job, I found was when simple assignments like upgrade/downgrade and/or troubleshoot services become new installs due to poor workmanship by others. However  the most enjoyable part is when your able to complete the job and your customer is totally satisfied."
good,"Great daily motivation meetings before starting sales day. Extremely competitive, 100% commission and must have a strong motivation/desire for success."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work and learn new skills. Working there gives you first hand experience with handling inventory, managing bills and finances, and various types of sales tactics. This job requires you to utilize critical thinking and social skills. Working there is not a walk in the park every day, but no job that will help you grow is. You need to be open to learning new skills and applying those skills effectively. The salary is great; you make hourly and commission."
good,It's a decent job. I enjoy working with my coworkers and helping the customers. I've learned a great deal about the workings of the different phones.
good,Good overall company to work for. The benefits are excellent and the wages are very competitive. Work can sometimes be stressful due to competitive nature of business.
good,"A typical week was 50+ hours of work, which is fine, but I had no say in how long of a day I put in. Typically 2 hours of work went unpaid (commutes to and from home). The company is a great place to work, but just not with a family."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits. The company helped to become a team player and able to adapt to change. Offered great discounts for services. Offered great vacation allotment each year job accomendations for family emergencies.
good,I am grateful for all the knowledge I gained while employed at  AT&T.  AT&T provided good training for all the job titles I held.

good,working for AT&T was the best 13 years of my life. the job was very challenging and rewarding at the  same time. i was able to transfer to any department and learn something new at any point in my career. i have worked in every department imaginable short of working on the towers themselves!
good,Great training programs to assist with career advancement. Fun fast-paced environment with great leadership. They are often going through re-orgs which has laid a lot of divisions off.

good,"-Delivering the best customer experience with every customer, every time;"
good,"there was a lot of miscommunication between management and employees. the work environment was great. the most complicating part about the job was caused by not knowing what was next for me as an employee. other than that it was a reasonable place to work, great pay good people to work for"
good,Att is a decent place to develop personal skills that you will need in the future. Att provides you with a good compensation package and plenty of opportunity for everyone to enjoy a good time at work.
good,ATT call center is very high energy and fast pace.We help assist customers with troubleshooting their wireless devices. We also handle any billing questions and concerns.. The environment is great. We treat each other like family. We have great benefits and the rewards we receive for meeting our call center goals are wonderful.
good,"Great place to work; however, there is little chance to advance within the company.  The company does offer great medical, vision and dental options.."
good,"AT&T is a great company overall. The benefits are decent, but you have to wait a year to achieve them. They have a flawed attendee system. The money is decent. The comp structure usually changes every year and where it hurts some stores it helps others. Management is key, every store is different and I've had great and bad. Typical work days are either really busy or slow, you must discuss all products with every customer. I learned to adapt to different management styles and learned a lot of technical things.The hardest part is hitting on all points they want you to discuss during a transaction. You end up with great friends from the people you work with."
good,Since I am working in Software Industry from last 7 Years I have excellent command in front end developing and good knowledge on backend technologies.
good,"Opportunities abound in self-development, advancement of corporate initiatives, and both team and individual innovation."
good,"My overall experience with pleasurable because it was my first and only career placement.  I learned how to use computers in which I did not have any experience before employment.  I logged into computers and we had the main port for sending orders to other location such as for equipment needed to fulfill an order.  I worked in an office with engineers and designers that were always busy designing.  Filing was important and so was daily reports and special attention orders were recorded. I typed orders and made sure the disc at that time was replaced to keep the orders flowing correctly.  I learned how to use a xerox machine and as a group we each had daily responsibility to fulfill  in order to make deadlines and often times we had to back others up with their workload.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning, meeting people, overtime and office parties.  I started with Ohio Bell owned by AT&T, to SBC, Ameritec through the divestitire and back to AT&T.  My only regret is that I did not fully apply myself when AT&T offered the opportunity to work and study, company paid to learn about electronics and cables.  Classes were given at a community college and would not interfere with work schedule because I was not technology literate at all and in the end education would have paid off tremendously.  Although I did not have the experience of working with cables and wats, I would have had the knowledge to stay at AT&T through the transition of manual to computer everything."
good,It was fun working at AT&T. Every last one of my co-workers was fun and easy to work with. I also enjoyed doing my job; so it was almost as though I was getting paid to enjoy myself.
good,Employee's at AT&T are family.  I am close to my peers but the company is going to an SDN driven company so if you enjoy coding then AT&T is a great company to work for.
good,A great company to work for. Excellent training and advancement opportunities. Good opportunity to earn bonuses each month. Co-workers are friendly &and supportive.
good,Great innovative company with cutting edge technology and vision. Pay increases came with promotion but merit increases were generous at times with great performance.
good,AT&T gives its employees many benefits and definitely helps cater to personal needs. My schedule has always been approved and their salary is fantastic. I can't really complain about this company. I feel like I've gone as far as I can go here and I'm seeking new opportunities.
good,Great company to work at with opportunities to rotate and move to different businesses. The work life balance was great and management wants to work with you to develop your career.
good,"Typical day at work was competitive and sometimes stressful but always enjoyable."
good,AT&T is a very competitive environment and has many benefits for its employees. I learned so much from my peers and especially managers. You grow so much as an individual and exponentially acquire skills you never thought you could grasp. The company instills a sense of responsibility within all your actions and requires you to be at your best at all times. Customer experience is very essential and ensures that you are living up to company standards. Rigorously engaging customers and striving to give a outstanding customer service. Finding out your customer needs and recommending products based of those needs is key. Uncovering those details is the hardest part of the job. You can run everything like its your business and taking ownership of that is the best part of the job. You have managers that will show you how to be the best and how to recognize errors and make corrections. Becoming a true expert in your field. Overall AT&T is a great company to work for.
good,"Typical day is answering the phone and resolving concerns with empathy and satisfaction. Management and co-workers working together as a team. The hardest part of the a work day was not being able to resolve the customers issue, I enjoyed talking with the customers in and out of the United States of America. The best part is assisting customers from all over the world and deescalating a call and satisfying the customer with his or her concern."
good,"If you are a go getter & the attitude to exceed the expectations, then this is the place to be! Good company with great benefits. The call center really prepared me for my next challenge in management."
good,"Very well run corporation, highly recommended.  Great 401k, . Salaries are very competitive with room for growth.  Pay scale is very nice and rises with tenure and years on the job.  Paid holidays double time if forced to work overtime."
good,"steady work, good environment. No micro-management depending on your manager. Union backed position. Great co-workers who all get along."
good,Customer service for account receivables. took heavy volume calls. very fast paced job. excellent benefits. The coworkers were family after working long years with most of them.
good,"My current role allows me to work remotely.  Throughout the years, I not only learned all aspects of wireless technology but I also learned the wireline side of the house.  Our Management provides us tools to learn and grow in our own roles, lots of trainings! I have worked with my peers for quite sometime now and although we are all remote we get to connect in a designated day for a team meeting or team building event.  The hardest part of the job is being on call 24/7 but the most enjoyable part of the job is to know that you have satisfied a customer by resolving their issue and that you have continued to earn their trust and their business."
good,"Prior to AT&T, Tulsa 21st & Sheridan was the only 24 hr tech center for DirecTV. It was a job I kept for 7 yrs and although I could not say I was anything more than 80% happy being there in all those years, it was occasionally rewarding and the team atmosphere made it tolerable. Co-workers were what made you want to go to work. Pay was amazing, goals were easy to hit. After the transition to DirecTV/AT&T all was changed. Overnights were removed, Customer service was no longer a priority and morale dropped for many other additional reasons. Hiring stopped and several hard working team leaders were let go only because of their pay. (Most tenure) Removing those who drive and know the business well was a very poor decision with awful consequinces and it made me feel uneasy. Being I was there 7 yrs seemed not to matter. Unfortunately this company does not understand seniority is important and that those with experience assist even when not in that position. I left with a very heavy heart."
good,"I helped start the company.  Great comp, great job, but a few years later the company restructured and reorganized. Nothing lasts forever."
good,Work was tedious and pay was commissioned. Very polite and energetic coworkers. The workplace was very ambient and coworkers were helpful and experienced.
good,"Daily work consists of maintaining the financial needs of at&t for multiple departments throughout my career"
good,"Good work life balance, benefits but can be stale in innovation depending on department.  Also if you are looking for an international company, this isn't it.  Primarily jobs in the Midwest area and telecommuting isn't promoted which is odd for a telecom company."
good,I don't really know how to rate ATT. I worked for DIRECTV before it was bought out so my stars above were based on that time period. Had great benefits. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with.
good,Satisfactorio y estricto con horario completo con comisión
good,"AT&T - Awesome company"
good,"management is fair although they don't always get credit for their efforts.  technicians are unionized and have a good salary and benefits although benefit cost keep rising.  co-workers always help each other when time and workload allows.  enjoyed the troubleshooting part of my job, disliked the last minute shift changes, but that wasn't too often.  on call rotaton was shared among the workgroup."
good,"There is a good working environment"
good,"I am happy working at AT&T. There is good work/life balance. The salary and benefits are great. Advancement opportunities however are minimal, unless you are in certain areas of the country."
good,My experience with AT&T is definitely one of the most astonishing moment in my life.  From the hiring process to training and finally on to the sales floor.  Everyday was different on the sales floor.  Some days are good some aren't very satisfying.  Engaging with different customers through a simple conversation while positioning products and services was very challenging but also amusing.  I learned to communicate with different people and that was the best thing about going to work everyday.  There were sales goals that were needed to be met month and that was another thing I enjoyed about the job; the competition between your co-workers and the incentives given at the end of the month for your achievements.
good,This is an amazing company to work for. Benefits are second to none and probably the best work/life balance you will experience. The advancment opportunity is there however it is not the best. overall this is a great company!
good,"Typical day of work includes driving to customer's houses to install ATT Uverse and DirecTV services. "
good,"Good pay, high paced environment, angry or irate customers, various shifts, good training programs and training time. lots of advancement opportunities,"
good,"At&t is what you make of it. The hours are good, but if you have a family, it's hard to balance family life. If you listen to what they teach you on selling and actually implement it, you can make some serious cash. The issue I noticed was that you may have a great month but then you can't slack off or your pay is affected and your seen as not trying hard. Oh well, good company all in all."
good,"Care and respect afforded to most all of the employees I ever was in contact with and worked besides. Rewarded for performance, and overall accomplishments."
good,"Day consists of on call job duties, attending to customer needs and services. You learn to be patient and precises on your job duties."
good,"You work with amazing people and get to be around the newest and greatest technology. You work with a determined team that has your back both in and outside of work. If you want to be a part of a loving, successful, and appreciative work environment this is an amazing place."
good,"answering phones solving wireless services issues such as billing, troubleshooting issues with devices. 40 hours per week with options of overtime"
good,"- Nice Company"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is going to be your coworkers and the customers. A typical day when I worked lasted 10-12 hours. Management usually leaves you alone if you do your job and make all your numbers. Your performance is based on numbers you have to meet , you get points on time quality, and customer interaction."
good,"AT&T provides and good work/life balance which allows for a more creative and motivated work place. I was blessed to work for and with some amazing people who were very talented and fun.  Although my position had a lot of freedoms it also had A LOT of uncontrollable variables, which made reaching goals a challenge at times.  I was also often disappointed in the over all lack of respect my specific channel received from the company."
good,"Answering and handling up to several hundred calls per day."
good,"AT&T was very professional and all about customer service. I felt that they took good care of their employees and had great benefits. A typical day would start out by checking in and checking your email and following up with any unfinished businnes from the day before. The day would consist of cashiering , sales, and trouble shooting any issues customers had."
good,"training new hires as they start there careers was was very self satisfying,and the most enjoying part of the job. The attention to safety and well being is inpressive"
good,"Job security, high pay, achievable metrics; coming from someone who has worked for several carriers, AT&T COR stores are the way to go."
good,AT&T is providing  Directv services  which gives  its customers  clear  hd services for  customers  and faster  services for its internet customers.      Great move for both AT&T and its fiber customers..
good,"A little on the stressful side, but always has challenges and having fun. Would recommend this job to a friend. Good overtime."
good,I had an wonderful career with at&t.  Telecommunications is a competitive and challenging industry.  And huge companies like at&t can be very complex and difficult to navigate in terms of processes and timeframes.  at&t however made client and employee feedback a priority in an attempt to improve things internally for employee satisfaction.  But most importantly for client satisfaction. The company committed to a continuous learning environment for its employees.
good,The people I worked with were the most enjoyable part of the job.  The hardest part of the job is there's not enough time in a day to get all the work done.
good,"While compensation is great, I did not find my position to be fulfilling. There was a bit of disorganization. There was definitely opportunity for growth."
good,It is a great company to work for and amazing pay and benefits for any employee to live comfortably. I learned great skills about handling customers and strenuous situations.
good,"Loved working there, had a lot of different projects that made you feel that you accomplished something all the time. Good management and benefits."
good,It  is  a  very  fast paced environment. Not  everyone is  cut out for  that type of  work place. The pay  is  good and so are  the  benefits. There is  not  much  room for advancement.
good,"solid work, physical work, mental work. its like a lifestyle work out. it is like working for a big company lots of policies to be followed as well as safety standards are high."
good,My years with Cingular Wireless & AT&T Inc. were some of the best years of my professional life.  I would recommend AT&T to anyone seeking a career in network engineering.
good,"AT&T is a great place to have a career. The expectations are high and you are compensated for that expectation. Managing people comes with a price, that being 50-80 hour work weeks depending on your tasks. As a craft employee, you have high expectations for high-level integrity and customer focus. You need to be able to change yourself and your mindset with the change in customer and company expectations. The company is constantly evolving with the times and requires a new set of thinkings for that evolution. Expect constant change. The company has set some demanding goals to keep up with the changing world."
good,"Most of my time was spent on activities around leading people and managing performance results through the use of data, reports, and call monitoring observations.  Most of my 27 years with AT&T focused on customer sales and service. Beginning as a face to face sales and service representative through my advancement of ultimately supporting more than 800 inbound and outbound personnel I developed my expertise providing excellent customer experience"
good,"Fun place to work, relaxed and laid back, Chat side is easy. Management is very kind and works with schedules. Great place to learn about people"
good,"Awesome and diversified customers, excellent co workers and managers! A great learning experience and job growth potential. Best part was always the customers and sales interactions. Hardest part could be achieving higher commissions"
good,"sell, sell, sell. learned new techniques to selling the products we offered. management is really involved to making us better. my coworkers felt like family. hardest part of the job was to meet their goals.  most enjoyable part was we had a fun atmosphere and played with all the new electronics with the customers."
good,"I enjoy the relationships I have fostered with my colleagues, managers and customers. AT&T is such a large company and strives to be very inclusive and employs people of diverse backgrounds I have experienced extensive opportunities in various parts of the organization."
good,I learned how to work with management and the workforce really well. I worked with my co workers for over 10 years which made for an upbeat environment.
good,"Working at AT&T was very rewarding, and my colleagues were incredible.  I had a lot of training opportunities there, and am thankful for that.  Professional development is important to me, and there is almost unlimited opportunities to learn.  The most difficult part of working at AT&T is the uncertainty that goes along with repeated layoffs, and the feeling that you have no control over the selection process.  Working hard and working smart is not always enough to have security."
good,Overall positive work environment with good managers and great bonuses.Managers give you a very flexible work schedule.
good,"I would develop and design software pertaining to a teleconferencing platform for AT&T. I programmed using java, shell scripting and sql store procedures."
good,"same like other big companies you really need good relationship with someone in a high charge in order to grow, in other hands is a really good a experience"
good,"On a typical day I take 20-30 calls and help att customers with billing issues, payment issues,technical and online isses,payment issues,new services and upgrade services."
good,"I started working for AT&T just after their forced break-up by the government. I started as a rookie computer programmer. I was immediately welcomed into the group and given programming responsibilities. We were a large district of over 60 team members, sub-divided into 4 smaller teams. Each team member would take turns at being on call, so if a problem arose in the middle of the night or on the weekend, you either had to drive into the office or if you could, fix the problem from home. Our district stayed pretty consistent for around 10 years but then came word of downsizing. Our district was now split with half remaining in New Jersey and the other half moving to Florida, but now with 30 members in each location. This now made team meetings a little more difficult, but with AT&T being in communications, video conferencing was no problem. This situation remained for a few years when we were told that our services were being outsourced to a consulting firm, CSC - Computer Sciences Corporation. I was one of the ones outsourced to CSC with the promise of long term employment. A couple of years later we were informed that our jobs were going “off shore” and we were welcome to look for new jobs elsewhere. When I left CSC, I was making over $70,000 per year …. It isn’t easy to get even an interview when employers see that you were making $70,000 a year and they couldn’t match it."
good,The culture at DirecTV is very positive and you are never without support. If you are struggling with something there is always a way to be coached to the behavior. The compensation and benefits are very rewarding.
good,"I loved everything about the job. One day you might get off at 4, the next day it could be 8. I liked that not one day was ever the same as the day before."
good,"Opneing store, preparing kiosk for payments, cash handling, Sales, billing issues, technical issues, and customer service."
good,"Great coworkers, and the benefits were the best in the telecommunications business. Efficient training and preparation for job tasks."
good,"Very sales driven, very easy to adapt to, but one thing is hours, especially around holiday season, but that is retail! Work environment was great, and everyone has the team attitude that a lot or employers lack."
good,"It was a great experience working with AT&T. Meet great people that I was able to learn from, The managemant was good with working with their agents to reach biggest goals."
good,"fun work place with supportive management. there was a lot of variety in what i did each day, ranging from the tasks to new projects and new customer accounts."
good,"I have had the best experience with AT&T. Unfortunately, there is no further growth for me within this company due to less years of sales, so I wish to move forward and further my career."
good,"Learned a lot about about networking and running cables. Typical day at work was as long as you made it, so working accurately and quickly pays off big. Management was good and are willing to work with individuals to assist them in doing their best. Most enjoyable part was finishing a job in a timely manner. Hardest part of the job was working around unforeseen problems to finish the job."
good,Organization has fun activities/perks to promote sales.  Management is very hands on and co-workers are caring and dedicated. Has flex hours to allow personal time.
good,"Consisted of opening my key (or phone) to receive incoming calls from customers. Once the customer is online, they advise what services they would like for me to perform for them.  Anything from placing a new phone order or to change services on their telephone.  I also worked in billing services...so explanation of the bill or removal of services to reduce bill."
good,Fun place with supportive management. I like the place as the colleagues are very very supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"Work life depends on management,company goals were set so reps couldn't meet goals. Company spent more time figuring how to profit instead of listening to current employees"
good,"Overall ATT is a great company to work for ,excluding lay offs ."
good,"Typing letters and correspondence,copping documents ,filing paperwork, answering multi-line phone documenting all travel compensation due to Sales Managers. Assist in resolving customers issues sales personal could not handle. inputting staff time information in computer, as well as sending daily, weekly and monthly reports to Main office."

good,"Currently working with this company but overall good company. Has good benefits and retirement. Work hours are good, not much overtime, had in the past but are not giving it now."
good,Fast pace changing type of company. As well as a stats driven company. Great benefits but can be stressful after awhile. If you like taking 30 calls a day from happy and angry customers. This is the job for you.
good,"I was able to give my family the things they needed and more."
good,Directv was a fun workplace with Great management. It was a fast pace working environment with a calming feel .the most enjoyable part of directv was my co-worker and how helpful they were.
good,"I definitely have a passion for working with people and installing/troubleshooting cable, internet, and phone services.  I have a strong work ethic which accommodates for almost any possible task at hand.  AT&T provides me with a work order and my initial signal which flows through designated cable pairs and ultimately provides the necessary Tone over various frequencies, in order to synchronize and provision digital modems and receivers for my customers' desired service. I am confident with AT&T and have the knowledge to install high speed internet, anywhere in the world. I am knowledgeable in protocol and the acceptable parameters needed to allow these services to exist at full potential, with quality and assurance for the future. I will get the job done, with pride and integrity, offering all of my customers endless tools and education to cover all angles of their services, through direct communication as well as business contact information for all future inquiries. All supervisors and coworkers practice team building and joined leadership for quality assurance. AT&T condones reaching out to any and all veteran employees for advanced troubleshooting and additional educational resources, which really does allow me to learn anything and everything that I pursue within the company, and shows me vital solutions to any problem I may face. I have found wire shorts, opens, water damage, fire damage, animal damage, voltage interference, and even those humbling experiences when we discover that the CPE simply needed to powered on. The summers are hot and climbing electrical poles"
good,"I would clean the store, I learned a lot about customer service and satisfaction, how to interact with all kinds of customers. I really enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers, but I always managed to overcome those obstacles. I enjoyed helping people."
good,"Great company with a lot of growth opportunities, most management were great and employee was treated with respect. This was my first experience in telecommunications and i love to work with them... they merge with At&t and all the magic was lost..."
good,Throughout my tenure with the company I learned a lot about myself mostly. I learned how to build better rapport with different individuals. A normal day with the company working in the retail store was spent dealing with customers face to face daily.
good,"Great compensation and benefits.  There is an attempt at improving the job culture.  Different departments have very different cultures.  Daily change is a given, and you have to be able to roll with them."
good,"Troubleshooted and resolved fiber optic, cable, internet, DSL and home phone issues escalated from customer support"
good,"I enjoyed my years with AT&T.  It was a good experience.  I managed a team of senior technical project managers.  Good team, many changes to adjust to.  Mergers had an impact on many aspects of the company."
good,"Fun working place and friendly environment. All about sales goals and numbers. Competitive sales role, but expected of a big company"
good,"Overall, a good place to work. The people there were nice and easy to get along with. The benefits were amazing as well. There were no days that I did not feel like there was any negative vibes coming from management as well."
good,"I learned a great deal about time management, sales, employee interaction and management skills."
good,"Too much changing of commission, it can be enjoyable if you are outgoing and are if you like sales. Coworkers are usually friendly and work as a team."
good,"Wonderful benefits, time off, 401K. Supportive staff and management.  I've been here over 13 years and watching the company transform into a high-tech industry is incredibly exciting."
good,"During my two years work, I had lots of good experiences right from co-workers to managers. Enjoyed being part of the team"
good,"Answer high volume of calls on cell phone accounts and technical issues. Rerate accounts, document customer's account while following all company policies and procedures."
good,"Work consist of speaking with the not so happy customer, due to their internet service not working.  It is up to me to calm the customer down, and assist with any connection issues, or questions that the customer may have. I also assist customer's make sure that they understand that I will do all that I can do for them or I will do my best to find a solution for the problem to make sure I have a very satisfied customer."
good,Excellent staff and work environment. Benefits were not as good once Cingular took over.  Still a good place to work.  Changes from AT&T Wireless to Cingular created a challenge but made the job fun.
good,"Company supports a great deal of team cohesion which works as a high percentage of the people who work there are very friendly and open in the work environment. Management usually helps you ask much as they possibly can and are usually very friendly as well. Job benefits are great including health insurance, 401k, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sheer number of different people you get to speak to and hearing about things from all over the country. The hardest part itself would be the repetitiveness of taking phone calls all day which in itself is not that bad at all."
good,"Very busy today, everyone seems to be very alert. Coworkers asking how are you, do you need any assisting. When time drags it makes a long day,we have learned to cope and keep moving"
good,"Great job and benefits schedule sucks. Never know when you are getting off, but offers excellent pay and benefits. I love the job and the people I encounter, management sucks though."
good,I tend to thrive very well under pressure so it was a great experience onboarding 600 contractors into a software as the SME.
good,"AT&T offers a great salary. If you are enrolled in college, I recommend that you apply. They offer tuition reimbursement that helped me pay for my education. Even if you are shy and reserved, APPLY! I feel as though I can communicate better with people because of this job. Great place to start."
good,AT&T Wireless was a fun and great place to work before being purchased by Cingular.  The work was even fun you worked all the Overtime you wanted and you were allowed to assist the customers and make sure you were providing quality customer service.  The company paid good for the quality of employees they were getting.  After Cingular purchased the company and changed the name back to AT&T they stopped allowing us to provide the best customer service because it went to call handle time of 6 minutes or less.  It was not about helping the customer it was about how many calls you can take.
good,"it is a good place to work, minus the schedule does not work with family life and school event. Besides that its fine to work at"
good,"It is a shift role which requires one to work on the operational task that comes in during the particular shift. In AT&T, i learnt how important documentations are, Linux, and communicating with stakeholders from different regions. I was with the Shell account , which requires me to speak to people from all walks of life. Management has been a pain in terms of giving increments which was the reason I left AT&T due to the rising cost of living in Malaysia, with no increment for 2 years and endless promised not fulfilled. Co workers there are great and a joy to work with. You can never feel alone in the office. The hardest part of the job is dealing with stakeholders from Shell due to their never ending demand. I learnt how to negotiate on how to solve an operational matter in a very effective way without having to offend anyone. The most enjoyable part is learning something new every other day due to the complexity of this Shell environment."
good,Working here enabled me to learn the retail business and develop  techniques needed in the sales environment. The benefits of working hard outweigh the cons of working in the retail business.
good,Nothing to get surprised from a company of this size the salary benefits are good but cellular markets are stranded fighting for customers and this affects the job security.
good,Lot of opportunity for movement. Busy environment. At the time I worked for them broadband was just coming on the scene and there was a big push to grab a large part of the market. There was a lot of reacting instead of proactive planning but it made for a challenging experience.
good,this was a great opportunity because I had to move. I believe I was worried because fear of lack of development. I was blessed with wonderful management that helped me develop in my role.
good,They have amazing benefits but the job is tiring and tedious. They value their employees.The are a performance based company. They have a lot of incentives.
good,"Provide weekly enhancements with 20 – 30 agents to ensure they are meeting standards and guidelines of their job description"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is that you know what your supposed to do. ATT will train you how to do your job efficiently and make sure that you can succeed. I have never had a problem with any degree of process.
good,Great team and excellent opportunities for advancement. I enjoy being able to work from home for a company that is nationally known and has built themselves a high strong reputation for customer service satisfaction.
good,"Management here recognizes who is working hard and who should be offered chances to advance."
good,"Good place to work.  Self-managed at my position. Learned a great deal about telephony, dial tone, dsl, uverse, etc.  Great and diverse workforce.  Too few people, more responsibilities of late.  Satisfaction of doing a great job"
good,I enjoyed working for At&t.  I was able to grow and learn a tremendous amount of knowledge from this company professionally.
good,Great place to work.  Work life balance slightly off if you work in retail but plenty of room for growth.  Lots of training provided to you.  Benefits are ok.
good,"I learned from management how to deal with customer issues, which was the only time that the job was a bit hard, only cause of unruly customers. Enviroment and team were all great and easy to get along with and also very helpful towards one another."
good,"My recent position was Call center Supervisor. I have mange a team for over five years. My role was to make sure the agents are coached in a daily basis, follow AHT,meet or exceed the goal."
good,"AT&T has been a great company for my family. The pay and benefits are very good. AT&T has lots of jobs available, therefore growth potential is a positive."
good,If you work hard opportunities are available to move up within the company. Lots of training to get you all the tools to be successful.
good,"Answer incoming calls from 22 states for sales, service, and billing. Handle initial customer requests, and transfer calls to appropriate department. Discuss billing and payment issues and negotiate future payments with customers. Troubleshoot incoming service calls when possible, and forward to technical support when required. Calm angry callers, repair trust, and locate resources for problem resolution, while exceeding customer expectations and building long-term loyalty."
good,"Stats are required, it is fast paced, and can be stressful. My coworkers were the best part of the job. The company also does a lot of really great things for the employees. They have pep rallies and customer service week. They are big on motivating the people and trying to keep a positive work place. They are also very good at working with students, schedule wise, in order for them to continue to go to classes. The benefits are also really good."
good,The most enjoyable part was getting outages posted so we could get a lot customer service could be restored at one time.   Much of the work was proprietary in nature so I cannot say so much about it.  We did do the best that we could in all circumstances.
good,My typical day at work was making cold calls and also making up to 3 -4 customer appointments.  I would have t handle billing and also offer new proposals to at least 3 customes a week or more.  I learned how to be effective with Time Management and achieve my goals. I would have to also work on obstacles that were often daily task and work on time managment details daliy.  The hardest part of my job was most times identifying which group to engage from the wireline side of business as they were changing the support staff monthly but it was done.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to offer a customer a Business Solution that help their business to grow as that was a way to also increase my business with them.
good,Found AT&T to be an excellent company with great opportunities. Only issue was the reduction of positions within my state and not being able to leave this region to continue employment with them.
good,Great company with a lot of room to advance. I worked with a lot of great people who really care about their jobs. The job allows for a lot of autonomy. The training is also great at at&t.
good,"cool place to work at, nice environment and comfortable place to work.  I did advance my training and experience at AT&T. They had good training department. I had great classes and learned a lot."
good,"The best part of the job was the fact that there was no limit on meeting your financial goals but also flexibility on daily bases. As long as I met my daily goals, I was fine."
good,AT&T is a great employer who values their employees and their customers. They focused on coaching and developing their employees.  pay was competitive and allowed employees to be comfortable in their personal life
good,"A normal work day consist of troubleshooting incubated products such as HD Voice, Connected car, Cloud Services(AT&T Locker & AT&T Messages). Each interaction is tracked through a SharePoint survey called the PMC(Product Management Tracker) for trends and report. I have been trained to utilize different troubleshooting tools that involve remote support and data base systems. "
good,Great company to work for if under good management team. Advancement within the company is welcomed and highly encouraged. Year round training in different products and sales techniques. Multiple trainings and counseling's before discipline.
good,AT&T needs to stop acting like a sociopath and acting only on the interests of its stock holders. They fear making contract employees into full time employees because of the legality issues and instead ship off the available work to 3rd world countries which its US based consumers cant stand to talk too.
good,A typical day at work involves coordinating efforts by a multi-functional team to deploy products.  Management is very focused on best in class products and customer focus.  Co-workers are professional and cooperative.
good,"Enjoyed sharing and training technician how to provide quality customer service and communication skills."
good,Looked forward to going to work each day.  The only reason was leaving was due to the call center closed down. I was able to assist both customers and co-workers.
good,"Retail Sales Consultant is as simple as any other sales job. Be expected to show up on time because there is no tolerance for late employees. Meet quotas, learn about new products and technology. Every store is different and is expected you maintain the area you work in because you will work many hours. it is your second home. scheduling can be difficult. Some stores can be understaffed and require that you be available. You get to demo some of the devices you sell to customers. Discount is great on services. Hardest part is communication. Your clients expect your to keep them up to speed about products and services. Your management will expect you to maintain a professional attitude and respond to customers calls and emails. Don't let management get to you."
good,"My tenure with AT&T afforded me the opportunity to work in several positions as my goals and objectives changed. I learned a great deal, met incredible people (customers and staff), expanded my skill set, and was well compensated for my work. I found sales to be challenging and rewarding and meeting quotas and having successful installations provided me with a strong sense of accomplishment.  I worked with and for very talented and knowledgeable people who were very committed to success.  This was not just an 8-5 job which provided me with the opportunity to structure my activities to fit my customer's time frame needs."
good,My co workers made this job fun.  Always competing with each other and sales is a very self driven self motivated job. This job included awesome benefits but the most enjoyable part was being able to make more money the harder you work.
good,"Overall AT&T was a great company to work for, I would recommend it to anyone working in retail looking to make more money based off of your own selling skills."
good,The people and superiors were very helpful and honest. The equipment was a learning experience. It was rewarding . The company was there for its personnel. It would be great to see more companies like this one which are being lost and are now becoming less concerned with the employees and more of the bottom line.
good,"daily pase at work; easy going, happy atmosphere, manager was enjoyable to work for. 7 story building, airconditioned, 1 hour lunch with 2 15 minutes breaks, 2-3 copiers on each floor. alot of lovely ladies."

good,I enjoy working!!! AT&T was very good to me and my family. I enjoyed my managers and coworkers. Many were like family to me.  I was able to learn a great deal about telecommunications and how important it is to our daily lives. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customer happy!!!
good,Great place of employment. lots to learn. Great structure from management and great co workers. Always a busy place with busy days. Benefits start from first week of employment and are very great. You see many customers during the day and are always learning about a new device.
good,We worked with a lot of different people.  Educating clients on cellular technology was enjoyable.  I was able to learn a great deal about working with the public as well as how a team should and should not function.
good,If you enjoy a fast pace enviorment then  AT&T is the perfect place of employment for you. I truly enjoyed working with customer face to face while meeting sales goals and quotas
good,This is a very great company. There is room for growth and advancement. The compensation is amazing. The best part of this job was working with a team of of other reps and managers who become family. The hardest part about the job is being able to meet the objective monthly.
good,"After training, and you do well for the company, you can pick your own schedule. You get frequent bonuses if you do well. My first Team Leader wasn't as successful as my last."
good,"Como jefe en Directv debes manejar todo el tiempo un lenguaje positivo y asertivo con tu equipo de trabajo, colegas y gerentes, así que a pesar de que tengas mucho trabajo o no estés de muy buen carácter debes saberlo manejar para dar una respuesta adecuada a la solicitud o inquietud que alguien te pueda hacer ( esto  es como lo más complicado). Lo que más me gustó fue que siempre mis ideas fueron escuchadas y casi todas las pude poner en práctica, Directv siempre busca la creatividad y la innovación para dar solución o mejorar algo que se requiera dentro de la compañía."
good,"After being with the company for over 14 years, I am only leaving due to layoffs.  The majority of the leadership is fantastic and is always receptive to feedback, new ideas, and willing to work with day to day family situations that arise. The compensation is fair but not great.  The work/life balance is fantastic for level 1 management but not typically for upper management.  The benefits package is very good with the exception of high health care costs."
good,"It was great working for AT&T even if i didn't make enough, i was able to work with cable and understand more about internet protocol. the management was great and my boss was very respective"
good,"A typical day at work starts by having a one-on-one with your manager about your goals for the day, which need to be high, but attainable... and they are always changing."
good,Tested and repaired Outside Plant for Internet Protocol TV.
good,Great company to work for. The only downside was management. We switched up managers a few times.
good,I learned a lot my years at at&t. Management was typical but I didnt have any problems. At&t was was for years laying off and moving employees. My turn finally came after so many years.Hardest part of the job was working midnites for 16 years. I enjoyed making my customers happy their service was working again.
good,"Training and management were excellent. Sales environment was great! co workers were awesome. However, this is a very competitive environment where you are required to meet sales goals and quotas. While working there, i believe their compensation/ metrics system was not appropriate. Could be different now. Overall great place to work with a lot of earning potential"
good,"Was one of my first jobs, too much favoritism, but learned to adapt to all personalities. Great compensation plans, at the time I worked there I had about 3 different managers in a short span of time, would of liked to have more training, I was and am very motivated, and the lack of options when encountering a difficult transportation matter was taken for granted. Overall, would love another opportunity if I ever needed it!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was solving problems in a challenging learning environment with talented people. I learned how to start and close a business deal including contract negotiations and client relationship management.
good,A day consisted of traveling from task to task. Sometimes from town to town other times going just around the block. I learned to work alone on tasks and to coordinate with others when needed. Management was primarily there to remove roadblocks so I could do my job. I considered my immediate co-workers as friends. We relied on one another for help in completing some jobs on site and other times for their experience and expertise. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upper level management with no job experience in the field they manage. I enjoyed the job when I solved a customer service issue to the customers satisfaction.
good,"Small team of subject experts in Information Security."
good,"AT&T is a great company.  They offer competitive benefits and employ some of the best talent in it's industry.  Unfortunately, you must be willing to live in Dallas or Atlanta to grow with this company.  "
good,"At AT&T I learn how to accept new change every day, because we always have new training, in a day I may talk to one-hundred customer which is not bad. AT&T is a place to grow and gain discipline also learn how to interact with order people and get work done under pressure. The hardest part of the job is receiving a phone call in less the 5 second after you just done got done working with a client and that happen very often. In a regular day the most available time you may get from getting a phone call is one minute. the most enjoy able part of the job is that you get to make other people happy by resolving their issues and make the company look good and for me personally making people happy is my passion."
good,"DIRECTV es una muy buena empresa para trabajar, existe un estilo de liderazgo horizontal, se pueden proponer nuevas ideas. "
good,"I enjoyed working with AT&T Advertising and Publishing, however, the  office was downsizing and reorganizing and eventually closed."
good,"A typical day at work for me is like a day at court, someday days can be easy and smooth and some can just be rought but I manage and I get through my days. I learned the customers/ client is always right and they will be right at the end of each call. my co-workers are pretty much self kept unless needed to be spoke in regards to work relations, but overall decent people. The hardest part of my job is dealing with an unexpected belligerent customer and solving their issue without engaging in confrontation. The most enjoyable part is being able to make a customer/client satisfied and happy and the end of each call and visit."
good,"I loved working for Ameritech, SBC and AT&T. Did a great job of work/life balance."
good,Att is a great company to work for but just like any oth if you dont know someone it will be hard to advance

good,"Seriously the best benefits I've ever had. Insurance is amazing. Vacation time is amazing. The people I work with are amazing. I've learned many things over the last 3 years. Patience. Understanding. Sales. The best part of my job is having the opportunity to turn someone's day around. Being in retail, you're constantly talking and asking questions. I'm blessed for the opportunity to meet and connect with so many people."
good,"Travel to different houses dealing with different customers"
good,Great pay. Union job. great benefits and great environment
good,"No comment I really don't have much to say about the company, but since this application process won't allow for me to continue unless I make a comment, here you go!"
good,"- Procedure writing for mobile feature testing."
good,Talking to peers and clients on their needs. Great to have open and honest communication. Folks wanting to share their knowledge to help others understand the needs of the business.
good,"So if you're goal is to be a tier 1 CSR forever this job would probably be perfect for you. Once you get the hang of it, the job is pretty easy. Management is pretty laid  back. However it seems DTV would rather hire people from outside the company instead of promoting within"
good,"Install voip,iptv, ipdsl in residential and business perms."

good,willing to work with schedule and enjoy life. great pay and a great company that takes care of his employees
good,"AT&T is one the largest and fastest growing telecommunications in the world, so they expect a lot of from their employees."
good,"A typical day  I would grab my ipad to clock in and go out by the front door to greet and approach our customers. At this point i would have already opened the door for the customer and introduced myself. After inquiring why the customer has come in i start to go over their plan in my system to see what services they are available for. Working at Att we did a lot of phone upgrades and some of them take a while. That being said, while i am going through the flow of getting the phone checked out thats when i bridge to other services. such as home security, tv providers internet etc.. If they are still on the fence i ask for manager approval to maybe throw them a deal on a phone case or accessory. At the end of the day i performed closing duties such as closing gates, nightly deposits, closing kiosks and arming the stores alarm."
good,"Benefits, Employee Development, professional development, I really enjoyed working at AT&T!"
good,"When the phone rang you never knew who you would get!  I've talked to celebrities like Chuck Liddel (UFC fighter), to everyday blue collar people who were just trying to watch their favorite shows;  but couldn't because something just wasn't right with their bill or their service.  It was my charge to resolve these conflicts through my breadth of knowledge on the DirecTV system.  Training was provided and it was state-of-the-art, top notch and well thought out."
good,"the hours are retail, but as you become a more senior employee the hours do get better. Constant changes in technology always learning new stuff. Fun environment to work in. The goals are set very high but if you work hard they are attainable and exceed able."
good,Working environment enabled to learn new cutting edge technologies and thus helped in enhancing technical knowledge
good,"Great training, great support great benefits, awesome pay. Decided to go after a dream and change careers and follow in my family footsteps and become a 4th generation hairdresser."
good,"They'll keep you busy, compensate you well, and are flexible with scheduling. Perfect for anyone just coming out of school, or trying to get back to work."
good,"Good Organisation to work "
good,pretty much a generic call center experience. if you have worked call centers before you're just dealing with the same stuff different product
good,"Upbeat, great customer interactions, multi-tasking, offering all products and solutions based on customers' needs. Management is very knowledgeable and helpful. Co-workers are fun, helpful, and team players. The hardest part of the job is remaining calm and patient in high volume and stressful situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the rewards, and enjoying the individuals that you work with on a daily basis, benefits, and incentives."
good,Your typical sales job that you have to meet your quota. Great management team and a diverse group of co-works gives it a good balance to the environment. The hardest part of the job is accepting that you will spend less time with family and friends. And the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the products and services the company offer are good which makes it easy to sell.

good,I started my telecom career with Pacific Bell and learned how voice and data telecommunications has made an impact on todays lives. I was excited to learn and be part of a winning team. My daily routine included residential and business repair and installation visits. I wanted to keep up with the changes with the industry and that's why I moved on with CANUS.
good,"This call center position is heavily micro-managed. You are timed from the start of your day, till the end of your day. This includes your breaks and lunches. Typically allowed 6 minutes a day for an 8 hour shift, without being penalized.T"
good,We had a reasonable expectation of work levels. Strong work ethics. Great team work and warm work enviroment
good,"Obviously this company has been in business for several decades and has been known for it's innovations and dedication to the ever-changing market of telecommunications. I actually enjoyed coming to work everyday, because the company took the time to make sure I was properly trained to provide the appropriate products and services our customers needed, which build confidence.  Account Representatives were content in knowing this was a company who cared about their customers and employess, which makes for a dedicated employee with integrity."
good,"For years, this was a good place to work.  Management produced a caring environment for its employees but later changed."

good,"Overall a good company to work for with excellent benefits, good training, and a pleasant working environment.  Management was usually willing to listen and was responsive to employee feedback."
good,"Working for AT&T does provide a great job security. You can even move around in the company. However, I don't believe the pay rate is all that great compared to what other companies are paying for the same positions. I NEVER got a chance to even balance work and life...""What is life"" would be my question. The schedules were horrid."
good,"I appreciate the opportunity I had to work for AT&T. It was a learning experience. They offered many training an developmental skills. I had the ability to grow and learn. I was fortunate to work with great leaders."

good,"ATT is great place to work to get your career started.  It's difficult to move up in the company and upper-management still has old-school management style.  They have communicated that this is being changed, but you can tell even today that it still exists.  Most employees at ATT are very difficult to work with as they won't put in the extra time needed to get the work done.  They feel like they are being shorted because their is no room for growth and therefore don't put in the extra time.  You will not get paid OT, yet expect to work OT if you're not an employee."
good,AT&T is a great company to work for that provides much potential for learning and enhancing one's work abilities.  The management and co-workers make a great team and make you a better person all in all.

good,"Fun work place and a lot of fun. However, management felt like drill sergeants."
good,"You sit in your cubical and answer inbound phone calls all day helping customers with their issues. The worst part was the script you have to follow, and sometimes annoying customers. The best part was being able to work so much your day goes by quick."
good,Typical day at work starts at 7am with safety and quality meeting then off to work area conditioning cable testing and clear defective cable pairs for customer. Management would come out and perform a quality and safety check to ensure we meet all safety and quality requirements to ensure customer satisfaction. The best part was my co workers we all helped each other and got along like one big happy family. Hardest part of the job was being out in the weather this winter was the coldest i have worked out in a very long time.
good,"Working at AT&T was a great experience professionally and personally. I loved going into work on a daily basis due to the workflow and excellent experiences that I helped provide for clients. Everything about the customer service/sales position was fast paced, key knowledge and giving excellent services no matter what. I successfully exceeded my expectations along with management expectations. The job was very fulfilling"
good,"Typical day is you receive a certain amount of tickets to work dealing with anything from data issues to feature problems to network issues. Everyday there always work the environment is okay sometimes but, the job is repetitive but my Area Manager keeps on different type of special projects to handle for him."
good,AT&T is a great place to work for it offers a variety of benefits to get one started until completion in his or her career. i have enjoyed working for the company which has given me so many memories and fun times.

Coordinate sales distribution by establishing sales territories, quotas, and goals and establish training programs for sales representatives. Analyze sales statistics gathered by staff to determine sales potential and inventory requirements and monitor the preferences of customers. I learned better on delegation to get more jobs done faster and better. Better coaching and training of large employee staffing, how to better maximize potential in people through different motivational skills. I really enjoyed working with the public and bringing a new peace to peoples lives. Being able to provide new and approved services everyday to my customer base was very satisfying."
good,"Mucha calidad humana en las personas que trabajamos allí, el ambiente laboral es muy cálido, el trabajo aumenta ya que la organización se expande en numero de suscriptores, la cadena de negocio es extensa y compleja ya que se manejan todos los puntos de contacto desde la venta inicial hasta la terminación del contrato de los clientes, esto exige al máximo las capacidades de cada integrante, los directivos son accesibles la cultura es de puertas abiertas, la parte mas difícil del trabajo es encontrar compañeros de trabajo resistentes al cambio ya que cuando existen ideas innovadoras no siempre son tomadas de la mejor forma, lo que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es que no se limita, tiene muchas oportunidades de mejora y me ayuda a desarrollar en algunas oportunidades habilidades que no sabia que tenia."
good,Great place to work. Managers didn't micromanage you if you were meeting sales objectives.
good,"Training programs are the best, you will learn so much within your first 8 weeks of employment. Listen, learn and make application and you will make money while enjoying your job every day."
good,.not very happy with the way I was let go. Otherwise a good place to work
good,"Handle a high volume of incoming calls."
good,"Your typical day consisted of answering calls, and socializing with management to obtain helpful information on the job. I learned that having the instinctual urge to know more could prove helpful in businesses such as AT&T. Management had held an open policy to their employees rather it pertained to work or being a guidance with decision making for careers. My co-workers always helped out no matter what the situation was at the time, even sometimes when it inconvenienced them. The hardest part was not  having the proper tools to solve every problem but the easiest had to be knowing others would be there to help out in anyway that they could."
good,"Call volume was always high... thank god, was kept very busy. "
good,"Typical to large corporations, it was difficult to achieve short dead lines.  Teams were inclusive of up to 10 organizations with as many as 70+ Team Members. The resource pool was generous for the most part and options were abundant."
good,"Working for AT&T I learned to  developed positive customer relationships with many customers on a daily basis. Some were more difficult than others, Although at the end of the sale you must make sure the customer is completely satisfied with all products and services. Management was very friendly and helped and trained with anything you felt you needed help with. The hardest part of the job would be making the sales quota at the end of a very slow month, to resolve that issue you had to make lots of phone calls and keep a good customer base."
good,"Excellent corporation to work for compared to many of the larger corporations. Benefits are excellent, training and bonuses can't be beat. The training and advancement opportunities are better than any other corporation I've worked for. Training is top of the line and they do as much as possible to prepare you for the job, the ability to advance in this company is similar to most places. Pay is excellent and many of the people work there for the benefits alone. If you like customer service jobs than I recommend AT&T, the only reason I left was because I was given the opportunity to travel for a couple of years and could not pass it up. My husband returned to the corporation and still currently with them. I went to school and changed career paths but would choose AT&T if I were not in an entirely different field. The one thing I did not like was the constant change of desk locations, managers, and teams. If you don't mind the constant change than you will have no complaints."
good,Loved working here. people were polite and helpful. Work was plentiful but we had fun at the same time.
good,"Answer incomming calls and requests to add or change cell phone plans. Great company, Great pay, Great benefits."

good,this was a very fun and challenging environment to work in. i learned in depth the importance of high quality customer service. my co-workers i didn't see much of since we are all out working but very well mannered environment. the hardest part of this job is not giving up when things get slow.
good,"Typical day at work"
good,"Compliance--Typical Day (If any could be truly typical)"
good,"A typical day at AT&T has all do with customer service. Its all about using the foundation of communication that the company trains you on to help the customer find the right device or services that makes their lives easier.  "
good,Typical work day always a challenge which when productive was very lucrative. What you learn is that every customer is different and you learn to adjust and grow to develop different skill levels. Management helped you become a Manager. My co-workers were the Best. The hardest part of my job was not the job it was having to leave.

good,Nice company to work for. Good benefits.Compensation is based on your experience.
good,"My career at AT&T offered me many opportunities to experience different jobs at different locations/states. Most of my experience at AT&T was in technical organizations providing business support.  This allowed me to utilize my Business degree while learning how the network functioned.  Bridging the technical community with the financial community was the value I brought to the company in most of my assignments.  This required establishing business relationships with both organizations and managing organizational dynamics.   Hardest part of the job was providing quick turnaround on analysis the executive leadership team required, but it was also some of the most rewarding parts as well.  Knowing what my team and I produced guided the corporations decisions."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for.  They have tremendous benefits and welcome top talent.  For hard workers and are politically savvy people, AT&T is the place where you will succeed."

Review calls, set goals, conduct huddles to cross pollenate and share best practices. Take customer escalations. Motivate team to acheive metrics for individual and team.

good,"Former employee really enjoyed working with my team, my coach was awesome always wanted to make sure her team exceed. The compensation and benefits were great, I truly miss that."
good,"I would be logged into the phone all day and would take calls from customers regarding their cell phones or their bills.  I learned a lot about how cell phones work and the different usage patterns of different age groups.  The call center was broken into teams and each team had a manager.  Occasionally we would move to a different team and would then get a different manager.  Co-workers were laid back and most everyone got along.  The hardest part of the job was keeping track of the new technology and the billing plans available.  The best part was being able to assist customers, especially those with billing issues."

Although the company I worked for never changed, the name did after several corporate acquisitions.  During my career, I learned time management, positive customer contact skills, Microsoft and other applications, negotiations, the list goes on and on, as the company spent significant expense on continuous training for their employees.

good,"a typical day in the life of the inventory room is to: tidy up, read reports, catch up on emails, recieve shipment, paperwork, reports, be ready for audit, and any special projects to  help out the managers. What I've learned with at&t is teamwork. Without teamwork you can not run the store by yourself. My co-workers are the best! You can always count on them to laugh when you have a hard day and to be serious when it comes down to work hard. The hardest part of this job was the stress of the annual audit but its also satisfying to know all that stress and hard work pays off when you pass your audit."

I learned how to be time efficient, handle clerical and administrative, and I learned to enjoy my job.  My co workers were a big part of my life. They assisted me to be able to have an enjoyable work day.  The hardest part of my job was the fluctuating schedule."

good,"I sent 15 years working for Bellsouth prior to being brought out by AT&T, like most buy outs, many things changed for the good, bad or indifference. BellSouth was a great place to work, most employees stayed forever, the benefits were outstanding, we had onsite gym, yearly picnics all sorts of great incentives.  AT&T was caught in the middle of surpluses, layoffs, and other things that came along with transitional and moral changes.  With that in mind, a typical day was very busy our National customers covered the West, and entire Southeast region, we handle very high volumes of work daily. I learned how to work independently as well as part of a team. My organizational, communication and leadership skills improvement drastically. I worked well with our management team, often scoring high on yearly reviews. My co-workers for the most, enjoyed the positive role model that I displayed. They could always count on me to step up take charge or lead the group. In my latter years I worked in a smaller group, therefore, we were like family. The hardest part of the job was being able to except the fact that others may not value their work as you do. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I played a valuable part in the success of a great company. Also the fact that I made a positive impact on the lives of many people was rewarding by itself."

good,At&t Mobility was a good place to work if you are in the retail customer service industry. There is a lot of money to be made based off of their comission structure. Some room for advancement but have to be willing to move around for the opportunity. Typical retail culture.

I have been able to work along side so many different people with different beliefs and views, which gave me the ability to be able to work with anyone well. The hardest part of the job is never being able to plan your day cause your schedule changes on a daily bases."
good,Great place to work overall.  Since it is so large your outlook can greatly vary from others both positive and negative.  I would highly recommend working for AT&T.
good,AT&T Mobility was a wonderful company and I should have stayed there instead of transferring to the landline side. Very motivated company and loyal to it's employees.
good,"I would work there again, there is room for advancement to move up in the company. You just have to make sure to stay healthy."
good,Loved At&t.  The only thing that was not easy to work with was the attendance policy.
good,"A typical day at work day at AT&T was logging onto the computer/ phone desk. At the beginning of the day you may have phone calls waiting to be answered and once you're done with one call another may come through different questions, people and solutions, so it was interesting. I learned how to deal with several different types of people . My manager at the time was not that informative about promotions or the well being of his team. I had very friendly and diverse co-workers that were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is probably becoming overwhelmed with so many calls in a single day. The best part about the job is how good you felt by solving an individual's problem, it gave me a good feeling knowing I've solved a problem of someone else.  "
good,Att wasnt bad but when you have to work 6 days a week and have a growing family it is difficult.
good,Working outside with no one boss over your back and dealing with all kinds of people everyday was a fun and interesting expierence. Management was very professional and fair to every employee from my prespective. The job paid well and had great benefits. The hardest part was the actual install it can be a little challenging at times. The most enjoyable part was the freedom of not being stuck ing a building allday.

good,"Each day is different, depending on the house I go to, what all I have to install, and the quality of the wiring. My customers love me because I make sure that my job is done right, and it is tested to make sure that I cannot find any issues with the network, lines and equipment, before I leave. My coworkers are fun to be around, though we don't get much time to talk, and we help each other out as much as possible. The first line managers are supportive of their technicians, and do anything they can to help out. The hardest part of the job is either going through attics/under houses or climbing phone poles. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am able to leave people happy with my work."
good,"A typical day included monitoring capacity on the VoIP network, generating build orders, hiring and working with vendors, balancing project budgets, working with long range planning on future jobs and budget planning, overseeing meetings between vendors and central office managers and working with various internal groups to complete said projects and installations."
good,"a typical day at work is coming in with a smile on my face, makes the day better logging on the computer and phones and assisting customers with tech issues and basic questions. I learned what good customer service takes and to never let any issue go unresolved. I also learned a great deal bout computers and phones. My co workers were great never had any issues i worked well in group meetings with others as well. The hardest part of the job is the irate customers but luckily i was trained how to calm customers down in a repsectful way and assure them the issue would get resolved. The most enjoyable part was resolving customers issue and the compliments due to resolving issues"
good,"If you don't mind working retail hours and enjoy technology, this is probably one of the best opportunities out there. The pay is probably one of the best salaries you can receive without a college degree and if you are wanting to get one, they have a great tuition reimbursement plan as part of the benefits."
good,"I have had one of my best work experiences in AT&T. As with any other work place, you'll find yourself dealing with different levels of politics, and you should be prepared for that. However, what has really made a difference for me is the importance of community involvement within the company. If giving back to your community is important to you, this might be the place for you."

I am looking to move back to my home town in Winston-Salem and am looking for a good job to start with and advance with and increase my knowledge in accounting as this is the degree I am currently perusing.

good,Inbound Calls:
good,AT&T is a safe and reliable company to work for. They give great employee benefits. The company culture is traditional and they adhere to many of the values and initiatives that the company was founded on.
good,"When I first started I went through training to learn the sales process and about the products. It was a combination of web training, shadowing experienced reps, and classroom style training. On a day to day I had to have a good grasp on the devices, features, plans, as well as the other products that the comoany offered to make reccomendations to customers based off what they told me about themselves. During down time we did warm calls to old customers to up sell and ""make sure their needs with the network was being met."" All in all, it was a great place to work because of the pay and people working there."

good,"The best thing about AT&T were the people I worked with. The worst thing was that it was a strict call center environment. This is where i acquired most of my management skills. There's a basketball court, air hockey, and plenty of games to keep the work place flowing."
good,"Compiled advertising orders for submission to publishers and verified conformance of published advertisements to specifications, for billing purposes."
good,Much better than I expected. Both my sales role and internship in analytics allowed me to further my career and gain valuable work experience.
good,AT&T is a great place to work. I have learned several things working there regarding technical support for internet. I love my co-workers and management is great. I would like to get an opportunity to work in the Electronic Medical Records field in which I am attending school for.
good,This company has the resources to do anything. If you can explain your needs AT&T can provide it.
good,"Selling cellphones, accesories, and any other AT&T product with a ""customer service"" focus would sum up a typical day at work. I learned about many AT&T computer programs, and learned that even a company as large as AT&T can instill in their employees exactly how imporant it is to make a customer feel important. The management style was extraordinary seeing that both the manager and assistant managers would expect the employees not only to perform their best but managers would make sure the employees understood why the their performance was so important. My co-workers played an important part in my work environment and we would strive to always be encouraging to each other but not to forget each of us were out to be ""number 1"". The hardest part of my job was to accept the fact that the opportunity to advance with the company was minimal seeing that positions beyond retail rarely came open. I enjoyed working in the somewhat ""high-pressure sales"" environment and the fast changing workplace. My management and co-workers made up a great team thus making my job more enjoyable."
good,"My typical day at work is doing outbound calls for 80% of my day and taking inbound calls for about 20% of the day. It's a great company to work for, but management has been there for a while and it's very hard to move around within the company. The people I work with are great and I learn something new every day and I love that it's a chalange."
good,directv is very organized and backs up there reps with a great benefits package and pay
good,I get to work on multi-million dollar projects and push the envelope with high quality user experience projects. Helping the online experience as well as being part of the founding team to create the mobile experience has been awesome.
good,"Greeting customers,building value with customers and uncovering their needs. Good company that educates and acknowledges employees. Management is willing to help you futher your career. The hardest part of my job is the ""uncovering"" the problem of our customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is speaking with my customers and trying to find a workable solution for them."
good,"Delivery and installation of analogue radio cells to different telephone stations. Installation of cabinets, power cables, RF cables and combiners. Installation of circuit boards to the cabinet."
good,"AT&T & local telecommunication companies within AT&T afforded me the opportunity to succeed daily. They provided produce training (computer based & leader lead) to make sure their employees were the best. I was able to move up within the company from an entry level clerical job to a Sales Manager. So they gave people the opportunity to succeed with is very important. The atmosphere that AT&T fosters is that of a family, a work family. The most frustrating part of the job was having to fire someone after spending hours & months of coaching them to be successful. The hardest part of the job may have been the constant change in process which made it hard to implement a product that was sold, which lead to an unhappy customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the people in my organization were successful & to witness the enthusiasm with themself. So I guess you could say celebrating the success was the most rewarding."
good,"With AT&T I was able to grow myself on a daily basis to provide a professional and satisfactory relationship with my customers and that of my peers. My tenure a AT&T also allowed me to get familiar with the wireless telecommunication field, from applying adjustments and credits to the customers billing needs to first level trouble shooting of any device. I was assigned to various TEAMS (3) while with AT&T and within each team the management was top notch, they were always ready to assist if you had a question or an issue with an inbound call (escalation) and my peers were also there to lend a helping hand if needed. I believe that the hardest part of working for AT&T was having to deal with a call of a customer that had just lost a loved one. One can not help but feel sympathy for one person. But on the upside, dealing with a caller that called with the intent to ruin my day would be most enjoyable for me. The reason I say that is becuse I would be able to defuse a situation by resolving an the issue, but most importantly make the customer feel as if he/she were the most important person in the world."
good,I started when the company was Bellsouth Mobility and then went to Cingular Wireless. After that it became ATT Wireless.
good,The AT&T Business Unit fostered a team work environment which was fully supported by management. Supervisors encouraged employees to seek problem resolutions using company processes and procedures. Managers were available for help as needed. Employees were measured on monthly production metrics with the resolution geared to customer satisfaction.
good,"At DIRECTV, I work as a customer service representative. I am primarily responsible for retaining customers who are wishing to or considering cancelling services. Our job consists of talking to customers from all over the country and relating to them, figuring out what they need and value about DIRECTV services, and providing this at the most reasonable costs to our customers. I have learned how to relate and communicate with many types of people, whether friendly or unruly, talkative or quiet, I have developed a skill for communicating and most importantly, listening to the needs of people and helping as best as possible. We are in a competitive environment, where we are divided into teams of 10-14 with a supervisor. Our supervisor keeps us updated on our numbers and charts how well we are doing in categories that are measured in our department. The most difficult part of my job is figuring out the perfect solution for the customer, especially if a customer is unwilling to let you help them, but we must still be professional and courtesy, no matter the situation. I enjoy the competitive environment, my team I work with, as well as my supervisor. We make the work the least stressful as possible, and there are perks and bonuses for exceptional performances from individuals and teams."

good,"DIRECTV is the leader in satellite TV, provides competitive pay and incredible benefits. The call center has a relaxing atrium with couch seating and waterfall, and full cafeteria to enjoy during breaks and lunches. I have learned a lot about myself as a manager and a leader, however, I am expendable, like any call center employee. I enjoy my coworkers, employees, and peers, and enjoy coaching and developing my employees. The hardest part is delivering difficult information that affects an employee's pay and stability."
good,"It was the type of job that is always changing. I was always learning new things, and I really enjoyed the people."
good,"handle and quality assurance and provide training to all customer service associates,"
good,I would get to work and start going to my desk 10 mins early since it is a big building. as soon as it was time to be there I signed on to my computer. Next I would start taking phone calls with the script that At&T wanted us to use. I learned that being calm with an irrate person is the best way to get along with everyone. At&t management was really good to us. They always where there to help us to improve stats. Co-workers were never rude to me or telling me I could not sit at their tables. The hardest part of the job is moving from one upset customer to the next. This is easy to get over though when The chance to talk about the issue very vaguely to another person.
good,"A typical day at work would be to see the staff and have friendly competitions with goals. Management would have a briefing on where you should be for the month. I learned to achieve better career advancements, and how to succeed in the company. Meeting and greeting customers."
good,Enjoyed making every customer feel taken care of when they called to get assistance with any issues on bills or phones.
good,"While working at AT&T I learned how to be patience and understanding. After working in customer service it taught me how to be a better customer, and to treat people how you would want to be treated."

good,It was an interesting place to work. Could be fun at times.I liked working there alot. I enjoyed talking to the customers and trying to resolve their issues.
good,"A great company where paper pushers can hide among the sales force though. I would never bad mouth the company, because they were very good to me on many levels. I had the state of Delaware as my territory selling ATM, Frame Relay & Point to Point services. I had great management support teams and great IT departments helping me along with the sales process & implementation. Hardest challenge was being patient as AT & T is a big multi layered company. Best part was traveling on training and meeting people at AT & T from around the world!"
good,The best part about the job was working with talented people who cared about the quality of their work. We operated as a team even though we did not always agree on everything. At the end of the day our common goal was to make sure that the customer received the greatest ROI. We succeeded every time!
good,I like att buisness care because they make sure you are properly trained before letting you take calls. The training is was very informative and helpful.

good,Buena empresa para laborar con beneficios que realmente te ayudan y con sueldos suficientes para tener buena vida y por ser medio tiempo

Fun holiday parties and team events. Technology was good and effective for meeting my goals. Ongoing reviews on performance were stressful at times but my hiring managers were great to work with.
good,"Working in the AT&T Call Center was great, and I recommend it to anyone who is in need of a job and is fine with doing customer service over the phone. I liked it, but there was a bit of a sales focus also with adding lines of service and selling DirecTV, and that's what kinda turned me away from it. I'm just not into being a salesman. If you are, hey, go for it!"
good,The call center has closed but was a place to work. Did sch based on how long you have been there which is great and they also offered leave early when available
good,"Great to have stability. I am applying for part-time work outside of the normal hours at AT&T. "

good,Start with a morning Huddle to discuss the days goals and objectives. Discuss how the previous day was and what we want to work on today. Be professional. Work place is comfortable with a break room and back office. Scheduled breaks and time to break when needed. Hardest part of the day would be making sure everyone maintains professionalism when its really busy and the Queue is full.

There was additional opportunity to expand our skill sets through the AT&T Computer Based Training curriculum. We had a really great team who worked well together and was willing to offer additional support where work was needed. Our manager was really helpful focusing on our personal growth and development. Working in the Operation Center, we had to interface with many groups to resolve various issues. Willingness to work with other work centers inside and outside of the company was a must. The hardest part of our job, working night shift, was isolating whether network outages were due to maintenance or not. I really enjoyed sharing knowledge with my coworkers."
good,"I worded for AT&T as a junior executive in which I was a door-to-door salesman/informative, I found it to be a fun and well paying job so long as you met your quota for commissions which could be stressful at times; however the employees are great and you’re never in the same area so it stays refreshing."
good,"if you're okay working in a strictly monitored call center environment then have at it. bathroom breaks are strictly monitored, every call has to be 100% no matter what, don't let a shouting customer get under your skin.  "

good,"This was a fast paced call center environment.  Lots of cultures and backgrounds. At&t provided training that insured that our performance was top notch on the phones.  We were rolling out At&t @ Home, one of the first high speed internet service. It was base paid, plus commission and bonus'.   I advanced quickly and became a Customer Service Supervisor. Which intel's the preparation of weekly meeting for my assigned team. Teams were broken up into 10-15 people with one supervisor. In this case me. I did annual reviews, write ups etc. for my team."
good,"There is an abundant amount of training available.  "
good,Calls are rough and stressful but if you learn to roll things off its a pretty good job. The calls are inbound and it was a third party company I worked for.
good,"It would depend on which department.  Engineering was intense having to make sure cell sites were on air at a certain deadline.  Human Resources tested my organizational skills, because a headcount was lost, however, a great experience.  Being a part of Corporate Communications included a lot of time and dedication.  It was a challenge which I enjoyed.  Working long hours to support executives.  In addition, payroll was a technical role as well.  Helping assist 250,000 get paid across the world can be stressful, AT&T is a great place to work, unfortunately I was laid off in September."

good,I enjoyed working for this company for the most part. there was some stressful things that you had to do but for the most part it was an enjoyable company to work for.
good,It is a company where not everyone is accepted so someday you may bring 5 people in that want to get the service while only like 1 will qualify. It hurts your wallet but that is part of the job and you have to get use to it being pretty hard but fullfilling
good,Overall a good experience in this company with friendley enviornment. Wonderful place to learn new things in my carrier. I love my team who gives me support all the time. In my batch everyone maintain the timing. Everyone think that there will be a tough time in the job but my manager lead a team like where there is no pressure on the work when we do our assigned tasks in a given time. Atlast i want to say if i get chance to work with that team i will definetely work with them.
good,"Like any job they all have their good and bad points. Overall I had a great career with AT&T. If not I wouldn't have stayed for 35 years. It was a good place to work, you could advance your career if desired and most managers wanted their crew members to advance."
good,"I worked for AT&T for 38 years. I gained a lot of experience from the different positions I held during this time. It was very fast paced, at times stressful, sometimes competative"

good,Company has evolved over the years with many changes.  An intense work environment but a sound and ethical company to work for with excellent employee benefits.
good,It's a great place to work for and I would recommend them highly.  Only problem is that work days can get really dull with too many boring meetings and protocols.
good,I had a great job but they surplussed me due to my location.  I worked at ATT for 20 years and would have retired if they weren't trying to get everyone in a collaboration zone.

good,Working at AT&T Labs Austin was a great experience in itself. All the SME were highly skillful and helping which led to my overall career growth. Great Working experience!!
good,"Good place to work. Can be stressful at times as the entire center is retention. Customers can be overwhelming. You have the support to ensure you know your job and keep improving. Attendance is very crucial. Benefits and discounts are great! Indoor cafeteria with all you could want for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Game/TV break room. Schedules are based on seniority but you can almost always get a good shift."
good,Advancement was assured if you worked hard and I benefitted from that a lot. The people were tough but fair and I always showed up when I was required to work.
good,Excelente empresa con innovación de punta  y  cambio constante en oferta comercial para beneficio del consumidor.
good,"Great Place to Work if you have a Great Leader. Some managers are not cut out to lead...they make it bad for good employees to stay and advance. I loved the company, but my manager made it hard."
good,"I would say, at this time the company was learning to work on a new culture which was AT&T.  Directv culture was great and I felt very stable. "
good,"AT&T is a great place to work, especially if you love talking on the phone. If you have the passion, then this will be easy money for you. It can be very stressful due to the number of calls you get a day. The managers really do their best to make sure the employees are happy."
good,Very good organization with lots of fun at work and motivating the employees... got very good incentives but more pressure on skill side.. yes I would recommend anyone to work here
good,"You have to understand the outside environment can be treacherous at times, but otherwise it is a great place to work."
good,The work that we do is just like regular customer service. This place is laid back as can be and do great as a company due to the people running the company as a whole. The only thing they lack is the pay rate that they have this set. It's like you have to be here the majority of your time to even see a $400 check due to the regular standard 15.3% taken out by Texas and oh they don't tell you about the money they take out for the staffing.
good,"The hours can be long. The work can be hard or easy depending on the types of jobs you get dispatched on. Typically in balances out. Management is good. Fellow employees are awesome, best part of the job for me personally. Doing full installs and working aloft is the hardest part. Not a job for those that are scared of heights."
good,"I loved working at Convergys.  It was a laid back customer service job.  You have the opportunity to receive bonuses with every phone call. You get two breaks a day, and they have wonderful food in the cafeteria."
good,Company does an excellent job promoting diversity and inclusion by means of organizations and participation.  The company is involved by many different external/internal organizations and consistently encourages involvement of employees.
good,"I was able to start with AT&T in an entry level position with good salary and benefits.  There were many opportunities to move within various organizations which provided me with experience in a wide variety of positions and exposure to new and emerging technologies.  Financially, I earned a pension and had the ability to invest in company stock.  The company can be slow and difficult to deal with in certain areas of needed change however the leadership team did an excellent job of steering the company over the long term."
good,"When I worked for AT&T, there was a program implemented called LEAP. This allowed for management and employees to work together through various avenues to achieve an open and honest workplace. There were programs for advancement, special projects, and opportunities to get to know different managers by way of mandatory rotation. The hardest part of the job navigating the many different programs, however, you had access to various lifelines for help. I have heard that the atmosphere has changed since I left, but I would still recommend because of my experience."
good,My time as a CSR rep when i was with AT&T  was a pleasant experience. Loved the fact of time off needed for vacation and sick leave. The perks of having discounts of AT&T and other companies they affected w. I would highly recommend employment with the great benefits & package they have for a longevity.

All the managers I worked with were nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was when a major circuit would go down and it was very imperative that it be fixed asap.

Some days were better than others. The pay and benefits was great. The only down side I can say is that the home and work life was not balanced.

Working side by side with my team to meet and exceed our sales goals monthly was no chore, but a pleasure."
good,The best thing about this place is being able to leave a smile on your customers face. I was working directly with the customer. The only entity of the company that the customer actually seen was me the technician. I liked addressing there issues and solving customers problems. I felt i represented the company well! I liked that i was provided the knowledge of how to get the job done then it was just up for me to execute.

good,AT&T provided a very friendly and professional working environment.  Management was supportive and attentive to employee work environment and valued/appreciated employee contribution.

good,"i was a directv installer and service provider. it was great i was based out of lacey washington working in port orchard washington. the pay was self earned, meaning the better and faster you were at your job the more you earned. i enjoyed the employment very much. but i was injured while working, and it has been almost two years since i last worked. i havent heard from them, or any of my fellow workers. they never checked on my welfare or if i was doing ok. this company left a disgustingly sour taste in my mouth."

good,I loved and enjoyed working at AT&T. I learned so much. Met awesome people. The company is always advancing with technology and work.

good,"Management was willing to send you to a formal school or explained it properly so you can do your job."

The most enjoyable part of the day is pleasing the customer"

good,"The job is fun and they pay is good. Retail hours can be very long and you're on your feet a lot. "

good,AT&T provided a great salary and work environment with reasonable hours. I would answer phones and handle customer needs on accounts and payments. All employees where tested for the position.  Book closing was the busiest time due to print deadlines. The best part was working with the Central Office Group. I learned a lot about other facets of the business along with IT networking skills. I was sad when I left.
good,"Great company to work for to gain sales, management and relationship building skills. "
good,"Being a leveraged rep at 60% salary and 40% sales is stressful, but its not just the sales, there are also qualifiers that must be met.  great paying position but can be very stressful.  That being said, management is amazing, the office is a family that works together, and it is easy to balance work and personal life."
good,"I worked for AT&T when it was still DIRECTV. The management team was wonderful, the pay was great and there were definitely opportunities for advancement. However working in a high call volume environment full time can be tiresome especially with their attendance policy and time off schedule. I hated having to fight for time off. Other than that I have no complaints.."
good,"Not one job or customer is ever the same.  You need to be able to adapt with everyday changes as the company always pushes new product and new policy. Overtime is always offered which is great.  You need to be able to work in confined spaces and not afraid of heights.  Hardest part of the job right now is Direct TV installs since its fairly new to us.  I'm sure given the right amount of training this new task will be second nature just like U-Verse TV.  What i like most about this job the feeling of independence.  I'm the type of worker where I work better when I know my boss can depend on me.  As long as you do what you're supposed to do and be where you're supposed to be, you will have a great career with AT&T."
good,"good company to work for"

My immediate management were kind, courteous and grateful for the efforts put forth.  My co-workers made up a friendly, professional team.  The most difficult part of the job was keeping up on the four supervisors and twenty plus staff that i was responsible for insofar as responding to correspondence in a timely fashion, ascertaining that their time cards were filled out and approved correctly so I could enter them into the database etc.  The most enjoyable part was the social activities that accompanied the job such as luncheons, banquets, dinners and outings."
good,"This job used to be a great paying job. They unfortunately changed their commission structure, so the payout went down drastically. Because of this, I now need to look for a different job."
good,"Great benefits and salary for the experience required "
good,"Our senior management has been constantly supportive through good and bad times, they do not count their hours when it comes to assist us in any way possible."

We had a wonderful group of people, from our management down through our service representatives.  My co-worker and I had a great system, and we enjoyed each day, including the challenging days.  The only thing constant at our office was change."
good,"Each day I updated previous day's data into Access, then automated the data thru Excel or Web based reports viewable only by mgmt. The hardest part of job was making sure all reports, data was accurate. The most enjoyable part of job was after creating a process flow for reports to be viewable at the upper mgmt level via the web within a secure website. Co-workers were excellent in providing me the raw data for me to use. Our management team had a solid platform to review and use to make decisions on productivity, identify the weaker and stronger employees based on information i provided them daily, weekly and monthly."

good,"I very much enjoyed my time with AT&T.  I was paid well to do interesting and challenging work.  Excellent direct management, excellent co-workers and a supportive environment.  As an Engineering Assistant I learned not just the direct skills for the job but also became a better communicator and became a better representative for AT&T with the customers and governmental agencies that I had interaction with.  The most enjoyable part of the job was also the hardest part of the job, the pacing and need to multitask."
good,"I actually loved working for DirecTv. They had great benefits, paid well and had a good break system. The work wasn't extremely difficult, the numbers weren't hard to meet, and management truly did try to work with employees."
good,My job has its up and down. Overall it is a great company to work for and love the work but hate the politics behind it. My co-workers are great to work for. My manager I would not change for any other manager but my 2nd level is not an easy person to deal with. Personally never had a run in with him but from the incidents I have encountered he is not behind us as he should.
good,Fun work place with everyday communication with customers. Extremely supportive direct management. Very nice and friendly colleagues. Strong security policy as it should be. The best place for the first work but I want to grow my career and I do not see myself within the company at a position higher than the one I have now.
good,I had no experiance yet i became the number 1 seller in the district if you have passion and drive to be the best this is a great company to work for
good,"This is an excellent company to get involved with and build a career with. The work/life balance isn't so good when you start out, but it does get easier as you move up."
good,great place and the staff is always willing to work with you. Also they keep fun activities throughout the year so the work environment stays positive
good,"I absolutely loved the job itself- helping people and taking different kinds of calls each time. I worked for them for almost 5 years. The amount of paid time off and the ability to switch shifts is outstanding and flexible, but being union based, we changed shifts every 3-6 months based on seniority. The schedule inconsistency makes it hard for family life, but great if you like change. It is fast paced, and goals/expectations frequently change based on business needs. You have a learning curve in the beginning and accountability for stats after that (They will put you on coaching plans to help you improve and if unsuccessful, they will let you go.) On the job training with amazing tools and systems give great opportunities to work closely with customers and other agents to resolve issues. The pay is fantastic and increases significantly until you cap in a few years. Advancement opportunities are mostly only available if the call center size increases or a manager leaves the company, and then the hours are based off the management seniority. Some departments are open 24/7. I can honestly say that this was my favorite place to work. There are company perks like discounted phone, internet, and satellite plans, incentives for good stats like bonuses and other give-aways. We were always participating in some donation drive or charity event, which was very rewarding. If you like working with people and computers, don't take customers personally, and don't mind being on the phones 8 hours a day or the changing schedule, this is a great place to retire! (401K is good, too.)"
good,"While at AT&T, I trained new hires, store employees and sales representatives. I was also involved in the hiring process as well as the termination of employees if necessary.  I  trained refresher courses when new products or procedures came out.  I was responsible for following up on the new hires and making sure they were doing a good job. "
good,Very productive work floor with a lot of overtime offered some mandatory. Paid training and a raise once you get out of training. Friendly coworkers and managers.
good,AT&T has always been a fantastic service company nation wide.  They train the employees well and on top of that have a fantastic benefit package.
good,"I really loved working here until I got a manager that was told by his superior fire people to make his numbers look better.  If you can drag the company line you will go far here.  If you get targeted by management, pray that the union has your back or you will be on your way out sooner than later."
good,"Fun to work, supportive management. training classes are conducted whenever necessary. employees and colleagues are very cooperative. submission of projects by deadline was very hectic."
good,It's an excellent company to work for with every single thing except the work schedule assigned due to it being computer generated with no leaniancy and is based on seniority.
good,I worked on projects supporting the US NAVY. The projects were challenging and interesting. Problem solving and troubleshooting activities highlighted each day.
good,"At this job was responsible for taking calls from AT&T customers giving them the help they may need with their mobile devices, whether it's a crack screen, can't make or receive calls, not able to send or receive text or any outage problems etc. I give them the respect and a warm welcome and try every way to keep them as a customer and if there frustrated and upset I sympathize and have them smiling and happy at the end of the call.

Having worked for the company for nearly 8 years I've learned to adapt to changes very quickly whether it be policy changes or changes to our compensation plan. Hands down the hardest part of my job is the system issues we run into daily.. even though I've seen many of different kinds of scenarios there's not a day that goes by that i don't run into something I've never seen in regards to system issues ."
good,Always doing something and always opportunities to make more money! I see people advance quickly and move around easily.
good,"A normal day at work for me is to always do my best no matter what, try to be the best sales representative in the company. In Directv I learned to be patience, work as a team to reach the goals of the company. Theres always going to be thug time in any work and the most enjoyable part of my work is the satisfaction of my customer."
good,"Typical day at work getting on the phones from 8am-5pm. I learned from this job was how to handle someone who was scared of handling over personal information. Management was good people to work with, as well as my co-workers. The hardest part about this job was trying to calm a angry customer down over the phone. The most enjoyable part about this job was be able to connect with different types of people all around the states."
good,"Sold phones talked, helped customers with bill, and issues phone issues. Learned how to outsell co-workers how to use the system that they used. hardest part was meeting goal at the end of the month."

You have to follow adherence/availability everyday and stay logged into the phones at all times, I learned working there how to provide great customer service . The culture is different everyone working there was awesome and everyone was very different in their own way which I liked they hire a certain type of person at all.

I also facilitate and contribute to various projects to launch new support software, onboarding of new chat support centers, and I also assist in the migration/testing of new metrics reporting platforms.  I usually work from home, and I am on a virtual team; none of my team members are in the same state, and neither is my direct supervisor.  I have learned that taking initiative to find ways in which leadership can make measurable improvements to their customer support efficiency and survey feedback can be very rewarding, and beneficial to career advancement.  Working not only with my peers but also strategic partners and other stakeholders to help them find opportunities to improve their employees' performance is the #1 priority, as it is translates into a more positive customer experience on every interaction.  My direct supervisor is very hands off, which is a perfect fit for my team because we are all managers and require little to no supervision.  We do occasionally look to our boss for information that is fed down the chain of command, or for more insight into operational decisions that we may not alway be made privy to, and he is always there to support us in that capacity.  My coworkers are some of the finest people I have ever had the pleasure of working with, and among them are a business school graduate who recently joined the management side, and provides reporting and analysis on social media."

We were constantly learning about the technical aspects of new equipment, as well as how to support our technicians installing equipment that was not considered ""new"" technology. The hardest part of this job was relating to a new technician on site who had not had enough training to know the basics because this made it harder for him to conceive technical instructions to resolve his issue.

My small team got brought up to number one in the nation for sales for a month because of our go-getter attitude and teamwork.  Management is reasonable as long as you follow your procedures and work on your quotas while getting customer service excellency.  Benefits are better than most companies can afford, seeing as how they hire only full time employees.

What I have learned is strategic sales along with growing new business to the company.   I focus on individual sales metrics and sales rankings, however, there is a big team element in the Company to help motivate one another.

good,A typical work day is very busy from the time i come in to the time I leave. I have definitely improved my computer skills and customer service ability. the management team is willing to help in any way they can and if they don't have the answer to something they find it and get back to you always. the hardest part of the job of course is those irritated customers who no matter what you do are not happy and scream and yell to get their way.
good,Everyday has its ups and downs but over all we all work together as a team and work things out to the best of its ability. No job is perfect but i can say i definatly enjoy working here.

good,Typical day of work involved daily meetings that began with team building exercises followed by classroom style lessons to keep us effective in the field. I would partner with fellow co-workers to role play customer and sales agent scenarios to keep me on my toes with challenges met in the field. After the daily meeting we would grab lunch and head to our designated sales territories. Hardest part of the job was to stop knocking on doors once it passed nine o'clock and in-climate weather conditions that affected the visibility of potential customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new faces and assisting customers with making educated decisions towards saving money on their cable phone and internet needs.

My branch manager was awesome and customer driven. As far as co-workers, everyone jumped in to help in areas where help was needed. The hardest part of the job was managing three store's inventories when you could only be at one store at a time. I liked the fact that when we had important meetings before our scheduled work time or even on one's day off that management would recognize the fact that it was an inconvenience to some and they would provide donuts or bagels and juice to help offset the inconvenience. It showed me as an employee that they cared about us and not just themselves."

The most enjoyable was the employees, training team, and management."
good,AT&T is a great place. The culture is great and everybody is easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is truly figuring out what customers need help with and also the hours of the job. I learned a lot more on customer service and how to handle customers.

Being with my coworkers made the job more enjoyable and when everyone hit their quota, everything was. very easy going."
good,Luckily I have had the honor to work with the finest people and staff during my career with AT&T. Some of the smartest people Ive ever known and all make it seem more like family than work.
good,I worked with Tier II Technical Support at ATT for almost 10 years and loved the technical side.   I had tenure and the pay was great.  My management at the time was very supportive of their workers.

good,"AT&T purchased BellSouth. I stayed for a year after the buyout and was promoted to manager. The company was starting to layoff a lot of folks (and has since laid off many many more)."
good,Innovation and change is what makes AT&T unique.  There are lots of opportunities and an employer where you can learn much about technology.    Opportunities are across the country and leadership is strong.
good,"Got promoted from within for this new channel. It wasnt what I expected. If you are a really good seller and a shark, it is easy to go into peoples houses and sell them services, but most people are not expecting you. Because it is new, the original goals for the team were low and kept growing. There can be rewards if you work hard, but the hours I put in extra weren't worth the commission I made."

good,"AT&T gives its employees lots of ability to advance.  They offer tuition reimbursement and time off to attend training and conferences."
good,"AT&T gave me a lot of advantages. I was able to bid for a schedule that worked with my home life. The best part was working with the management team and the individuals on a team. The culture was fast-paced, but very supportive.  Lots of training and lots of one-on-one with your managers. If you are looking for a new career, or like me a career change, A T & T is a great starting point."

good,"I monitor the nation-wide network for issue such as hardware, software, power and performance problems.  I work with field technicians and other work groups to get those issues resolved to ensure reliability of the network.  Management supports technicians and does not micromanage.  It's a collaborative workplace culture while also requiring to work a lot of the time on your own.  The most enjoyable part of the job is doing my part to resolve large outages, such as those created by hurricanes.  The most difficult part of the job is knowing that the NOC will be shut down in June."
good,I loved working there. I loved the environment and everyone I worked with. We were like a close knit family. From training classes to work. Great personalities were everywhere.
good,Working at att i would recommend to a good seller. you can make a lot of money. Room for advancement and a lot of career buildign for future jobs as well
good,Working at the At&t (Cingular at the time) was a great learning experience. I handled calls from the Mid-Western states. The benefits and pay were excellent. I hated leaving that job.
good,"To start with, the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide. Not sure how she manages to make sure each of us are being noticed, acknowledged, appreciated. Best HR i have ever worked …"

good,"I liked working for SNET... When ATT took over things have changed.  But not for a while.  I loved going to work everyday.  I loved working with the people that I worked with.  When I go to work in the morning I had to sign in by the computer.  I had to learn each step in different programs to look up phone numbers whether they're working or not, plus how old they are.  The typical day at work is answering phones from service reps. to give the phone numbers that customers want.  I learned that a phone number doesn't work unless a LEN isn't attached to it.  We have to figure that out too. The Management were very nice and would help you is you needed help. They had all different nationalities that I were friends with.  The hardest part of this job is having certain towns that we are responsible for.  Plus, they are different of phone lines.  For instance, Meriden phone service was a EWSD (Seiman Switch) line and we had to change al the numbers because they wanted to be a 5E service. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things, working with interesting people and just liking the work that I did. I lost this job because this position went to Michigan."
good,i would love to continue to work for at&t but i was laid off and haven't heard responses on other positions I've put in for. really starting to feel like I'm being let down.
good,"I definently enjoyed the experience at the AT&T, they treated me very well and were helpful during the training classes. They explained everything to me and answered my questions."

By 7:30 am, a workgroup meeting was conducted with technicians to distribute work assignments, overseeing a safety meeting and reviewing objectives for the day."

good,"My days at AT&T were very busy and I spent many hours making sure all projects, large and small, were on time and progressing as they should. I inherited several groups in addition to the one I already had. My group served as the hub of every project Sales sold."
good,I really don’t have much to say other that I absolutely enjoyed working there. I would have stayed if I would have been getting paid for the manager duties. Other tat that it was great.
good,"I personally recommend working for Authorized AT&T dealers. This is where you can make great money, with great incentives. The best part of the job was the personal interactions you'd get to make everyday. Working with businesses and dealing with small issues that were resolved with critical thinking. Definitely a great work experience, I would go back if i could."

good,es una buena empresa sin embargo tiene mucha competencia de ventas con corporativos que el producto lo regalan  aprendi mucho sobre ventas me gustan las ventas la parte difícil es la venta del producto a gente que se lo regalan pero muy bien
good,"Work can be stressful at times. Management is great, works with you to help you improve if needed. Commission was good. Hourly is great for the job. Would recommend."
good,"Calls vary depending on what a customer calls in about, can only use work phone out on the floor, managers and floor support will work with you until issue is resolved. Only issue is that you have to keep up with scores or you can get in trouble."
good,One of the most fulfilling jobs I have had. High level of responsibility and lattitude for achieving results. The perfect environment for a competent individual who strives to make a difference as opposed to being a cog in a wheel.
good,great place to work with great benefits. managers know your job and theirs exceptionally well. coworkers are eager to help when you are new to the job.
good,"es buen trabajo, buen ambiente laboral, todo bien a excepción que no te capacitan en el uso de herramientas de trabajo, te enseña un compañero y aprendes rápido si es que sabe manejar las herramientas bien, de ahí en fuera, todo bien."

You will enjoy educating/selling customers on the latest products while enjoying a monthly commission check and other incentives. In the past few years I've learned TONS about the telecommunication world. That's one of the more enjoyable aspects of the job but also the hardest...the everyday product knowledge."
good,"I enjoy working at AT&T, I have been employee there for over 8 years. The company has many opportunities for advancement. Its a forever changing industry"
good,"AT&T as a whole is a great company as long as you are in corporate and not retail. However, being in a satellite location of corporate makes networking difficult and promotions are harder to come by. Culture depends on the management ladder of the region and segment. NPS scores keeps leadership in tight focus of their own job security and satisfaction, which is good."
good,"•	To meet our monthly quotas, and up sell by offering our plans, upgrades, and products"
good,"The job description keeps changing. We received great training in the beginning. During training we were told we all had the same middle name, Flexibility. As the job changes, you are given additional training at every step. Opportunities exist if you show initiative. They are Union and every employee in the States of California and Nevada have been working without a new contract for over a year. The Union Stewards are pathetic and work for their own agenda. Realistically, it's a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work, currently assist customers with their accounts. go over bills and to see what retention offers that they can receive to retain them as customers."
good,"I worked for At&t twice. Both times, I had co-workers who made the day go by faster. Having a good team to work with makes all the difference, since you spend so much of your time there. The work/life balance could be better, but the pay is really good so that helps. Customer traffic of course varies during the months but you are still getting your guaranteed hours."
good,"learned at AT&T how to deal with multiply customers at once, as new phones and technology came out was on top of all the new products. management was absoulty great.  hardest part of the job was long days"

good,"Un buen trabajo en equipo, beneficios que da a sus trabajadores."
good,Manager of about 30 employees. I learned a lot about the constuction industry and the difference of being a Manager and a Leader and the impact that that made on the employees. Visited job sites to earn the construction company business.

good,"I started out in the field as a Construction Manager but AT&T moved there CM into the office! Construction Managers was done behind the desk. They left it up yo the Turf Vendors for quality and cost.Not a good thing!"
good,"During my tenure with AT&T,  I grew in knowledge of our wireless system and the new integration of the IoT. it was an enjoyable experience and a good company to work for, the one thing that I disliked is that for the past 5 years our Segment went through many changes that brought upon many surpluses."
good,Assisting incoming calls from customers to issue credits for problem calls. Maintaining call flow. Only downfall schedule changed daily.

good,Fun to work at and great place to learn new things they have a very good training program system and great benefits and payroll is good compared to other competitive companies in the market.
good,"AT&T is simply an AMAZING PLACE TO WORK!  Thousands of employees have worked there for many, many years.  That alone is something special."
good,"A typical day at AT&T included hosting a number of conference calls relating to my projects.  The calls were very informative to all who attended. Providing status reports to upper management. I really enjoyed the number of years I spent as an AT&T employee. I learned valuable information, which I can use throughout my life. "

good,"working with co worx/AT&T was a really great experience and fun place to work due to the on going activities they had for the employees and opportunity for advancement.  The benefits were great as well, if I had not moved to Atlanta I would still be working for the company"
good,A typical day at work would have you driving around San Francisco to customers houses and different businesses. It would be stressful at times to get job done but was very rewarding. You'd be able to be on your own and work without much supervision. Try all the food the city has to offer.  help customers with something that has become a basic necessity for life now wether it's their tv or internet service.
good,"At AT&T the day always started with a 5 minute meeting with management to discuss attainment to sales goal performance and to make sure we were updated on current promotions. This meeting was also a good time to ask any questions I had and to strategize with my coworkers how to best position products to close sales. After the meeting I would hit the sales floor, making sure to greet all customers and find a solution to their mobility needs. Probing questions were used to uncover areas for potential sales opportunities so I could offer a complete solution to all the customers needs. Interacting with customers was the best part of my day, because meeting so many different people allowed me to share in their experiences and build positive relationships. "
good,Southwestern Bell was merged with AT&T so the culture of AT&T is described above.  Nothing more to say since the company technically no longer exists.
good,"Great company, the manager is great but too ...... he just need a little bit of kindness. But about is job, he does know how to manage, I can't say nothing else about that."
good,"This is a great place to work if you are protected by the Union. Once you get promoted into management, there is a chance you might get laid off which is really a deterrent towards moving up."
good,great place to work where good money to be made at anytime if you can sell. I worked in the retail environment where you dealt with anyone who waled through the door.
good,"Great place to learn, grow, and assume a responsible role if your sales stats are good.Great hours, great money, good leadership. thats outside sales anyway, i don't know about inhouse."
good,I like the people to work with; the pension is great.  The benefits are nice. The managers are nice and for the most part they know what they are doing.
good,"No doubt about it!  The best Team support as if you were a brother or sister.  The best encouragement.  The best opportunities to move within the company and cross train in other positions.  A bit stressful at times, but worth it all.  Finance, management, reporting tools and creating spreadsheets, assisting with new ideas and innovations, and enjoying the best of management leadership.  It was all good!"
good,"a high paced work scene that relies on quality customer service. over 1,000 customer calls received daily so it was an easy place to keep busy and keep the customer happy."
good,Awesome opportunity. I had a blast making memories and money. If you can sale this job is easy and not hard. Have a understanding of phones and technology and you can't fail!
good,"Fast paced, learned psychology of sales, mastered sales techniques management was always available to help. Juggling the different personalities was the most difficult part of the job yet it was possible to do so.  The best part was the constant effort to build up moral."
good,"Good work environment, fast paced. Grate benefits and salary, training/learning opportunities. Friendly helpful peers. Well managed. Overall a very good company to work for."
good,a good day at work we always have our morning meetings then we got out to the feild for the day.what i learned from this job that people are very pickey about  their t.v poivider the hardest part of this job was the fact that it was always hard to find people that actually wanted the service and if they did want the service then somtimes it did  not go in their area or maybe they had bad credit it just depend
good,I can honestly say that I work with amazing people who stride to better themselves and also better each other.
good,Total support to meeting customer needs. Has backing of corporate AT&T.  Allows employees to focus on customer needs.  Leaves business growth to management. Good benefits.
good,they understand and work with their employee to make sure the information going out to the customer and the customer is given the information they need to continue with their coverage or let their coverage go.
good,"Everyone helped each other if needed. I felt like we were all on the same team. (which is the way it is supposed to be). A typical work day was getting to work on time and start answering the phone. It was a very busy day (which makes the shift go by faster) The most enjoyable part of the job for me was knowing that I was responsible for helping a lot of people with their technical support.    Unfortunately, I had to relocate to another state for personal reasons. I was told that there should not be any problems getting rehired. However it has been over 3 years and many interviews doing the same type of work. I believe that they are not hiring me back because of my age."
good,"I worked as a temporary Cable Splicer. The company is losing a lot of staff and the environment is changing. If you work for ATT, ensure you are in a profession that is growing and not in a legacy trade."
good,"Fast paced, Interaction with customers abundant. I learned how to handle customers in many different circumstances. Management was very good. My co-workers were friendly. Team oriented. The hardest part of the job was to satisfy every customer. There is that very small percentage that you can never please. Most enjoyable is pleasing the customer."
good,Very fun atmosphere. They take care of their employees on a regular basis. Must be able to handle different types of people and also confrontation well!
good,"We had daily team huddles that provided a lot of information and encouragement from the team leaders. The co-workers were awesome and there were plenty of perks like trips and new tvs, and points you could use to buy other things. The one biggest think i disliked was that when AT&T bought Directv, they changed the scheduling and made everyone go to a flexible schedule and they also got rid of part time, which made it hard for single parents or people in school that needed a set schedule."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work. "
good,"un excelente trabajo u muy buen ambiente"
good,"Phone sales daily, talked to some successful entrepreneurs. Co-workers were great, and some are close friends. Job was easy, sold or upgraded cell phones, business phone lines, set up new service, set up or upgrade internet service or T1 service."
good,I gained a lot of valuable B2B sales experience at AT&T. I would recommend the company offer more sales incentives such as spiffs and monthly bonuses based on results to motivate the top sellers.

I spoke to end users and resolved any type of issues they had, whether it was immediate or via trouble reports. This technology wasn't available to the working person when it came out and I watched it change and grow. I created training programs to keep up with the changing aspects. There were some abusive or upset people, which was the hardest part of the job. But they needed help and THAT is what I enjoyed most.

good,Customer service was good but at the time I worked there we were expected to sell TV Uverse to the customers that were calling in on their bill and they had never heard of Uverse.

The hardest part of my job is the downtown. there can be hours before i get customers into the store. What i love about working for At&t is the new take on customer service, as well as product development. Working in an environment when new products and lessons on new ways to sell, keep it exciting and fulfilling."

good,"One of AT&T’s main focuses is to ensure customer satisfaction. Since working with multifaceted personalities, co-workers or consumers, I have grown to be very patient making it rare to have an angry customer leave the store. It is important in any circumstance to be open-minded, courteous, and empathetic. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with sales quotas. The best part of the job is providing an extraordinary experience to my customers.

good,"At&t(BellSouth) was a wonderful company to work for. Change was constant, and the job itself was quite challenging yet rewarding. Being on a team was a perk because we challenged each other to maintain and reach sales goals. The hardest part of the position would have to be dealing with irate customers and overcoming various demands the customer had."
good,"Coached, motivated and trained 15+ employees in a team. Spoke to customers that were very satisfied/dissatisfied. Lots of probem resolution to satisfy the customer. Management always available. Everyone worked together to get the job done on the team. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving the customers' service or billing complaint and to leave the customer completely satisfied."
good,Southwestern Bell (now AT&T) was always very innovative and forward moving during my career there. Most people think of cell phones when they hear AT&T but it's so much more. Some of the services we use today were only a concept and a dream only a few years ago.
good,It a fast paced company with different departments to work in. you have to be able to work independently and be able to meet production numbers to be sucessful on the job.union environment in some unit sectors
good,Having the AT&T name behind you makes selling and doing business a lot easier because the weight the name holds. It's a good company to work for but you can get lost and you have to deal with the politics every now and then.
good,"I started working for Pacific Bell November 8, 1999. I enjoyed my 10 year career with Pac Bell/SBC/at&t. Unforunately, I was forced to leave my job of 10 years, but if at&t called me tomorrow I will be right there. Excellent benefits, excellent pay, and a great enviroment."

good,"It is a very good to work for. Great package and work life balance. The management depends on who is your boss."
good,Working for AT&T was both rewarding and challenging. The best managers to work for were the ones that were promoted from within the company. The challenge was finding ways to help improve within the company. The reward was being a part of that process.
good,Professional atmosphere and great people to work with. The scope of work was challenging but also encouraged you to better yourself and learn new ways to complete your job with better time and quality.
good,"Me gustaria trabajar ahi otra vez, no lo pensaria fos veces"
good,"Independent working environment"
good,Es una gran empresa para trabajar y ganar pero requiere todo tu tiempo yno se le puede brindar apoyo y atención ala familia esto afecta por que es horario quebrado yno vives serca de tu casa
good,Not much to recount. I was in my mid-twenties and do not recall to many real details. This is ridiculous that I have to meet a certain number of characters just to write a job summary that I don't recall!
good,"Great culture, great tools and great customer focus.  I would recommend this company to anyone that is looking for a fast paced environment and are looking to work up through the ranks."
good,"High volume of customers on phone and face to face. Workplace was fun and we were a team! A lot of support from management and peers. The day would start with wonderful coffee we would all contribute to the coffee club and usually someone would bring great things to eat like cookies, pastries, fruit, nuts etc. It felt like we all were family as most of us had worked together for several decades. "
good,There is room for advancement and very good benefits.  I work in KCMO and live in Topeka.  Right now the commute is challenging because I have a young child and would prefer working closer to home.  But AT&T is a great  place to work.

good,AT&T is constantly growing at a rapid pace so the opportunities are endless for growth within the company. AT&T has taught me how to manage a team properly in order to reach monthly quotas.

good,Excelente empresa en la formación de carácter de los empleados en un nicho de mercado con alta complejidad y aceptación del mismo.
good,Stressful yet fast paced environment. If looking for a good place to start a career and you are good talking on the phone this place is it. Otherwise forget it.
good,"I enjoyed the call center work a lot, actually. It was sometimes stressful because by the time somebody called me, they were usually in a bad mood. I usually always found a way to cheer them up, work out their needs, fix the situation, and ultimately satisfy my customers."
good,My co-workers and the management team were always supportive. They were always there to give feedback on how you can be better! Constant training and updates on products to keep you informed of upcoming changes.
good,Loved the job and the people i worked with. Had to retire as I had a bad knee that required me sitting and I was unable to get a doctors note that satisfied the Company.
good,At&t has a well structured working environment.  Most of the management worked at the largest public accounting firms and adopt the best practices. The systems are being improved and growth is being made by constant mergers.  There is opportunity for growth if your city is expanded following the recent mergers..
good,Most enjoyable part of my Job and they're were many. Was being able to contribute to each project and being supported each executive team member associated.
good,"Excellent benefits, they match 401k, it can be stressful at times. Paid vacations, no sick leave. They do outsource some jobs overseas. They do have some unrealistic goals."
good,I started career at AT&T. They train you like no other employer. They are innovate. Bleeding edge. Driven to succeed. lots of advancement opportunities.
good,Would have stayed but moved Atlanta group to California.  Work was challenging and management was supportive.  Life work balance was possible.  Benefits are great.
good,Muy buena empresa  exelente ambiente laboral asi como muy buenas instalaciones y buen sistema de trabajo tambien te dan buenas herramie tas para trabajar
good,Management is very supportive but it is a constant grind to get sales. Customers call in about issues with service or billing and every call needs to contain an offer for new service.
good,Friendly environment and inviting culture with multiple work groups and organizations under one roof. Newly renovated workplace with market area. Gym with access for employees and showers in main bathrooms.
good,"I loved working there! It is a face pace environment at times, but the workers and staff are great. Always an opportunity for advancement. Great benefits that   is a plus...."
good,I liked it for what its worth. I got along great with all my teammates and managers. shift bidding was great unless you got stuck with a shift you did not want. They dont have sick days which can cause problems. You have to go through the IDCS to get missed days covered if it was due to sickness or other medical issues. The IDCS is horrible. AT&T needs to find a different way to help emploeeys get those days covered.
good,Great place to start your career and advance just gotta be ready for the long haul. Great environment and customer relations. Upper management is awesome.
good,"Nice respectful co workers nice relaxed place to work, call volume was really slow but the training and management was really good and helpful, hard staying at work when the calls is slow on most days."

good,"It is one of the best companies to work."
good,"A typical work day begins at 8:00 am stocking the truck with work materials needed for the day, pre- calling the customer and driving the company vehicle to work location. The job can be an install or repair beginning with an installation at the facility box making connections, checking signal on the pole, making preparations for inside work, and installing boxes and equipment on the inside after running lines. Repairs can entail repairing all the materials and equipement mentioned above, listening and fixing any issues for the customer. I am 1 out of 16 where we all work separately. We lend aid to one anther depending on the needs of the person. Needs could be provide over the phone or coming to lend a physical hand. The hardest part of the day is not knowing what you are what kind of job you are showing up to.  By far the most enjoyable part of the day is to see a satisfied customers face one you have either finished or repaired their services."
good,Management was great. Positive and upbeat atmosphere. Music was always playing in the building which I believe helped foster a great environment.
good,"From my first job at AT&T to my last, I experienced working in Accounting preparing corporate budgets to being a Conference Supervisor responsible for coordinating and planning executive level conferences across the country to Transmission Engineering working on sophisticated telecommunications equipment.  During my time with AT&T I grew professionally from being hired as a clerk to supervising 10 employees, providing job performance feedback, speaking publicly to large crowds and finally working with some very intense technical equipment and assessing its performance.  I  am very grateful for the wide variety of experiences and grew tremendously from the experience. I left AT&T to be a mom to 3 incredible children and can truly say that was my greatest life accomplishment. That job was the hardest yet most rewarding of my life."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and great people overall. I really enjoyed working at at&t and would do it all over again."
good,"Over my career at AT&T I consistently learned that customer service is first and goes hand in hand with technology advancements. Overall the work force is a family and works to support on another in their daily work life. "
good,"I was able to work with several high levels managers, and gain insight to their jobs. A typical day for rewarding for me, got to interact with peers, and upper managers."
good,"I was hired in through Manpower as the Receptionist and worked hard to earn a promotion to a Publishing and Advertising Representative or Staff Associate level III. The compay offered great hours, benefits and working conditions. Unfortunately they had to downsize during the economic decline and my positon was eliminated in 2009."
good,fun job good everyday atmosphere looking for something better great people working for the company hardest part would be some of the things required

good,"I loved working at Bluegrass Cellular.  I was given opportunities, education, and experience that I have used throughout my entire career life.  Bluegrass offers decent pay, a great balance of life and work, awesome benefits, and the best 401K program."
good,"This position connected me with so many people from diverse backgrounds all with very similar work ethics and a goal to achieve both individually and as a company. The management was very helpful in a way that allowed you to grow and learn on your own, but be available when you need motivation and coaching.

good,"The managers were absolutely the nicest people. They understood confidentiality. They were very caring to make sure you had the proper help you needed. They have a beautiful cafeteria with delicious food! If you work hard at your job, you can get major bonuses.The hardest part were the customers that tried to bring you down. Also, Direct TV went out of their way to help out customers who were having financial hardships but it created ""credit monsters"". Meaning, customers were always demanding a lower bill without changing their programming."
good,"Really enjoyed my time here, I even went back and worked in the same location a second time. Advancement was not an issue and was available"
good,"My day was always busy, I would get to my desk and log in and instantly calls would call in. Calls would vary discussing and walking people through there bill and charges and after the reason for the call was resolved we were asked to upgrade or sell them service, or ""bundle"" together there products to give them more features for ultimately less cost. Hardest part of my job was being able to calm down the customers, in reality no one likes receiveing a high phone bill but when you call in to a call center and receive a snotty repressenative it makes it worse, I always feel as if I gave the customer time to explain there issue and then resolved it for them but it was difficult to help when customers usually started out the conversation yelling at you. The good thing about the office is that you were in a cubicle with a co worker so if you had any questions you would be able to almost solve them together and management was always there to help."
good,As a customer representative responsibilities include answering all customers questions about their cell phones bills or troubleshooting their products. Selling products and plans are also included. The challenging part is handling customers that are angry but the enjoyable part is accomplishing your goal.
good,"Sometimes the stats can be overwhelming and getting put on steps of discipline can be more added stress but the job itself is great, you just have to watch out for disrespectful/rude customers."
good,"Arrive, no physical clock in. Congregate with team and manager, discuss how many tickets need to be accomplished. Dispatch on a job. Call customer before arrival, and map out plan to complete task thoroughly. We are timed based on severity of task, and graded on efficiency."
good,"There were never typical days in any position held and that's what is just part of my learning lesson. Management for the most part listened to input of employees, I was fortunate to have worked with the absolute people ever. I can honestly say my co-workers were and some still are my extended family. The hardest part was knowing we were getting laid off and watching many friends pass away. The most enjoyable has and will always be meeting my lifelong friends and family."
good,Work was steady and rewarding. There is an immense amount of training to keep you abreast of all the products/services the company offers.
good,"Amazing company with great people, I have never worked with sales people with more integrity and great work ethic. I could work here for the rest of my career."
good,Assist customers with there telephone service . Each persons needs maybe different some need help with new service others need assistance with already established service. I've learn to listen carefully and let the customer know you care about there issues. Let them know you will do your very best to fix or find the answers they need. This is a independent position you have very little interaction with the manager. We are a team and its important that we work together. The hardest part of this job was not being able to fix the problem sooner when the customer is very irate. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you fix the problem a customer has and they remember to say thank you.
good,"I loved my coworkers and management staff. It was always exciting to learn the new products and I loved to be on the phones, the only down side was that some customers weren't always friendly but that's par for the course."
good,"-a typical shift would require visiting several customers tin order to correct /fix any problems or concerns with their telecommunications equipment."
good,"Working in the telecommunications field allowed me to acquire many skills.  AT&T provided excellent opportunities for advancement.

good,I worked in several aspects of customer service.  all in management positions. My last position required me to work both independently and as a team to meet prescribed metrics.  It involved with working with external customer along with internal people. The last position was working with billing complaints with business customers.   I had to negotiate adjustments based on my investigation of the issue. The hardest part of the job was meeting some of the metric standards when our team lost individuals and was not back filled.  The most enjoyable part of the job was solving customer problems and negotiating to a win win resolution. The team that I worked with was dedicated and hard working.  They helped to make a stressful job coop able.

good,"Great place to work fun people interesting work."
good,"It’s a career. You meet great people. The job is different every day. The only thing that was bad was the fact that if AT&T does something to upset customers, it’s taken out on the front line."

good,muy buena la paga y el mejor trato de los coordinadores
good,"Good Work environment"
good,Only drawback is that AT&T has aged internal systems and a mess of outsourced customer service sources complicating resolutions on both consumer and employee sides.
good,Always plenty of work typical day begin at 7am and ends at 5pm or 5:30pm depending on the work load. I worked in an office management were in and out I was a frame attendant short for inside technician.The hardest part of the job was pulling the cable sometimes when you the correct connection could not be founded.

I would say the hardest part would be when your not able to completely satisfy the customer."

good,AT&T is a great environment to work because they provide you with a good salary with health care which covers both you and your family.
good,I worked the second shift band from 10 am to 6pm. I answered inbound calls only and called customers back to see if the troubleshooting was successful. What I learned from this job is different functions on a phone and different resets. Management was awesome. Whenever there was an issue they responded very quickly. The hardest part of the job was customers that yelled through the phone and it was an issue that I just could not resolve. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things about phones every day.
good,"Fun and exciting work atmosphere"
good,how to deal with irate customers was the hardest part of my job. playing competitive games against my teammates was enjoyable as well as helping customers understand their service.
good,I enjoyed my time at AT&T. I would probably give anything to go back. Management was there when you needed them. You could tell they actually cared about their employees.
good,Work day was looking foward going to work to be with fun and wanting to help customers meet goals and see or meet friends
good,"A typical day consist of greeting every customer that walks in the door, also handling the traffic of the store."

good,I have worked at this company for 13yrs. I have great coworkers and we are fast paced environment
good,typical day was some what hetic at times.. overall pretty good job great co workers for the most part. Always meeting new people and having fun with each other. It was stressful at times but thats usual for any job
good,this direct tv branch was a scam and I would sell their product and never get commission. I had multiple sales and would call the customer to see if our product  got installed and my manager would take credit for the sale
good,"I was a Secretary to 20 people..  Answering phones and typing for them all and ordering supplies they needed.  The department was "
good,You can arrive on time but you must wait on management whom is always late and then they have their favorites. The working environment is unorganized and they don't be honest about commission.
good,this was a great place to work also the pay was great clean and treats employees like employees what else can i say i made a lot of money here.just check it out
good,great company good support staff learned a lot in a little time great place to start and expand a IT career great work schedule training truly provided all the keys necessary to be sucessful
good,The job is easy and the people are cool to work with the but hours are not easy to work. I started out at 9-6 and my next shift after 5 years is 1-10.
good,I would coordinate a p.e class and any playground activities with students from kinder to fifth grade. Anything that would go on the playground area i would take care of. I would also take care of students in there class room while teacher needed to assist a meeting or was running late.
good,"It was a good job, but it just was not for me. I was a contractor so i had to buy everything that we need to use for the installations every week. We received no benefits so that was another bad thing. Bonuses were terrible and wasted to much gas money. We would travel from Ohio to Kentucky and down to Xenia, Dayton and would not really be home with my family and really never had free time. and that is why it was not for me."
good,"I enjoyed working for ATT, I worked a lot of overtime for the company. I wish we received benefits but since it was through a temp agency I didn't. I resigned from the position due to conflicting schedules when I started my education at Remington College."
good,This was my fist real custmer service job in a call center I was used bing face to face to my customers making them happy at At&t Ihad to gain the cust trust over the phone they had a unique way of making agents professional
good,Se trabaja con varios favoritismos y con pocas oportunidades de crecimiento al igual un nulo apoyo a los empleados para seguir laborando con ellos
good,"This job is very stressful. Something is always changing and you would never know that it is."
good,"A productive work day is when you are able to help every single customer during an entire shift without the need of contacting a sup or mgr. it,s not always easy to deal with unhappy customers on the phone all day long. So a productive day will be all issues resolved by the technician in a timely fashion without the help of anybody."
good,AT&T threw great events for friends and family. We engaged with the community and we love to give to the united way. Great pay ans benefits! Hardest part of the job was dealing with stats.
good,I worked for AT&T for 9 months in Detroit under contract. I never had a direct contact with AT&T. All was done by reports. A great company to work for.
good,"horario flexible, se trabaja bajo mi misma responsabilidad sin supervision."
good,"Helped me grow more into my skills, great team, wonderful people very team oriented everyone picks each other up and very friendly ."
good,"Cool place to work manager wasn’t the best but the company as a whole is cool. On your feet a lot, not a great environment for pregnant employees. Great benefits"
good,"A typical day starts at 4;30 AM and this is for seven days a week"
good,You have to help customers with their business needs on a dialogue with the customer and have to read between the lines to see if you can sell them a product to benefit their business
good,"Customer Service is not the main focus and either is the customer. Just their wallet. If you apply here, it's not about helping people who need assistance."
good,I wont work for a corporation like this. I am not a drone and i wont be treated like one. Its a be seen not heard place to work  I did not like it. This is something ive faced since working after college.
good,"Competitive atmosphere "
good,"there is NO time for family, you will not have a family life if you work in the call center or retail. you are just a number to the managers and they could less."
good,"I recommnded to a family member, and she's been there for the best two years. Very supportive team mates, and encouraging training to prepare employees for the sales floor."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at AT&T but the latest changes and commission structure have affected the reps. Managers think that by writing reps up they will make them produce more, wrong! because nobody produces under fear. Benefits are better than most other employers."
good,We were like a family in Wendys we all worked together to get things done.We all use to hang out outside of work too.But I had my son early so I had to stop workin and j wish I could go back because I would even though I know the same crew isn't there
good,the few months i worked there they had 4 other people quit or get fired. the few that stayed just sat at their computers looking for another job. It was that bad. the managers would make you feel like you were 3 inches tall and he had no idea what he was doing on the salesfloor either. I was NEVER trained. i was there almost 3 months and never received a proper training. so i spent all my time training on my own doing my own online att training courses. The rapport between employees was awful. nice to your face then gossip the second you arent in the room. TERRIBLE place to work for. GLAD TO BE RID OF THAT JOB!
good,"I enjoy my job with AT&T, but i'm capable of a lot more then this job has to offer."
good,"Alorica isn't part of ATT; we're contracted employee's so it was interesting to see. I enjoyed my coworkers but the Supervisors and Management had kind of a bi-polar attitude, which I expected but it is still not something you should be used to at any job."
good,Management has become subservient to people that feel they have an entitlement to their current position. People are staying longer and feel they do not have to work during their last years. All I hear is I have 1 or 2 more good years left. This demoralizes people that want to do stay and/or need a job.
good,The pay is ok. the managers are not flexible. overtime is mandatory. Good job for three to four months before moving on. high turnover
good,"The job itself is very challenging and fun, the management and environment can be more professional, also the work load and hourly rate didn 't match"
good,When my systems work i enjoy helping customers out on their issues and concerns.
good,Back in the day it was great to work there.  Being under the AT&T umbrella afforded nice benefits and a decent salary.  They promoted a team environment with the ability to attain quarterly bonuses.
good,Stream Global is somewhat a hard company to work with.  But At&t is a wonderful company and really do care about their employee's
good,"Just like many other big corporation tries to get as much out of their employees as possible. Over the past two years they increasingly try to get as much work out of their employees as possible, while at the same time trying to pay us less and less and lower our benefits,"
good,"es un trabajo que requiere esfuerzo mas físico que mental , donde se aprende todos los días, los jefes exigen resultados cada hora, los compañeros son bien, lo mas difícil del trabajo son los horarios, lo que mas me gusta es la calidad."
good,Not a bad sales job but Poor work/life job. Retail was ok it was the in home part of the job that made it not work. It started off great but management changed the atmosphere and made constant changes to our schedule and pay structure.
good,"If I can speak freely, I would say the company was not a bad company at all the people and etc was terrible the pay was not even straight forward and benefit did have any"
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T because I learned a lot about technology. I also enjoyed those who I worked with. The hardest part of my job was when I was placed in stores that did not have a lot of customer volume so it was hard to meet the sales quota for the month sometimes.
good,Excellent pay good benefits just not a lot of work around with schedules. Most management members were not very honest and fair which made and already stressful job even more stressfull.
good,Job and work life balance was a struggle. Lack of job advancement opportunities. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers we built strong connections
good,"The hours are horrible, management was great. No work life balance in a field position. I cannot say i do or do not recommend because it had its benefits but if you like work life balance and are not single its not right for you."
good,Too big of a company that is trying too many changes. Management is shuffled around too often. Leads to poor company morale. Company is too inflexible working with employees. Too beauracratic.
good,"got along great with coworkers challenging job, no opportunity for true advancement again great coworkers nothingmorenothing less more training needed"
good,"Great for younger people. Don't dream of becoming a KM/DM unless you are a teacher's pet. Only the favorites get the job, even if they are not cut out for it."
good,"Troubleshooting, installation, and repair of phone lines. The hardest part of the job was fixing storm damage."
good,"As a call center Supervisor there are no typical days. Every day is diffrent, a diffrent approach towards the goals. Monitorings and daily coachings are just a part of the day. motivation of a team of 15-20 reps on a daily basis to obtain certin goals. Meeting sales qoutas as well as certain metrics, being able to change your training approach depending on the rep that you are showing."
good,Was a good job shipped over seas.• Oversaw and coordinated the disconnect processes associated with provisioning main billing systems
good,At&t is a overall good company but you have the people that work for the company that don’t back there employees up. The managers also need not to make the sales reps do fraudulent things and then the reps get fired but the managers still retain a job.
good,"a fast pace 40hrs plus work place, and learn a lot of products and services. Many different managers that came in and out of the store, sometime hard to work with due to making numbers."
good,"I look forward to going to work every morning ... I work with a Great bunch of guys . We are a State of the Art Company, we are computer dispatched and self managing most of the time. Very Safety conscious and goal oriented. A Great place to work if you like being in several places during the day and working out in the elements"
good,"If you have a family and are trying to grow within this company, I would suggest to find other options. Your hard work goes unnoticed within this company unfortunately."
good,"AT&T is a very cool place to work, the management selection process is not based off of knowledge or work ethics but rather who you know in the company, and because of this, it creates a tyrannical environment. The company itself is great but if you are lower level please watch your step... I would recommend anyone to work there."
good,"answered incoming calls "
good,"ATT Mobility, my call center is amazing. The management and coworkers are great. However cooperate is not. The rules and the way things go in the call center due to things out of our control are no fun. Schedules are not the greatest. We work weekends. They are trying to make it better in OUR call center but over all they need a better plan for work life balance. Hardest part about the job there are two things. One is the customers when they freak out and curse are disrespectful. I struggle with that a lot. Two would be meeting the metrics. Sometimes they are ridiculous and impossible it seems. I just do my best each day and go home knowing that. The best thing about the job is I love all of my coworkers and the entire management team. They are amazing and really want us to be successful. Its nice to know they have our backs even when cooperate doesn't."
good,Too stressful.....too little real management material.....benefits and pay are great but not worth the stress and balance between work and home life..
good,"It's what you make it. Good Luck.  good luck have a nice day, i have learned many things that I unable to share but good stuff. Management (employee )"
good,"The company is growing at a pace that causes good workers to become overwhelmed and lost in the fray. There are very little options for advancement and you are treated like a human resource and not a person. The pay is good, but the quotas in over 10 different metrics is extreme."
good,Troubling shooting u verse equipment that requires individuals and families to connect to their internet. Call center atmosphere in a small town.  Always had issues inside the department.
good,coached peers to reach their personal or company goals. answered calls inbound and on dialer campaign. Filed Faxed and investigated payment claims. worked in executive appeals
good,"This was a high stress job, the pay was very good but it wasn't worth the stress. Management was not consistent, for example, if you were on a team, your manager will instruct you to do your job one way, then if you were transferred to another team, that manager may not agree with how you were trained while on the other team and will instruct you to do your job a different way."
good,un ambiente lleno de estrés explotación laboral y amenazas del empleador
good,"very strict attendance policy, no personal and worklife balance. my coworkers are great, manager are always under a lot of pressure so they stress out the consultants"
good,I was let go from this job. Not because of performance but because our store was bought out and there were only 2 openings in other stores at the time. The managers took those jobs.
good,Hard labor. If you're disabled this isn't a job for you. I'm currently seeking employment else where. The work day doesn't end when it's scheduled to.
good,"a typical day at work consist of arriving and being ready to begin your job at the time your tour begin.  I learned that no matter what type of person you come in contact with, to always remain calm and courteous. Management was all about making the quota and not able satisfying the customer. My co-workers were just that co-workers.  I respected them no matter what there issues were.  The hardest part of my job was receiving an irate customer and not being able to satisfying them no matter what I offered and they cancelled their service.  the most enjoyable part of my job was one call resolution with the customer being satisfied."
good,A overall busy day dealing with customer accounts and etc Interface with customers via inbound or outbound calls or the Internet for
good,Great Company very innovative always advancing in technology actually is the Worlds largest Innovative company.
good,"Going door to door is definitely not for me, that’s all you will be doing if you do door to door sales for AT&T fiber.  You get paid training $50 a day and on top of that you work six days a week, I’m surprised they don’t make you work seven"
good,"Sales is the name of the game, hardest part of the day is a bad sales performance. typical day is you answer calls and try to get them to buy a product."
good,This company had structured the compensation for the employees where it was to their advantage of how to I was paid. This created a class action suit. My last year with the company three installation techs were injured two resulted in deaths. These were falls from ladders. The pros are that you could drive your company vehicle home. Also your route for the day would always start from home.
good,"chose to opt out, i prefer not to answer any questions at this time,I have nothing to state , decline to state my opinion. I prefer not to state an answer"
good,"A typical day  at AT&t is very upbeat. Back to back calls most days. Not much of a work life balance. Its a loud place to work, lots of music going and there is also competitions between teams. AT&T also has a lot of outside things that we are involved in the community."
good,"A great company to work for. Started our mornings with a lot of motivation. very long hours, did not have a lot time for my daughter and other personal time."
good,Working there was fun a short lived time. Nothing more to than i got some co workers that have become more like great friends. Micromanaging was definitely present
good,"You can advance within AT&T Inc. every 18+ months if there are new opportunities that present themselves. However, depending on the department you work in. You may have to drive in everyday and that can be draining with the Atlanta traffic every morning or evening."
good,se aprende a manejar mas la paciencia y tolerancia al cliente aprende a escuchar y a gestionar
good,"Comienzan de muy buen humor, pero terminan dandote una apuñalada por la espalda."
good,"Great company, awesome benefits. But it gets slow at times. They work you to the bone, when there is work. And customer is always right. But overal an ok place to work."
good,"After working for this client for 2 and a half years, you notice the lack of accountability in some of the expectations that their employee's set. Would love to be continued employment with this company seeing as spending the last 2 and a half years immersing myself in their plans, rates, and procedures of their systems, makes me an genuine asset to their company."
good,"Worked there for 24 users and them let go. Thanks for nothing not a good place for a career, company doesn’t have compassion for employees, Your just a number."
good,I work for a collections agency for AT&T and the work environment is horrible. A typical day work consist of being on the phone for seven hours convincing debtors to pay their bills. Management threatens our jobs daily if goal isn't met. It's also a dirty environment. The only I enjoy about working for Prince Parker & Associates is that it accommodates with my son's school schedule.
good,I worked for a company that worked as a contractor for AT&T. we worked for the U-verse side. door to door. it wasn't easy and it was very cut throat. over all it wasn't good for my person.
good,i remember crying over some of the calls and the work. i did love the people that worked their just the bitter people that would call and have so much rudeness in them that it over shadowed what they wanted to get done. it hurt me and who i wanted to be.
good,Overall great job for the money. Unfortunately I want to move up and career advancement is extremely hard. Kind of get the run around til you're fed up. Would only say work there for money.
good,"I was under the employ of Alpine Access,  AT&T was there biggest client. I cannot give a review of AT&T benefits, or bonuses or management, since I did not work for AT&T but for Alpine Access"
good,When I worked there they didn't even have coffee in the waiting room and offered literally nothing in the form of culture in the location I was in.  I came to work and left feeling like my brain was waiting away.
good,"AT&T is a great place to learn the ropes of retail.  It is a large company, so what you experience will differ based on what team and area you are working.  It is also a transforming company, which the company provides ample resources to skill-up, but you still have leadership teams that either haven't skilled up themselves or understand what the transformation means for them.  This results in situations were the message from the very top doesn't mix with the message from direct leadership."
good,"AT&T was a great place, I had something like 10-13 supervisor/managers in the last 4 years. Mid-management is the real issue and sounds like AT&T is working on it."
good,Was a great place to work but high call volume. Your work is never good enough. Company allows customer  survey to determine your bonus. If your customer's cell service sucks due to towers in disrepair the customers negative response is held against your personal stats. BEST PAY IN TOWN. So you hate the company but love the pay and benefits. Always felt my job was on the line.
good,Att good company I started working for then they start changing in compensation and demanding the same level of work. The pay was affecting our bills specially have such loyalty with a company for a long period of time.
good,"I loved working for AT&T.  Great family atmosphere at my work location.  Great benefits. Training was awesome.  However for someone with a young family like myself, family time is very limited due to retail hours."
good,AT&T wasn't the problem. It was Coworx staffing who didn't treat the employees fairly. It was always a popularity contest based on who you know and not your achievements.
good,"I really enjoy AT&T as a company, everyday is very different and you always have something to do. "
good,"A typical workday starts off with an inspirational sales meeting in which produc knowlege is tested and objections are covered. New turf is discussed and a plan of action is determined. From that point turf is printed out assigned and the crew leaves with field manager to assigned field. Travel is a big part of this job often times up to 100 miles away. When arrive at turf you begin to work your lead sheet. i consist of door to door knocking and selling att uverse, putting people into yearly or bi yearly conracts."
good,Not a place I would ever recommend. They pay extremely well but it is to get you to stay and put up with the policies and procedures of one of Americas most shady employers. Even the customer relations and visible parts of the business model suggest the only they care about is the almighty dollar and have little regard for the mental and emotional well being of their customers or employees.
good,"recuerdo que viajamos muchisimo y cuando llegamos a la plata llovia"
good,"I walk in say hello to every one including new walking in clients ,get right to work to reach my sales monthly sales goal of 88 cell phone contracts and 14 home products example home internet home Television.I have less than 30 days to reach this goal.I love the excitement and pressure behind a sales goal very motivating to me ,While doing this attending to management co workers and clients every need from cleaning the bathroom to installing new software to a laptop i sold a customer"
good,Not the best. Definitely a company that does not love to compensate their staff.
good,Get ready to work 10-13 hours a day. Hardest part of the job is working in attics in the summer.
good,I enjoyed working with my customers. Good benefits. But poor management.
good,My supervisor went on medical leave and had a jealous second supervisor a old Cwa supervisor no chance for advancement and this guy wrote a bad performance review on two of his guys cost AT&T not to rehire us bad bad
good,Competitive pay great but work/life terrible. Never make plans before nor after your scheduled work day... not going to make it.......................
good,"AT&T is a great company from a product, technology and compensation standpoint. The work culture is very stressful and nobody really feels like they have job security. I have been with the company for 19 years and still feel like I have no job security."
good,"management was very nice; Enjoyed the manager and team I worked with. I learned a lot , just wished the job assignment would have lasted longer. I love the world of 911 and working with different peole and personalities."
good,"AT&T is a quality company with great benefits including being part of a union, and a quality commission structure and benefits. the only draw back to being a AT&T employee is not having time for my family."
good,"Mostly at most jobs one had to be in the ""click"" to advance."
good,This was a very competitive job with quotas that had to be met everyday and on a monthly basis.  The management there needed more training on how to relay the changes (that were made frequently) to the employees.
good,"I got laid off, despite being a union member.  That pretty much says it all, but I'm required to enter 150 characters for this review (and this will make 159.)"
good,"There were many opportunities for advancement, which I took advantage of."
good,My experience with AT&T was certainly a positive one. The training is very good and I was prepared to  succeed when getting on the sales floor. It is tough to move within the company once you are a sales rep.
good,Not much care for the employees happiness or morale in the workplace. Manager consistently violating negotiated contract to avoid responsibilities. Just a overall stressful and non productive work environment.
good,A typical day at work would be irate customers but I loved the way I was able to clam them down. I learned how to be patient with customers. The hardest part of my job would be the customers who call with dead of a family member or having home issues. I always made it my best to do what I could do for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is laughing with the customer and the bonuses for hitting your quota
good,fun enthusiastic fast pace work environment with constant change so you must be flexible from day to day heavy customer service required but plenty of on the job training
good,Its a really stressfull place bad managment there... looks like a lil kids playground. Its a good job if you can put up with the customers and the mangament and as a first job.
good,Aprendí que estar en un call Center es recibir llamadas de gente enojada y que no respetan la privacidad la empresa de las personas al momento de tipificar mal
good,commission-based sales. every metric was considered in every month (including customer satisfaction ratings). An array of products to sell but that also means many more metrics to meet.
good,AT&T is an awesome place to work. Advancement is available and highly suggested. Location is key to success........................................................
good,Managers have too much on them to take care of individual employees. Morale was always low. employees always took hits for call backs even if it was hardware or software issues and customer related. the company itself is a great place to work. Uverse side could better.
good,This company is very inventive. I enjoy the technology and new services.  Sales can be very demanding and weekends are required to reach goals. Schedule can be demanding depending on customers in store. Required overtime can be asked
good,A fast pace work environment with a great team. Everyone brought something to the table to generate reports for the field to perform the success of the job.
good,"Great pay, long hours sometimes, some days short hours, as with any job management can be great or horrible just depends who you get. Work culture sucked"
good,"Good benefits, decent pay, lack of decent leadership. Lots of jobs available but the company has no loyalty and everyone is just a number. Performance reviews are not fair."
good,"I would have to say overall when AT&T was Illinois Bell it was an excellent company to work for. However, over the years as changes were made it became grueling. My position was phased out several times before finally I was laid off. Only options were to relocate to city and state I was unfamiliar with or take on a opportunity completely out of my field of work. As a customer service rep I was offer a job as a truck driver."
good,"Company does not trust its employees."
good,"Very good benefits from services to medical and dental insurance. The work/life balance is horrible. You start at a certain time but never know when you will be going home at night,"
good,Not wiling to maintain and workforce in Chicago. The compensation was great. And the union IBEW 21 was definitely a must. AT&T needs to come back to Chicago.
good,No job security but great pay. Fast paced sales environment. Great discounts and benefits. Must be able to sell products to survive the job. Does not work around family or outside work. Job always must come before anything.
good,"equiring initiative, self-motivation and a wide range of skills. For one"
good,I worked for AT&T 10 years. The pay and benefits were great. There was no work/life balance. I never had a weekend off unless it was vacation or I called in. Management was terrible.
good,"Great work location, awesome people with interesting work. Management was open and available. This was the land line group and much different from the wireless group."
good,"Sales, cust service, high paced sales. Sold cellular, direct tv, Internet, home phone. Was also a member of my local union and was the secretary treasurer."
good,Buena presencia como empresa motivando al empleado a dar lo mejor de ellos y dejandole saber que tienen su apollo. Ademas te dan todas las heramientas.
good,"As an Outside Account Executive got to performed all aspects of territory management to include protecting and growing AT&T’s Middle Market business customer’s revenue as well as acquire new customers. Overcame competitive situations by providing a high level of customer contact to establish an enduring relationship through face to face visits."
good,"very good environment"
good,You are put into a box and expected to stay in that box even if you have an idea! Those ideas are ignored for the egos of those in charge. They feel like they are above you and don't listen to the voice of their employees
good,"typical day as a prem tech"
good,I approach my job early than expected. our meeting starts promptly at 0700. Safety and Quality is covered and our work is handed out. The current manager instructs us of our different jobs. The most enjoyable part of my job is simple just work.
good,Was excited about working for them then started me out with 13.00. not enough for all the day to day problems you face. They start you low and then expect you to perform like you make 23 an hr
good,"A typical day at AT&T would include signing on to my computer and proceeding to take call from customers. Helping customers with their internet issue, getting them back connected to the network. I learned a lot about the internet and technology that I would have never know if it wasn't for AT&T. I loved and got along with my co-workers very well, I still miss and keep in contact with them. The hardest part of the job was the schedule and the confinements of the call center, being attached to a phone for 8 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ever changing waves of technology, I always learned something new."
good,"Aprendi muchas cosas, creo siempre una experiencia te deja muchas enseñanzas tanto buenas como malas, pero hay que aprender ha sobrellevarlas y crear un mejor clima de trabajo."
good,"Great place to work. Unionized which brings its own set of challenges and opportunities.  Systems have allot of information which presents its own set of challenges and opportunities."
good,I enjoyed my time and I do not have anything to say about this place I would not like to provide any feedback at this time
good,retail sales is fun job always a different experience. however my coworkers call in alot which means the rest of us have to cover extra shifts.
good,I loved the customer service side of the company and having to deal with the customers. I enjoyed working with the systems because I learned new things within the company.
good,Commission lowered every year. Recognition very up and down through the year. Accountability there but very selective. There is absolutly no work life balance.
good,AT&T provides competitive salaries and flexible hours. Its benefits are average and declining. They tend to outsource jobs with little to no notice.
good,On a day to day we sold service to the customers that called in.. It was a great job if you like selling..
good,"è un lavoro pesante,molte ore di lavoro e poco retribuito...ambiente di lavoro pesante per il mio carattere allegro"
good,"Great Company to work for, management just needs some work. Great Benefits and treats employees well."
good,I believe the job is there for some people just not myself personally
good,"We were on the phone discussing sales opportunities with customers that would call in to the office.  I learned how to deal with stress when working at a stressful job.  I loved the managers that I worked with, as they encouraged me to go further.  The hardest part of the job was knowing there would come a time when the job would end, as AT&T would close offices and shift people around, mostly to other states.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, I loved talking on the phone with people and it showed, as I was always able to meet my sales quotas."
good,"I am not a sales person by trade, I work with my husband. What I have learned is there are a lot of no's in this field. I manage myself my co-workers they are cool. Setting out with a plan and having it fall apart has to be the hardest part of my job. Working with my husband makes it better"
good,"Productive and fun workplace with excellent environment."
good,Great benefits and pay but not a lot of job security. Nice way to meet new people. Union job.
good,"this is truly  a  job that every one should  at be employed atMetamorphosis is more than a metaphor for Ma Bell. The telecom giant has been through more changes than a butterfly. Most recently AT&T has agreed to be acquired by SBC Communications in a cash and stock deal valued at $16 billion. AT&T is still a long-distance leader in the US with more than 30 million customers, but competition has driven rates to all-time lows and the company is no longer seeking new customers in its most traditional line of business. The company's biggest revenue generator and its new focus is the AT&T Business Services unit, which offers advanced data communications and accounts for nearly 75% of total revenues. The company's global network is among the largest and most advanced. "
good,Wonderful laid Back environment. Great benefits. lots of chances to earn bonus.
good,"AT&T Mobility (Farmers Branch), Dallas TX"
good,I enjoy installoing DirecTv. It is a wonderful company because it has great service and Tech's that take l of pide in their work and the company
good,"I really liked working there, Management is horrible & very ignorant. But for the most part the money was great & I loved my customers."
good,When customer have a pacific need their is nothing but a win/win situation all day long. Each customers need was different and very challenging in its on status. By interacting to slove the situation made the day short and exciting in it-self.
good,Great company with even better benefits. Only issue is you will never be rewarded for performance. No way to move up. Most of the managment team is 60 years or older and have no idea it is time to retire.
good,Typical day load truck up and leave with a set of work request. I learn all of the telecommunication equipment that was updated. Saw managers every moirning to get work. worked alone 90% of the time dealing with the weather.The chance to fix any problem i had ran into
good,"The position currently working on is great but the Manaemnet is bad they does not known what they are doing and they enjoy hardest to they technician which are the people doing the work. And company does not give good discount to there technician. And benefits kick on after six month, if you are a family person does not help. And the hours are killing you can not live your personally life with your kids and wife. If the company want to be number one in U-verse please change your rules and Management."
good,call center life has it's pros and cons. the environment is nice the people is nice and at&t could do better about being on one accord.
good,We have been sold to another company and in two years we will be let go. I need more stability with the work place
good,"no supervisors looking over your shoulder, you get your assignment in the morning and go to work"
good,Assisted customers in sales of cell phones through the company Best Buy. Helped customers upgrade their accounts and find the cell phone solutions that best suited their lifestyle.
good,"Standard work day scheduled jobs and areas shift consistently, but I am home every night. I've learned working in a fast pace and ever changing technical word that products and service change with little notice. Must be willing to adapt in order to succeed. Benefits are very good,"
good,"This is a management position but with no subordinates.  It is a sales position and there is a ton of freedom.  You must be self motivated and have a great attitude.  The pay scale keeps changing, so that’s not cool."
good,"I loved my job at at&t, but upper management makes the job very stressful, but constantly threatening, and carrying out, surpluses every 6 months or less. the company needs to focus more on its employees than it does on buying up more and more companies."
good,not the best sales job but also  not the worse ! the hours are okay and the pay is decent ! you will have to sell a lot of direct tv which they fail to mention during the interview
good,"I was a WIFI engineer designing deploying WIFI, Controllers, Cabling, Switches, Routers, The problem I had was there were times I was working 120 hours a week to get the job completed."
good,company has its flaws but can also can make good money with the sales if they stopped changing the commission structure! I love my job but hate that the seniority can effect your time off and schedule bidding. i feel it should be based off performance that would get the employees to push a little harder!
good,"It’s ok, comp ok. Just average. Micromanage then isn’t my thing. Union environment is a bit negative and anti—the hand that feeds us all. Nothing is even or equal with management. You can come from stellar performance numbers-wise and one nasty manager can fire you for not asking about the weather.  And they don’t care."
good,"It was a good place to work with great benefits , the work home life balance was the part of the job that is not as appealing but the pay and training was good ."
good,Great company to work for but upper leadership and managers need to do better with communicating and helping being set up for success on a daily basis not not as a “figure it out” finding the right mentors is critical to your success with AT&T.
good,a company with a multicultural team and projects that let a lot of lessons learned from around the world. all the team related with the project aport in several levels of the company
good,Its good to work for a most reputed company. There is lot of scope for quality learning everyday. Work place culture depends on individual team. Over all enjoyed working here.
good,"Bad management, they were way to personal instead of remaining on a professional level & tended to get into drama. But overall an amazing company to work for with the pay & benefits."
good,"The economy is constantly changing, so companies have to make tough decisions on staffing needs. I’m satisfied with the work I do and the freedom in my job to innovate."
good,"Days were pretty good when you didn't feel like you were being micromanaged, The days were long but standing on your feet with no chairs was grueling if you did not have the right shoes trust me your back would kill you."
good,The company was great to work for with great benefits. just don't allow emloyees flexibility in schedules which takes away from family time The environment was a bit stressful.  Everything as far as schedules are seniority based so there was not a lot of opportunity for one to have family time on the weekends. I worked every Saturday for over 7 years. no time to be with my children or travel much. this company has a very strict attendance policy.
good,AT&T was great until it wasn't.  It is a union company and when they merged with SBC in 2005 they laid off thousands workers because of redundant positions. The union did not fight for jobs even though it was mandatory to be a member and you paid weekly dues.  Management was not for the worker.
good,"overall = good. I was a contractor hired through a company in Texas. As with many union work force entities, AT&T was trying to do away with a unionized work force."
good,"Would be an awesome job if they had better management. Would probably never work for them again, not a huge fan of retail hours......................."
good,"0 oportunidad de crecimiento y aprendizaje"
good,"Good company to work for overall,but I don't like that the commission check is taxed 44%. You work all day to hit your goal and get your paycheck and 44% has been taken out! Also, management (well mine anyway) could be better."
good,"I learned a lot. It was my first business that I ran myself. learned a lot."
good,When I started it was a DirecTV only company and then AT&T came in and purchased DirecTV. The union then came in. I had never worked for a company with a union but I found it to be good and bad. We had a commission pay issue that lasted several months and the stress of that was too much for a lot of people. I stayed with the company with the hope that it would work out. In the end I relocated to another state. I worked in sales and the hours were always between 2pm and 11pm which made for a horrible work life balance. The pay was lower than I expected for a call center. The people were great and management was 50/50 some supervisors were amazing while others dident seem to care. Overall it was a great company to work for and I would recommend it to anyone. The benefits package alone was out of this world!
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. They allow work/life balance approach. Working environment is always great. People are friendly and the company supports diversity.
good,"Most days we are so busy we cant see the front door. However, we still have daily procedures that have to be done: hyla returns; next trade in;  deposit; stock balance: and finally fixing the schedule. The hardest part of the job is simply put working for a company that does not care about you as a person.  Customers for the most part are friendly but you do have a few that make you want to pull your hair out."
good,Performance is the main driving force at AT&T. If you are a great performer and hit all your metrics then you'll be noticed and advanced quickly to your level of incompetence. This leads to managers who know how to sell but have trouble couching other because they have no experience in developing talent.
good,For the most part I enjoyed my Career with AT&T and especially appreciated that it was a very large Company and therefore you could move around in the Company and gain more experience in various Departments of the Business.
good,I worked here for many years. You get great benefits as an employee. There is job security if you are an employee. Know that they expect a lot from you and consider that a norm.
good,The place was always up beat. The managers there were there to help to make sure you understood everything before you got out to the call floor
good,Pretty okay job. the only huge problem was the micro management at this job. overall i wouldnt want to work for that specific company again
good,10 to 12 hour days co workers were the best immediate supervisor was amazingly talented. Constant motion and unable to sit down
good,"AT&T was a good company to work for however constant changes in commission structure, company policies and company focus made it difficult to continue to want to be there. If you are comfortable being robot like this is an excellent job for you. Poor work life balance."
good,call foll was always heavy so it was very hard to take a break on time. I learned a lot about taking calls as the primary function of your job. for the most part management was okay until you had an issue with one then nothing would be okay anymore. very easy to get along with other agents. hardest part of the job was having so many people call in that we very aggressive and angry.
good,"-Typical day at work is interacting with customers and clients on a day to day basis."
good,Overall a good company if you are a permanent employee. Nice work place. work from options. But should expect long hours at work.
good,Very good job to provide a service to your customers for television viewing and entertainment and different culiters  of people.
good,good work environment and it's gave me good customer service experience.I learned a lot of skills and didn't stop learn.
good,"Great company to work for, but the wire tech position needs to be upgraded.  Big disconnect between the management and front-line employees."
good,"I loved working for AT&T, however I was part of a group that was laid off. Something I did not like about working for this company is that the people who needed to be wrote up for doing things really wrong such as adding lines for people not on the account, was over looked, due to race. Race played a big issue in the store I worked in while one race was punished according to company policy other races were allowed to ""slid"" by with a slap on the hand."
good,"This is a great place to start building your career, but not much advancement. Things are always changing including work schedules. This job is meant for people without kids."
good,This was a good place for up-and-comers to hone their craft during live sporting events in an extremely fast-paced setting.  I met a lot of great people there who have moved on to tremendous things.
good,"Management was not up to par, was very poor on the team managers side, and favoritism was a big part of team leader."
good,Was a great company I just was going through some family issues at the time that I resigned. They weren't understanding of that so I had to resign.
good,Good small company so you have touch with owner but lack of room for advancement.
good,It was great i think the hardest part of my job was u verse selling that because so many people was so comfortable with cox or direct tv. so had to come up with ways on why u verse was better then whom ever there provider was when we had higher prices then our counter parts.
good,"Banquet housemen are responsible for making sure that all elements of the banquet are set up. The banquet houseman sets up all necessary banquet supplies, checking that the food is being prepared, making sure the banquet is aesthetically pleasing and checking the hall's cleanliness."
good,"A call center sales area, high pace and must be able to keep with the sales numbers."
good,I really enjoy working with my clients.However all the process and lack of support make it very dificult around customer sat.
good,Activating new line of phone service. Manage three store's
good,"The teams were wonderful, competitive, managers tried to make it fun. "
good,"My typical day started at 8:00 am during training. Here I learned some details about the company, the position, products, and the service being provided. The training environment was fast paced and loaded with lots of great information. The management staff was  patient, positive, and encouraging; as were the employees. The hardest part of the job was biding for shifts and having to change schedules every week. Going from 6:30a - 3:00p one week, to 11:00a - 7:00p the next, and then to 2:00p - 10:00p the next week, and so on. This made it hard to balance things at home and work. The best part was working with and amazing group of managers and co-workers that truly enjoyed helping customers resolve their issues everyday."
good,"Great Company to work for very strong commission based drive,"
good,"ATT pays well and they do not give away free paychecks!  A typical day goes by fast and before you know it you are done.  AT&T teaches you how to relate and sell to customers and a vary professional environment.  You are at the cutting edge of internet, tv and phone service.  Management is different, the first lines operate on individual small business.  Co-workers are outgoing and fun.  The hardest part of being a rep is that you can not take one call off, you have to be focused."
good,During my time at AT&T I learned a lot of different skills that helped further my career
good,"very demanding, high end expectations and zero tolerance for any deviance from plan"
good,AT&T was a good company but lacked in communication be tween management and the representatives. Excellent pay and benefits and not so relaxing work space but still a good place to meet different people from different backgrounds.
good,This division of AT&T is more relaxed and typically geared toward doing one task consecutively.
good,"I have nothing bad to say about my previous employer. My typical day would start in the Tampa, Ft Myers, Sarasota, Lakeland offices at 8am with some follow up emails, around 9am make some cold calls for a bit. I'd have some big appointment to go to and become their friend, to stay in touch with them and make sure they are happy. The next appointment involves a little driving, from St Pete to Lakeland. I end up getting stood up. I grab a quick lunch and make some phone calls for a bit after lunch. I Then have another appointment which none of my co workers could get into. I do and close the big deal. Back to the office at 4 to get caught up on paperwork and anything else that needs to be done. I like to work after everyone leaves since it's very quite then."
good,The hardest part of the job is the micromanagement tactics and no opportunity for advancement within the company
good,"Delivered outstanding customer service, Outstanding training and knowledge."
good,"pays great, demanding work hours crucial extensive training, however great people work here so it made it alot easier for me."
good,AT&T is a fast moving company.  Change is eminent.   Very diversified.   Lots of training.   Overall a very exciting company to work for.  If you're energetic this is the company to work for.  Opportunities are there if you are a go getter.
good,"- Hard days work for a fair days pay is the best way to describe it. "
good,The company was great  over all.They can improve on hiring better management.They have good compensation overall. It was a pleasure working for them .
good,"It’s a good company that is ran and organized well, it is a good company to start at and understand the business of retail at to learn and grow while working."
good,"Great environment to work, but there are constant workforce reductions that create employee uncertainty. I would recommend AT&T to other job seekers though."
good,Was a Contract employment job. Was treated well during the length of the contract. Met a lot of good people and made many friends. Would recommend to others.
good,"Great company, I enjoyed my time there as a technician and acquired all the knowledge that they had to offer me. Recommend working here if you're seeking to advance yourself in the communications industry."
good,Great Customer Service! Upward mobility movement. Great staff. Plenty of opportunities. Family fun. Appreciate you. Has a diverse culture with a ton of money to be made
good,Fun learning experience in sales/ customer service. Perfect training environment for trainees to learn/develop necessary skills to provide an excellent customer experience
good,"Perfect job to build my managerial and sales skills early on in my career."
good,Who want to see you succeed. The hours are typical for a retail environment and there is room for advancement. The environment is constantly changing so being able to adapt is important.
good,AT&T has become such a large company that sometimes it is difficult to get in touch with the right person to answer questions.  I enjoyed the time that I was a contractor for them.
good,"management at the time sucked . It was a all male store and i felt out of place and like they was trying to push me out the door. "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my employment at At&T it was a great learning experience and I would do it again. I learned a lot about the wireless industry and jib training and coaching in this position.
good,Industry leading and best practices establishing organization. In-building design and services leader that changed the face of this industry. Very challenging and rewarding.
good,no me pagaron lo que se me tenia prometido pero no es culpa de la empresa sino del gerente en esa estancia
good,"My company has nice work culture and allows employees to work freely, also there is good support from seniors and employees are motivated and appreciated for their efforts"
good,Good company learn a lot. Help me with quality and my experience on big company looking for growth and good team.
good,Show up at garage have a small meeting and then off to do our jobs. Drove house to house to install and repair. Managment was a little to hands on and involved.
good,It was a great experience for all the years i spent with AT&T and all the success I was able to achieve at the brand recognized company.  I have life-long friends there and will remember the experience fondly
good,Great company to work for if you want to advance your skills in customer service. High energy and fast pace. Great environment with staff focus on the people
good,I enjoy working for DIRECTV/ATT. My commute is not that difficult and the hours can be flexible as long as I get my work done. They have been good to me here so I would recommend someone working here.
good,I loved working at AT&T. It is great place to work. The company cares about the success of their people. Great benefits and inclusive work environments.
good,Daily list of task to perform to provide the customer the best service. At AT&T we are all about providing the customer the best service we can provide.
good,Great company to work for and great opportunity. Very fast paced and busy helps the days go by quick. Learned how to provide the best customer experience and help assist customers finding solutions for their needs.
good,Overall good company to work for with great benefits and excellent opportunity to move up. I only worked there for a short period of time but it was wonderf
good,"A fun place to work. Very productive. Challenging and eventful place to work at times, but always fair. I would recommend to everyone interested working there that AT&T is a GREAT place to work"
good,I do not won’t to respond at this time .Due to not every job is not for everyone so you will have to work for this company and make you own Decision  thanks

The learning experience is always continuous especially since new products and promos are always available to your expense. Management is always there to help you grow and give advice when you may need it. Your coworkers are always there to look out for you. If you are having trouble with a sale just know that there is always someone there to help. The hardest part about the job is not being able to satisfy every customer that may walk through the door.

good,The company is a great company to work for. if you are a very tech person that love working outdoors on aloft. this is the place for you. it is a very competitive environment that is focused on number and not entirely focused on doing what is best for the customer initially.
good,"Alltel Communications was my start in the wireless industry.

good,Arrived at work at 8:00.  Learned how to work with CSR's. My supervisor was extremely critical of most coworkers. My workplace culture was stressful. Trying to satisfy my supervisor was the toughest part of the job.  Most enjoyable part of my job was the intermingling with the customer service representatives and town hall meetings.
good,"Exellent workplace, good pay and flexible work hours. Great team and colleagues, good management and good work-life balance. Hard to find jobs like in AT&T."

good,Fue algo diferente para mi donde puse en practica mi idioma ingles y fue muy grato el trabajar en esa empresa.
good,The management sucked. I had to be manager for 3 months without a pay rate difference because my manager quit without notice and the procrastinated on hiring a new manager. we were also short staff for about 2 months
good,My job was great I was able to speak with movie stars etc. I sold cell phones and contracts did allot of troubleshooting of phones and billing issues. I was promoted to a supervisor department 1yr after starting and I took escalated calls about billing issues and it was a little different at first but building a good rapport with people is a big help in resolving the issue at hand

good,"The AT&T work environment is pleasant. The sales teams come in anywhere from 9:00 am - 9:30 am but i would never come in later then 9:10 am. Unfortunately, internal promotions are usually silent and you don't find out about them until the opportunity is no longer available. I need to leave in order to advance in my career, because they only open positions for Senior Account Executives."
good,"I have worked at at&t for 3 year and have plenty of experience. My position there was to handle all the important information of a manager position as well as the back office.

good,Great company but I didn't care for management. there was never any consistency with the store manager at this location.For me it was just too far to drive.

good,"It was a good experience.Management was friendly and encouraging."

The most enjoyable part of the job was reaping all the benefits that came with being the number 1 sales rep on the floor"
good,My typical day at work started with a team meeting to discuss goals and or roadblocks for the day and resolutions for any roadblocks that existed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the new challenges that came up almost on a daily basis because of the quick changes in technologies and the fact that I got to organize and plan my workday unless maintenance issues arose. Most of the interactions with management was done remotely which sometimes could be a little bit of a challenge. I learned mostly to self manage and when needed to pitch in and help my team members. I also knew I could rely on my team members when needed.
good,There was a big reorg Consumer Broadband Marketing with lots of layoffs and contractors are being pushed out.  But it was good while it lasted.

I learned to have a set of procedures that would eliminate many questions and help me better get to my customers' requests in a timely manner. As an assistant manager I learned a lot about building and maintaining a good work environment for my sales team, to encourage results and coach my coworkers to help everyone succeed.

good,"Entry level sales, teaching you the basics of handling objections"
good,"While under the management of Jack Overfield, who actually has since been promoted to I believe to Regional Manager, I was taught the true meaning of customer service by that man.  Not one (1) person walked out of that store- regardless of whatever their personal situation; Every single person walked out with a phone.  No matter how he convinced upper management for the approval, but he did it!  That is probably why he had the #1 store in the Buffalo region.   With all the technicalities that AT&T Corporate tried to enforce, such as being forced to re-sign another contract, if let's say you broke your phone.  The company made it's profit through the actual contracts.  The phones they had were estimated (most) at a very high price (usually between $400-$600) if bought straight out.  So, they were able to recoup the phone costs, as well as on upgrades, and other inventory products, accessories, etc.  There was also ""web add-ons and other services"" that just added bonus to the service and phones.  Most important was customer service, because quickly after that became referrals.  And I learned that by taking care of one good customer, you could've gained yourself ten (10.)"

What I learned the most was how mature I became over the 13 years that I was with the company.  Great company to work for and the benefits were excellent.  The hardest part of the job was that of dealing with happy personalities some days and sad/miserable personalities some days.  I like to smile everyday, and understand the need of having to have a pleasant atmosphere.  It makes for a great work experience that makes it enjoyable to work.  My co-workers absolutely loved me and I to them.  I'm easy to work with and for.  I run a tight ship, but understand the level of respect between my peers and I.

I gained experience in sales techniques. We worked in a small retail space so I had close relationships with co-workers as well as the owner. I was held in high regard for my outgoing personality and ability to open new and retain accounts through a great customer experience. The most challenging part of the job was overcoming the customers expectation that the least expensive product would also have high quality. The only remedy was the highest level of customer service to explain the benefits of long lasting quality. I enjoyed training new associates the sales techniques that made me successful in my tenure as a sales associate."

The working environment was always fun and pleasant.  Call-centers have different sections and so our supervisors would always have some kind of competition going on with other sections to see who would take the most calls, less dropped calls, etc."
good,"Although customer service is frequently stressful, it also has its rewards.  I love helping customers complete the reasons they have called in.  Not only do I offer very satisfying customer service, but my customers don't leave the line until they are happy and all issues are resolved.  Our management team is very involved in helping coach and motivate the reps in my position.  The co-workers are thought of as family members.  We have all worked together for so long, that each and every person has a special place in my heart.  The hardest part of my job is when I get a customer that no matter what I say or do is not happy and they take their frustrations out on me.  Even though I know it isn't personal, I take it personally that I can't change their mindset about AT&T.  The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely the customers.

good,A typical day answering phones for deaf and hearing impaired people.   their to their liking just anyone on the phone.  Meaning not participating in the call except for typing what was being said or reading what was being typed.
good,You are compensated fairly at AT&T and the benefits are second to none.  The culture at times can be fun depending on your direct supervisor.  It is a demanding but rewarding place to work.
good,"Good strict policies, unions used to be strong and the benefits great. With technological changes and the ""brain drain"" (innovation syphoned clandestinely through tech devices by almost all companies, if not all), opportunities are far less, if there."
good,Made a lot of money . Xo workers were good. But the constant change in what the business needs where and the constant push for things that where not even needed to get the job done was to much .
good,I loved working for AT&T. I grew and developed as a leader and employee year over year. Compensation was excellent. Hours were challenging. Worked all weekends and all holidays with the exception of Christmas Day and Thanksgiving.
good,"ATT is an innovative company, the hold there customers and quality of service to the highest of high standards. the customer service goes above and beyond. AT&T delivers a quality product with outstanding service."
good,This job was worth the stress. At the end of the month the commission was well worth it!The management was great and the hardest part was making sells trying to get your check at the end of the month.
good,"Leaders were willing to help employees, though salaray was not good enough but still learning tons of things with the leaders will help you prepare for your upcoming job."
good,"I have gained the more knowledge and experience at AT&T then any other company. Trainings are incredible! If you work hard you will make money; however, if you just want to shoot behind a desk and collect a paycheck then this is not for you."
good,"Att was a great place to work. I found a different job that allowed for more family time. "
good,I had a baby and I had severe post pardom . They didn’t want to allow any more time off . So I had to quit for my health . A person can’t do a good job for the company if they are not doing theirselves good.
good,"Trained to do the fundamentals, enough to learn and improve your skills. You will be on your own most of the time after the training period, but you will be on a tight schedule for each job. Great way to earn a lot doing a high skill job, but you will miss a lot of family time since you will work a lot of OT. It was average to work around 15 hours a day."
good,Great job overall but poor work and life balance. I worked from sun up to sun down and was constantly on my feet. They got rid of the ssr position which forced me to have to leave the company
good,Have your workers excited to work. And lay off the directv. No one wants it. I feel there should also be a hour lunch break. And more then two workers.
good,"I was an engineer for bell labs then bellsouth then Cingular.  then they got rid of my wireless data development team."
good,"At&t is a good company, but can definitely try your patience at times. I do not think the current CEO is hands on about what is going on with his front line employees."
good,"Typical days work would consist of 10 hour days."
good,"At&t was beyond a great company to work with & for! I Just wish at the time i was apart of the team , things would be more organized and imformation filled. I Feel like alot of the times we were led into the dark with no information."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with attending to your emails and sending updates on your assigned trout tickets, followed by conference calls/meetings. and then attending to your assigned trouts tickets."
good,"Mi ingreso fue en Nextel de méxico, y en cuanto a esa empresa todo fue muy bueno, prestaciones, salarios, promociones, sin embargo al cambiar la administración a AT&T , todo cambio radicalmente , en general esta bien, pero no hay punto de comparación."
good,ATT is a great place to work with all sort of opportunities for movement. The pay is above average. The benefits are great. the job is very physical in nature
good,"The managers were very critical, didn't take our opinions as they matter. Customers surveys that were sold devices with no service were being charged for micro cell $200 just to get service was ridiculous, then store representatives were upgrading phones not updating imei numbers so devices weren't working as expected, when I tried to goto store location, wasn't able to get out of call center I gave them 6 1/2 years wanted to move up in the company but couldn't so I quit."
good,"I left the company to help my mom in Arizona. I would never have left if they had a job for me out there but they did not. The company is very giving, but the job requires a lot of dedication."
good,Job was decent. Alot if pressure to sell Directv. Coaching everyday and honestly cannot have an off day or you can be coached for it. Part time roll did have 3 days off and sometimes in a row depending on staffing so that was nice for work life balance.
good,Att has no flexibility with hours excpecially fr new employees. The pay is great because t the medical is expensive and is basically just major medical benefits.
good,"Retail sales jobs are always different. Some days were busy, some were slow. Some were fun days, some were not. I had a great manager and team at all the locations I worked at."
good,"I've been there for 5 years, the company takes excellent care of their employees. For members it's now too far from home but I would recommend to anyone."
good,"Offers the benefits of a large company, such as advancement, ability to move around the country, good medical/dental/vision, good pay. "
good,AT&T has an amazing Brand recognition. The market is extremely competitive and selling the solutions is all about low pricing. The market is not interested in value selling but low pricing.
good,I worked there for 17 years I was blessed to have been afforded a great training plan.  I Enjoyed all of the opportunities ATT offered me.  I would most definitely go back now that the manager I worked for is no longer working there.
good,"I worked for Directv then AT&T bought them out so I left the company instead of relocating. Lots of young energetic employees that are over qualified and underpaid and usually use AT&T as a stepping stone to a more stable, financially company."
good,Easy to advance but no job security. Take advantage of all training opportunities while you can. I advanced after 2 years to management  After 5 years of hard work I was let go.
good,Working in the call center is back to back calls speaking with irate customers. It is very stressful but all of my coworkers were like family. The personality tests I believe do a great job of picking employees  that can handle that environment.
good,En este empleo tuve mucha estabilidad y excelentes comiciones buena atencion
good,"It was fun. lil bit challenging but doable. when you are new, you need to learn fast. I was at the mall, a lot of food traffic. I was closer for 7 months. you will get home late, kinda tiring specially if you have family and kids."
good,"IAT&T was like a family get together.  At work or at home if you needed something, someone was there to help.  Although the phones stayed busy, the environment was a very relaxed place of business."
good,"With the cultural and management changes, the work place was change to a stressfull place with a lot of pressure."
good,working with phones was one of the hardest jobs i did in the past  at the time i was not very good with phone and knew nothing for it but i i worked at at&t i got better with phone since then.
good,"Great company with lots of products, the focus on becoming a entertainment company is very exciting step into the future. With the new products and promotion added it's a help to drive into the next step."
good,A typical work day at AT&T would be fast paced and stressful. Management attempted to make things easier but it 's stressful listening to someone screaming or cussing you through the phone. The most enjoyable part of my job was friendly people and  getting paid at the end of my work week.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at AT&T on contract for 4 years. I would recommend AT&T to anyone who want to have a great career. If I could I would work for them again."
good,"come in to a fast paced environment with schedule breaks and lunches and your schedule is based off seniority, customers are put on a wait list and often mad about wait time"
good,I loved working for AT&T. I loved how they would bring in the team and pump them up for the upcoming work week. The one thing I was concerned about was the lack of job security towards the end of the internship.
good,It's an amazing job. I have no complaints. It's not for everyone and sometimes you just grow out of it. You have to live your job. It's pretty great helping
good,"Pros"
good,"AT&T is not flexible in times, there is no seniority for scheduled work"
good,Great position for someone youthful and excited about products and technology.  Call center requires someone very punctual and required ability to mitigate customer concerns while preventing cancellation of additional features while trying to offer new plans and equipment wherever possible.
good,Great company to work for. Great project I was involved in but the company was not able to monetize it. That was the reason why the project was shot down.
good,"The biggest down side to working at Att is the retail environment keeps from a good work life to home life balance.  Great benefits, pay,  and employers.  It is a career building opportunity."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty laid back. Dress code is lax. "
good,"During attrition, the leads were tasked with weeding out reps.  They were actually paid bonuses.  I had been a union rep at a former company, so they began harassing me, and asking if I intended to join the union.  My stress resulted in severely elevated blood pressure."
good,I was the motivating force for my team.   I would maintain the calls and the sales that were produces from those calls. with monthly quota's as well as quarterly stats to maintain.
good,"calls after calls,working with different customer around the states who wanted to cancel service/tech support/equipment upgrade,fun part is the incentives when they hit your bonuses"
good,"Typical day at work is always pretty different. In the mornings we always have our work huddles that helps drive the days goals. The rest of the day anything can happen but we always seem to regroup and make sure that we are all taking advantage of every interaction with customers. We always go over different strategies to encounter different objections. My team leader is always the one to go to if I need his guidance but I've been with the company for a good amount of time and now know the answer to just about everything. In sales, in my opinion, theres always room for growth which is why I love the group huddles. That is my work day."
good,"A excepción del coordinador todo perfecto. Bueno el único detalle es que no te dejan salir a baño sin permiso,  yo me enferme varias veces por eso me retiré. Pero el trabajo es muy bueno,  haces amistades grandiosas y hablas con todo tipo de personas."
good,"This is by far one of the best companies I've been able to be a part off. The only thing that's not so good is that this company is not very flexible when it comes to getting sick days or missing days from work in general. Also, the commission structure has to be fixed because at a retail location you are responsibl for a lot of sales and are not being compensated due to such mediocre commission structure. You'll be lucky to make $1,500 a month and realistically speaking that doesn't pay the bills anymore."
good,"nice company to work for from skills and cultural poit of view."
good,"each house was different , practice makes perfect setting"
good,"-A Typical day of work included many calls with some irate customers, some nice. "
good,I have been moved to three different locations within the past year from Virginia beach to Chesapeake to Suffolk Virginia. I enjoy my career but the relocation is a bit overwhelming.
good,"Primero el trabajo, luego tu familia. No hay Separacion entre tiempo con tu familia y el trabajo"
good,"I was responsible for outbound calls to AT&T customers to confirm, cancel, or reschedule AT&T installation appointments.  Any changes to the customer's scheduled service/installation appointments were documented to Excel spreadsheets, and then forwarded to the appropriate regional managers to adjust technician service calls."
good,"AT&T was ok until they told us that our department was being Closing that hurts alot of employee's, other then that the company is ok."
good,"Company under a major transformation. No longer a jobs company. Uverse is a very demanding, results oriented position with very long hours."
good,This position allowed me to greatly advance leading to promotion.  The leadership and support of my manager was key.  Unfortunately such assests are not recognized at AT&T as one might think they would be when it comes to downsizing.
good,"this job was a struggle at first but once I learned the job, I felt I was an excellent call center operator. I helped so many people and I felt as though I learned about the world."
good,"directv/att was a really good place to work, I worked there for 2 and a half years and worked in the retention department and was in the top 10 in the united states for sales and saves."
good,Wish I could have remained there. Issue with Top management inability to develop system/ products that is sellable to customers
good,long hours equals good money but your job is not safe you get an extra week of vacation time every six months but you will lose your job very easily
good,Taking a lot of technical support calls.  It's nice to have a great support system.  Co-workers are nice and willing to help.
good,high schooler serving while trying to play sports. I was very overwhelmed but enjoyed the cast of people i got to meet.  I learned how to serve and take orders accordingly as well as give correct change.  was in charge of the appetizers and entrees coming out in a timely fashion
good,"Great trainings/ learned so much & benefits my future."
good,"Long hours, but the pay does compensate for it. Overall a good company to work for, especially for those starting out. It pays pretty well especially if you don't yet have a degree, and has good benefits, too."
good,"Not a place to work if you have a family, all about the numbers and really no room for growth with the company. Big company that has the eyes set high, not really thinking of the man and women who are out there representing the company on a day to day basis."
good,"This is a great place to work, fun, great monthly bonus, and it has free TV.  As far as the call centers in the area I would say Directv is the best one to work for."
good,"A day at work would be me waking up, brushing my teeth and then logging into mysystems for work. I did get a chance to interact firtualy with other co workers. co workers also were availible to help with any questions that we may face. The hardest part of the job was dealing with complaints. Thee assiest part was knowing how to reolve problems and making the customer happy."
good,"must be extremely talented in sales and installers to make this into a career. This field is a fast paced environment. The per job rate depends on mobility and the ability to have al the equipment necessary to complete the job. Not a good career chose for worker fathers, but may be a suitable career for a bachelor looking for a fun job"
good,"DIRECTV is a great company to work for in general, but the office where I worked has bad I have learned a lot with this company though, I have learned how to work Workday and Kronos.  I really enjoyed my job and working with all 72 technicians to ensure that they were paid correctly."
good,"This is a great company for advancement , however it depends on the location in which you work. More demands are place on the work which is hard to focus on advancement. So you have to determine the correct balance for you."
good,As an Accounting Specialist you are never bored with your assignments and the day goes by quickly with new an exciting challenges.
good,Very relaxed fun working environment in which there was lots of opportunities for advancements ....great management in which they help manage your pros and cons for you to achieve the next step in your career
good,You start off the day with your headset and you need it everyday. You log in on your computer and they send you phone calls that you have to make a sell. Wasnt professional and got caotic at times but I learned it was very simple and easy to stay on task I had the best Supervisor talking me through. I loved closing my teams calls and helping them get sales. Co workers were cool and collect. Hardest part was taking bad calls where they really didnt want the tv or they wanted off the mailing list. Most enjoyable part was getting a Sale.
good,"This employer although challenging is rewarding. Great pay, must be able to handle irate customers, keep your composure, multitask, work several software."
good,Some areas of ATT are great places to work and other areas are mismanaged and have horrible managers.  The company is currently in transition to an all IP network and unless you know someone you're out of luck
good,"Like every other job, it has its high and low points. Overall it was good. During training, the class I was in were literally shuffling through different team leaders and trainers. Material that was required for learning wasn't available to us due to system maintenance that they couldn't print out the work book. I hated that they didn't have a set schedule and also a set team leader who would make it one's priority his/her trainees."
good,"AT&T is a great company if you are wanting a laid back environment with strict management, the company really cares about their employees and takes care of us well."
good,"Overall good company to work for, commissions are paid monthly and your paid an hourly rate..down fall is its retailComp plan is constantly changing to make less in your commission checks"
good,"I really enjoy working for ATT.  Everyday is an adventure.  IT is an ever changing industry so there is always new products and services launching."
good,Its a Pleasure to help member with their benefit questions and soothe their anxiety
good,i would not reccommend this job for people with small children due to the hectic hours
good,Great company the job can be fun but stressful at the same time because it is based off of sales and metrics.
good,"working at AT&T was a fun place to work out everyone there was friendly employee's respected each and everyone of us."
good,"Same as above this is the same company I worked at the same company for 19 years, they changed the name 3 times while I was there"
good,Fast paced call center environment which challenged all set of skills on many levels
good,"I enjoyed teaching the new agents the art of great customer service, while incorporating product sales as well."
good,The job has many different parts and responsibilities . The most enjoyable part is seeing a project or a repair through from start to finish . We deal with customers from residential and business and inter-company as well .
good,"•	Maintain inbound call flow traffic to provide optimal agent productivity and reporting daily metrics to client."

good,"I was treated well and enjoyed my time there but I was not able to "
good,"The pay is decent, but the management is poor an the work life is strenuous."
good,"Wonderful Compensation, but a really stressful job. Inbound calls, scripted sales, high quotas"
good,"Report to work for 8am 5 days a week on a normal work schedule. Occasional forced overtime.  All technicians are responsible for installation/repair of tv, internet and phone service.  Required to dispatch from a job pool, and continue to do so until all jobs are complete.  There is no standard off duty time.  I have advanced in customer service as a result in working as a technician at At&t.  All co-workers have a positive rapport.  The hardest part of the job is trying to balance my life along with not knowing what time I will be getting off work on a daily basis.  The good part of the job is having the chance to meet all different types of people."
good,"A typical day at work was very productive. I learned how to activate directv accounts and assist people with difficult technical issues over the phone. The co-workers were awesome, but the hardest part of the job was the amount of information that is needed before beginning the call and the amount of typing for call logging is unnecessary. I really enjoyed free directv."
good,I loved working there but it closed down and it was devastating. I miss my old boss.
good,Great work.  Market legal review of all lease modifications for the Mid-Atlantic market.
good,"Sales, Sales, Sales..... Always up to date on the lastest training in the market place."

I was able to be promoted to a senior agent within 2 months. In the process of my short time here I learned how to utilize 5 different engineering schematic programs, train other agents to use these programs and answer questiong reguarding process and procedure at the level of a subject matter expert.  In the course of training other agents, which had been promoted, I developed a training manual for those agents to use on their own and had exstensive one on one time showing them the functions of their new role in my department."
good,"AT&T has awesome products and services, which made it a fun environment. For the most part, customers are willing to cooperate with you, but you do have those that are stubborn and are impossible to work with. You really have to have patience and ethics to be a Retail Sales Consultant. "
good,"Call volume exceeded 1000+ calls throughout the day, thus requiring overtime to ensure customer issues were handled in an appropriate timeframe. Opportunities to work with Presidential Escalations provided experience in generating case profiles, and Better Business Bureau inquires. Gaining such knowledge assited in communicating with irate customers and the ability to work toward a resolution."
good,The work environment is fast paced and often stressful.  The job has excellent pay and benefits but is one of those jobs being replaced by automation.
good,AT& T has a great training for a call center enviroment. The are very many resources for training. The call center is a very strict and by the book center.  AT & T pride in customer service.

It also included filling out paperwork for new customers and being there when a customer had a complaint. My co-workers were great and supportive and helped me if I needed it.

I ran wire from the terminals to the jacks, Installed equipement for DSL and worked on customers pcs, both business and residence. I got along well with my coworkers and enjoyed the times that I actually worked with them. Working in bad weather was the worst. Making unhappy customers happy was the best. Most people just want to be heard and helped with whatever their complaint is. I am a people person and enjoy helping others, and like to try to lighten up unpleasant situations if possible."

good,"It was a very good company to work for because of all the medical benefits and the pay was really great, besides the nice staff I got a chance to work with throughout the years."
good,"I would say, although AT&T is a great company to work for, it can be very hard in certain job titles to leave work at work. Some things take time to develop, so in turn i find myself taking work home with me."
good,"The pay and benefits are absolutely unbeatable. The union does a great job getting compensation, time off, and other perks. Unfortunately layoffs happen quarterly, so it is impossible to feel secure. Layoffs are always happening or being talked about daily. No matter how committed you are the company looks at you as an expense and is always trying to downsize."
good,"Field managers, also called field services managers, oversee employees who travel to work in sites or in the field. Their main task is to supervise people on a site, ensuring everyone on the team is performing their responsibilities in the field. A field manager's task is to lead a team sent in a field."
good,En mi estancia a lo largo de el trabajo no tube ningun problema la mayoria de el personal era tenia muy buen trato y en ningun momento hubo algun problema o desavuerdo.
good,Good pay and benefits - lack of compensation. Too many calls are being outsourced to other countries which makes the job very difficult. Stressful job
good,"It was a great job that taught me many skills that can be used in other areas of my life and work like multitasking, careful listening, understanding empathy with customer service needs and all around respect for all walks of life while providing the Best customer service experience to customers."
good,Good money but there isnt a work balance. pay is very reasonable but commission can be a bit difficult. tthis is perfect for people that need a job experence.
good,the job overall is well paid but the environment is harsh the focus of customer has been lost not completely but it is not to its full potential in my opinion the infrastructure is old and not maintained like it should
good,Relaxed. Work from home allowed. Long hours required occasionally. casual attire allowed.  Technology advancement is good. Lot to learn. learned different tools
good,"I supervised a group of 7 employees, I was salaried so even though i only needed to work Monday thru Friday I still talked to my employee's every day to see how they were doing. Work life balance was sometimes a struggle however the plus's outweighed that by far"
good,"Love the work at AT&T every day is a new adventure. Each install and repair is unique and meeting customers expectations is exciting. However, the balance between work and family time is not balanced as a premise tech."
good,"Excelente sueldo, promociones con palanca, excelente lugar de crecimiento si eres soltero sin hijos, ya q si los tienes no los veras...pero traeras dinero en el bolsillo.

good,"Good paying job with excellent benefits however even though the company is union,they are in the process of downsizing the workforce therfore job security is an issue."
good,Contracted to AT&T was an incredible experience.  They really unleash you to fully excel in your capabilities and explore your potential. Exploring the  only real critique of the company would be the shifting of leadership of the division doesn't provide long enough for a stable direction to set in.
good,It was a great place to work until management decided to purchase other companies that had no value to the field employees.  These purchases affected thousands of employees.
good,"I had a great experiecne with AT&T. I learned alot and improved my management career. You come in and you have to get to work and leave everything behind you. Great place to work, great training program. you gotta create the will yourself."
good,"buena empresa laboral, hasta que  vendieron sucursal a distribuidor."
good,"Check in at 7 AM would walk around the downtown area to local business shops for AT&T line service and good monthly internet  plans. "
good,its great place but not  family oratanited so if you have kids in day care or  school its  had to work around but you get what you get ...............
good,I cannot stress enough how well diverse AT&T employees are I feel honored to be working for them because I really feel like the potential for growth is great for African-American women and that's what I am
good,its not a bad place to work but just like any other job all it takes is one manager to make like hard. I liked the job but if you have any issues the union will make sure to not make things favorable.
good,Great pay...awesome benefits.  Have worked for over 11 years in different positions.  Not for everyone.  Can be back stabbing.  Union mostly has your back.  Just need to be were you are supposed to be.  Very safety oriented.
good,better work place to work with. the environment looks great. would recommend to work there. finally enjoyed doing work there. the staff also supports well.
good,"its a good company depends the area you work, retention is more harder. calls  are intense plus if you have an accent people who call discriminates you about it you have to be patient about the calls."
good,"I was ecstatically happy for about 18 of almost 20 years."
good,"Busy, busy, busy! You get your own truck or van but keep up with the times. Because you have to use the latest equipment and keep up with competitors with whats going on."
good,"Due to technology changes AT&T are surplusing jobs across the nation. As much as I would love to stay with them, I also have to think about my future and my family . I'm willing to learn a new career or take a job on that utilizes my skills in the Broadband Technology World"
good,The Worlds Largest Communication Company with all the Bells and Whistles Couldn't ask for a better Company to be Attached to for credibility purposes.
good,Loved working here just wish management cared more about my recovery and new pregnancy when I came back due to lack of accommodations  for myself . I felt unwanted and disliked because I required a chair and patience.
good,Eight hours of 30 plus inbound call covering general customer service to advanced technical support..  Billing to international support issues. Selling insurance to troubleshooting network outages.
good,"I have to ensure that a combined team of 100 employees (Managers and Non Management) work safe, meet our commitments, do not exceed budget, care for every customer, and remain productive throughout the day.   We have many challenges to overcome.  Equipment shortages, training needs, vehicle breakdowns, and time commitments are only a few adversities."
good,A lot of changes over the years. The New work culture has changed how the company operates. There was always room for advancements and Training opportunities. Company is very goal and results oriented. Large amount of jobs have been outsourced and more contract employees. Continued surplus of jobs can cause a stressful work environment. Salaries are set for union workers by job title. Management salaries vary by job title and performance. Im not familiar with retail wages. I was on the wholesale side of the business. Due to the different business operations there are some parts of the business that we were restricted from accessing the accounts. The overall Company  operations are very complex.
good,Love to work there again. The company wasn't bad due to the company being sold to prime communications and a issue with the district manager and me I was fired.
good,"very honest and open work culture, very open to all lifestyles. This company is on the road to becoming a holding company much like General Electric. They are focused on acquisition of video and security companies however their stock is down $6 per share over the past year."
good,great company to work for but no life balance when you work in management or sales. i love the team environment and the money that we can make as well but sometimes it comes with loosing time with family.
good,I was not able to go off of the commision pay so I had to find other work I cannot afford to not have enough money for my family or maybe not have sales for that week but for new and eager workers that don't want a cap on what you could make this is a job for you
good,there network was old and not up to par with competitors like Comcast and Verizon. The management was not very helpful and the approach to obtaining new business was out dated
good,AT&T was positive environment for me and provided plenty avenues of income. Each day was different of course when dealing with customers. However great training made it easy to handle.
good,"great pay / management was horrible, the commission structure was ok, try not to pay out by putting on restrictions on certain sales. for instance in order to receive commission, you have to have made at least one cellphone cell In that month."
good,My assignment was to assist newly hired U-Verse Installers with training and settling in to the schedule. AT&T stopped hiring installers when we purchased Directv which made for long days and no advancement.
good,This company expected good work ethic from their employees.  The benefits were the best.  They liked teamwork.  The employer was respectful to their employees.  Kept their  employees informed.
good,Surpluses and layoffs happen too often you're never comfortable in your position.I've couldn't believe a company would pay to relocate you after a promotion then surplus you 11 months later which leads to a layoff because you don't have enough management experience.
good,Good work experience. Offers good work life balance. Compensation is fair. Due to re org there is a great deal of uncertainty amongst employees and contractors.
good,"I was hired on through a college program"
good,I enjoyed the opportunity that AT&T gave me. I was contracted for a few months. I met some great people and learned some new techniques. I would work there again if given the opportunity.
good,"I got this position thru Collabera INC.  I was very happy with the position for 3 years because it allowed me to work from home and I worked very hard.  "
good,"With all of the mandatory meetings you have to attend, between conference calls and team meetings, as well as one-on-ones with each direct report; time management skills are a must."
good,A fortune 500 company.  Very good working environment.  I left the company when my 2nd kid was born.  And the company was cutting down people at the time because of economic down turn.
good,the company was good to work for overall and no job is without its challenges. My manager was great to work for and the hours were not bad. they do have a policy were if you are late one time during training you can possibly be fired then.
good,"At&t is an awesome place to meet and connect with new people. Wether it’s your coworkers or with customers, lasting friendships and partnerships are made while working a fulfilling career."
good,"Typically work in all types of weather. People are for the most part friendly. Change is always. Must be able to multi-task. Goal oriented. Best practice is common place. Management is supportive but company is numbers driven, which is understandable but there needs to still be a balance with quality vs quantity. Meeting customers is best and most rewarding part of job."
good,I worked for AT&T and I can say that it was a culture of past excellence and employees trying to keep their jobs at all costs. The threat of layoffs and being replaced by contractors is always prevalent.
good,"Best place to be whenever but the job security is not guaranteed "
good,Loved it when I was there. The work days needs to be worked out a little better. I didn't enjoy working every weekend. I loved the fast paced environment. The days went by really fast.
good,"Enjoyed working with most everyone,  had fun did things for most holidays,  they try to make it a fun place to work.  But they need more communication with employees."
good,Working from a workstation the daily task involved provisioning and troubleshooting circuits through pc  application software. Enjoyed working there for 8 years.
good,"As an In Home Expert known as an (IHX) representative, it is your duty to ensure that customers who are having home products installed are aware of all promotions available to them. While our goal is to service our customers needs and assist them with their services and accounts. We also leverage and offer products that might fit their needs based off of what they've told us. "
good,Att is great. Fast working environment. Promotes healthy companions between in store employees as well as area and regional. really good hourly rate plus commission options. Jobs is also union with helps a lot.
good,Its good place to work and employee have freedom and everyone will enjoy working with the company and also gives lot of appreciations and trainings will be given
good,Working for AT&T was a great work experience. The company provides adequate opportunities to advance. Working there keeps you up to date with fast progression of the world tech advances.
good,"AT&T is  a Fortune 100 company that offers great training, opportunities for advancement,  and excellent benefits. Management styles vary greatly from place to place which often leads to conflicts and inventory shortages.  The company has sufficient liquid capital and resources but its managerial system frequently leads to practical confusion with taxes, over/underpayments, benefits distribution that could be avoided by training managers or hiring managerial staff from amongst experienced line staff."
good,"Very fast paced environment, great hourly rate of pay. Above average and state of the art equipment. Management was not on the same page. I worked there during a transition period in which 3 directors were replaced during the 1st year of service. Great incentives, loyal customers even though our rates were astronomical. "
good,As a customer service representative i had a qouta to meet every month which made it sometimes stressful. Competing for customers and being able to sell your product and making the customer believe in it as well was challenging but accomplished.
good,"Very fast paced, and challenging job. I love the hard work. I love working outside wethere its hot or cold. If you dont like being outside this job is not for you."
good,"Very competitive in the workplace. They would bring in pizza from either papa john's or dominoes for the team at least once every month. However, the upper management wasn't very good needed improvement and was the reason why many of the employees left the job. There was no job security the management would decide to fire some individuals over small issues such as a write-up or absence."
good,This job is extremely competitive and fast paced. Hourly pay with bonus opportunity for sales. Management is terrible and not much room for growth. Overtime is rare.
good,with At&t its all about who likes you in order to move up if one ARSM don't like you he or she will make it bad for you to move up however if you have someone backing you then you will be advanced very fast
good,The company in general is awesome. However the department is being ran in the ground. They let one single person destroy moral and department. The job used to be awesome. It is really sad.
good,"Inbound phone rep."
good,"Managers were very helpful in assisting me with my everyday tasks. They answered every question i had and also allowed me to make mistakes, grow, and thrive."
good,"•Single point of contact for customer, seeing orders through from start to finish."
good,My days where fun and interactive with co workers and other employees. I learned a lot about new technology and new techniques how to sell and train. Management was pretty good on giving out feedback and information.
good,AdquiríT conocimiento en manejo de aplicaciones de inventarios y paqueteria office
good,This was one of my favorite jobs. However lack of advancement and favoritism. I was with the company for 5 years and was forced out by a manager who had a grudge.
good,"El ambiente dentro de la empresa es muy agradable, las labores son relativamente fáciles, el sueldo es bueno, el pago de horas extra esta muy bien respetado."
good,I worked in a 24 hour fraud center. We monitored the network for international toll fraud.  I worked every other weekend and holidays with rotating shifts.  I love the job however when SBC bought AT&T the workplace changed.  I was at the top of my pay grade could not advance other than to management.  My peers became part of my family.  I was the Vice President of my local union for the last 6 years.  The most enjoyable part of the job was happy customers.
good,Great Place to work need to compensate income......work in sales peaks and valleys.   Want to go into management opportunities very slim at this time so I am looking to grow in the Metro Detroit area.
good,"I worked as an independent contractor, and loved the opportunity. ATT believed in promoting from within, and also professional development.  I have nothing but great things to say."
good,you get to learn alot about telecommunications through AT&T - They give you excellent training and gives you skills you can take on through the company and that are very attractive to other companies
good,"Each day brought new challenges.  Although the business has evolved to meet the needs of the 21 century I have no doubt that the people who work strive to offer the best service to customers possible.  Each employee, rank & file/management, lent expertise to ensure the customer experienced quality service."
good,"challenging"
good,Great company with good benefits. fast paced and have to be willing to move to get promoted. Based in over 200 countries so if you are mobile you have a great chance to get promoted
good,good company to work for and good benefits. the training and the care is very well organized. The opportunities are available to us. The salary and compensation are low
good,"Being that communication is a very important factor in 95% of the population in the world, I loved the fact that I helped customers with their communication services. Getting to know customers during transactions is fun!"
good,"The experience that I gained at AT&T is invaluable and I am so thankful for the experience. As a contractor, unfortunately, we are not privy to the same things as permanent employees such as competitive pay and benefits and discounts. I absolutely love my team, love my job role and am privileged to have been part of the company but they just are not hiring."
good,"Es una empresa muy buena nada mas que al fucionarce con nextel y iussacel, se descuidaron muchas areas y al personal se quedaba solo en caja luego sin personal para cubrir."
good,AT&T is a good company in many parts but not in every part. I work as a premise technician which is the bottom end position in the field. While a few have advanced those opportunities are few and far between. The pay is better than average but is still lies compared to the work load  we are asked to do. In five years I have seen my job change from simple in home installation to what now could be considered facilities work. I have been in a union which fights for most employees but my particular position was forgotten about at the negotiation table. There is potential for growth but AT&T seems more focused on buying other parts of companies than increasing is customer base
good,The hardest part of working for such a large company is the difficulty with coordinating between many different departments across the US sometimes to get anything done. The work is challenging but the benefits are great.
good,Customer is paramount. Good balance between job work and life. Excellent compensation pakage. Daily interactions with diverse work force throught out the United States.
good,when I started att it was a sales job.  than it became a retention center and I was just not able to sale more than I disconnect so the job just did not work for me because I was a honest person
good,"A company with world wide reach with team members scattered around the globe. Management employees who are not co-located with other team members were allowed to telecommute. Although the company is currently stressing on team collaboration so do no attempt to apply to AT&T unless you are located in Texas, New Jersey or Missouri. California is currently on AT&T hit list and is starting to close data centers and laying off management employees. No future in California for employment opportunities."
good,Great company to work for. Move to a different location for a very I'll relative...  Not really ready to get over the death of my love one.  Really wished I could've  transferred to another city for the same job tittle. But my family came first in the situation...
good,"Certain positions are not meant to be worked long term."
good,It's a great place to work if your a team player if you're motivated and have great personality you have to be driven in customer service and always find a solution for the customer no matter what stressful at times but overall it was a great job
good,No room for advancement. You’d have to move to be concise Red for promotion. I love the job itself and my stability but after working 6 years no room to move up.
good,"AT&T is a good place to work.Management was good,They bahave w friendly with employers,Job culture is also good.we can learn good things in this environment."
good,"This was an amazing place to work, the benefits were OUTSTANDING.. I had worked for them in my child rearing years and was treated exceptionally well all the way through THREE pregnancies and even me planning a wedding... Great company to work for"
good,"Great company to work for however, if you work in a channel with poor leadership you really need to watch out or you could be bullied.  Good pay, benefits and opportunities to further your education."
good,Loved working as a AT&T rep but it was such a long drive for me everyday. Benefits are great but you have to be good at sales also. It is a great job for anyone that lives closer to the facilities or looking a great start in the customer care field.
good,"Many opportunities to move ahead if an employee. As a contractor, not any opportunity for advancement. Co-workers were great to work with and I enjoyed my time there."
good,I enjoyed working for ATT and learning all the technical things to learn about cell phones. I never knew how much technology a tiny cell phone impacted.
good,"In the many years I worked for AT&T it was very fast paced, everything was timed. It had good benefits, vacation... but you can not miss work unexcused or be late."
good,"stressful work environment, management makes it difficult to do your job. The pay and benefits,401k ,medical are great . They do offer college programs which is a plus"
good,"Una empresa que actualmente atraviesa por muchos cambias, para mejorar los cuales de manera indirecta nos afecto a los empleados, sin embargo es una empresa consolidada la cual esta en constante crecimiento, a la cual debo mi consolidación y experiencia en ventas"
good,"I spent 10+ years at the Johnson City Call Center. It was challenging and stressful at times, but the pay is great for this area. They do criminal background check and have no tolerance for drugs."
good,Great place to work. Wish the pay was better as well as benefits. I did not receive any paid time off which i wish i did because i have a family that i like to do things with
good,"Very good training, great incentives. The management team was not always well trained and they do show a lot of favoritism.  There was too much pressure to sell and not enough on good customer service."
good,"This is a a great job, challenging and competitive, great pay and benefits!  I loved helping people save money and correcting any billing errors. I also loved being able to talk to many different individuals each day.  I learned a lot and the training is always going on, which is a good thing."
good,"Great place to work with little to no stress."
good,Company was cool the training chance to advance is benefits are amazing when your apart of them you can tell it feels and shows there nice company recommend
good,Like any other job. Some days are good. And other days can be bad. Some customers can be real challenging. Summer times in Florida are horrible. Its even worse when customers want you to crawl thru there hot attics.
good,"We had our fun time.always serious about working there the managers, employees was very good to get a long with everyone had respect for each other did good working there"
good,It was a great place to work especially it being my first customer service job. They trained me we and it was like I had been doing it all my life. They taught me everything
good,Great product and great people to work with. Some managers were not people person.  The workplace culture was very festive and there was a happy hour almost every day.
good,"Extremely fun and exciting job field, telecommunications will get you where you want to be if you show great sales discipline and the drive to learn and make on fly adjusments,."
good,"Pay is okay, no life though. you are here 24/7 . I have a family of 5 and i barely see them. It should not be like this. Understaffed 6 months out of my 1 year."
good,"No work life balance, sell more for less money. Management pushes for sales that are not there in the traffic sometimes. You do meet great people though"
good,"cut throat environment, working here is fun but you have stats you have to constantly meet, you have to have a certain talk time, maintain your transfers level at a certain percent, as well as collect money & assist to their other needs. gets over whelmed."
good,great place to work.  I am currently still employed but in a surplus capacity for 60days.  I am not adding any more to this review at this time as my choice to not participate
good,"I helped opening up the first Southwestern Bell Wireless Stores,  I handling billing, setting up new accounts, an Sales. This was a salary position.  I work up to 70 hours a week"
good,The first time I worked at AT&T I was very happy and it was a very rewarding job other than standing on a hardwood floor all day. No chairs for customers or reps. That later changed when I came back to AT&T in 2014. Finally! Chairs and Tables that we and the customers were screaming for for years. The management now is really bad. The turnover rate is 98%. The goals are ridiculous because we're always understaffed. If you're not hitting 100% in all categories then you will be written up for the smallest of unimportant things until you're gone. If you're hitting your goals they turn a blind eye to even some of the shadiest of deals. Great company.... unethical management.
good,Great place and people to work with. Was on consulting assignment and had clear defined responsiblities. Challenging and interesting assignments over the years
good,"My very first IT position was at AT&T in Piscataway NJ.  I worked for the largest marketing application that supported the sales force to business communications services.  I worked with PL1, IDMS, DB2, Cobol, VSAM, MVS and Teradata.  During the 7.5 years that I worked for AT&T it was extremely enjoyable and I learned a lot from my co-workers.  There was a great sense of comradery there as I was part of a large group.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the great groups of people I did and the ability to learn different technologies as AT&T was very supportive for any technical training that I requested."
good,Needs better management. Very very fast paste work. In and out of houses. You get to see a lot working with at&t. Possibly travel and work in other states
good,"I trained for three months, learning the U-verse system inside and out. I drove a company vehicle and would arrive on-site to set up the system in a customers's home. The situation between management and workers was odd because of a worker's Union. The hardest part of the job was working in attics during the summer months, and the time limitations placed on the premise techs. I did enjoy the freedom that was allowed me as a Tech ."
good,Works with lots of non profits in the area. not a lot of positions or funding for new positions and raises. Nice culture and work environment. does a lot for the community
good,AT&T culture develops a sense of purpose and direction for the company and its customers. Solid foundation with an eye for the future. In my time with the company we've developed from 'The Phone Company' to a content provider with the infrastructure to deliver entertainment to customers on a multitude of platforms.
good,"AT&T is fun and exciting, very rewarding but also tiring. Working long nights and weekends can take a toll on someone with a newborn at home and that was my downfall. Other than that I really enjoyed the company."
good,"A very competitive workplace."
good,Outsourcing crushing traditional job paths.... automation taking positions as well.  Excellent leadership but advancement during these times of workplace 2020 is becoming difficult.
good,After 2 years of micromanaging and not living up to 1 managers standards I walked away from the company. i have learned from large corporations that cannot handle themselves in a below capacity facility put a lot of their goals on the employees 'pushing the sale' and 'send it anyway' attitude. if you want to work where morals and policy are not lived up to or by be my guest.
good,Productive environment with loads of customer interaction. The workplace culture is very fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job is with the customers. I had all major hospitals in area.
good,"Getting my start at a news station "
good,I Enjoyed my time working there and had a really good experience there. There was flexible hours and i enjoyed coming into work. They also helped me gained experience in sales.
good,"At&t is a good place to work, the most difficult part is time off and working around things that pop up in life. It's fast pace and the income with benifits are great."
good,"It was a great learning experience. Both professionally and personally. With all the different jobs I had it taught me how to work with people with different perspectives attitudes, and background.,"
good,Retail jobs are hard to accommodate a genuine work/life balance and that is no exception at AT&T.  There are long hours and constantly changing metrics to meet.
good,"Its a fast track and energize place to work every minute and day is a fast pace to be. make your numbers and you will be at the top of the field in every department. Make your ideas in how to perform under extreme quotas and management rules. A real thinker out the box type problem solver, customer service and applying the company credo at all times. Always with integrity and comply with the company values."
good,"Good Product, Great people, job security is not most stable, Good benefits, great innovation. Training opportunities are great as well."
good,This was by far one of the best jobs. Benefits are amazing and compensations is great. You determine how much money you make based on job performance.
good,Job was very boring for the most part. And now I have to come up with at least twenty words. I learned some but not often. apparently 20 words isn't enough for this pointless review.
good,its a good company to work for theres some rotten tomatoes in management that shouldn't be leaders but for the most part of the rest they are amazing i love AT&T but there were some that made it hard to to my job other then that I recommend the experience to anyone.
good,"This is a great company to work for. you must consistently sell  things so if you dont like selling,dont apply for the position"
good,"Aprendi a tratar a los clientes, ya que hay unos especiales y no a todos se les trata igual ."
good,Ok. commission based job. Made good money but the hours were kind of crazy. Commission never guaranteed. Base pay was only 10/hr and was only if you hit your hours
good,Workplace was upbeat and fast paced. Always someone to answer your questions and help you learn more about the company. Great incentives and benefits.
good,"AT&T is a place of work that you can advance if you work 80 hours a week, learn to work for micro managing managers, and do not think for your self."
good,Excellent job work and life balance with good compensation and benefits. The management is really good with a good work environment and co workers....
good,"Nice platform to learn new things and  Learnt new tools like Oracle Golden date,EWR reporting tools etc here.Got good encouragement to learn new things and shared across team members.We will get good recognition for our good work for sure."
good,At this job Fusion BPO Services was horrible in then overall Employee Sat. I wish Fusion would take the time to give back to the employees. Also this company has a hard time of getting peoples pay correct. They need new management. That is one reason why I left this employer.
good,Face to face communication with clients. Assisting guest with getting up stairs to clients. Knowledge in property management and budgeting funds.
good,"-completed required tasks as assigned daily"
good,AT&T offers a good environment and best learning opportunities. Management is very agile and future focused with lot of initiatives being taken to emerge as a leading solutions provider in the IT industry
good,"OK place. Great salary. Insurance is not the best. Company is advancing at a rapid pace. Self pace work, extreme conditions at times."
good,"Responsible for AT&T’s wireless and mobile portfolio consisting of 4 major retailers (Walmart, Best Buy, Target & Sam’s Club) and Authorized retail locations in Western Arkansas.

good,"ATT is a great place to work. There is place for advancement and growth, and amazing benefits. Managers work with you and there is always ongoing training."
good,My typical day at work is to get my normal sales or higher and keep my respect with customers and be on time to work always and all my co-workers are great peronality and i have great  people skills
good,The pay structure varies. As in every work place you have some good and paid it comes with the marketing of the world. The hardest part of my job is making sure that I have a steady paycheck every two weeks to make sure that my life and bills balances out. I get free Satellite and Half off my at&t bill plus unlimited data
good,The culture and environment at At&t has changed in the last 2 yrs has changed. At&t has established new guidelines that has the potential of turning the company into a revolving door company.
good,"AT&T/ Directv was a great place to work, I loved my job and the people that I worked with. I was very happy with the morality of the company always trying to do the right thing for the customer even if it wasn't necessarily in the best interest of the company."
good,"It is very fast past environment. Constantly changing procedures and policies depending on the needs of the business.  If you plan your day the day before, you will have to adjust calendar to compensate the needs of the business.  You may get some irrigated customer that you will  have to assist and diffuse their anger.  AT&T is a good company to work for, they provide excellent benefits. I have learned that each day is different and you cannot get upset and back away from daily life. Working with co-workers are a great way of learning from each other. We worked well together to improve results and share best practices to ensure we are all successful in what we do.  I love working with the teams to better results.  We had fun events to keep the agents motivated.  The hardest I have experienced is there is no work/life balance.  Family is important"
good,"Successfully completed training and made cold calls in call center."
good,"I was a contractor at AT&T and it was an great place to work."
good,"The upside: self-directed work, most of the time. Down time, spent waiting for job approval, construction support, etc..."
good,"Worked for AT&T for almost 8 years. Starting out it was a good place to work. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and the management staff was awesome. After becoming pregnant however working for AT&T was hard to shuffle with my personal life. I never had time for my family at all and missed out on a lot."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers on the phone, and specially when I resolve their problems. I also, learn new skill every time I deal with angry customer, and I feel proud of my self when I me able to calm and deal in good way with angry and upset customers."
good,I worked for AT&T just about 9 years and it taught me great values.  I would recommend giving AT&T an opportunity. Ok Ok Ok OK
good,This company is well organized and I found it fun to work for them. I was able to work well with my fellow coworkers. I learned a lot from working with this company.
good,"Has been in the BPO business for more than 8 yrs performing management/operations in different call centers. Online Media, Customer support, Technical support, calibrations, quality assurance, lead generation, email and chat support, survey and even sales."
good,lack promotional opportunities based on experience.  too much subjectivity in promotions.  Too much of dog eat dog world
good,Worked with multiple contractors and internal personnel. Daily inventory consisted of cycle counts and warehouse duties.
good,"Typical day at work involves providing a single point of contact and is the AT&T face to the customer. I've leant that great service works; to consistently setting and exceeding customers' expectations for resolution and deliver on your promise, built trust."
good,"My job consists of a lot of responsibilities. For me, I was a relieving manager when Managers were not available for extended periods of time. I also help with new applications that was being tested in our office. I am currently a Team Leader for the group, which assists on takeover calls, assisting with errors on orders, and speaking with inside technicians and business office. For the 18 years I have been here, I have experience in consumer, wholesale, billing and network."
good,"Dynamic and exciting telecommunications environment with"
good,AT &T Changed my lifestyle and they invest in their employees.  I worked Monday through Friday after being with the company for 4 years because of the union but eventually it was worth the trade initially.  Most of my coworkers had more years of service than I did but we all managed to get along in our experiences. the hardest part of the job was working holidays and not being able to move up within the setting I was.
good,loved my job here but no room for advancement and to much family in their offices. I loved working with customers and other employees
good,The only negative is the degradation of the management benefits and retirement for older employee's who had spent a lifetime working and thinking they would have a good retirement income.
good,"Good place to work, advancement is TBD. Work Life balance is available but greatly depends on organization you work in. Tuition reimbursement is poor"
good,"Very structured great employees to work with and a fun place to grow with a lot of people,  Job is a great place to add a lot of experience to your job history."
good,"Install cable, internet, and phone services or repair them. Deal with various challenges from each day. Team meetings each morning. Great environment to work in and plenty of interesting people. Management can be a bit rough around the edges, but overall a great company to work with."

A typical day when I was a clerk was dealing with other clerks in Indiana and working closely with them to give the company and its customers the best product.  Management is an extension of the company that is mandatory. The hardest part of the job when I was with 411 Directory Assistance was the constant pressure of managers walking up and down the aisles checking up on the employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job at Directory Assistance was helping the customers and being the connection between them and the company.

Management played an important role as far as assisting with difficult customers and coaching to advance to the next level.. Co-workers were also an important part because they were always accessible when I needed assistance with answering questions on topics I did not have the answers to or in teaching me how to do certain things. The hardest part of the job was always the language barrier and attempting to please and make every customer have a seamless experience. The most enjoyable was bonding with individual customers and making the work place a fun place to come to."
good,Working for Direct Tv or actually a sub- contracting company that has them as a client is really laid back. I had my own truck and on schedule. I thought about myself as the best technian because I was in several workers eyes. The pay was awesome.

good,"At&t was a great company to work for. A typical day is just serving the customers, which is my joy. I learned alot through this company that has continued my success through the years. The hardest part was the hours. The split shift with a family is hard unless you have great support. Working 7 am to 12 noon then from 3 pm to 7 pm was hard for me being a mother of two small children. The best part was the money, the joy of helping customers, and the rewards for being a great employee. Knowing the feeling of being an asset to a team is rewarding as well."
good,"Usually I would come into the office ,follow up on the previous days statsand create a competetive enviroment. I would have new requirements of the day , numbers required daily which would help my team reach a monthly goal. Answering any questions from the customers that would be disgruntled for any reasons.

I would bring them back to my table by the home theater department and talk to them about Direct TV by advertising and telling them about the store promotions both Direct TV and Best Buy had for them and what they could save. I learned how to make sales and really identify potential clients. My co-workers where really great. It was a lot of fun to work with each and everyone of them from the office to the store. The hardest part of the job was traveling to different locations and later being placed on commission. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and talking to new people."
good,"If I didnt have to sell it would have been easier, I loved the job though so much freedom and you really learn a lot about business in general. Great for all ages and all types of people(unless youre that 2.5% of quiet people in the world) They give plenty of chances and are awesome people in general. I quit though, due to not meeting what they wanted me to, and the rediculously 52 hours a week.(including lunch)"
good,"You are at the mercy of a retail schedule when with AT&T Retail stores, but if your a good salesperson, you can make upwards of $80,000+ in 1 year. Good management to help you along the way, and depending on your location lots of opportunity to make money. When you work in this part of AT&T, you are usually away from home at least 11 hours a day, so if you have children, make sure you kiss them good morning, because more than likely you will see them in bed or getting ready for bed when you come home. Average time I leave home is 9:30 am, and I arrive at home usually around 8:30 pm."

good,Solo que no existe congruencia en sus estadísticas de crecimiento y establecimiento de alcances de manera objetiva
good,"They could do better in how much they pay their employees after all they go the tax cuts.  The call center is very busy and not enough suowrvisors.  The customers can be rude and now I hear since I left, they just chat on the phone so not that much chance to have customers abuse people who speak with an accent.  I wasn’t supported when I took abuse from the customers on the phone."
good,"The pay is worth it. Management needs improvement and so does their training methods. You are paid based on experience, which is rare for ""slow-broke-cala""."

good,"Great job. Pay is above other cable/internet providers. Lots of paid time off. Honesty, wish I never would’ve left. Management is ok at best, but if your doing what your supposed to be doing, generally they leave you alone."
good,"This is a good place for people that want long term stable employment.  It is not for the new breed of employees.  There is no fast advancement, no rapid progression to what you think you deserve."
good,"Reading assigned feature or functionality descriptions."
good,Morning meetings very demanding managers strive for perfection. Work in bad weather conditions  made job difficult. Pole climbing in alley. Meeting daily job completion requirements to meet monthly goals for bonus and keep your job
good,"good work during my day"

good,"Great place to work! I was paid a decent wage with benefits 401k and perks such as discounts on wireless, Directv, home phone, or broadband services. My schedule sucked though and I hardly seen my family. Other than that it would have been a dream job."
good,Great job. I work in Texh Support. However after a while the job gets mentally exhausting. For me at least. It gets hard at times. And knowing people always call in with a problem eventually got the best of me. However the pay is more than I could have asked for in a starting position.
good,Had a great career with cutting edge technology. Although a large corporation the wheels do move a lot more quickly than before. The most enjoyable part of the job was my ability to coach and teach others.
good,"Provide very good opportunity, in career development. Company's strongly promotes continuous personal development. Offer educational support for individual in particular studies."
good,Excelente ambiente todas las prestaciones muy bien en el caso de las cuotas es donde de repente les falta un poco ya que siento que sus procesos de medición son muy exagerados y crecen las cuotas muy excesivamente pero en lo de más excelente empresa
good,I love AT&T as a company and I love their service.  I will stay with AT&T as long as they are a company.   I think they have great service and great customer relationships .

good,It is a good job with a lot of perks. It is challenging stressful and fun all at the same time. The team you work with and direct supervisor make the job fun or a nightmare. Overall it is a fantastic job. Long hours and mirco management will wear you down.
good,"Pay does not match jobs performed. Multiple functions in the customer service field as the company was moving to on stop shop, but pay did not increase with the work performed."
good,Working for AT&T was very challenging this was due to the ever changing processes which were being implemented almost every 6-months. Some of the timelines or due dates in my opinion became unrealistic to manage correctly.  So based of this process you find the goals which were set for the organization fell short of being completed or exceeded based on the category of performance.   Due to the climate of the social media & higher expectations from leadership the real world applications became difficult to achieve.
good,Was a good company to work with but the pay was low however during my years there i was able learn alot and manage differentdepartments . I also learned to set up meetings and learn more about the company
good,When  I worked at Directv. The Fort Smith site was the best. We set all standards and was proud to do it. But the company is not the same things have changed a lot from what i hear.

good,"Workplace culture is phenomenal at AT&T.  You meet people in assignments that you will continue to be in contact with and know during your entire career.  Over the years, these contacts often become close friends, career contacts, and sources for getting corporate questions answered and securing paths for resolving problems.  Understanding the culture makes your work easier and makes you a more valuable asset to the company, making it much easier to be chosen and rehired if you ever decide to temporarily leave AT&T."
good,"Great place to work overall. They are driven by numbers more so currently. Great atmosphere. Only downside is the shift bids, the limited work life balance."
good,"Unfortunately, my supervisor wasn't understanding to my personal situation.  I had a death in my family and wasn't able to make it.  Things wasn't well."
good,Good job for the position I worked.  Very flexible on the part time hours. Loved the paid days off for holidays or double pay if worked. Nice pay to just be a greeter in the store.

good,"Good team work. Although the lowest on the food chain, the pay was good. However, if you have ambitions of advance, you will need to have the patience for somebody to die on the department you desire."
good,Investigate the Network to ensure no outages were present. Assisted Customer Care Reps with device and network related issues through Cherwell tickets
good,worked there 18 years with a progressive career in marketing technology.  They go through re-orgs and re-locations fairly often with mergers and leadership changes every few years.  The changes can be stressful if you're not in a stable department.
good,"I would say in all a good place to work but the hours can become quite long as you do work until all the jobs for the day are cleared long and the weather is not always on your side, i just feel its time for a change"
good,"AT&T is a good company to  work for. Allows for advancement and is a union company.  Days can be stressful and fast paced, but the management team tries to keep things lite and make it a fun place to work.  Things are always changing and the jobs duties and responsibilities of each department are always increasing.  Schedules change but not as often as employee's would like which can make it difficult for non work related things."
good,Managment was supportive and had your back as long as you give your best and have positive attitude. Enjoyed the work of a Lineman. Physical and dirty work as to be expected. Good salary and lots of overtime if you wanted to work it.
good,"Good colleagues to collaborate with. New technologies to learn. Paid travel expenses across mid-atlantic states. Ability to influence decisions and outcomes of cell site construction, access and property owners."
good,AT&T has its own University and it helps retool employees for jobs for the future and it also offers Nano Degrees and other degrees that you can obtain online.
good,"I was given training the same day hired. I worked during the summer months, so its was a little warmer, but I enjoyed the walking. The extra income came in handy."
good,"Nice job to work at, especially if you like moving around a lot. Requirements and expectations are very easily to abide by. Employees are willing to train so you can be on the right track."

good,"Very well life balanced job , and open for advancement looking forward of coming back to AT&T again , culture is open and they open for suggestion looking forward of hearing from them"
good,As a sales representative I gained a lot of experience working with customers and management that pushed me beyond myself. I liked the nature of the work environment although it was a bit too competitive. To the point that workplace bullying occurred everyday.
good,"Strong stable job for telecom engineering. Contract positions outside of AT&T are also profitable, but altogether AT&T would be the way to go, if you want a long, stable career as an OSP Engineer."
good,"My manager degrated and be littled, not only me but other coworkers as well.  The worst part is she is still working there. The only highlight of my day was our senior manager and other coworkers."
good,"overall a good company like any other it has its pro and cons, the main thing at the workplace is the importance of the customer, and always remain professional and calm when providing customer support"
good,"Great place to make money get educated advancement It was exciting to be working in a man's field but after training You were expected to set your family aside.Overtime was mandatory not even the Union could save you.You accepted and waited for vacation."
good,"The company overall is a great place to work- unfortunately when it comes to job security, there is non as decisions on head count aren't done according to any logical manner and no real information is given how selections are made."
good,job had good pay & great benefits---people worked with sometimes very verbal-union shop- 8-5 hours free parking management likeable no a lot of room to advance in none management
good,"A variety of jobs as requests would come in globally of issues that needed resolving. Meetings with senior management or dealing with various crisis."

good,"I did not have the chance to work for a very long time."
good,"overall good company, change level 1 managers like crazy, hours working  versus hours at home could be better, good benefits, work alone most of the time, no stress"
good,"Install, upgrade the new equipment if required  and repair residential satellite TV products,service calls and trouble-shoot satellite products, and complete work orders properly..."
good,Great place to work and if you do a great job on the phone there are plenty of chances for advancements.  Their are also lots of incentives that are given to motivate you to work harder.
good,"Worked at the call center for 13 years. Score card killed many jobs. There isn't much to to tell. They pay well, great benefits, great PTO & FMLA. if YOU CAN GET HIRED"
good,"Faltaba apoyo correcto de los supervisores."
good,Poor management selections. Management is never consistent and never one the same page. There is also no room to grow or advance your career. Benefits are great and pay is good. Commission changes too often
good,ottimo ma il lavoro non da' certezze essendo precario e in Repubblica Ceka non riuscivo a coprire le spese
good,The employees were ok but the manager weren't the best. the job really taught me a lot about providing great customer experience and it was great learning sales
good,"I had a lot of autonomy on my job, learnt a lot and grew in my career here. If you work hard the opportunity to be recognized and grow is there. Being a team player and making friends with collaborating teams will help."
good,"The company is a great company to work for, however they need to provide more or better training for their technician. Once you are out of training they pretty much let you go and you either sink or swim. SO, If you never worked in that field you will not last long."
good,"Fast pace.  "
good,"El ambiente laboral es muy bueno tanto con compañeros como con superiores,"
good,I learned a lot and the company can be like family. They teach and guide you through all the changes that occur. At the center of their corporation is humanity.
good,"I loved that there were continuously training, giving a proper preparation to the representatives creating ownership of the company and the product. Loved the team work experience, and the most important thing being able to work with different cultures. Learning about the products every day. It was amazing when we fulfill and overcome the established goals."
good,"For the most part it is a great career, after you have been there so long they offer programs for you to go back to school to earn a degree to advance further in the company."
good,"The company started out great and gave me a great transition from the military; they even kept me hired when the position went away.  They then helped me to get into another position that was more permanent.  However, contract expired and was undercut by a terrible company who forced everyone to take their salary cuts."
good,"Great work place, have to have amazing communication skills, a people person, very competitive, you have To be dedicated if you want to work here, if you aren’t dedicated you won’t last long. I was very dedicated"
good,Steady work with good benefits and perfect if you have a family or life outside of work. The people I worked with were really nice and fun made it worth going into at the office.
good,"Great company, not so great management. Our specific store went through 3 managers in a 6 month time span all of which figured they were bigger than the company."
good,"The company pays well overall and invests in their employees."
good,I liked it I wish they had technical support or sales for call center in Kingman az so think what you want or believe what you hear about oh god att phone jobs are super boring. Well their kinda fun and entertaining in my opinion but maybe I'm jist a bit wee whacko? LOL
good,"Over all its a good job. Your paid well and get discounts on cell phones, tv and internet services. Also get performance based bonuses each month if you make your numbers."
good,"The ability to help bring ideas and people together with their desires and needs and your company's opportunities and solutions is communication perfected.  There is rarely a predictable, typical day at work.  The hardest and most enjoyable part of the ""job"", whether a long term project or an immediate, short term task is the need to and the opportunity to listen, think, and communicate all at the same time."
good,We were typically very busy and juggling several items at once.   Some issues were resolved in a few minutes and some took a few hours so we were very often chained to our desks.  But it was always interesting and time passed quickly.
good,"Excellent job for anyone not afraid of working hard, learning new skills, and working as an individual within a team.  Some of the metrics are a bit ridiculous, and the management is meant to constantly “discuss” your numbers with you as scare tactics, but as long as you do your job, and are where you are supposed to be, its a great job.  It’s a better job if you are a single person without kids because you may find yourself working until 10-11pm regularly in the summer time, but the pay is excellent and the OT really helps.  The culture at work is excellent too for the most part.  Some of the most fun I’ve had in any job was getting to spend time with my co workers.  Sure, there are some people that one may night get along with, but overall, 98% of the people working there were great to be around.  One of the best parts of the job is the fact that other companies understand the amount of training that goes into becoming a tech with AT&T. The experience is very highly sought after by other technical companies.  I personally had management from other technical companies approach me and ask if I’d like to move over to their company when they saw me in public in my uniform.  You may think that being a Wire Tech is ‘just a cable guy” kind of job, but there is so much more to it, and you will be humbled by the amount of learning, effort, and skill that goes into this position.  And yes, I’m actually a Wire Tech."
good,Metric and performance based environment.  Constantly having to improve.  Lots of room for advancement.  Very diverse employee base.  Management willing to work with you.
good,Great experience in telecommunications industry.  Worked with all levels of management and functions to develop and facilitate process control maps to improve the processes and streamline operations.
good,"Wonderful Job , Wish i didnt have too move. The team i was with was very team oriented upbeat and loved to sale. I believe your co workers can make or break a job more than the fact of if you actually loved the job or not."
good,The company as a whole is wonderful. The job itself will stress you out if you let it. There is too much miscommunication and most of management is not on the same page.
good,"I learned so much in my 26 years there, They provided onsite training classes, where I learned technical and soft skills. The atmosphere is like a family. Many people have worked there for years."
good,"uverse support. always changing. enjoyed people i worked with and manager, did not always agree with what was asked of us but gladly did it with a smile."
good,Really enjoyed AT&T and wanted to be on full time but with DTV buyout contracters were cut down significantly.  Very good work culture and a place that provides a great work environment.
good,"My time spent working at AT&T was well worth, it taught me basic business skills that will progress with me for the rest of my professional career. My typical work day would consist of meeting with members of team management to discuss daily sales goals and coming up with different strategies to accomplish them. The workplace culture was very good in the sense that my teammates were not just my co workers, but my friends as well. We would constantly challenge each other to become better in order to make more money and run an efficient business operation. The toughest part of the job was definitely over the holidays when the rush can seem to be overwhelming. However over time, I became much better at discerning and recognizing situations in order to innovate personalized solutions for every customer, from bill analysis, to restructuring plans, and selling various products and services owned by the company. In turn, it also turned out to be one of my favorite times of the job itself because you had the best chance to make the most amount of money. Usually management would hold daily, weekly, and monthly contests for the sales team to make competition more exciting and add more incentive."
good,"I loved the team of people that I worked with, what I didn't love was the inconsistency of our goals.  My pay was highly based on commission, and after having a good month, your goals the next month would be doubled, and failure to meet those goals resulted in dramatically lower income."
good,enjoyed flexibility with going from job to job. always something new to learn. I was always in contact with different customers and brought joy to their faces when i completed my work in restoring their service.
good,pay was ok but the management was great as you moved up the chain of command it started becoming favorite based when they would think of promoting and they mainly outsourced for managers so you don't even get a chance to me moved up.
good,"Working for AT&T now is way different from when I worked there. I've been gone for 17 years and it was during the time of the cell phone. People no longer have land lines. There is more than one number per household. Where as then there would have been two at the most. "
good,AT&T was a fast paced environment that was constantly changing. If you were not an open minded will to learn individual then this is not the job for you.
good,Workplace culture is fast paced. With tight deadlines and level of collaboration required is high. Teams are very experienced in their area of expertise.
good,"Very large company - pays good and on time.  Paid training, pays for tools, training materials and books and supplies. good vacation and benefits - medical, dental and eye."
good,"Great Company, Great Benefits, and Great Work/Life balance. Also great maternity leave"
good,"Great company to work for! You definitely learn a lot. If you do not work, you do not make the desirable pay. The commission keeps you eager to work harder and more. Endless hours, not a good separation for me between work/ home life. No benefits other than unlimited pay days off."
good,"Enjoyable place to work, offer great benefits. Depending on what department you worked in, the benefits were different for every department. They occasionally downsize different areas."
good,"Some days are busy most are easy going, everyone gets along and it is a very laid back environment. Normally I will configure and troubleshoot printer, desktop, and workstation issue's."

good,"continuous traffic, customer facing, and customer service. Overall a great company. I've been with this company for 12 years and I've grown tremendously"
good,"As with every company, there are expectations that need to be met. You are the face of a huge company and they hold you to high but obtainable work standards. You have a good amount of freedom in the field but management can and will pop in on you at any time. If you are disciplined and do your job right, this is a great place to work."
good,"My 20 + years had its ups and downs . But at the end , it was a great place to work for . Employees are dedicated as long as they are given the proper respect. "
good,"A day in the life at AT&T can flunctuate between highly busy and a calm day.  I've learned the direction AT&T would like to go in, the expectation they have for us to uphold with our customers, the opportunities they provide and the rules enforced."
good,"Atención, comodidad del centro de trabajo,hospitalidad en todo sentido y capacitación seguida"
good,"Working for ATT has been a great experience.  Most of the business units have a positive culture.  The company offers many benefits like service  discounts, health benefits, 401k, and tuition reimbursement."
good,I was ranked number 6 manager last year and won wards each month. I won the first quarterly reward this year. My team members all loved me and called me momma.
good,"I like working for AT&T, unfortunately we are losing the account I am currently assigned to, thus actively looking for a  new position.  Actively looking both inside AT&T and outside."
good,"Competitive pay, great benefits!! It was fast paced so it kept you busy most of the day, good comission, paid training in brooklyn i had my training paid hotel and food."
good,I was able to bid on open jobs and move into different positions with this company. There was ample oportunity for growth and development  It was a very competitive environment but overall a good place to work.  Its especially good for young people who are willing to be put on mentoring track.  The benefits are good.  And the hours are flexible.  I had to leave for health reasons.
good,AT&T is a good workplace. We were there for the customers benefit. Able to help them through their situations was a great feeling of accomplishment for myself and the customer.
good,Great place to work and raise a family.  Must be disciplined and punctual. Great pay and benefits. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the angry customers but at the end of the day the family like atmosphere and encouragement from management and coworkers helped minimize the stress.
good,Overall a great company to work for with full benefits.  I enjoyed working for the company for 17+ years and have seen many changes - mostly positive changes with the company.
good,Very nice place to work can be stressful at time but I wouldn't trade it. Not much room for growth maybe next year thing swill turn around. I learned a great deal and receive tuition reimbursement.
good,"Un día de trabajo era la captación de posibles clientes en los diferentes puntos de trabajo."
good,The company as an overall i would say it is a wonderful company. I learned a lot from this company in the technical field. The best part of the job was when the customer was happy with the service we provided to them.
good,"Very good company to work for with excellent pay, excellent benefits and an extremely fun culture driven by sales of cellular and satellite devices. Would recommend."

good,The culture is amazing and the teams are knowledgeable and the partnership is great. The hardest part of the job was controlling the work life balance.
good,"Your day consists of very busy, back to back calls or concerns addressing customers questions. This can easily be described in one work. Complaints.. people complain a lot and if you can't not take it personally you're doomed."
good,I have been with AT&T for over five years and they have provided me with a quality platform to grow professionally. They foster a competitive working environment and give you access to a vast amount of resources to help you meet quota.
good,"I have had a few roles at AT&T. I have had good managers and bad ones. The executive leadership is great but they serve the stockholders and there are 5-10% budget cuts every year (most resolved by cutting people). Get into a growth area like connected cars, entertainment, artificial intelligence, and you will be fine."
good,"I didn't work for corporate AT&T, I worked for Prime Communications which was privately owned. The job was awesome my co workers was the best. The only problem I had with this job was the commission check. They changed the rules monthly and made it very hard to reach your goal."
good,"Have to work hard at att to advance, is a great company with great benefits I don't complaint . Only bad thing about it is job security and a really bad fmla policy , you can't get sick"

good,"Una familia respetuosa,amable,compresiva y colaboradora"
good,"I believe AT&T is a great company to work for with huge opportunities for advancement. If you are a driven by opportunities and goals, then AT&T is one of the best in the world to consider a career path."
good,"Use to take the team briefing  at the start of the shift, motivate them to deliver good stats, take Supervisory calls & manage the team coach them to deliver their targets. Also coach them to take good calls, take refresher training if need with regards to the process. Use to make sure the Representatives working under me are happy by doing some fun activities also use to plan some outing at least once in 3 months.Working with AT&T have learned to deal with different kind people."
good,"I had a great time working at the eddystone pa location. my coworkers were awesome and truthfully we were a little dysfunctional family. The store managers were phenomenal and very helpful with all issues. Yet if you decide to work for this company be prepared for a 6 month probation period which was issued by the union. also during that time you do not get second chances for breaking policy, that is what happened to me without any remorse even after explaining the entire situation which was a system error."
good,"You start your day at 8 am, the last job window is 4-8. Some days can be very long. But over all it is a good place to work. You have to choose your position wisely, some positions are very hard to advance in."
good,My management team was excellent and always supported my efforts to improve our customers experience. the people who worked for me were excellent and well trained.
good,at&t is a great place to work. they ask a lot of you but they will compensate you very well for it. i would definitely recommend it to anyone the only bad thing is the hours.

good,I had a wonderful career at AT&T for over 33 years.  I was able to advance into several other job opportunities and further challenge my abilities and stay current and engaged.  AT&T allowed me to move into other areas to grow and strengthen my skills and experience.
good,Directv (AT&T) is a good place to work.  Advancement is plentiful.  Most positions are demanding.  Hard if your just starting a family and family time is important to you.
good,at&t was a great work experience. Worked with good people building the brand and learned to be a coach of people and not just sales. Work/life balance was a challenge but overall a great place to work.
good,"I have spent a great number of years with the company and most have been very enjoyable. Lately however, it seems that employees are no longer required to adhere to the quality elements that made the company great, including the Extraordinary Leader model and motto that embracing diversity allows for more creativity and innovation."
good,Trabaje muchos años para esta empresa la verdad me encantaba trabajar para ellos trabaje muy agusto y muchas iluciones de cada ves mas subir de puesto ya que ellos me valoraban mi esfuerzo y motibaban mis deseos de superacion con muchas oportunidades es mucho lo que podria decir de esta empresa siempre valore y aprobeche las oportunidades que me daban mis supervisores jamas se que jaron de mi trabajo era tan rapida con lo que me tocaba aser que me quedaba tiempo para alludar a mis compañeros gane muchas veses el socio del mes.  Alcanse ser grado 4 que era el maximo logre ser empleado universar no logre llegar mas alto no mas porque la empresa decidio retirarse. Sufrimos mucho con este retiro ya que la mayoria de mis compañero la queriamos mucho no la veiamos como un trabajo comun si algo mas como si fuera parte de nuestra familia casi les aseguro que acualquiera que le pregunten de los que trabajamos en esa empresa les dira lo mismi que yo se los digo porque yo fui su compañera y todos manifestaron lo mismo .

good,"respectable place to work in, as long as you do your job no one will bother you, make good connections and very great opportunity for growth"
good,"Great company, but not customer focused and work-life is not important.  Management is hit or miss and inconsistent.  Products competitive but service is not"
good,"a regular day at AT&T when I worked there was enjoyable come in the morning login your on the clock. Next we wait for the customers in my normal day I would handle 75-100 payments per day also along with the pleasures of helping a customer purchase a phone that is to their liking as well as phone cases and accessories etc.. and after every shift I did the deposits and the drop box and the ""customer input"" for the day (how much money was made that day). The hardest part of that job was dealing with a customer and their insurance claim. The most enjoyable part of my day was always around 10 am when I first got there I would open and clean up the store."
good,"Good company, you direct supervisor will be a factor in your overall experience with the company.I enjoyed my time there and was there for 5 years."
good,High energy and enthusiasm from all to service and create a new customer base. I learned educating the general public of their actual needs is not an easy endeavor. Management was johnny on the spot with guidance and information to produce a protected and cared for customer.
good,Empresa muy apegada a la atención y satisfacción al cliente
good,A good place to work. Expectations for field employees are unfair due to there metrics that are not fair. Management is poor and not expirienced.
good,"You get to work out of your own truck. Everyday is different. Management is professional and helps you get the job done. Co-workers are ok, the company needs to do better at keeping it professional between employees. Hardest part of the job was not knowing when you get to go home. The most enjoyable part was everyday was different."
good,"Typical day was continuous calls handling billing, tech support and problem solving."
good,"Typical day at work is logging in to several data bases to complete 1 or multiple job duties that are assigned daily. I've learned to trouble shoot methods and procedures that are continuously updated, notified via email, team huddles and classroom training groups. Daily team and individual performance results sets the tone to striving to be our best."
good,"great competitive culture. plenty of room for advancement as long as you are a hardworking, committed individual. great place to work when you are a fan of technology and want to connect with the world around you."
good,Fun work environment but did not see all the money i was supposed to be making. I definitely would do it again under different management.
good,"Great benefits such as discount on cell phone"
good,"Would have liked to make a career out of this, but there was not enough hours or real opportunity to move up. Great atmosphere, people were great and lots of good people to work with."
good,"i started a server, learned everything there was to know about the company quickly, and showed that on that floor.  It wants long before people started to see that it was time for me to advance, so they promoted me to supervisor, gave more responsibilities and a pay raise. I continued to shine through. That was when they gave me a another pay raise. i learned so much about every aspect in the hotel for my own sake, and i loved it. i enjoyed all the employees and customers that i worked with. It made it a great job overall. The hardest part of this job was when management. it would change very frequently. Which then meant we would then have to change our styles of work that we knew so well. management was really hard subject here at the holiday inn due to hours and scheduling. they really wouldn't take anything into consideration when anyone needed a day off or had personal issues .The best part of working for this company were the employees lunch-ins, they would have every month to show appreciation to employees in front of a crowd, as fed us free food and drinks, and were giving out awards, and gifts. great thing to do for employees to show you care!"
good,"ATT is a fair and great place for all, great benefits, dedicated customer services level for all customers and partners."
good,"I absolutely loved working as a sales consultant. Working with people helping then to solve their billing issues and set them up with new services to start their businesses.  I enjoyed the challenge of being number one in sales each month. I stayed number one in sales for 7 months straight. The people I worked with were all amazing, friendly, and fun. I spent all day taking calls fixing customer problems and selling products. I scored exceptional each month in sales and customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was being trained on new pricing. Training was sometimes given while I was on the phone with a customer. Beside a few small things I overall loved the customer service and sales driven part of the job!"
good,"I enjoyed my work at AT@T School of Business and technology"
good,Very long hours in all jobs - learned how to plan and be productive - Management is good at lower levels but upper management does not understand how to manager people - Co workers are ok - Long hours - People.

good,"Typical day was handling 50-70 calls.  Resolving billing issues and selling services within a 300 second time slot."
good,"Everyday began with a team huddle reviewing safety precautions and updating the team on goals for the month."
good,"A very challenging environment with huge list of applications since it's an amalagamantion of various organizationss like Bell South, Cingular, Direct TV. Multiple vendors to support different applicagtions and too many verticals, all the vendors have their own process."
good,Worked in an enjoyable environment selling phones tablets and other technological products.  The most enjoyable part was working alongside m colleagues.  Assisting people was also very rewarding as mobile phones have been engrained in our culture and society.

good,"Excellent work place with very supportive management"
good,Horrible work hours. But the pay and the travel was nice. Management is poor and not very knowledgeable about job. Big company that doesn't really care about employees
good,Fun place to work....but to many employees. Very crowded office space with cubicles very close to each other. To many supervisors
good,"Great company but un-supportive management when dealing with employee relations. Worked for this company in a call center, Overtime was great"

good,Company has nice work culture. Management is Co Operative and Hard Working. They are connected with the Ground Reality.
good,I started out as a contractor before being converted as a permanent employee and so far i haven't had any complaints. The main reason i decided to work with At&t instead of being a contractor was stability.

The hardest part about the job is nothing. the most enjoyable part about the job is when we get shout-outs for selling or upgrading products for a customer.
good,"I am not sure AT&T knows exactly the path it needs to take to get there. It often times chases the competition without recognizing what it has in its current portfolio to be able to pull away and be an industry leader.

I had great co-workers that were very easy to get along with while I was with the company. The hardest part of the job was the schedule was just dealing with my schedule.

My co-workers were very cooperative , understanding and patient. The hardest part of the job was the beginning as it's a complex and large scale company, getting used to it took couple of months, apart from that, everyday is a challenge here which is worth accepting.

I've handled inbound and outbound collection calls. Currently I am the manager relief for Bankruptcy. I have handled bankruptcy for eight years. The hardest part of the job is making the customers understand our collections process post bankruptcy and getting them to adhere to the policy.

good,"You will be written up, there are five stages of being written up. At larger branches of the company there might be horizontal and vertical movements but in the Austin location transferring to those branches and/or other departments means that you must have a flawless attendance, and must meet the ever increasing goals that every one has regardless of monthly changes or outside conditions. The hardest part of the job is getting your goal figures and then having them just be increased 20% even though only a few people are able to meet all of their metrics. For me, the most enjoyable part of the job was having power to fix csx's bills, and alot of power in that regard. The worst part, is that there is no true sickdays. Sickdays work the same as vacation and sometimes there are no days you can take for weeks in advance. You must have your home life be nonexistant or a very strong net to catch your responsibilities as 1 sick day can get you on the first step of discipline"

good,"General office duties. Worked in a busy Call Center. I supported sales reps and Management daily. They sold advertising for The Real Yellow pages. My job was to make sure they had information (dates for deadlines to print, rates for ads for each directory, order supplies, pull reports several times daily for Management to track results, etc..) No 2 days were alike. We were forever getting training on new proceedures to relay to the sales rep."
good,"I learned a lot from this company especially how to talk to customers the right way on the phone, and help them with their needs in a professional manner. You are allowed time for breaks and lunch. It is an in-bound call phone center so you are never just sitting there doing nothing, you are always on the go. the hardest thing about this job was only having one day off during the week."
good,"I enjoyed my position with AT&T Wireless. They are very committed to their customers. They strive to always give the best customer service possible and they are always providing on going training in system upgrades, customer concerns and their feedback. Everyone employed with AT&T can come away with the knowledge that they have learned exceptional customer service skills that are put to the test everyday with customer interactions."

good,Very enjoyable group to work with. We all worked remotely across the country & meshed very well.
good,"National Electronics Warranty is a national company, but the location I worked at only serviced the one client, Directv. There were about 700 people there, divided into teams of about 20 persons per team. It's a call center, so the work consists of answering phone calls and assisting customers. Probably take about 50-80 calls per day. Overtime is often requested, almost required. It's not unusual to have 60 hour work weeks. It's stressful, but most of the stress comes from management. Management has the philosophy that it is more important to be enthusiastic than experienced. It is rare for someone to last more than a couple years. I was there for five years and went through many team changes."
good,"Good company, but allot of travel, great benifits, overtime"
good,Great job for people that like to work by themselves. Great work out everyday.

good,"Southwestern Bell provided excellent pay, benefits, and training."
good,Awesome company with good management. Compensation and versatility at job was great. Tried promoting and it was rather difficult. Customer service and interacting with vastly indifferent people constantly was ok. Was manager on duty a lot when management was not present. Grew quickly because I learned fast and picked up on talking to people and helping them fit there needs.
good,I assisted customers with their bills and also upsaled items for there account. Learned to develop patience for customers who were irrate. Co-workers were always helpful and management was great. I loved the full service cafeteria te company had.
good,Telecom
good,Every place has their own issues. Pay n bonus were great they take care of there employees. The team leaders is their issue poor manager skills.
good,"I would have to say that AT&T teaches you about time management, how important customers are whether they are right or wrong, the hardest part of the job in the beginning were apologizing for something I didn't do but later down the line I realized the purpose of it."
good,"I sold AT&T cell,cable, and accessories to existing and new customers. I lead the company is sales. I had a good manger and he taught me a lot. I liked the environment I worked in. My co workers were great and funny. The hardest part was trying to out do my previous goals. The most enjoyable part was reaching and acheiving my goals"
good,"Everything was going great until they decided to sell the store to a dealer and then they wanted the reps to drive a 2 hour drive to go to work everyday by transferring to another store. I would do the morning paperwork, deposits, inventory and sold cell phones along with up selling products. The best part was being able to work with the customers."
good,I enjoyed working with customers and really liked looking for new ways to solve problems each day. The benefits are excellent and make tenure at the company worth the time because each year you get more vacation time. One thing that I would suggest to AT&T is that they focus more on ensuring the complete happiness and overall willingness to improve among their employees.
good,N/A. One of the better places to work in the telecommunications field
good,Really enjoyed working with DIRECTV. Well organized and good staff.
good,was very interesting place to learn the basic and advanced customer service satisfaction. interesting environment and great diversity of people.
good,AT&T was a great place to work.
good,Good job. The company has a tendency to move your work area with good notice. Cause transportation issues and no other options. Had to resign because I couldn't be transferred
good,"good company to work for but the fear of being laid off is getting worse. The pay is good, and the benefits are really great. I would recommend this company."
good,"The hours sometimes sucked but overall I loved it! Keep to yourself and do your job! "
good,Management back when I worked there was not professional. Retaliated against employees still do and there is no help when needing to do a hardship transfer.
good,The environment at AT&T was exhilarating! The work there was enjoyable and it was always room for advancement. The diversity of the cultures was great and it was one of the best places I ever worked in the lifetime of my career.
good,I’ve been employed with AT&T for 20 years and it’s been a rewarding experience.  AT&T offers amazing opportunities to advance as well as tuition reimbursement .

good,it's a great company. Id still be there if i didnt have to move back to tennessee. supervisors were experienced and knew what they were doing. The game room was nice also!
good,My time at AT&T was fantastic. I enjoyed the type of work I did and the people I worked with. It seems to be very difficult to advance because most openings have their desired employees in mind prior to posting.
good,"Overall, AT&T is an excellent company to work for. I was disappointed, however, in the lack of on-the-job support I received for my career change and the lack of opportunities available for transitions to a new job function."
good,"I learned the majority of my skill set at at&t and I am thankful for the training, it is my opinion that it is the most detail oriented training with pass fail exams along the way.  Be prepared however as a work life balance is difficult if you have a family on the technician side.  As a non management employee you will have the option to join the Union, that being said will either be CWA or IBEW depending on the region where you are located.  The compensation is governed by the union contract so you always know how much you will be paid depending on where you land on the experience progression scale.  Overall as a company, at&t is a great company to work for and learn skills that will catapult you to the front of any line.  This review is solely for technicians."
good,Great job. I have a great experience so far in this job. The management is great and they make the work environment pleasant. Salary and Benefits are good as well.
good,"Metrics and measurements for ""efficiency"" often leave workers with no choice but to forget about customer service. Taking care of the customer usually takes more time"
good,"Great company, good benefits and pay . Siri life balance can sometimes be changeling however it’s worth it . All jobs have pros and cons. At&t has been my favorite job thus far."
good,Good benefits.  Opportunity for advancement.  Sales is a very stressful environment and constantly changing goals. Management moves around a lot. Not a lot of consistency.
good,"i loved the job and what i did. The difficulty of it was every home was different, no job was the same as the last. Physical whether it be maneuvering ladder to get to telephone line, climbing to get up the pole, or being in the customers attic. Have to work under extreme work conditions, heat, cold, rain."
good,It is a really great place to work if you are actively serving in the National Guard or the Reserves. They have an amazing military compensation package that allows you to conduct the mission and still feel important to AT&T.
good,I have been an employee with att for over 9 years and it is always exciting but there needs to be better leadership in place for employees to feel valued and to grow the brand
good,It was a fun experience and taught me a lot about customer service and how to treat a customer. I learned how to install things in peoples homes so yeah it was a great experience.
good,I help a lot of people with things they didnt know about there phones ect. It was really good energy everyday no one slacked on work always on time and maneger was always available
good,"I loved working for AT&T over the near-decade I worked there. I made many friends and acquaintances along the way that I am forever grateful for. The training with AT&T is phenomenal as is the benefits. In the right environment, I would recommend anyone to work there, especially at the retail sales consultant role - lots of money can be made!"
good,AT&T was an awesome place to work. I loved it. Met great people had great friends. And the sky was the limit as far as pay. You get what you put into the program. Like all things in life. They gave you all the tools that you needed to succeed. It was just up to you to use them.
good,It's a great place to work for or a great company to work for the people make the company what it is it is a very stressful job you need to be there in order to go ahead and work there there is no I am late I am this you need to be at work with AT&T
good,Great Company to work for! Affordable benefits. Great management. Work/life balance. Great incentives. Management understood life’s emergencies.I really enjoyed being a part of the company.
good,"You must be on time, no excuses.  I learned the office manager should never been allowed to work there and that is being nice.  Management just does what office manager says to do.  Having people listen to you and then critiques you.  The people and customer were fabulous!  Our Union was very strong which helps.  I unfortunately had a long commute.  I have everlasting friendships from there."
good,"Work days were full of excitement with a great team and mentors around it didn’t even feel like a work day, you will be challenged but you will have help and it will be a great experience moving forward for you"
good,A lot of training and responsibility but fun place to work if you enjoy the outdoors.  You work alone most of the time and can get a lot of overtime if that is desired.
good,Working at AT&T has brought a lot of  opportunities to my life. I have learned a lot from the company on how to have a work life balance. The management and AT&T is very down to earth which is something I never saw at any other job I had.
good,Very good company. I was laid off twice without any notice as a contractor due to budget.  Would love to go back but they seem to be notorious for laying off.
good,"This is a well know in the RF engineering community that AT&T is fair paying contracting  services, some Markets better manager than other but overall great place to work."
good,AT&T i found was committed to get the technology right rather than push things to producction and then depend on support group to fix issues as they arise.
good,"A great opportunity to expand my skill set and grow in a competitive environment. Grateful for everything I learned, I became very resourceful to my colleagues and customers."
good,"This job will go down as my favorite and I've had many. I worked there for 5 years.I moved up the ladder very easily. When I wanted to transfer to another state, it was done seamlessly. I had some great managers and one asst manager that was a pain,  but other than that it was a great experience. I learned alot about technology. The pay was good, but the hours sucked. Senior reps definitely get better hours. I honestly regret leaving but I had personal issues that I had to tend to and after being away for a while I just didn't have a desire to go back into retail."
good,"Era un ambiente laboral amable con tus compañeros, pero las llamadas eran muy estresantes, incluso me tocó ver 2 personas pre-infartadas por el estrés."
good,"You can make a good living as a sales representative, but you will work brutal hours until you gain seniority and that takes a long time because people never leave due to the pay."
good,"After you leave the garage you are your own boss."
good,"Pros: Very good company to work for. Good benefits and union. "
good,"Great place to work . Diverse environment, great compensation and benefits, great place for young enthusiastic people who are looking to be challenged you won’t be disappointed."
good,"I worked with a team that felt more like a family at my store, and the locals and regulars were usually fairly easy and kind to deal with. My manager was always really nice, the job wasn't too stressful seeing as how the team was always happy to help me out if I needed amy assistance (I had barely any experience and required several classes), and vice-versa."
good,"Great company to work for, management can be better at training and hiring from the outside.  lots of layoff at times.  Need better job security for employees"
good,Great...allot of moving around which I liked because it keeps you very busy.  Co workers make you feel like theyve known you forever. I am very pleased to have experienced them.
good,If you like to have a place where they sky is the limit working for AT&T gives you that ability with there no glass ceiling work environment. They also take time to get to know you ad figure out where you want to be and actively help you get there.
good,"AT&T is an awesome place to work. As most high paying positions the balance of work life to family life needed to be Moore balanced. Excellent salary compensation as well as benefits.  However, even though there was a wonderful vacation package you were working so hard with multiple deadlines that is was difficult to take those paid vacation days off."
good,Excelente empresa para trabajar y crececimiento laboral
good,I loved working as a tech for at&t. My supervisor at the time gave me the option of be terminated or resign and that is what messed me up in the end i shouldve used the union instead.
good,"Assistant Retail Store Manager "
good,"empresa normal para trabajar, aprendi a valorar el balance de vida"
good,The pay and benefits are great.  There is extensive training to learn about all the systems and products.  There are a lot of goals and quotas too. They monitor you on the phone regular
good,"Great place to work, great work life balance and the people are fun work work with. Great awards programs, trips and commission monies are always good."
good,"Typical day would be dispatching from home, you would go to your first job. A whole lot communication with the customers and management. You have to manage your time a lot as well. The company became union which placed me at the bottom of the seniority list unfortunately that caused me to get laid off due to cutbacks. I wanted to retire at At&t because it was a great company to work for. Other than that, At&t is a great company to work for!"
good,I’m very grateful for the time spent working at AT&T. I’ve had some great coworkers and I’ve learned a lot about dealing with customers and resolving issues that at times seems impossible to resolve. There has been a lot of changes within the company regarding the job I was expected to do.
good,"Uno de los mejores trabajo, en relación a la organización, distribucion de equipos, manejo de la información  y automatizacion de la atención con programas de facturación y asesoria en equipos"
good,"A great company to pursue a career with. Pay is really good and the company has good benefits. As with all retail careers, AT&T has a hard time working with family schedules and requires inconsistent schedules and holidays to be worked."
good,"overall my experience working for AT&T was quite fulfilling.   A typical work day included following up with customers regarding their services.  Answering inbound calls and often making outbound calls to customers to assist with their bill etc...for the most part, management welcomed questions and always assisted with helping to resolve any issues that may arise.   The hardest part of my job was driving nearly an hour and a half in traffic to and from work everyday.  The most enjoyable part was having the opportunity to work with great coworkers and ultimately making life long friendships."
good,"Es una muy buena empresa, pero como todo, el nivel operativo siempre va a trabajar  más con un sueldo más bajo que los demas. Los horarios son muy largos y la paga es muy poca. "
good,"From the coordinators to the Market Director, all of the people on our team were professionals who are easy to work with and able to get the job done."
good,I enjoyed working I thought I wanted to stay home benefits are good.management care about employees clean and friendly environment. The only things are hard is stats
good,I gate things didnt work out between me and at&t... Really was one of companies i've ever worked for. I was a very successful representative in both sales and customer service.
good,"It is a fun workplace, too bad had to move to a different state. Love the discount you are getting from Mobile Plan and Direct TV services. That is all I can say."
good,"Great place to work, great pay and benefits.  Hours can be tough on families.  The company is awesome, has great products and services.  Really diverse workplace."
good,"A typical day as a premise tech would starting the day at 8 by contacting your first customer of the day, loading up on any equipment needed and the leaving to go to your first job by 8:30. "
good,"Capacitación muy bien dada"
good,Working within a matrixed organization stretched across half the country can always be a challenge.  AT&T Broadband did a great job of providing continuous training to managers to help acclimate to that scenario.
good,"Buen desarrollo en los retos a diario, pero el favoritismo con algunas personas afecta el área."
good,A typical work day was never typical. Different location different service requirements meant that this job was definitely not monotonous. Limited supervision meant the company trusted me to get the job done.
good,"Company is quick to hire and quick to fire. Upper management changes there mind every 6 months on nearly every subject. Lower management protects the hourly employees from much of this, but can only do so much."
good,"Enjoyed working with the company, management very strong and clean environment, day to day activities always something new learned. Working conditions were very good, pay was good and the flexibility with shifts was a bonus."
good,With each day posing a different puzzle to solve and obstacle to over come. Challenging your skills and know how this job could show you the same problem in many different ways.
good,"One of the best, most rewarding jobs I've ever had. Customers can be negative in the retention department but when you can genuinely help someone its so rewarding."
good,"It was a good place to work.  The people were friendly, and very helpful to get me settled in when I joined.  I wish the contract hadn't ended when it did."
good,"Worked from home on most days, loved this job, great boss and co-workers, circuit provisioning, worked with techs in the field and project managers, one of the best jobs I have ever had"
good,"Not too bad but not the best job, you can make good money working long hours, but will miss family time, most managers are very bossy and arrogant, some of them even lack the skill of management and I don't know why AT&T is keeping them. Also the job is seniority based which is absolutely not fair versus skills."
good,I love working there because of customer service wise it has definitely been a great experience for me. I think the best part is it is face to face interaction.
good,excelente empresa en cuestion laboral y de crecimiento
good,The great part about working for AT&T was the diversity and consistent engagement with customers. It was never a dull day. I had the opportunity to help so many people.
good,"Great company overall to work for but the only thing is that they do not hire permanent linemen anymore. "
good,I’ve been employed with the company for many years. I find that over time I have come to appreciate the impact AT&T has in our new global economy. I love being apart of the next big thing!
good,"AT&T is a great brand and company to work for. Benefits and healthcare were a big plus. I worked retail, the hours and working holidays were difficult at time, however, morning or evening shifts provided flexibility. The sales quotas were typically fair. The training availability were always great."
good,"Great benefits, great pay. Horrible management and horrible scheduling issues. It's pretty tough dealing with people. But it's very easy to hit your monthly sales goals if you are able to stay motivated or if you have a good management team. At&t is a unionized with force, and our local union works very diligently to make sure all employees are being treating fair."
good,"good place to work, managers and upper level does not care about you you are there to work and work only they do not care about their employees they are for self only"
good,I enjoyed working for them because it was a challenge. Everyday I would encounter something new that I would have to overcome. This experienced helped me grow as an individual.
good,Enjoyed the time. Continued learning. Positive work culture. Difficult to make the monthly goal when vacation is taken. Open culture to reach out to management for assistance.
good,AT&T really does a great job investing in its employees.  Many training courses are available to enhance your skill set and tuition reimbursement is available to further your education.
good,i enjoyed the customers and speaking with them but meeting the sales was hard especially when some numbers were un realistic and the management at the time was unethical
good,Great job great people good paced loved every moment. I feel att was the place to be it showed me a great putlook on customer service called the white glove service
good,"AT&T has been a very good place to work for a long time.  I have worked in several different departments over 20 years.  Great pay, great benefits, a lot of opportunities to improve your competencies and learn new skills."
good,i work for AT&T over 17 years. The company changes happen quite often. If you are a hard worker you will have no problem meeting the expectations. I believe front line workers should be paid what they are worth.
good,"Sales job. Upbeat atmosphere, great co-workers. Fun enviorment. Great benefits and perks. Mostly consist of customer service and sales. Providing service to meet consumer needs."
good,Upward mobile goal oriented customer service levels are very high and are very achievable with coaching and specified training. Once your objective is set you strive to meet your goals everyday and are given freedom to grow.
good,"Lots of fun as an intern, and really great management in my department. The projects you get as an intern depend on your boss and department, and luckily mine were both awesome, and gave me a lot of learning opportunities."
good,You will gain a lot of knowledge in telecommunications. You will learn how to crawl in crawl spaces. You will learn that road cones create force fields around your van.
good,"ATT is a great company, they pay well,  and give you great benefits. This job does require dedication, and it does not allow for much work/life balance. It is a salary job, and does most often require you to work open to close, and long hours. If you want to promote, you have to be willing to relocate if given the opportunity."
good,This opportunity is a great fresh out of college job. The people I work with are great and there is lots of opportunity for advancement once the program is over.
good,Can make good money but be prepared to get off late. You are union so you have union dues. You get company owed vehicle with gas card. You work alone for the most part but meet lots of people
good,"i enjoyed every thing that the career had , given a seciond opportunity i woukd move in uit quikly. lots of money tio be made there. and advavnement is hard"
good,"Very employee friendly with awesome pay and perks. I didn't enjoy having to follow the ""script"" for each call without being able to properly help the customers."
good,"My resources for this job were outstanding. I was able to find what I needed and the support for my job even though I was working from home. The hardest part was all the information to continuously keep up with, it was sometimes a lot of reading but always very informative."
good,"AT&T has a great muti year working tradition and has modernized its way to be a leading place to work. Also, at an executive level, AT&T offers a great motivational and leadership training."
good,Been working here for 3 years customer service is the main thing going with at&t. Never had any trouble with the calls or people that work in my postion
good,"No hay crecimiento laboral o es tardado ,piden muchas ventas"
good,"Large company with endless training opportunities"
good,It was a great entry level opportunity to get in to business to business sales.  I think knowing advertising is a good skill to carry with you in any industry that you go into.
good,"All the people are very nice and lots of opportunity to learn different technologies.  With the site being so big, almost everyone will get a office. It is not easy getting hire, but once you are in AT&T there are lots of opportunity."
good,I enjoyed my time with AT&T and would like to go back once I am able to. AT&T is a great place to work. It is a fast friendly and fun place to be. If hired there you will had a great experience of your life.
good,Mostly assist customer with their billing and made sure they were getting all discounts deserve as well as making sure they had the correct package for home and life style.
good,"A typical day at AT&T is pretty routine."
good,"	Ensure all necessary documentation and financial requirements are completed in order to close out construction projects, tracking of projects. "
good,My typical day always started with getting the team on the same page and making sure they knew all the promotions and that i was not far if they needed any help Closing any part of the sale. As well to remind them that we are here to Have fun while being the best .
good,This company really takes care of their employees financially.  A lot of company perks.  If you meet your goals and sell like a rock star you're good. As long as you meet those goals consistently you're off the radar.  If not you will be coached out.
good,It’s a great career position and I love the company. The management is hard on you but it’s only because they want you to succeed. They provide you with lessons you can take with you for the rest of your life. The only reason I’m leaving is because he rotating schedule and long hours with me now being a single parent. Other than that I would definitely stay.
good,"What made me like this job more was my store manager. He was very friendly and love to have a good fun environment to work at and was always there if"
good,My role in my department was fun filled and exciting but challenging each day would bring new opportunities.  You would  have an opportunity to work on elite and VIP projects that would introduce you to celebrities.  Confidentiality was key.   This was a laid back work environment that allowed you to do what you do to make things happen.
good,Company focused on the future. AT&T invests a considerable amount of time and energy in growing their employees and investing in their communities. Overall great company to be a part of.
good,this was the best job I had until they closed the office this job worked hard with there employees lots of training. they appreciated the hard work we did there and the company gave back to there employees
good,Great job to grow knowledge and build life long work experience dealing with telecommunications. You are able to learn new and interesting traits on a daily basis.
good,I loved working for AT&T made a lot of new friends was recognized as a top producer among my peers. Lots of perks and discounts for working with the company.
good,Productive workplace with a chance of learning more skills. Good management. Good communication with all the team members and management. Easy going policy on work timings as long as required work hours are logged.
good,"The company has drastically changed from my beginnings, Bellsouth was much better to work for, it had a family feel now it's no smiles of the people except those at the top, it's still a good company to work for but you definitely have to watch out for yourself 100%."
good,"Working as a Services Technician was a great job , Great place to work and the people were great including management. Pay was good , enough to live comfortable. To bad they don't need me anymore, I really love that job."
good,"I enjoyed working for at&t, however, some unavoidable drama within the branches made working for the company unnecessarily stressful. Would happily work for at&t again, but I would prefer a corporate or call center setting in future."
good,"Facing challenges at a big company like At&t , helps you progress in your career faster ."
good,"Facilitated and up-trained new hire employees and current employees on new products, service, promotions, company history, etc. within the Directv and AT&T framework."
good,I had an amazing experience here.  I am only looking elsewhere due to a relocation and I need to move sooner than what AT&T will allocate.  I highly recommend this place to others.
good,Great benefits. Positive environment. Would like more opportunities for advancement. Management is fair. Zero tolerance for attendance issues. Would like more one on ones with management.
good,"AT&T can be a great place to work and has great pay and benefits. Leadership is a little old school in my opinion with some of the policies and procedures that are in place  The only downside is that there aren't very many opportunities for advancement unless you are willing to move, even then, if you don't know the right person, then you won't be advanced."
good,"Great company, needs better management. Salary and benefits needs to be better. Great  training and experience. My skill set came in handy being that I never received training."
good,Reforcé mi experiencia en servicio a cliente y conocer acerca de la telefonia mas a fondo.
good,A typical work day is not 8-5.  You work until the load is clear.  I've gained much knowledge in the area of telecommunications.  Management at the first level is very involved and personal but doesn't have much authority.  The hardest part of this job is the hours.  We are not Monday through Friday.  I enjoyed working alone but it feels like a team environment with our team communications.
good,"Corporate work is in and of itself a very regimented disciplined arena.  Daily work as a project manager is to associate oneself with many team members based across a varied global landscape.  A project manager not only keeps the lid on many firefights but knows how to finance/budget, position team members and coordinate revision based upon daily outcome of team meetings."
good,"Typical day starts w/techs dispatching on a job at 8am. If your jobs are bulked, you have a general idea of the area you will be working in for the day. Bulked jobs allow you to strategically plan your day for success. AT&T taught me time management skills,how to work under stressful situations and made me an innovative person. The workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job was dealing with our tech of support. There was a language barrier and most of the support staff did not know their job. The most important part of the job was meeting new people and not having to stay in the same location all day."
good,Working for AT&T is great however if you can handle fast pace or for field Technician being outside it’s not for you. AT&T’s promotion within can be stall at times
good,"No Job security, does not matter what you know, matters who you know to keep your job and transfers. Wish instead of laying committed honest talented employees working for 5 to 25 years could have been utilized in other projects."
good,Had a relaxation room and game rooms. The trainers were awesome. Training made it possible for me to understand what was needed from me. Once I was on the phone I feel like I knew what I was doing because the trainers helped so much. Having the CWA was also a relaxing thing as well.
good,"i enjoyed working for at&t. i enjoyed working for the people. i loved how i was able to excite customers by encouraging them to sign up for Directv. "
good,"AT&T continues to offshore and outsource their jobs.  this creates a negative work environment as employees never know when their jobs might be offshored or outsourced.  AT&T typically outsources jobs, requiring the vendor to take 30% of the employees and putting the others on a surplus list.  I went through this process many times before finally being outsourced."
good,We started every day learning about new products and services. I learned so much there. My manager was extremely motivating. Hardest part of the job so keeping up with sales goals.
good,-- Flexible hours
good,"The company has great benefits. It was a fast paced environment but, the compensation was wonderful.  I would recommend the company to friends and family."
good,"I have not worked here in over 5 years, so I am not sure what the company culture is currently like.  My coworkers were great to work for. My job was not rewarding or challenging enough to keep me there."
good,I really enjoyed work with AT&T. It was stressful at times with the demands company changes and work environment.  I would still be there had my short term disability been approved. Once denied it pointed me out.
good,It is a stressful job but you do get paid well. About 21 days paid time off.  Insurance as well as benefits are a plus. Plenty of chances for advancement.
good,I began working at AT&T immediately after high school and learned alot while working there providing me the opportunity to advance from a clerical position into a management position.
good,AT&T is a good place to work. There is enough learning opportunities. Rewards and recognition are not always great but compensation and benefit wise it is a good place to work
good,"Great customers, supporting cast and company. You build up your knowledge on products pretty quickly and weekly if not daily updates on new products, pricing or company changes."
good,Great place to work when you can get into a department with good job security. To many surplus it was a much better company when it was bellsouth. There wasnt a hard part of the job
good,Managers can be a pain when using their authority some managers overstep their power just wish the culture can change back to when I first started out there
good,"es una empresa en la cual aprendi muchas cosas y me dieron la opurtunidad de crecer mucho laboralmente , tienen una gran cultura laboral"
good,"Managment at the time (2009-2011) did not do a good job of leading the team in a constructive and beneficial way. Overall the pay was beyond acceptable with commissions and the job was easy to perform. The only reason I left was the management at that time, I would consider going back there since they have all changed over the years."
good,If you can sell the product you will advance . Huge focus on direct Tv . You will make money if you sell product it’s that simple. It’s a unionized company pro and cons to that
good,"My review is not the best to be in consideration, at the time At&t was merging with directv they had just bought the company, Within that time they had eliminated all part timers and would not allow any flexibility, they change the shift operations completely going from 6-12 months schedules on teams to having to big for your schedule every week for what shifts and hours your working. Overall since than the company has become unionized and a imaging a lot more has been sorted out, overall i would recommend to anyone in need of a job to apply there. "
good,Depending the location can be some times slow traffic of customer. You learn something new every day. Management at least on my actual location are great. The hardest part of the job is when you already gave all the options to a customer and still want to do/get something is impossible. Most enjoyable part is when the customer is satisfied with your service and products.
good,"Fast paced, challenging working environment. Friendly, team work oriented front line work group. Immediate management team very knowledgeable and dedicated. Some upper management decisions questionable."
good,"Area Managers are the first formal level of supervisors at AT&T. During my 7+ years with them, the majority of my Area Managers were very good. I won't lie, I did have a few that were less than helpful in giving direction, delegating work, motivating employees. But overall, they were some of the best supervisors I have had in my 35+ years of employment. AT&T does an excellent job of training their supervisors."
good,"Typical day You have to be ready for techs prior to them starting - time approvals, previous days results, planning and coaching through out the day on crews ranging from 14 to I have had as many as 26.  Will handle customer complaints.  Will be in the field coaching and performing safety observations and quality observations throughout the month. Must be able to multitask."
good,I worked for AT&T Call Center for 13 years.  It was a fast pace competitive place to work which I enjoyed.  Call Center work is not for everyone but can be very rewarding.
good,A typical day consist of coming to work & getting logged in as soon as your shift gets started. You begin taking calls immediately & might have to go in for a company meeting. These meetings are only to update you on the company's new policy & to keep us informed about what's going on. They have a diversity of different people capable of speaking all sorts of languages.
good,very fun p;lace to work very good compensation you will have a very long work week sometimes you are over worked but they do offer the proper compensation
good,"Great learning experience in working with telephony, internet, video pole climbing, ladder, defensive driving, cpr, fiber. You pretty much kept to yourself with seldom visits from supervisor to check your work. Well stoked vans for all jobs, the clearing of wire taps sucked. Assistance among technicians was always welcome, whether you low on equipment, new to the job, or need assistance in a difficult job. Vans were kept in office you would drive to them from home to be for daily 8am meetings before dispatching. At times you would work over time due to long days or difficult jobs, but the job itself was enjoyable in doing (running lines coax/ cat5, boring holes, attic accessing, customer education, equipment configuration)"
good,"This position is very demanding, the work is very fast pace if you want to complete you jobs for the day. You must be a self motivator! Be prepared for all conditions and be safe."
good,"There were things I was unhappy with, but in general AT&T is a great place to work.  Great benefits, but limited opportunity for growth, more project managers than team members doing the work"
good,"Worked at my pleasure, since I am an illustrator. Free coffee. Lunch breaks at the Rockefeller Plaza. Managers very nice, even to freelancers. What else is there?"
good,"No job security, great pay, love my job. Never know what task you may challenge each day. I am being surplused along many others in the state of Mississippi."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, trabajo en equipo y bajo presión porque hay una alta exigencia en las metas; Se adquiere experiencia importante en la comunicación con clientes, manejo de objeciones, analisis de información y de acuerdo a esto habilidad en el momento de tomar decisiones.  Adicional el trabajo brinda la posibilidad de adquirir una experiencia importante en el liderazgo.  Es una compañia que se preocupa bastante por brindar un excelente servicio al cliente con respuestas oportunas y solucion a los problemas que se puedan presentar. "
good,Es una buena empresa pero ahora no cubren mis necesidades x ello busco otro trabajo
good,AT&T is a global corporation with many titles and opportunities. Each department is structured differently based upon experience and education but all are compensated well with a great benefit package.
good,"Very busy filling customer orders for telephones.  Extremely busy, but I loved the people and the customers.  I learned so very much in Customer Serv."
good,"Upsetting after so many years taking Pride working at the company, coworkers and for my customer. Only to find out that they don't Walk the Talk! The employees take Ethics and confidentiality courses  but  they don't follow them. Ethics and confidentiality is very important to me and it's my business, not the water cooler! Employees should be held accountable! even when reported nothing was done."
good,"As a manager at AT&T, the typical work day was 10-12hrs, however, a lot of this time was dedicated to paperwork, reviews of employees, etc. There was a great sense of satisfaction in seeing employees learn and understand safety procedures, as well as them learning about how to better interact with customers. The highlight of the job was seeing the end product of sometimes days worth of work, and the highly improved quality of service in an area."
good,"Project Management, Collaborative, new technology"
good,"Was with the company for 10 years, looked forward to work daily with the energetic, and fun workplace. The skills that I picked up while with the company being apart the a team on the cutting edge apps and technology. The management team was great due to the team was made up of all mangers. The hardest part of the job for me was the last day I was there due to the department closed down/laid-off. I would describe the most enjoyable part of the job would be the next project/product that was going to be introduced to  the industry and the customer from apps to devices."
good,"Aprendi muchas cosas importamtes como la cultura de la organizacion, hacer negocios y mucho mas. Los dias tipicos es que a pesar de tener demasiado trabajo habia un espacio de brake para reponer las fuerzas, tomar cafe, reir un rato y continuar, hablar con el equipo de trabajo y seguir luchando para finiquitar el trabajo."
good,"load vehicle, dispatch job, drive to customer premise. install or repair internet, phone, or video customer provided equipment. wiring and fiber optics to premise."
good,Cingular was a new company to be involved in and truly was on the cutting edge at the start. The development of the culture along with involvement with NASCAR and many charities really set the pace for success.
good,"AT&T is a great place to work.  It has downsized alot because of home phones being virtually obsolete.  Many of the the construction and engineering positions have faded away, and Internet, cell phones and cable tv are their main sources of income."
good,"work work work mandatory when I started in 1977 as i was leaving ATT was changing and demand for overtime was not there"
good,This is actually my first call center experience and I can say it was a roller coaster ride because in this company is where I got a lot of mistakes since I was new to this industry but was able to cope up with the culture and enjoyed working.
good,"Generalmente Bien, no habia mucha presion, los compañeros era geniales"
good,I go to customers homes and install a satellite and other things for them to watch cable Tv. I typically drive to the customer home to see if they can get Directv or they may be having trouble with their system so I roll out to fix the issues at hand. Hardest part part of the job is when it is raining trying to fix directv or install it. Sometimes giving the customer the news that they can not get directv is hard because they become upset. I enjoy it when I can put in Directv when it looks like it can't go in or fix a customers issue and just to see them happy and excited.
good,Keep yourself out of trouble and develop a good and honest work ethic and you will be happy but keep in mind AT&T will let you go no matter how hard you work if the needs of the business require a reduction in workforce.
good,This was a great company to work for but there is ALOT of stress that comes with the job. When I started many years ago it was just customer service. Now it is all about SALES.
good,Nice employee and management. Just not located close enough for where i live. I would be looking for job outside state. Minneapolis area precisely. Would be a Data Analyst
good,This company is a great place to work. I left to pursue my bachelors degree and would be happy to come back and work for them if there is an opportunity.
good,I would work here again. I got a lot of great experience and  enjoyed it overall. I met some interesting people and learned a lot. It can be stressful but you have to be focused.
good,"very competitive, fast paced environment. very good benefits, health, vision and dental. 401K and employee assistance. very good discount on our products"
good,"This is a great place to work and learn , you could move up and advance to higher areas of company as long as you follow their rules and regulations. loved working for them and wish I could go back to work for them but my artificial knee keeps me from working for them"
good,"Just sitting around and having training once in a while."
good,"A typical day consists of logging into the phone at your desk, at which point every keystroke and second of your day is logged. This was not an issue as I did my job, used the facilities and treated customers well. All calls were recorded and monthly we would listen to these calls and confirm that we have met all criteria."
good,I spoke with customers assisting them with account questions and or details. I explained the bill if they were having a difficult time understanding the bill. I added and removed services per the customers request. I assisted irate customers; handling their issues generating repeat business. Customer retention. I learned how to deal with various customer personalities. I enjoyed my coworkers. We became one big family. The hardest part did not come with having the job it came with being laid off. It was difficult to no longer have my AT&T family to work with and see at work.
good,This is a very challenging company constantly changing.  It can be an exciting and fast moving experience.  It is also a very competitive work environment.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the people, I found the environment to be welcoming, and helpful. The employees seem to work together as well as the groups also."
good,Management is great.  Really good benefits. very fast Paced environment. constant change. wish manager were all on the same page with procedures. .......
good,"Everyone was friendly and helping each other. "
good,"loved the company and the work - teams are well organized for the most part and the Agile environment keeps projects running smoothly.  the only caveat is being a contractor, you're the first to get let go when projects are defunded"
good,This is a company that can help you to get on your feet if you are not finding the jobs that can keep you afloat. if you are good at talking to people and finding ways to save them money you definitely can make some good money with at&t. As long as you are productive you really can run your own show. The only thing bad about it is that it can get repetitive and often people lose sight on climbing up because of the constant grind
good,AT&T was a great company to work for with room for advancement and fair pay.  The benefits at AT&T were awesome. The sales reps had company paid cell phones as well as company paid uniforms.
good,"At&t provided me with knowledge in customer service, leadership, & other skills that I will continue to carry with me throughout my life.  The people I worked with  in new orleans & kc,mo were great"
good,"Share the knowledge to complete successful projects with team."
good,AT&T was one of the best company for advancement that I have worked for. There are plenty of opportunities to advance and move up within the company. A great place to work.
good,Ive been working at AT&T for three years. The moral has changed since my first year. The company does its best to get rid of the bad managment. My biggest complaint is not knowing what time we get off for the day. One day 8 hrs the next 12 hrs. No real home life. Good 401k plan and good match.
good,"Great work place, good leadership, fair wages, safe environment, stressful workloads, very competitive, structured environment, changing focus, good training programs."
good,In the collection department I learned quickly the importance of good customer service. In a typical day you could speak to over a couple hundred individuals. Fast paced and self control was the key to this position.
good,It's a great company to work for. There could be better programs  for promoting  regular employees. the discounts are great. over the culture is good but it/s what you make it.
good,"Maintains customer confidence by keeping service information confidential."
good,"good learning, people friendly, work life balance and fair pay. I would highly recommand this as a work place. I was hired their via TechM so ATT HR/Management was not directly involved."
good,"It's a fun and very delightful place to go to every day.My co-workers makes it's fun and worth going to everyday, the management staff makes it an environment like a family. I enjoy working we have at least two lounges on each floor with television, ice machine,  microwave and pool table.We have a lot of update and learning on a weekly, they make the objective very high unreachable.. The part I love is coming  in taking the calls and being able to assist my customer with whatever they're calling for. I can help them and love that part and giving the best customer service, I know people just don't get that any more. I love doing the things that makes a difference."
good,"Overall, this was a great company to work for. They took care of their employees with great pay and benefits. Management was okay. Excellent work culture- great people!"
good,Worked at a Corporate location. It was totally a great place to work. Lots of work to do but they treat you pretty well. Long as you get the work done you you will be fine.
good,The day was never typical changed daily. The culture was more like family than like work at times. Hardest part was some customers that were disgruntled. The best part was the family atmosphere and the friendships that were made.
good,"El trabajo era muy sencillo, apoyo por parte de supervisores."
good,"They expect you to dedicate yourself to the work, and provide a return on investment. They compensate you accordingly. If you have the time, its an amazing place to start a career. If you decide to make the leap, plan to stay for awhile. If you have other responsibilities that will interfere with your dedication levels, wait patiently for a better time. Good luck."
good,"Pay and benefits were top notch."
good,"long hours ,working with all types of people all career field how to do complete installed buy certified direct tv code. their was never hard part to the job. meet and talkin to all new or previously different type of people selling direct tv & at&t products"
good,Great company that supports training for the future. They also have tuition reimbursement along with certification training opportunities. You must be able to manage several task and projects without missing a beat.
good,Telephone companies in the  past were extremely different in more ways than one. They provided much needed jobs to families with children with ample pay to give them opportunities that could not be possible with other jobs. However the unions were not proficient enough to secure the jobs of their members when they needed them. I lost my job because I had to have 2 surgeries in 1 year.
good,I worked there over ten years ago when it was Cingular. It was my first call center job pretty good benefits were great and pay was good. But I did not like outbound calling
good,This career has been very pleasing in most aspects.  The one that is the most difficult is to advance you must relocate.  AT&T has some of the best benefits in all of the workforce.  I appreciate the time I have had with the company.
good,"great company overall good benefits. Great job if your looking to save money, and learn new hands on skills. your pretty much your own boss on our jobs, and meeting new people everyday, some good or bad.."
good,"Good place to work. I hade several positions over my 17 years there and I enjoyed every one of them. "
good,All around a good position/job. Just be aware that you are to train on your own with unorganized training material. If you already have the experience/background it should be fine.
good,BellSouth was awesome to work for - however when bought out by AT&T - it was obvious that we were given our replacements to train - i.e. ex BellSouth Employees verses AT&T employees on coming.
good,"A typical day at work was busy from the time I step into the office.  Customer calls, employees, request, assistant Program Manger, Assembler and Technicians.  Management there was up and down, it depended on their focus.  I learned many aspects of the job functions independently, lack of procedures.  I don't remember any hard parts of the job, because I like challenges.  I love working with others and solving problems."
good,"Complex work environment dealing with various customers in their homes to install satellite/uverse tv, internet, phone service, and to perform repairs and routine maintenance on every system."
good,The culture at AT&T is continuously growing to be so diverse.  The benefits are phenomenal. The pay is very competitive in comparison to other media companies.
good,"All management thought about was numbers, which made good people become animals and lie to customers and add service and products on customers bill without explaining.  Makes the mass majority become UNETHICAL human beings. But you cant blame them when your lively hood depend on it."
good,This was a great job that I love to do the people are great and the management knows how to treat thier staff. I love selling a product that can sell because it is a quality product.
good,AT&T really seems like an excellent place to work. Great pay and awesome benefits. Awarded the oppotunity to work from home which provided the perfect work life balance while employed.
good,It is a fast paced work environment especially during inclement weather. The customers tend to be a little irate due to the nature of the incoming calls.
good,"I am team lead, I supervise over the biggest team in the call center, in Rome, GA. I handle escalations for irate customers and handle all of the coaches needs for the team. I handle side by sides with reps to make packages and contracts for each business customer."
good,This was a very demanding and rewarding job .  While interacting with customers and resolving their issues and concerns we had the opportunity to improve our customer service and organizational  skills.  Loved the teamwork environment. Unfortunate they closed our call center and jobs were lost.
good,"The work place was fun but also challenging and I met a lot of people while working there, I enjoyed interacting with the customers and working with my peers"
good,"AT&T fit me as a company very well due to my eccentric personality. I learned a lot about the new and latest technology every single day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was able to help people who weren't to experienced with technology, learn. "
good,AT&T is a good start to a career as a wire technician. There is a lot of things that can be learned while working day to day. There is competitive pay and benefits for an entry level field of work. Management isn't too bad if you get lucky to have a good manager. here is a union and for the most part everyone sticks together. Only downside is there isn't much room for growth due to the nature of the business unless Network Manager is where you want to be.
good,Management are not that informed on how job works or how pay works. Very knit picky and pushy on sales to where it effects the experience with the customers.
good,"Great job, great benefits, just no job security. every quater you would be hoping you are not surplused. some of the managers are not great people and work with the people that are supposed to help you, get rid of you.,"
good,At&t is an awesome company overall. I was able to make alot of contacts and build on previous skills as well as acquire new ones. I had a lot of fun working there.
good,I enjoyed every day of work and absolutely loved my job and the customers.  Bad part is being a union based company you always had to watch your back because management was constantly trying write employees up and not focusing on the quality of service provided
good,AT&T invest in the growth of their employees while challenging them to reach their full potential. Excellent benefits and lots of room career progression.
good,"Best job I ever had. I saw a great part of the world traveling to different sites for my job."
good,"Fun, fast paced, technical and repetitive. Sales is a constant hustle, each month the same thing. Hit numbers. Taught a lot of management skills and time management skills."
good,"Very good place to work. Good pay, great benefits, great bonuses, great 401K and great shift. My shift was from 7:30-3:30 and I really enjoyed what I did. I was able to assist many customers, provide assistance to management and work with a great team of employees."
good,Professional fast paced environment. I have learned so much from the incredible individuals in the financial and operational organizations. The workplace culture has been evolving over time due to mergers. The most difficult part of the job has been the balance of work life. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,"DIRECTV was an amazing company to work for, that's why I was there for almost 10 years. I was not able to adapt with the AT&T acquisition and am now looking for a new future."
good,"As an inside sales rep, you teamed up with the AM and you both worked at the number.  You have a chance to make good money.   This was about 5 year ago.  Things might of changed by now."
good,Always a new work place working in customers home. Different situations on wiring homes for the services we provide. Learning trouble shooting on a daily basis.
good,ATT has some of the best benefits you can find on the market.  Department was 24/7 operations so you seldom got calls after leaving the office.  Technology was about 5 years behind market. ATT managers seldom had IT experience and did not like the managers hired outside the organization.
good,I take inbound calls with customer issues. I have to handle their issues then up-sell them on at&t products.Also find new solutions at&t provide to help the customers small business grow.
good,Requires dedication and commitment to increase knowledge and innovate jobs to make great customer experience first time contact is made. Keep customers connected to their world in the most efficient and fastest way possible.
good,"Avaya is a great place to work since it was part of the old Bell system.  Benefits are very good.  "
good,"At&t provides great benefits including great pay for what you do. Hourly plus commission, 401 K matching 6%, United Health care with 500$ deductible, dental, vision. They also love to promote from within."
good,The job was enjoyable and challenging. Employees were great to work with. Pay and benefits were second to none. Their offices were various locations so an employee could move if wanted too.
good,Every day is challenging experience. Being in Operations was fun and challenging. Cutting edge technology at its best. Company gave an opportunity for a young manager to grow.
good,"The days vary depending on the traffic. There are high times of traffic volume and times with none for a good while. The management works to improve your skillset and advance in the company with a driven mindset. I have learned patience, information technology within a telecommunications company, and how to work with different consumers with different backgrounds, needs, & personalities. The hardest part of the job is the varying hours and a non-set schedule. The most enjoyable is the people you meet as far as customers and coworkers and the relationships you develop along the way."
good,This job has a good chance for advancement.  The retail hours do suck though.  Customers are definitely serious about their cell phone service.  Mangement always had my back.
good,"There is always a group huddle at the beginning of the shift. You are provided with help and tools that will ensure a great job to the public. Sometimes I felt a little micro managed, even though my customers were pleased. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a positive effect on the customers and turning situations around."
good,"Un día típico en la empresa: las responsabilidades no faltaban, los contratiempos, y dinámica."
good,I started working their as a intern So it taught me alot about entry level turn key quality building untill you reach pass the traing and then you impute was crafted into the quality of work that you could produce to make the job better /I like to try to forge the tile of the job in to a diffrent animal when I am done.
good,"I enjoyed my position at AT&T, but after years of overseeing contractors; often with limited skill sets, I decided to put my money where my mouth was and prove to myself that I was as capable if not more so than the vendors I managed"
good,on a typical day i would spend roughly 7 hours on the phone answering anything from basic customer service questions to advanced tech support questions. the hardest part of my job was ensuring i made each and every customer as happy as possible i enjoyed helping people and making their lives easier. My coworkers and management were pretty good people as well.
good,I loved this job. Excellent benefits and the people are one of a kind. I would recommend anyone to work at this company. The special offers they give the employees are consider as top notch.
good,Every job that I have worked at I have enjoyed but needed more. I am a hard worker and love to go to work everyday and give it 100%. I enjoyed all my co-workers and managers at all the positions that I have worked at.
good,"good work enviorment if you dont like being in an office all day, for the most part you are on your own, which is nice. the only time work is really tough is when its really hot or really cold"
good,My work hours are 4:30am til 1:00pm. Our entire crew begins work no later 5:00am daily and we work Monday through Friday. We receive full trailers and flatbeds around 3:00am. We scan sort and prepare all items for delivery throughout the State of Indiana.
good,"I worked on the advertising and sales side of AT&T so there was never a dull moment. I worked in various departments, such as, sales, customer service, and marketing. The best part of my experience with AT&T was working in so many departments with so may great people. The hardest part of the job is the instability because the company was being sold but they would never be truthful about what was going on."
good,ambiente bueno de trabajo muy buena atención al empleado. algunos favoritismos con empleados de parte de supervisores de la empresa // se contrata personal para supervisión muy poco capaz.
good,"A great job to grow customer service skills. Had a great time working with other employees, enjoyed consulting and assisting customers."
good,"This is fast paced working environment"
good,"There is a lot of opportunity to grow with this company. Its very hands on and a fast paced environment. Hard work does pay off, easy to grow with this company."
good,start with a smile greet the customer and ph calls all day. that the customer is always right. how to wow the customer on the products. management is not honest...well liked among the co-workers. the job is stressful and sitting for long hrs.. the most enjoyable is making the customer satisfied.
good,"Very High volume inbound call center, assist all customers with there billing concerns, troubleshooting there wireless devices, setup payment arrangements , worked overtime when offered. Made commissions, exceed all required goals. Hardest part of the job was dealing with very irate customers that were upset because of charges on there bill for services that were supposed to be removed and they were  not. This company did not play around with attendance or tardiness - which was nice due to a lot of people would take advantage of the company if this were not in place."
good,Needs more structure but overall a good place to work. Management is the last to know about any new policies to changes to policies.
good,"Typical day at work would be analyzing  your workload, checking your manpower (technicians) and balancing them both to catch the day's load. No day is the same, you are constantly balancing the load, checking for new work dropping in, giving recommendation to the field supervisors about technicians and work. We talk to internal and external customers, handle escalations and have daily conference calls. I have learned, that I am good at what I do and enjoy doing it. As a manager, I work to set good examples and maintain the same management style with each group. I am known as one that handles her business (strive for great results) and is willing to assist anyone. My co-workers are great and we enjoy working with each other. The hardest part of the job is not having all of my technicians trained and they not given the proper equipment they need. The most enjoyable part of the job, is knowing at the end of the day, that I have made my customers happy."
good,"Call center reps have to deal with multiple personalities so don't take it personal, pay and benefits were good, not a lot of understanding when it comes to family they are strictly by the book."
good,Great company that is very innovative. There is different levels of employment. Their career training is great. The benefits are very competitive. I have enjoyed working for them for 15 years.
good,"Great pay,  not very secure. Rollover very high. Have work very hard with zero defects and fastest time possible. That combination can be hard sometimes on technicians. Great pay, vacation, co-workers are awesome. But your walking on egg shells everyday to keep your job."
good,"Typical work, Good to learn, Nice team people, Working environment good, Good management, Enjoyed at the work place, hardest part of the job"
good,Have gained a lot of experience from working with at&t they are a growing company that allows you to increase your knowledge of sales and customer service
good,this is a very great job to have you learn a lot of helpful things to help you succeed in this company the work environment is incredible everyone is always smile full of energy and ready to work
good,AT&T is a good company to  work for.  The only cons are the scheduling and the surplus.  I enjoy working here but I cannot move to the two choices to follow the work.
good,"While I am forever grateful every day for a job at an amazing global company - I was part of an acquisition from DIRECTV to AT&T and the time that has transpired from last April through now has been a tough road."
good,"Trabajar en un distribuidor de AT&T es muy tranquilo pero se hace complicado cuando en el caso del distribuidor que me toco el ambiente con los jefes es tenso, hay mucha rotación de empleados, y tienen demasiada desorganizacion en todos los sentidos, ademas de que trabajar con su sitema es un completo caso, siempre tienen problemas en sistemas, podria decir que esta ha sido la parte complicada de mi trabajo y la parte que mas me gusto es que laboro en un buen horario, hay un ambiente de respeto y me gustan las actividades que hago como el llenado de contratos la captura de datos etc."
good,I was a permanent employee for 12 years then surplus 4 years ago. I was re-hired as a contractual for 3 more years and then my contract ended. However the company continues to downsize the workforce making the permanent employees work in fear of losing their jobs.
good,"Le agradezco a la empresa el conocimiento adquirido en cuanto a técnicas de venta, procesos administrativos, relaciones personales y laborales."
good,"A Retail Sales Rep position at At&t is very challenging but is also very rewarding.  Knowing all products and features is a little overwhelming as a new hire, but through repetition you learn more about all products as well as how to position them to the customer.  It is a sales driven position, so you get out of it what you put into it.  The company gives you the tools to be successful, you just have to use them."
good,Assisted customers with past due accounts secure wireless services.Company is very discriminatory with employees with disabilities
good,"This is a company that is truly about Sales People. Their main concern is all about numbers and as long as you are making good numbers for the company everything will be good for you here."
good,"Excellent training programs before, during and after hired. Development continues through education program that increase your sales and customer service skill set."
good,"Directv typical work day included helping customer with technical issues with their TV service, upgrading the protection plan to cover their devices, adding premium channels to their services and taking payments and ordering new equipment."
good,I spent nearly 20 years with ATT and what I enjoyed the most was all the relationships and friendships I was able to nurture over those years.  No day was ever the same and with each customer issue I felt a sense of accomplishment when I received a very satisfied rating after each call.
good,"Over all my experience at AT&T was enjoyable. They provided good pay, good health benefits, and great retirement benefits."
good,Great company to work for if you are starting out and need to make decent money without a huge resume. Management was great due to the amount of training you receive.
good,"Great location, very nice establishment. A lot of opportunities available. Co workers were awesome and management was open minded and understanding."
good,"I love working for AT&T because of the advancement of technology and the rigorous training and certification offerings."
good,"I learned how to operate and function within a large company and learned to leverage the different entities to be successful.  "
good,"This was a great company to work for. They give you a company car, tools, lots of down time, you also travel a lot. this company can make some changes how they are divers with there prem tech in the Youngstown area."
good,"Aprendizaje diario, con restos que daban satisfacción. Excelente ambiente de trabajo, con mucha oportunidad de crecimiento. Estabilidad personal."
good,AT&T Provides great all around benefits and compensation for the work required. Things constantly change which creates an environment that never gets boring.
good,A typical work day can consist of big jobs installing services for businesses and or homes. My team is very supportive and alwasy ready to assist. We have a great work relationship. At times customers can be a bit inquisitive and demand attention to their needs. The biggest satisfaction is a job well done and seeing a smile  on their face.
good,"Great company, great benefits, training is great as well. Everything needed is supplied and in the position i was in, you are responsible for other tools needed or preferred. As in other jobs, some management wasn't the best, but overall id highly recommend the job and the company. A typical day is an 8 hour shift, climbing poles, going into attics, finding solutions for problems, calling customers, fishing walls, making connections, running wire, and installing devices. My co-workers were great people and very helpful.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with things that were out of your control and counting against your metrics. I learned a lot of valuable skills from the job that can be used in other positions for other companies. Besides having a supervisor, you pretty much were responsible for your own and how your days would turn out which helped me learn to be more disciplined and become my own manager. It also helped me excel as a team leader when needed."
good,It was a good place to work and lots of friendly co workers willing to always lend a helping hand.  I loved to environment and the ability to help others.
good,Awesome company to work for! The pay is great for a person that is eager to sale and loves dealing with the public.  Success will come naturally.
good,There were some who needed to act more of a professional and leave the drama at home. But most operators really appreciated the training and help our group provided.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with this comapny, I cannot say many of my coworkers felt the same though.  Bad morale is dominant in the workplace and many of the workers were not appreciative of the compensation and quality of life they were receiving from AT&T."
good,"Good company to work with.Depending on the location, it varies your paycheck. Hours are really long. Its a good environment."
good,"this company is about the task of making more options self service  to its customers, /sometimes it works for the customer  and other times it doesn't. It does not work when you are an old person who has no knowledge of the  world of technology .  The staff says they can help but help means transfer because there are no numbers internally for the staff to get to the correct depts."
good,AT&T is truly a great place to work. The work environment is very relaxed. With this company you can grow within your department and after  your probationary period can apply else where.
good,AT&T da muchas herramientas para poder lograr las metas que nos proponemos. El trabajo y los beneficios son espectaculares.
good,"-Answer customer and client request or inquiries concerning services, products, equipment, claims and report problem areas"
good,"Clock in at 8, continue to dispatch on jobs till the work load is cleared. Trouble shoot network issues and do full instalations.My position as a tech makes me the face of AT&T. "
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, respeto, puntualidad "
good,This Co-Op is a great place to learn  the inner workings of a massive company. You learn how to assist in resolving customers issues while maintaining a professional outlook.
good,the salary and benefit are the best.  managers were not organized.  I worked for three years in the office & don't know most of the people names.
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for, there is definite room for improvement, but that is with any company this big. All I can say is that certain people that need to go should be let go."
good,"always worked from Monday to Saturday, sometimes working on Sunday, about ten daily working hours."
good,I had a blast working for at&t I miss it I just might reapply for a tech position in the near future very challenging kept me on my toes love it
good,"Many do not realize what a good company AT&T is until you leave.  The current culture if focused in advancing technology to offer top notch technology to ever consumer no matter the need."
good,I start at 7am and end at 530 pm 4 day a week. The people I work with are amazing. Some of the management  need better personal skills. I help 1-3 customers at a time in a chat atmosphere.
good,"Working for AT&T has given me the opportunity to grow not only intellectually, but also in knowledge of what constitute the backbone of any give profit-making organization: Repeat customers and retention. The importance of providing each customer with the unique experience of quality customer service that makes the difference not just in numbers, but in the enhance of the organization's name that prompts them to make referrals, repeat transactions and the reliability to offer a product or service they always know they can count on. Aside from all the paper recognition of meeting and exceeding the organizations expectations and quotas, what I enjoy the most is when at any given mall or public place someone comes up to you and state: ""You are the guy who took care of me."" Unfortunately, what I hate the most is the fact that I am goal oriented and drive by a commensurable salary and the least qualify person end up with your promotion."
good,Had lots of fun meeting new people learning a new field. Worked 16hrs a day sometimes 6 days a week pay was great benefits where equally great.
good,if you work little you won't be working for at&t very long. sale sale sale. top seller in market  - free luxury trip on the company for 3 days - treated like royalty
good,"The pay was excellent, when I first started the location was the greatest however AT&T decided to come up with a Super Center and relocated me and about 2500 other employees to Hoffman Estates, IL which is 51 miles one way."
good,AT&T has been an amazing company to work for.  Great benefits.  They encourage employees to develop skills and grow with technology.
good,"Sales driven environment that required a lot of hands on training. However, AT&T provided great opportunities for growth and advancement within the location you are employed and the company."
good,Jobs were very challaging and rewarding. You were able to choice how to decide how to test your procedures and implementation of your ideals
good,Great work culture. Lot of good changes coming due the various changes in the industry. Very supportive management with personal growth and development.
good,"I was taught and learned so much while at this company. It was rewarding would have liked to have experienced much more, and would to back to work at this company if opportunity arose"
good,"This is my worst work experience ever. It is a great company. The managers however are very unprofessional. If the managers applied what is in the employee handbook as they are paid to do, this would be a great place to work. I resigned in a heartbeat when i realized who i was working with."
good,"I worked for ATT for nearly 5 years. 3 years in customer care and the last 2 years in sales. I gained a lot of experience dealing with many customers on a day to day basis. Some good, some bad, a lot were mostly ""meh""."

good,"Love helping people resolve issues with service, performance incentives.  Hardest part of the job is trying to explain installation delays to customers who want their service installed yesterday."
good,The hardest part of my job was being away from my family 15 hours a day.  My typical day would start at 5am and I would open my computer and review yesterdays work and timesheets.  By 630am I would know who I had to see in the morning.  By being a field manager my job required me to meet a technician at his 1st stop however my garage was 40 miles away so I would start driving that way at 630am to meet a technician at 8am.  Sometimes my day did not end till 8pm that night because you are also required to see a technician on the last job before you leave that day.  The best part of my job was working with my technicians because they would work their butts off for me so I appreciated the job that they did.  But being away from home 12 to 15 hours a day takes a toll on the family and the lives that they have.

Working there enabled essential skills needed daily and I will be eternally grateful.

Lastly, It was truly a blessing for me to coach and develop individuals that did not think they had the skills to be respectable sales representatives is and will always be rewarding for me."

good,Management is a constant battle for the front line employees. Best way to describe this job is that they do not let their soldiers make it to the pentagon.

good,"At&t is a great company to make a career in. Lots of opportunities for advancement and great benefits. Co workers are always there to help. You become part of a brotherhood. You get to meet a lot of different people everyday. The only complaint I would have about the job is that its a very time consuming job. You barely have any time for yourself if there is alot of work, which is good for making money, but not good if you have a family."

good,"At Alorica working Direct TV everyday was fast paste. I learned how to clear a call within 7 min by my 2 week on the floor. My skills progressed as I continued working on the account over the months. I learned how to successfully close a sale with the customer feeling comfortable buying from me. However, the hardest part was to ask for their credit card information because that question makes just about anyone uncomfortable. I loved to help customers with their questions and most of all I loved to leave the customers feeling lucky for buying one of your items."

Management was always a source by which you could go to for an answer, if they didn't have it, they would find it.

good,"It was a inbound call center. Once I clocked in, headset was put on a the day started. Talking calls is not bad at all but sometimes you have to deal with irate customers but that is part of the job.  I have learned to understand that customers are consumers just like me; therefore, the customer wants to understand and relate to their problems. My co-workers were ok.

good,"A typical day on the job for Direct TV since I was an Independent contractor was I would go to a storage facility and my name would already be on about three to five work orders depending on how big or how small they were along with what equipment was needed for them. On the work orders it would tell me the customers name, the address of the install, and what I would be doing on the install such as installing a DVR, or maybe installing a dish and four boxes, or maybe just upgrading equipment. In this job I rarely ever dealt with management, if I did it was while picking up equipment and it was with DSI which was the company that gave me my orders. The hardest part of this job was dealing with picky customers and how they wanted their houses wired or finding the signal for the satellites because sometimes that was a chore all in itself. The most enjoyable part of this job was looking at my work and seeing how satisfied the customer was with it."

good,"A typical day of work is interacting with at least 5 to 8 different customers a day. Working business and residents, while having knowledge of safety and environmental policies on the company. Sometimes I work under structures or on top structures. I speak to many entities internal and external to provide services to customers. The hardest part of my job is knowing that I one of the top employees with an associates in business administration and knowing there is no chances of promotion in my current area."

good,Meet up with company workers and discuss daily ideas and goals. Then door to door sales rep with interested and new customers. Sometimes work with other co-workers and sell cable products. Hardest part is being rejected by non-interested customers. I enjoy meeting new people and getting better at my job on a daily basis.
good,Inbound call center. While on phone your job was to solve problem that customer called in for while reviewing customers credit and seeing what customer qualified for and didn't have with us and upsell.

good,"My typical day at AT&T consisted of provisioning complex circuits in live network switches for all telecom services. Our center took calls from co-workers throughout 22 states. I had to prioritize my work constantly to take care of the most important issues. I provisioned electronic cross connects and worked maintenance tickets to restore services. I interacted with co-workers in the local office as well as throughout the country to analyze,problem solve and provide good service. I enjoyed learning something new everyday and the satisfaction of solving problems. Our managers were available to assist if necessary."
good,It is a nice company. I worked by last 6 years as a Marketing Manager and I had a great expreience with Management and co-workes
good,I applied my engineering experience and applied to the programming assignments at the telephone company
good,"lost of advanced training in telecommunications services. which included data, voice, and television services. long hours and lots of responsibility. It was a great team environment, and the most challenging part of the job would be job planning, and trying to please every customer vs. doing the piratical instillation."
good,"Fast paced energetic workplace. AT&T gave me the skills to communicate in professional friendly caring way, also showing me how to multi-task using all my skills to be effective and proficient. Hardest part about this job would be that we could always use more hard working employees. Satisfaction that comes from this job is knowing you helped and did the best you could for each and every customer."
good,"Excellent benefits, good pay. Challanging work assignments."
good,explaining how devices work
good,AT&T is a great company. The health benefits are excellent. Always an opportunity to learn about emerging technologies.
good,"Assisting customers with valid information troubleshooting,sells ect. while management listen in on calls from time to time also sharing information with co-workers the hardest part was trying to get an irate customer to calm dowm"
good,Great company to work for... great opportunity for long term advancement. Awesome benefits. Great culture and values.
good,"A typical day at AT&T consisted of putting phones on sale floor,setting up the IPAD for the que,greeting customers,directing the customer to available rep.

Management was great and so were my co workers.The hardest part of this job was the week that we officially became AT&T,there were hardly any breaks we were all exhausted,but it did make the days go by fast."
good,A typical day at work consist of incoming calls and technical support. Our management is very consistant when it comes to helping us provide great customer care. The hardest part of the job is adapting to changing schedules that change periodically.
good,Overall I enjoyed my experience with AT&T. I was fond of the people that I worked with and the relationships that I formed with the customers. I am a very people oriented person and with AT&T I was fortunate enough to work with a variety of customers. I learned a lot about sales from this company and that offering the best solution is not always the cheapest solution and how selling out of your own pocket can make or break your paycheck. The hardest thing about working for AT&T was getting behind all products that they offer. I would try the majority of them out and sometimes was unable to see the value however they do have a number of products that I believe do better people's lives. Those are the products I would recommend and sometimes people would surprise me and find value in things I could never imagine using. I learned that you never know and never assume that what you may think is a waste of money another person would not need. The best part of my day was a game I would play with myself and to see how many people I could get to smile before the end of our interaction.
good,Working for this company is great once you find the position you are looking for. Great company moral .
good,Everything depends on your attendance. You are continuosly kept track of by the system for your attendance. Inbound calls only.
good,"Very secure, I open office, check eMail"
good,I enjoyed working there and talking to the different customers and meeting different people.
good,Learned management skills and customer service. Great interaction with customers while providing excellent customer service and selling quality products.
good,The company started out great and with each successive merger the company culture turn less employee friendly. Company politics and Managers bonus were decision makers each merger package.
good,"Verify all mail is moving for the client. Monitor the servers to ensure that all are functioning as they should, begin working tickets assigned by manager. Learned how the openmail processes work and function to transport email for the client. Hardest part of the job was determining if the issue was caused by a server issue or due to a network problem"
good,worked doing managers take over ... assisting the most difficult customers complaints. Good relationship with upper level management and co workers. There was no hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable was the end of the conversation with the customer after getting the confirmation that service was restored.
good,Work started at 7am once you get your route and load equipment then you were on your way. As soon as your route was done you were done for the day.
good,"The leader in digital home entertainment, now and for many years to come"
good,"Greet and examine client accounts for upgrade possibilities and account management. Created a friendly and safe sales atmosphere for clients as well as for other employees. Maintain and exceed sales quotas on a month over month basis with ease. Manage and oversee other employees in different aspects of there day to day operations. Maintain and seek new business opportunities to expand the company through peer to peer networking, social networking, and cold calling. Follow stringent inventory control policies while implementing new policies and procedures with employees."
good,Very structure with little regard to the employee. Strictly by the book environment. Did not like working in union environment.
good,The amount of information that i learned while being employed here is based on every day interactions.
good,"During my 34 years with Southwestern Bell/SBC/AT&T, I started out as a directory assistance operator, Then moved into the accounting department were I had various jobs, accounts payable, inventory of motor vehicles, computers and office equipment, labor rates, house service rates , motor vehicle rates. I then transferred and investigated unidentified toll. In 1995 I moved to the claims department and handled the disposition and paying of liability claims, filing, typing letters, and general clerical duties. In 2001 I was promoted to Claims adjuster. Currently I have my Adjusters license. In this capacity I handled claims for North Texas from San Antonio. This involved motor vehicle accidents, bodily injuries, and property damage. My job duties included taking statements from employees and claimants, determining liability, hiring appraisers if necessary, reviewing any questionable claims with our legal, clients and upper management. Documenting all files, reviewing pictures of the accident scenes, investigating ownership of the property. Index all claimants that had a bodily injury, report it to medicare, work with medicare liens, hospital liens. Setup releases and payments. My job was to negotiate and settle the claim in the best interest of the company."
good,The climate has changed due to technology and innovation. I'm not sure if the job security that I enjoyed is still there today.
good,I enjoyed the job at first then realized it was not for me...which involved sitting over 8 hours per day and I don't really like that kind of job.
good,A company that gave me a basis for a great life and with loads of training to be had just for the asking and for a person to do well if you take the advantage.
good,Great place to work but it didn't pay enough money. Nice management.
good,"Several organizations and department to be able to gain knowledge and experience from.  Depending on work group hours are very flexible.  Being with the company for over 20 years, I have notice a huge change for the positive in workplace culture."
good,"AT&T will review your work performance based on metrix and results, achivements and personal proffesional educative updates."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was having to work with great people of all walks of life. The diversity at the company made me feel included. I would suggest to anyone who looking for a job, to apply at this location."
good,"es una buna empresa, aunque tiene fuertes problemas internos en sus tiendas que no se preocupan en resolver"
good,"Great culture, awesome coworkers loved working here. Each day was an exciting experience to help people and make money in the process. Co workers were helpful and worked as a team, taking turns on sales opportunities."
good,New products were released and training was always offered. Good benefits and employee perks. Scheduling was good. Products were top of the industry and people liked the products.
good,"Money is good, need more of a flexible schedule and point system but overall pretty fair. Excellent pay and benefits. Paid holidays, plenty of vacay and 401k"
good,very fast pace company. you need to adapt to change every year. to get ahead and move up in the company you need to network a lot and get your name out there.
good,"Loved the flexibility the job offered.  Schedules could vary week to week and if you needed to trade a day/time most anyone would help you.  Only downside is that you are committing to a 24/7-365 job.  Don’t be surprised if you have to work nights and/or holidays.  Schedule is by seniority so new hires typically get the least amount of “good hours” but you can adapt, I did!"
good,"Large, diverse company with emphasis on diversity, innovation and customer satisfaction. An excellent company to grow and prosper. I retired after 38 years of service."
good,The workplace culture is diverse with a growing number of Millennials.  A place that is ever changing in the world of technology. The best part of being a part of this organization is the people.
good,"Awesome place to work and benefits work for. Convenient to get to work, cafeteria available which is nice, made lots of great friends. Training great keep up to date on products"
good,"Most of the time as an Outside Plant Technician was spent in the field, working in adverse weather conditions. Worked in remote locations frequently, a lot of time on the job was spent traveling to numerous job locations or trying to locate which pole or terminal or pedestal specified"
good,"Was there 4 years. Enjoyed working face to face with people. Very Goals Driven company. If you cannot engage your clients, be aware you will probably not make goal. The Union will assist if you are treated unfairly. I fully recommend joining the union. (Yes, I'm a Republican so I know it's a point of contention, however they did fight for the workers when needed, and were able to secure pretty good benefits for us.)"
good,"Coming into this position with no prior experience in this field and being able to succeed goes to show just how through the training process is. Work life balance can be a little uneven at times but if you’re looking for a challenging yet rewarding career, this is a great place to start."
good,With an overhaul in management the Fayetteville NC call center would be a great place to be employed. The company as a whole is a great company to work for.
good,"lugar estable y confiable para laborar, fue buen lugar para desarrollar habiidades"
good,I have been using at&t for years now and so has my family. I've been in the Army for almost 3 years and at&t just fits the type of work style I'm use to.
good,"Una empresa buena, en crecimiento en México, teniendo buena actitud logras un crecimiento."
good,"It an union house so seniority was an important issue especially when people come from any where in the nation and bump you. Good money, never off on the holidays. Retail in the beginning then corporate sales. Company phone which rings and you must answer because there is money on the other end. Good benefits."
good,"Enjoyed my time working in the telecommunications field. Worked as an outsourcer through Sutherland Global Inc.  The company offered a lot of training, and the systems were fairly easy to understand."
good,It is a very pleasant place to work for. I have always felt accepted and appreciated by my manager and my other co workers. You make pretty decent money for having little to no experience.
good,I enjoy working with others. I start my day reviewing my outlook calendar.  I pull up previous meeting notes to review.  Synergy is the key to successful projects.
good,"At AT&T you will enter to a great environment and great people to work with, further more if you are up to relocating you can escalate even further and find your future career, sadly my case is different when you have a family and depends to take care."
good,"It was a good company, they expect a lot but pay well and the benefits are great. You work hard they will leave you alone you screw about and you will be out the door In no time."
good,"AT&T is a great company and I've been privileged to work with them over the last 3 years. The company headquarters are located in Dallas and Atlanta, and the Denver office will soon close."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work.  You are paid well and there is lots of room for you to grow.Nice people, nice atmosphere, good pay. They have nice lounge and break area."
good,"Good company overall, but no room for advancement also going through some changes that impact the work to be done but no wage increase. Management was been shuffled around."
good,"AT&T has changed since I worked there in the 1970 and 1990 period.  However, everyone was always very supportive and the jobs were interesting and rewarding.  We had excellent benefits by today's standards and advancements were possible.  I utilized their tuition program to get a MBA prior to leaving for other opportunities."
good,"I’ve been on my job for 7 years and rotated thru every department I am now in management . AT&T is a company that loves to promote within so networking is required for growth. The benefits are amazing, as well."
good,"Good benefits, good pay. As all jobs, it could be frustrating at times working for such a large company.  The relationships I had with my peers were great."
good,Large multinational company with corresponding strengths and weaknesses. Worked in all phases of the business in role as Market Research Director. Currently retired.
good,"Decent company to work for. Decent pay. Decent hours. Working for this company is not bad at all. If you work safe and are courteous to customers, you can have a career at this company."
good,The Pay was great and you reciece great benefits. It is a bit stressful at times though but pace yourself and youll be fine. you have goals but work hard and you can do it.
good,If you want to have an outside life I wouldnt recommend this job. For at least the first year you will have many nights where you are out for 12+ hours. I learned a lot and developed some skills I never thought i would know. My manager was outstanding and always gave me the help i needed if he could.
good,"I wanna start with saying its a Great place to work for. but, some managers are terrible and some are amazing, the only way you move up in att though is if you know someone, if you don't your screwed. but i was happy with my job, its easy and you meet great ppl there. i wouldn't waist your time with the union bec they get paid off and it doesn't do you any good anyway."
good,"A nice place to work, but the company changed a lot after splitting with Lucent.  I was hired as a technical employee (programmer/application developer), but job requirements shifted until I was a Financial analyst."
good,"You log into your web-phone, clock your time into the computer system, pull up your customer management system and start taking calls."
good,Schedule can be intense however the job is very fun fast paced. Can be very stressful at times and irritating but overall love your coworkers and management. I recommend this job! I currently would like to go back hire me!
good,"Third Party for DirecTV./ Convergs"
good,"Worked hard for the money, paid very well, didn't like managers spying on you to see if you were working unsafe or doing your job correctly,  but I did work 30 years to reach retirement.  That's all I can say"
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for. I held a strong tenure there and wouldn't mind returning to the company. They have strict guidelines and metrics but other than that the work environment, people, pay, benefits, etc. Are all decent and they cover it all. Good company. Good pay. Good working man's job."
good,"AT&T was a great company to work for, excellent pay, amazing benefits, but it is union so I lost my job because of my seniority, there was a surplus and I got bumped out of my position by someone who had more seniority than me"
good,Fun work environment and the management staff was very easy to work with and very knowledgeable. The training was great and they offer great pay and benefits.
good,Great company to work for excellent benefits. I think the training process for someone coming into the business for the first time should be an longer process. It’s a lot to obtain in a short period of time
good,"Definitely not a bad place to work! Gotta be kinda fearless due to having to climb aloft up to 28ft, go into crawl spaces, and attics. Very attention to detail and customer service oriented. Compensation was great for all the work that you do. Also backed behind a union."
good,"At&t is a great company to work for. There is career advancement, great health benefits and pension plans. The company culture is great and always evolving in a positive direction. I decided to leave because of extensive work hours and wanted to go back to school to finish my degree. That was the only reason why I separated from the company. I needed a fixed and flexible schedule."
good,"The best part of my job at AT&T is meetings are kept to a minimum, which enables me adequate time to complete my day to day work, in addition to research applications and create processes, in partnership with other team members, that benefit the team to be more efficient and productive."
good,Being a technician at AT&T is what you make of it. Work isn’t super hard and you have the option for unlimited overtime. Great benefits. You don’t have to worry about someone standing over you all day as you work because you’re generally alone
good,"Best place I've ever worked at.  Great place concerning all considerations an employee has regarding employment (Pay & Benefits, Career opportunities, Work/Life Balance, Training, Work from Home opportunities).  Just knew it was going to end, got to 18 years then was laid off.  Keep up on gaining the Skillsets they want and need."
good,"Good place to work, very sales driven and aggressive so make sure your comfortable with that. Comp is amazing and good benefits. You can make a lot of money if your good at what you do."
good,I enjoy working for AT&T. Management is very interactive.  At times micro managing. A typical day of work is starting at 1100am taking calls for the first four hours then taking chats for the next four hours. Sitting at your desk taking one call or one chat after another. It becomes monotonous at times and very stressful working to meet all metrics.
good,"It was very knowledgeable job place for me. I worked manual, atomation, as well as mobile testing. The work environment is very good and friendly. My lead and manager are very good people."
good,Loved working there. On a day to day basis I would visit 4 locations daily to make sure signage was correct. They had to proper staffing in the locations and train on any new products and sevices.
good,"Great place to work, good Co workers, new scenery every day, problem solving, and keeps you busy, but wish they would hire for permanent positions instead of a 3 year term"
good,Love the team and sales reps are union so you have the support. Manager was great everyone helps each other. Everyone have to be on time greeting is important
good,The atmosphere was awesome. Good people and lots of fun. While the pay was less than expected for a major company as AT&T the benefits were good. There is a union that really goes to bat for its members. The culture was very inclusive and the management tried to do alot of things to keep morale up. Overall a very good place to work
good,Great place to work with great local management but corporate management seems outta touch. Union supported which is great as they help with work place disputes.
good,Great environment and wonderful colleagues to work with! The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new tools that can help influence my role in a positive direction.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo en el área operativa es tensa y demandante, se requiere de mucha dedicación, en ocasiones sacrificando la familia, reuniones, inclusive vacaciones, deja como beneficio el desarrollarse en una empresa de alto nivel, aprendiendo día a día, gratificante en estímulos económicos."
good,"this is a very good job, a lot of fun, the only problem is the managers, they try all the time to write you up instead to help you, they know nothing about the job we are working, and the Union doesn't work for the employee, they just all the time agree with the company"
good,"I enjoyed working their very good environment , you had a chance to switch position if you weren't comfortable with what you were doing. Overall it was a great experience"
good,Un lugar de crecimiento profesional y aprendizaje constante.
good,"AT&T Wireless legacy provided some benefits like 401K; pension plan; good medical, dental, vision and insurance coverage; employee discounts on Uverse (Landline, Cable TV, Internet), DirecTV, Celfone and other services."
good,"I learned so much on both a personal and professional level.  The different dynamics taught me who I want to be as a manager and who I don't  want to be as a manager.  Most importantly, it taught me how to interact and treat people."
good,I would absolutely work for ATT again.  I have worked on several ATT projects and always learned something new and gained experience that has helped my to advance in my career.
good,"As long as your 100% you will get 100% back at this job!!!"
good,I especially enjoy working from home. I'm afforded he freedom to manage my own schedule and travel. Working with the CWA union has its challenges. I learned its best to schedule union representation for upcoming interviews in case the subject requests a representative.
good,"Like any other job, it’s what you make it! Always keep in mind that the customers are mad at the company, at not you, you’ll be fine! It’s a great place to advance in the company"
good,The call center environment is very laid back and easy. System tool usage allows you to fly right by most issues that a typical work environment would struggle with.
good,AT&T is a great place to work where you can be part of a large team all focused on one goal. Learning to navigate processes is key.  Maintaining a good attitude will also make your career at AT&T better.
good,I enjoyed working here I lost my job to to a layoff. it is a good place to work.  I started as a premise technician and moved into management. Thank you.
good,I really liked my job. We received good training with live instructors but sometimes we did training online with computers in a training room. Sometimes only a certain number of techs were trained and they would give instructions to the general population of tech as they needed assistance
good,"The compensation plans are made for you to figure them out. Once you do and you focus on what they want you to, it's easy to talk to customers without shoving product down their throat. You have to get to know your customer and truly be confident at what you have to offer. The management is hard on you but, I'm sure it's because they also have numbers to make each month!"
good,"The job is fair and great for the most part. It really depends a lot on your district manager, your store manager, and the promotions the company is running. If you have no good promotions then selling things gets wonky. I was hired on and worked in an odd time for the company. They were restructuring and dealing with a lot of leadership drama. The biggest issue was they were shifting away from being a phone company and into DTV. It seems more polished now, but during the shift things were all over quotas were everywhere. Can be a high stress job. Just make sure you get a job at a busy location, not a slow one."
good,"AT&T offered great pay & benefits. Definitely would return if I could. Had some great managers during my career, also opportunities for tuition assistance & relocation."
good,Mucho apoyo de la trasnacional en inversión tecnológica
good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar conlleva una gran responsabilidad y sobre todo aguante ya que algunas ocasiones los coordinadores son estrictos como fue mi caso, pero las comisiones realmente son satisfactorias"
good,It was a great place to work until the company was changing systems and owners we had mandatory overtime they took away the free coffee it just changed the atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T because of the ability to grow and learn a lot in that environment, I also love my co-workers and how friendly everyone was towards me at my time at AT&T."
good,"I love working for the company. I got to meet people that I became very close to. The pay was great, I received raises every quarter and there were chances to make extra money making sales, or having good monthly stats outside of base pay."
good,"I worked at the Centralia Wa AT&T and enjoyed my time there. It is a great first sales job, you have many opportunities to make very good money as well as learn sales techniques"
good,Very homely feeling great place to work allows you to go for your full potential and a lot of people here to help with whatever you want to do in life
good,"The sky is the limit, if you apply yourself you can be a future leader. I've learned a lot of skills that are desirable by other companies, and the benefits are great."
good,"AT&T hires good people who are competent and positive-minded. I have the space here to be creative and am treated with respect. I recommend this employer for technical writers, business analysts, and other technology workers."
good,"Muy bueno de respeto apoyo entre compañeros,  muy buen ambiente"
good,A pleasant work place. I made some life long friend working for AT&T. The benefits and the salary was above average for the Augusta Georgia area. The work place was always a fun place when I worked there.
good,Great job and benefits. Can be a high stress environment at times. Security is questionable. Business decisions can lead to immediate head count reductions. This can be quite inconvenient and life changing.
good,Es una empresa donde como parte de su equipo de trabajo tienes muchísimas prestaciones
good,Constant lay offs and bumping people out of positions. But great pay and benefits. Only issue is no job security. Was a great place to work but I would not recommend trying to start a career here.
good,As company began putting the monopoly back together and acquiring other entities the emphasis changed from customer service to sales. And that is when I got the assignment of District Rep for a year and a half. Then Managers Assistant
good,Lots of hours but they paid well. Great place to work for a single person. The long hours pressured home life. Management turnover was quite high. Not much room for growth as many positions were being cut.
good,"Typical day at work,  nice and calm"
good,"Fun"
good,Loved my Job! It is what you make of it! The room for transition outside of IHX was limited in my area and I didn’t like retail or call center work. You can get burnt out and the dispatching varies by season so commission is mandatory to meet sales quota and there is no quota relief no matter what. You are in peoples homes so getting sick is frequent and if you have to take anything that effects driving you cannot work.
good,"fine group of people in all organizations , however supervisors are not needed and tend to cause tension and problems with in work groups , every management person is 1000 percent responsible and takes 100 percent ownership , supervisors distribute new work on a discriminatory basis. supervisors do not supervise since none is needed. Supervisors are poor and out dated to todays job requirements and business acumen and environment"
good,"ATT was an awesome company, Very fast paced and numbers driven position. I enjoyed being able to satisfy and save the customer the most. The hardest part I would have to say was not being able to retain all customers."
good,working with AT&T is a great training to be more flexible to multi-product account . while it was stressful it enhanced your ability to be efficient handling many tasks
good,"Great place to work , family oriented, great benefits,  good career opportunities, great pay, great environment, great coworkers, great mangers, good place to grow."
good,This company is fast-paced and hard-working but I truly enjoyed working there. Management works with you to help you get sales and meet goals.  I would return.
good,"It was a great learning experience and very challenging for me at the time because I was also a full time college student. Overall, it was a great start because it helped me get my foot into the door becoming acquainted with sales. On the other hand, it was in Mankato, MN and selling DirecTV in a small yet growing market for me was difficult."
good,"At&t is a great place to work, fair pay, great benefits, management is decent. You will be expected to earn your pay, not for the weak. Hardest part of the job is the lack of flexibility. Guaranteed 8 hours but sometimes days are long and it's hard to make personal plans."
good,Sales meeting in the morning and meeting with manager to review prospects and promotions.  follow up with calls to clients to promote advertising options. funnel managment
good,Worked at Sitel.Loved it.  Quality Analyst looking for opportunity in similar field to grow.  Sitel is closing down the Albuquerque site.  AT&T campaign is projected to be one of the first to go.
good,"I worked as an installer, my job was always an adventure meeting new people over coming new challenges and always a great experience. They have made a nice enviroment to work at."
good,"Worked from 8 am to 5 pm. one hour lunch break. Associates were easy to work with. Was able to work with other departments within AT&T.  The supervisor was excellent. "
good,"Loved working with customers in helping them whether it was getting them new services, providing technical assistance, and just further bettering their experience with the company."
good,"Guaranteed 8 hours a day plus possible overtime, drive company vehicle, work in any weather, management helpful when needed, co-workers helpful when needed, learned how to splice copper and fiber cable, how to work safely and operate company equipment safely."
good,Great company to work for.  Demanding and fast paced. Opportunities are endless.  Company rewards top performers and invests in their workforce.  Great vacation and benefits.
good,"Great place to work, technicians & management work well together, main issue may be job security due to out sourcing of some of our work and temporary  hired employees on term contracts, benefits are great and I always have something to work on or fix daily"
good,"AT&T is filled with opportunity literally around the globe. It has always been a diverse culture on all levels. "
good,"AT&T is an excellent company to work for, I have worked on the C&E side for 19 years and adore my co-workers. Our Area Manager is a wonderful boss to work for and our management team is amazing!"
good,I've been in a sales environment prior to coming to my current role at AT&T. I thought I had a good idea of what I would be stepping into working as a sales rep at AT&T. Boy was I wrong - yes certain elements of past sales environments were similar to AT&T but the level of professionalism I was greeted with made me that much more excited to be a part of the AT&T work culture. All-in-all I'm definitely enjoying my career so far with AT&T.
good,"AT&T has changed a lot in the past 20 years from a company that was focused on landlines, yellow pages, and phone booths to a company that now looks to the future of Network and Integration."
good,"Working for AT&T was very cool. So much has changed with the company, departments and culture. I would say that since the floors have an opened plan people are able to work seamlessly."
good,"I have learn a lot from working here. It is a very casual environment but innovative as well, i would recommend it to anyone  who is looking for a fresh environment."
good,Great fun exciting ! Helps build your career goals and get you ready for the world ahead! Excellent compensation paid holidays and vacations. Paid training
good,"I learned exquisite time management while working in the call center environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was celebrating birthdays, holidays, the birth of an addition to any of my coworkers family and especially the blessing of one of my co-worker's retirement. And the overall camaraderie we had as a family!"
good,"AT&T was great to work for. They taught me so much. They provided training courses and career paths. They paid very well and gave great bonuses. However, there was no loyalty to employees. No job security."
good,good job security and you always had the hours if no work in the area you were given a choice to travel to where their was work or end that day early.
good,I think it is really nice to see how far being a genuine person can get you. I love to see people laugh and smile it makes my day. I’m always thrilled to know that i can assist someone to help them have a better day .
good,Love working just moved and no job close it was a good company to work for good pay good benefits hard job but it was work and they paid you for it and what you did
good,Great place to make a name for yourself. Great benefits. They allow you room to flourish and provide an opportunity to gain additional skills by having a robust training program.

good,Generally a great place to work.  Change in regional philosophy at times feels like opportunities are limited.  However opportunities are there.

I am currently looking in my city for another company only because of the inability to relocate.
good,"at&t offered me the opportunity to learn and grow while performing my job.  A typical day with at&t starts with an agenda or worklist for the day that needed attention.

I enjoyed working from home with very minimal supervision."
good,"AT&T has served me well over the course of my career, however, I was laid off in 2015 after 27 years due to reorganization and job cuts.  I was rehired as a contractor and just recently laid off as another result of job cuts to contractors."

What the company offers is a forward looking, inclusive and growth oriented place of business coupled with set paths of self improvement. I surely would love to work for the company in Greensboro, NC or even working from home. My chosen vocation has always been Customer Service because of the customer interaction.  Any time spent working for AT&T is well worth it. If you can obtain a position with them anywhere on Earth I would say jump on it with both feet and hands!!"

good,"A typical work day is back to back fast paced, inbounded calls, i did however became better with muti tasking,my words per mintue while typing has increased.  The part I most enjoyed was building a interpersonal relationship with my customer even for that short period of time. Knowing the fact that I was able to make my customer feel comfortable enough to express his or her concerns. Allowing me to assist in solving his or her  issues and concerns, while  leaving my customer fully satified and at peace within in using great customer service.

good,I enjoyed working at at&t. I learned so much while working there. I learned how to be part of a team. My job title was advanced technical support representative. I was ablw to help peoe on a consistent basis. I loved that.
good,"A great company overall.. I enjoyed all the great people I worked with, from coworkers to customers. Great benefits as well as flexibility. My supervisor worked me to accommodate my schedule ."

good,"Great place to work and interact with a diversity of cultures.  Only drawback - if you are proficient and good at what you do, no room for advancement"

I enhanced my customer service skills. Culture of the workplace was very rigid but necessary. It was very satisfying to be able to help clients resolve their financial matters.
good,Wonderful for someone just starting out in tech. Not a lot of room for advancement. Very political but fair pay and amazing colleagues. Would recommend.
good,"AT&T was a great experience while I was employed.  I was able to move from Texas to Washington state as a transfer with the company.  I wanted to make a change and a difference in people's lives and found the opportunity to do so with AT&T.  Working as a Technical Support Specialist afforded me the opportunity to learn about the smart devices that are available in this day and age, the training provided by the company kept us all up to date on the latest technologies in the field of telecommunications."

good,"Overall a good place to work, can be tough to find work/balance when your are trying to get every dollar you can. Deaf ears from upper management on a lot of policies. Local management plays a lot of ""favorites"" and some departments can be very ""clickish"", but if you can stay above it, you can survive."
good,"Good sales position for young person starting out. good benefits, union position. potential to make good money but comission structure changes yearly and unable to maintain same level of income."

good,"Worked remotely, great training, great people, goal focused and an outstanding experience. I would love to work with AT&T again. Project Management, Management with a national organization."
good,When hired there was a clear indication of advancement opportunities but after 6 years of deicated service the comapny these were not availabe. The company is changing to a software and application base where most of the labor is beig outsourced and even laying off a good portion of the labor force. I wish I could advance to other postions as it is a great company to work for and will try to find other opportunities in the future.
good,looking for other fiber splicing/placing opportunities in the area. thorough knowledge on placing/splicing copper/fiber with ATT for 19 years. ATT has been a great company..could my service lead to other opportunities?
good,"One thing about AT&T is that it is not going anywhere, The amount of technical advancement the company has brought to the world is unprecedented. It certainly helped me grow."
good,This company was serious about gaining market share during the wireless boom. I enjoyed developing new processes and staying at the leading edge of technology
good,Facilidad para alcanzar las metas semanales los cuales nos ayudaban a tener un mejor sueldo semanal
good,"at&t is a great company to work for, very competative in compensation and in the work place...its sales driven so of course there are goals but very much achievable"
good,"My typical day was very fast paced which allowed me to experience the world of a call center. The management staff here was ok, but there were some that liked to micro manage and that is what caused the stress.  The workplace culture was great due to the diversity.  The hardest part of my job was the micro managing and the most enjoyable part of my job is the people that I worked with.  It was like we were all one big happy family"
good,"Everything about at&t is good with the exception of outsourcing which caused a huge rippling effect to this massive surplusing of management employees.  Great people, great benefits, and I enjoyed working with this company."
good,It was a great place to learn about the relay culture and customer service. We had a very strict confidentiality code about customer services. It was a great environment to work with also.
good,"This company is no longer at Convergys but I have to say this was one of the best jobs I have ever worked! My manager was fantastic, the pay was great and the environment was beyond fun!"
good,"Retired from AT&T at the age of 49 with 31 years of experience with many assets such as accounting, computer programming, data entry and many more such as phone experience."

good,"Work environment is so nice in ATT, clients are so helpful."
good,This was a great place to work.  Your co-workers were very helpful and friendly.  Enjoyed working with co-workers and management from different areas of the United States.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my time with AT&T and would go back and work for them again. As a PM, you always work with many team members across several levels:  Architects, Engineers, Networking personnel, other PMs, the assigned Business resource per project."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work, they kept things professional, and the union (CWA) was excellent also. Sometimes the customers were difficult and rude, but it gave me valuable experience to work with them."
good,Cutting-edge technology and some of the brightest minds make this company among the beset I've worked with.  The discounts and time off really make it a hard company to leave.
good,Overall AT&T is a good job but if you're ambitious and looking to move up it can be challenging. Normally if you're a top sales person management wants to discourage you from moving into management because they want to keep you on their team making their sales look good. That part about AT&T culture needs to change.
good,AT&T is one of the best places to work in the United States. Most people are paid well and come to work happy. If you enjoy a great working environment and being on time then this is a great place to work. If you are lazy and think somebody else will do your job for you and keep bankers hours then you probably won't survive very long.
good,"AT&T was a cool job to have. Would recommend anyone to work there. Management was poor, core values rarely implemented, and if implemented. Selective."
good,I worked with AT&T for 5-6 months and loved it. Pay was great for the work I was doing. It was simple work for the most part. I was great at it and management was easy to work with. The discounts you get are incredible. I eventually decided to leave because of travel distance. Originally I was told I'd be able to transfer closer to home as I was driving 62 miles one way to get to work. But constant change in management and being short staffed pushed off that transfer date. I decided to leave the company on good standards and hope to apply in the future for a closer location
good,"had the chance to have new experience everyday, and room for improvement. enjoyed working outside and interacting with the customers. enjoyed the time off we get"
good,Loved and excelled at my my job duties and responsibilities but unfairly management gave me a hard time.... I am sure that being very competitive can sometimes scared my superiors but my intentions were never to move up and they knew that....👎
good,Great place to work. Great benefits and discounts.  Very progressive company who cares about their employees.  The pay is competitive in the industry.
good,"I love my career.  If it not for corporate downsizing, I would have retired from AT&T. The culture is good and the company is among the leaders in technology and services."
good,"AT&T is a fun and fast paced place to work. The calls come in back to back, but the benefits provided to the employees are very good. Overall this is a great place to work."
good,"Challenging work environment. Learned so much. Worked my way up from 411 operator so I got to see many aspects of the company. The change from the ""phone company"" to a global communications, wireless and now entertainment provider was quite a ride!!"
