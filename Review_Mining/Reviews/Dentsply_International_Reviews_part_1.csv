rating,review
bad,"Management does not care about employees especially employees who advocate for practical, substantial and honest meaningful changes."
bad,Worse place i ever worked management will not train employees to be successful in the work place . Take my advise if you want a good paying job this company isnt for you. The work is all under paid wages to other plants in and around that area
bad,"Aucune formation à la hauteur de l'exigence de cette entreprise."
bad,The management is not good and they did nothing about how the women treated me. I had to quit. Older ladies are in cliques with each other and it is very childish.
bad,"Förväntningarna på övertidsarbete och tillgänglighet är stora. Då många högsta chefer sitter i USA, blir det svårt för dem att ha kontroll över befordringar och projekt som klubbas igenom, vilket medför att oprofessionellt ledarskap och ineffektiva projekt tillåts existera. Osympatisk arbetsplats. Undvik, om möjligt."
bad,"If you needed a reason to stay away from contemplating this place for your next employer, consider the simple fact that you'd be working for a dental supply company. There's no corner of the market more uninspiring and yawn-inducing."
bad,Working here has been a chore. Everything is mismanaged from the top down with poor communication between all extensions of the company. I would not suggest anyone seek a job here unless your goal is endless stagnation.
bad,"Ambiance déplorable et licenciement à tour de bras"
bad,"I worked their as a machine operator and the supervisor was disrespectful and would lose his temper when he was upset"
bad,"Very cut throat environment, poor leadership, high turnover, aged products, limited R&D, poor benefits, micro-managed, and extremely poor compensation structure."
bad,Sad. Unacceptable behavior by management and Supervisors.  If you liked high school antics you'll love this job. Would expect fair and equal treatment for employees from a company that thinks so much of themselves. A total waste of time.
bad,"Their managers micromanage, have favorites, treat those they don't   like cruelly.  Like working in the Twilight Zone.  I can't imagine anything worse."
bad,company does not show it cares for employees ever since the merger between Sirona and Dentsply. Company became less interested in employeee morale and all the good Incentive that made it fun and interesting to work for Sirona was eliminated.
bad,The work atmosphere is very hostile.  There is no work/life balance with this employer.  Expected to work long hours with no flexibility for family life.  No support or mentorship from upper management. Inappropriate comments/jokes in the office.
bad,"Recommend staying away from job opportunities in corporate, particularly corporate legal. Was great place to work before merger in 2016.  Environment declined drastically in October 2018."
bad,"management is disorganized, my team had no team leader when i was working there.....nothing but chaos and utter confusion!!!!....fired me because ""desk was too messy""....meanwhile i made over $11,000 in sales for the 3 weeks i was working there. management looks for any excuse to fire the temps, and favoritism and nepotism runs wild over there!!"
bad,"great company, very poor leadership towards new employes.lack of trainning."
bad,"Temps are treated poorly by a few individuals. Management lacks the ability to mange people. Very ""high school"" atmosphere and where supervisors thrive on the tadle tale drama. Not a team environment. Daily atmosphere consist of bullies, and brown noses, and if you aren't one of those you won't fit in. No measurable progress by supervisor how the department is doing reaching goals for bad debt. Supervisor's lack proper training to supervise, therefore staff is not be guided to its potential."
bad,Terrible place to work micro management under the direction of hourly associates from other Departments. Sr Supervisor very unprofessional.  A typical day would be spent trying to figure out where your trainees were.  Did not learn much other then to coach employees.  The workplace culture is stagnant & in need of new innovations.  The hardest part of the job was the inability of Sr Management to assist in leading the team and the lack of professionalism.  The most enjoyable part of the job was  being paid hourly in a leadership role!
bad,I would recommend working here...unless you're african american. Don't believe me? Go on their company website and look for diversity. It's a perfect reflection of the interworkings of this company.
bad,"Em relação a avaliação geral, acho que a empresa deixa a desejar em alguns aspectos por exemplo salario, fiquei sem reajuste durante quase 5 anos. Ajudaria mais a empresa se tivesse um plano de cargos e salários. em relação a promoção, sempre participei de processo seletivo interno, mais sempre tinha uma carta marcada. Gerencia depende de cada setor, alguns gerentes não procuram ter um bom relacionamento com seus colaboradores. Mais em relação a empresa, foi otima nesses quase 10 anos da minha vida, aprendi muita coisa e tenho muito a agradecer... Conheci muitas pessoas na qual fiz amizades verdadeiras e aprendi muito também."
bad,"Many of my colleagues have been held back in their rolls due to companies lack of interest in investing in its employees. Pay raises are generally 1-1.2% per year, however the benefits are great and on par with many other companies. As a Mechanic I have been withheld in my position due to the companies inability to provide a path for advancement or want to invest time or money in bettering me for the benefit of the company. "
bad,I was made a lot of promises that were not fulfilled.. They put the cart before the horse and listen to too many outside sources before making decisions and doing research.
bad,Management needs help in organization skills. There so busy traveling to Delhi and every place else. They refuse to take responsibility for their mistakes.  This would be great place to work if they would get the right management  in place it could excel.
bad,"This company tends to keep wrong people in lead positions! If you want to change the future of this company and expect the attitudes to change, listen to the workers!!! Stop catering to toxic leaders!!!! A lot of good people and great workers are FED UP with toxic leaders that pull the wool over the eyes of management ! Nothing will change if nothing changes!!!! No more enablers for a negative workplace!"
bad,"Receiving misc. items daily, cycle counting, poor management team, preached core values but did not apply them."
bad,Importante restructuration générant une ambiance déplorable
bad,"Um dia tipico de trabalho na Dentsply Sirona e ""apagar incendios""."
bad,Upper management does not value employees. Extremly poor work life balance. Many days of overtime and management hardly ever recognizes hard work and effort.  Work 5+ hrs of OT they want 10+ work 10+ they want 20
bad,"Burn out garanti au bout 6 mois, charges et chefs vous mettent la pression.Rien ne va jamais."
bad,"My mother taught me if you do not have anything nice to say, do not say anything! So I will take her advice on this and choose not to say anything...."
bad,"There is no career advancement with the exception of a few people that are favored, and it's not based on experience.  There is no work life balance.  Morale is low."
bad,You are not able to advance unless you are buddy buddy with someone high up. They don't pay people what they should be paid. They over work all of the workers.
bad,One of the worse places ive ever worked.  There was no communcation between management and supervisors.  They expect you to have no life with the crazy hours they want you to work.
bad,This company only cares about they' re numbers and products. No advancements to a better paying job. Benefits are ok. They continue to hire temps and dont care about work ethics.
bad,"This was a great place to work before the merger, now you can see nepotism at its finest at Densply Sirona. The amount of budgets being allocated to departments / employees  favored by the GM,  the lack of leadership and no career advancement."
bad,"Management does not trust technical staff.  Place is run by finance guys and spreadsheet (Industrial) Engineers.  They override and micromanage everything - then blame for poor result.  Management is completely fractured.  I am never sure who I report to or who sets the objectives for our site.  Management is constantly infighting."
bad,The job is very fast paced and you need to make production numbers in order to keep the job. their is no benefit to going over the numbers except to kiss up to supervisors. no advancement opportunities and no bonus or raises
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of standing in one spot for hours running molds through heaters and coolers trying to hit rate and at the same time keep records of the amount of molds and teeth handled. I learned the interesting but dull process of making teeth for dentures. "
bad,"Management is terrible and does not work in a team effort environment. Not only do they not motivate employees to want to be better, they discourage them  and impact morale negatively."
bad,"Ambiente lavorativo poco stimolante, con nessuna possibilità di crescita professionale.ruolo adesso è quello di customer care specialist, ragion per cui sto orientandomi verso una variazione di mansione nonchè di azienda."
bad,"Heavy work loads, poor training, under-staffed and low morale contributes to a work environment that is quickly intolerable."
bad,"It was a touch year ,"
bad,Trabalhei na época em que a empresa era a Herpo Produtos Dentários. Tratava-se de uma empresa familiar e com uma cultura muito familiar.
bad,"A typical day do you best with out any clear instruction, poor supervision "
bad,The location of the organization doesn't help in attracting the right talent which in turn makes the organization less exposed to the external world. The loyalty of the employees has more to do with benefits and location than the organization and work culture itself. The leadership team is not strategic and stumbles often but doesn't recognize the need to change. HR is really resource allocation and paper processing.
bad,"Empresa boa, porem muita distancia entre funcionário gerencia."
bad,"The workplace culture, at least in my area, was that many people would not take responsibility for their own areas and problems, and would try to blame others, usually the new employees."
bad,"zero communication from upper management, very unethical behavior from many, no life-work balance.  lack of trust is the biggest issue there.  if you like and enjoy brown nosing; then this is your place of work."
bad,"Die Fachthematik ist sehr spannend und Innovationskraft ist sehr hoch. Genauso wie das Schmerzensgeld, daß man bekommt. Aber ist das die eigene Gesundheit und Einbußen der Karriere wirklich wert? Auf Kosten der kleinen Arbeiter werden hier Projekte durchgedrückt ohne Rücksicht auf Verluste. Termine sind fix und das spürt man sehr deutlich. Management belobhudeln sich alle gegenseitig. Es wird sich in die Tasche gelogen und wenn man aufgrund von jahrelanger Ausbeute nicht mehr so kann,  wird man als nicht resistent genug dargestellt. Ellenbogenkultur zwischen den Mitarbeitern an der Tagesordnung, da sehr hoher Konkurrenzdruck. Keine Sitzgelegenheiten für Kaffeepausen und Absprachen mit Kollegen. Aufgrund von Zeitdruck wurden alle Meetings und Absprachen mit Kollegen gestrichen. Von oben regiertes Arbeiten, kaum Selbstbestimmung, keine Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten, trotz mehrmaligem Nachfragen und überdurchschnittlich hohem Engagement."
bad,"As a Molder,I was responsible for machine press operating by assembling molds with precise instructions..............................................."
bad,"If you're Hispanic, you will excel here. You are favored, and will get promoted to lead positions even if you can barely speak English. Management does not recognize other employees, no matter how much you go above and beyond."
bad,"Not a good organization for entry-level college students or persons with little experience to start with this company. ***They do not promote from within if you started with little experience.*** Many people in my department with 4-year business degrees were not able to gain a position higher after several years of work with high performance. Only making 35,000 per year with a 4-year business degree is unfortunate. Poor management directive, processes, and handling of metrics. Human resources provides false sense of hope by promising advancement opportunities, but hiring personnel from the outside with more experience. Was told several times by HR that if you are willing to re-locate you could be easily considered for a position. Qualified through their internal personality testing, regional manager wanted to fly me down for a personal interview, but regional manager was told by HR directly to interview local reps in the area first. This example re-enforces that they do not hire from within, and do not value their own employees. After three years of service to the company with multiple rewards for performance, I was let go and given an excuse that I mis-handled my territory. There was no warning, counseling statement, training record, or documentation. This company was also paying for my school and expected me to re-pay them in full for my tuition, however documentation did not explain or state otherwise."
bad,Faltava disciplina nos demais. Talvez essa seja a causa de tantos remanejamentos de funcionários.
bad,"It's production making dental supplies for dentists. Pros: Very clean environment. Cons: Working MANDATORY 10-12hr shifts, there's no work/life balance. 1st shift starts at 5-5:30 am, 2nd shift starts at 1-2:30pm, 3rd shift starts at 9-10:30pm. Hard finding childcare and the temps get paid as much as the full time. RIP OFF"
bad,"The only thing I learned from this place is what a corporate setting looks like. Poor management, favoring of some employees and employees who talk about everyone and everything"
bad,"The people that work there can tend to be quite varying in personality, but not always in a good way. the work environment can feel quite hostile. Depending upon where you are management can be good or bad."
bad,Worked there for years. The company was overall good. Room for a lot of overtime and growth within the department you are working. Three shift options and very family oriented.
bad,"The company is going through a period of time that where they have gone through at least 5 CEO's in two years, unannounced lay-offs, pay cuts, cancelled bonuses for managers and down.  Leadership is leaving or being fired in droves."
bad,"Dentsply ist ein sehr innovatives Unternehmen, das sich im Umbruch befindet. Auf Weiterbildung wird viel Wert gelegt und das Unternehmen tut hier auch sehr viel für seine Mitarbeiter."
bad,They have no sense of official training in the Waltham office. Management like to micro manage instead of focusing on training. They sit you with reps who fly trough the process instead of teaching you. Management clearly trash.
bad,"Dentsply is a good company to work for. Sales allows you to set your own schedule and appts. to hit your quota.  They are the largest dental manufactuer, so this will help you get into the door of many accounts."
bad,"Sirona was my favorite place to work until the merge with Dentsply. Culture changes, jobs disappearing and they reappearing for someone from Dentsply to take. Jobs moved to York, PA"
bad,"Empresa dinâmica,sustentável,visa benefícios ao colaborador,ambiente tranquilo ,poucos funcionários com deficiência."
good,"Dentsply Sirona has undergone many changes in the past couple of years.  with that, they seem to have lost sight about what is most important to a company. They bog all of their employees down with useless junk that doesn't directly correlate to your position.  Most people in my department are already working overtime voluntarily but upper management just keeps screaming for more and more and the employees have become disengaged.  Dentsply says they promote from within but that is not the case.  They are very focused on a persons education rather than the persons actual abilities. They want a degree and if you don't have it they wont even consider you for a promotion even if you are already doing the job"
good,"Management was hardly ever onsite, workers have to usually figure things out to get the job done.  Closed the NY facility and did not offer the opportunity for employees in NY to transfer to other locations."
good,Hard to balance your work life with your personal life. You are at work more than you are home or doing other things with your time. Have to work a lot of overtime and work on Saturdays maybe Sundays depending on what department your in.
good,The middle level management is horrible. The culture is very different and too much politics. Loyalty out weights competency.
good,"Not interested in filling out review for this company. Operate injection molding/automated injection molding machinery to mold artificial teeth; including staining, finishing, plastic mixing, mold setup, troubleshooting and minor mold repair. Experienced as Operator II doing color adjustments, documentation, setup machines, handle/work with hazardous materials, mix liquid and paste materials and training new employees."
good,"Training was exceptional... managers where not supporting of their employees very old school and no career path ."
good,"If you are new in sales they will hire you, but you will be gone in 2-4 years for the next group of grads. They do have very good equipment and training!"
good,Stock price fell in half this year. great vision and leadership obviously.  They're the most outdated in offering and highest price.  Time to get real.
good,"Merger of DENTSPLY with Sirona has yielded a much more stressful work environment.  There is significant pressure to reduce costs (managers asked to give back budget $ before year end, travel restrictions for marketing, there was a cutback on having lunches during meetings over lunchtime, etc).  Major division recently closed and top 8 executives at corporate ""retired"" (I thinks this translated to ""were retired"")."
good,"It started out as a great place to work.  However, over the years, due to new management, the culture began a drastic change.  Stressful place to work.  People often worried about their jobs.  Management is very misguided and does not show a lot of care for or give support to their employees.  Many departments were often left with out proper work tools, parts, and supplies to do their job properly. The people the department are fun to work with, however, management seems very disorganized in running the departments."
good,"Empresa que possibilita grandes experiencias de trabalho, podendo conviver com inumeras situações profissionais distintas."
good,"With the merger everyone’s job came into question. There was a constant threat of layoffs and firings. Weekly whole departments or individuals were being let go. Management was only looking out for their on positions. "
good,"The company holds too many meetings to simply schedule the next meeting.  Rather than trusting one to know one's business, they tell you the results they want on a spreadsheet and force individuals to provide forecasts that are unattainable."
good,"para practicas o residencia esta muy bien, solo para esos casos"
good,"This is a company that treats salespeople relatively well, especially if they pay proper homage to their managers. Basic sales training is very thorough and valuable. The challenges are average product lines acquired with no overall strategy, ill-supported by a very weak product management function. The sales function has to make up for all of these shortcomings, which creates stress on the whole system."
good,"Always busy, no one steps up to assist the other if they fall behind."
good,"I loved the staff, people were great and very friendly. However, the manager of both quality departments lacked regard for employees under them. One never showed up and the other was rude enough to insist that it is one persons job to work as the only inspectors because that’s what the company needed. Companies work because they have different positions and everyone works collectively as a team.To have someone work alone and dump all the work from months prior on that person with no training is wrong."
good,"Konzeptionelle und operative Arbeit, viel Beziehungsmanagement mit Key Accounts, starke Zusammenarbeit mit den Ländern "
good,"very quick paced skilled, data entry , people friendly. management very fair. wages run people away, educational work. safety first, leadership development classes fork lift and power tool learning good people bad people."
good,"Compensation along with benefits are very good. Effective training across the location in DE is very inadequate for individual growth. Operated with the ""good ole boys"" mentality."
good,Typical large company with lots of red tape. Poor leadership from management. Takes to long to get anything accomplished and by then the competition has already went to market with the competitive product.
good,I have worked for the company well over 5 years and in my experience it is ok for someone fresh out of high school who does not plan to stay long. The companies priority is its money not is associates. Management is chosen based off who you know not your capabilities and pay is mediocre at best. Hours can be long and mandatory over time can last for 3 to 6 months at a time.
good,"Sent most of the finance jobs to India to 'save money' and left over 30 people without employment. Once India couldn't do the work, demanded that those who were left stay, and had unrealistic expectations of how much could be accomplished by the remaining employees"
good,morning reach at 8. start opening censor. before lunch get all the sensor and make a ready for the master sil. at the end of the do all the paper work and finished master sil.
good,Empresa capaz de gerar experiencias em todas as áreas industriais.
good,"Empresa americana da área química com foco na exportação para Europa e EUA. Até 2008 a empresa era exelente, com ambiente leve e amigável. Foi atingida com muita força pela crise de 2008, afetando fortemente o ambiente da empresa com o fantasma constante do corte de pessoal e dos investimentos. Muitas coisas aconteceram desde que saí e amigos que ficaram relatam que o clima vem melhorando desde então porém a equipe hoje é de 6 pessoas, contra 11 do passado."
good,"Stressful/Micromanaged/No Training/No Tolerance .  Things have gone from bad to worse with the implementation of the new controller.  Too many Chiefs and too few Indians,"
good,managment team is dentsply..warehouse workers are excel.not following procedures
good,Very corporate. Lots of meetings. They contract out a lot instead of developing in house. Pretty frustrating and you are expected to work outside of work hours often.
good,"Empresa passando por processo de fusão e aquisição, com ambiente comprometido pela instabilidade e incerteza."
good,"Culture was a bit siloed and old school for my taste. It took a long time to get things accomplished and innovation was not a priority. The people I worked with nice and supportive. Most stakeholders knew their jobs well and worked hard. Overall nothing bad to say, a pretty standard corporate environment."
good,Its a great job for anyone whos looking to get into school and have income with insurance but its not a place to stay in if you want a to make more money in the long run. Yes there is over-time that's where most of your income comes in. Raises are very low and difficult to advance quickly. Work place is strict you must be on top of your job. All production jobs are easy but long and boring.

All production jobs are easy but long and boring.
good,"This company provides on-the-job opportunities to strengthen skills in finance, accounting, forecasting, and program measurement."
good,"Os dias de trabalhos eram todos normais. Alguns dias mais estressantes, por ser uma coisa fixa de trabalho, fazendo sempre a mesma coisa, mas dias agradáveis também , pois realizavam dinâmicas até mesmo para a distração dos funcionários. Para não ficar só na alineação do trabalho."
good,"Azienda dinamica in continua evoluzione."
good,"The turnover rate is high and there is a reason for it. Management has a hard time listening. Workload and timeline was stressful. Unable to get assistance until I quit and then they hired two people to perform the job I was doing. Forced to perform a job with no promotion while another received a promotion to do the same job. Every time someone quit or did not perform their jobs adequately others from other departments had to absorb parts of the their jobs, instead of hiring someone to replace them. I loved the job when I first started but, with each new manager it became unbearable."
good,"Boa"
good,Tested liquid analgesics using HPLC. Also tested medical device related products using various lab instrumentation.  Was treated fairly well as a contractor.
good,Large territory to manage with aggressive sales goals undergoing new management/merger.  Positive work environment and close knit teams.  Enjoyed close working relationship with outside sales teams to game plan and grow territory.
good,"Depending on shift, will either have the help you need or no help. Not the best paying job. Some days are better then others. Alot of people trying to get full time. Hard to keep qualified personal."
good,"Hardest part of job, Sales oriented organization . Finance support function always dependable on sales personnel, How they want to lead. There is finance career ."
good,A empresa ainda não conseguiu desenvolver uma cultura forte após a fusão de duas empresas muito diferentes.
good,"very competitive high paced lab. Not much leadership from the direct manager"
good,"Not a bad compamy to work for if you don't have a family.You will learn how to make dental parts such as stacking,brassing,polishing and final finishing which is scraping and packaging"
good,"Le poste d'opérateur de stock  était agréable , travaillant de nuit je préparais les pieces pour les opérateurs de jour. Par contre etre  operateur fut tres difficile il fallait s'assurer que tous les éléments fabriqués etaient complets et en bonne état pour proceder à l'emballage et létiquetage du produit avec des cadences tres élevés."
good,"dentsply  is good company."
good,"My day/job consisted of:"
good,This company is one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of all dental supplies.  I purchased all items needed to manufacture the dental supplies as well as planned the production schedule and made sure the items needed for production were on hand.
good,foi uma experiencia muito proveitosa ter trabalhado nesta empresa funcionarios exemplares e um bom ambiente de trabalho
good,"I have mixed emotions. I loved my manager but upper management sucks. They only hire you through a temp agency and would have you sit around and wonnder if you will become permanent. Working under a temp does not give you any healthcare benefits, paid time off or vacation time. If I was hired on I would still be employed there"
good,"The department I was working in has good teamwork and a good supervisor. Company started going downhill, people were getting laid off and quitting. started to feel like there could be no jobs after tomorrow."
good,"The company is still struggling with post merger pains, but I believe that it will rebound at some point.  I would recommend working for this company to individuals looking to enter the Dental Industry."
good,"Empresa boa, porem não valoriza muito os funcionários."
good,Average company. Can be good depending on which department you land in. Experienced both good and worst people. Good thing is that they are moving making the environment better.
good,Due to its far flung operations and numerous locations it was difficult for a comprehensive culture. Language and distance were a stumbling block but overall very smart people.
good,"Ambiente agradável de trabalhar, com grande aprendizado e trabalho em equipe."
good,"Yes Dentsply Sirona is a solid company, management is excellent, supervisors are very helpful. Other associates are helpful as well, will assist you with any question you have, very fast paced atmosphere. Have the choice to do some overtime on weekdays and weekends. Good benefits as well IF you are hired and officially part of Dentsply (temps are exempt from this) Cons: the pay (do so much for so little, does not add up) and work/life balance. I’d suggest fixing that issue if management sees this."
good,Okay place to work.  Commute was a bit of a challenge but they are a big company and going places.  There is always a chance to do more work and be given more tasks.
good,Overall a good company with good co-workers with generally a slow turn over rate among employees. Employees get cake once a month and out BBQs are held in the summer months
good,It is an okay place to work but it seems the compensations does not compare to the work done. It can be physically demanding.
good,Nice and friendly atmosphere.  Non-intimidating and open scientific culture.  People care and make you feel part of team.
good,"Multi-tasking all day long. Talking and troubleshooting with customers and dealers over the phone while entering repair orders, entering complaints, entering credits/debits, and answering emails."
good,"Overall, the staff at Dentsply Implants in Waltham, MA are nice to work with. But, it takes an act of congress to get some things done with certain departments and certain individuals.  Some people can ""hide"" and do very little in this large organization, letting others pick up most of the slack. Even in small departments there are issues with this."
good,"Um dia dinâmico, combinando as ações entre as áreas de atuação."
good,"Great patients"
good,Dentsply had many great benefits but the pay was not equal to the work and job security was an issue
good,"It's a good company to work for however, compensation is not as high as other companies in the industry."
good,"Boa estrutura corporativa, com maunais bem detalhados e revisados periodicamente."
good,"Företaget har genomgått stora förändringar senaste åren. Ny ägarstruktur och många omorganisationer. Sammantaget är detta både på gott och ont förstås, men på sikt kommer det säklert att bli bra. Det finns möjligheter att utvecklas inom företaget, det ställs stora krav på kunskap, vilja och ambition."
good,Typically doing multiple projects from time to time;
good,"Es una empresa nueva en mexicali en la cual me pude desarrollar aprendiendo de su gerencia en Mexico y EUA a traves de las certificaciones de calidad y las tranferencias de productos en las que estube a cargo, es una buena empresa para desarrollarse."
good,"Handle multiple daily & monthly tasks, which I enjoy being busy."
good,A typical work day at Dentsply was going door-to-door selling restorative dental products and training dentists how to properly use our products. .
good,Divsion trying to reaquire lost customers and retain existing business post-Japanese disaster with newer salesforce.
good,"Passava por cada divisão do setor para pegar os controles de produção e passá-los para a planilha do Excel. Aprendi que numa empresa grande eu posso ter oportunidade de crescimento, só não pude aproveitá-la por causa de problemas pessoais que estava passando na época. Meus supervisores eram pessoas boas de lidar. O ambiente de trabalho e os colegas do mesmo eram muito bons. O mais difícil eram as dores no braço e dedos por só ficar digitando no período integral de trabalho. Gostava muito do curso que fazia por ser Menor Aprendiz."
good,"Review of the company was overall a good place of employment, was hoping to retire from here.  It was a causal culture with good management.  I enjoy the people I work with."
good,I had several different positions at Dentsply.  The insurance is good and work hours were a bit flexible.  Did not like that hiring for supervisor positions was hired out instead of promoted within.
good,If your more into a relaxed non numbers based job this isn't the job for you. The real money is in overtime which is always there but you 'll find all your time is at the workplace for a descent check.
good,"Bien, pero fría . No dan tiempo y no tienes canales para poder demostrar tus conocimientos y aptitudes"
good,Very conservative and frugal company.. not really willing to engage world class standards of manufacturing. Sweating assets is not a solution set for plastics
good,"take measurements of burs to see what machine adjustments needed to be made... I learned a lot about tools, how machines worked, how to read blue prints. I entered changes in product in computer system. My goal was to keep products within company and government specs. Coworkers helped each other when needed. It was a very happy environment."
good,They take care of their employees better than a majority of companies. However they seem a bit top heavy manager wise. Very siloish when it comes to work duties.
good,"empresa com uma linda estória em petrópolis, onde tive muitas oportunidades que jamais esquecerei."
good,L'entreprise a vocation à évoluer dans tous les sens du termes mais faut il encore changer la culture..... Ce n'est pas choses facile car la majorité du personnel étaient présent avant la restructuration.
good,"This is a dental lab equipment manufacture as well as the dental drills that everyone hates, great company as long as they want to stay put."
good,Decent place good place to work. Very oriented with family. Some good values. Kinda decent pay. Nice folks to work with. Not hr middle of the beach area
good,The company is very productive and very cautious on what there technicians do. The benefits are good and the people that works there are very friendly. The managers makes sure that you are doing your job and they be making sure that the products are completed and passed every single test that the product needs in order to be released.
good,The company is good about working from home when needed. Very intelligent individuals in software development. The people are a pleasure to work with. Typical corporate structure. They struggle to provide resources. Have not produced a bonus for software development in quite a while.
good,J'ai adoré travaillé avec des dentistes et des laboratoires dentaires.
good,"Assisted VP and HR representative.  Company was recently aquired when I started, therefore had the opportunity to work with both companies employees.  Assisted HR rep with events for our facility."
good,"Depending upon what your job is, the place is okay. The place is kind of like family but some managers tend to do a lot of finger pointing (which never goes over really well with senior staff). Teamwork is great within the manufacturing community. Due to the place being a batch manufacturing operation, it is difficult to make significant cost savings. Management is extremely concerned about back order and often this places a lot of stress on manufacturing supervisors and scientists working on process improvements/trouble shooting. Bandaids are often placed on processes before you move on to the next fire. R&D help in analytical chemistry is minimal which makes troubleshooting that much more difficult."
good,"• Calling dental offices in focus product decline to gather information on why they have no been using Dentsply products and figuring out how to get them to purchase our products again."
good,"A typical day at work is easy going,with the addition of fun co-workers. The learning experience its self was interesting as far as the certification process on the forklift and the WAV (work assistant vehicle). Also management was easy going but non the less was a bit unorganized. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management but, the people were very fun to be around."
good,"The organization did mergers very poorly."
good,DENTSPLY Sirona is a solid company with a good company culture. It is well run financially and has a good training program. I would recommend especially if you are looking to get a solid foundation early in your career.
good,"A very Interesting Company with many great associates and very unique processes throughout the plant.   A very wide range of products, formulations to production equipment for a lab based environment"
good,"Excelente cultura de trabajo, falta bajar un poco mas la cultura a los empleados de otros niveles, la cultura de la empresa se queda en el equipo de liderazgo."
good,"Typical work day no different from any other company. You learn something new if you go out and seek it - don't rely on management. Culture is old school European American, and management reflex this. It pays the bills."
good,"Good company to work for. The upper mgmt team is excellent, the supervisors, not so much. There is absolutely NO room for advancement here. Even the supervisors are hired from outside. We went through 4 the time I was there and all of them were hired from the outside."
good,Employee Benefits and Salary are good. In the comparison of other companies Jobs are secure over there but if we talk about work culture it is very poor there is no life balance.
good,"Working with invoices at office."
good,"Changes in job. No raise. Need a change"
good,"Uma excelente Multinacional, durante o tempo que trabalhei sempre honraram com tudo o que foi acordado, uma ótima estrutura de apoio e back office."
good,Empresa boa para se iniciar a carreira profissional porem não conta com uma politica de RH muito clara referente as remunerações e promoções.
good,A typical work day for me would be a ten hour day starting at 5 am and working a ten hour day or until quota is completed. I've to always stay positive no mater how hectic the work day can get and time management is very important.Working as a team also helps the day go by alot smoother. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with demands.The must enjoyable part is feeling accomplished at the end of the day.
good,"Making the job done well is the bottom line, at any cost. Constant vigilance required for each worker to promote oneself."
good,"Worked here and I was based in a province. Handles 7 cities in North Luzon. Working on a not familiar place is difficult. What I did is for a month, I try to familiarize the dental clinics, hospitals and universities that offer dentistry."
good,"Typical day at work: Productive workplace with good management. "
good,"As I said before, I had a good experience with them and would work for DS again in the future.  I coached, motivated, and was involved in hiring.  Great experience."
good,Learned a lot while I was there.  Company treated employees well and gave a lot of opportunity to learn.  Paid time off and holidays were generous.  Overall a good place to work.
good,"Company have one goal and one team to manage the all area smoothly, some time management are maintaining the ethics and organisation target.always management got changed due nonfunctional."
good,Pazartesi  toplantısı ile haftaya başlanır. Diğer günler pazarlama materyallerin planlanması ve hazırlanması.
good,The biggest downfall working at Dentsply was being a woman.  The women worked way harder then the man who wasn't in a supervisors position.  It could be a very fast environment which I loved.
good,Dedication and hard work will pay off when the opportunities present themselves. Company has great benefits and management has greatly improved over the years.
good,"This is a very fast paced with continuous growth company which is great however many times there is not enough resources to satisfy the growing pains so employees ( managers, supervisors and labor) get stretched way to often. They could do better on employee training.They have excellent benefits"
good,I was a temp employee in the tax department at Dentsply for a month but in my short time there I learned the culture was very welcoming and I had ample opportunity to learn about sales & use taxes.
good,"Boa infraestrura"
good,Great place to work. Productive. diff. cultures. Many summer bbq. allot of interaction with the customers. Every year there a National Sakes Meeting in a different State or province.
good,"Uma ótima empresa, mas eu gostaria de ter aproveitado melhor meu estágio sendo mais focada na  minha área, que é engenharia. Para que assim eu tivesse um maior aprendizado."
good,more patience and understanding that being late on occasion is out of our control at times especially with children. A grace period should be added. too much cattiness amongst co-workers and team leads. training is sparse AND RUSHED.
good,"Management works very hard operating many departments at a time."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of creating daily cycle count worksheets and processing corrected worksheets for posting.  "
good,"Stayed busy, Management and Co-workers were great to work with, friendly atmosphere."
good,"A lot of overnight travel.  Great training program and great people.  The product was okay did not enjoy the sell through of product through a distributor, less control over the sale."
good,Many professional growth opportunities due to business philosophies and good manufacturing practices.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all the administrative managements duties that I undertook with Dentsply Friadent. It valued the employees and had a great working atmosphere. the company was known was known as Friadent when I joined. The head office being in Germany, it was truly a globalized experience. I thoroughly enjoyed participating , planning, organizing, setting up and playing the lead role in managing our stalls in exhibitions and  holding symposiums and trainings for dentist from UAE, entire gulf region and even global participants."
good,This job was an internship with no pay or benefits. My co-workers were very pleasant. The administrator I was working under told me she was very happy with my work and wish she could hire me but the company had a hiring freeze on.
good,"A typical day at Dentsply/ Caulk is like another other job, it has its ups and downs. The best part is what i have taken away from this company. With trying to get involved in as much as i could i have learned much about the industry and how a large company like this operates. The most important things though was making myself a better person in the business world. Everything from working with management, co workers and teams to developing my own leadership and presentation skills. The only downside to our current devision is the management. Unfortunately they think they have all leaders moving their company forward; however, what they have is your basic managers that avoid handling conflicts all the way to micro managers breathing down your neck. While there are a few that are born leaders, the management group leaves much to be desired."
good,"Being there for 37 years, I have been through alot of changes. I have learned how to work with all types of personalities, to multi-task, work with different departments, learn computer programs and general office work. I have had customer service experience and can follow through with any problems. The people I worked with were great. I have made lifelong friends.For me the hardest part of this job was when things got slow. I would find myself being more productive and take the opportunity to create backups for most of my work. I don't like to be idle. The best part of the job was knowing that I was going to see my ""2nd Family"" every day."
good,Etre habitué aux changements et indispensable pour travailler chez Dentsply
good,"Debía hacer rutas, entregando pedidos, depositar dinero o cheques en bancos entre otras, buena empresa con buen equipo de trabajo. Conocí más lugares y me ubique mucho mejor dentro de Santiago."
good,"- Komissionieren"
good,Since the merger the environment of the management and the style of management has changed. No employee loyalty and they would rather higher externally than promote internal growth.
good,I'm looking to make a change in careers.  I am willing to relocate to Florida if it's the right fit for both.  I'm a hard worker and love to set goals and achieve my goals!
good,"Es una empresa muy buena,  muy flexible con los horarios,  había café, té para el personal, los compañeros de trabajo la mayoría eran jóvenes por lo que hacían el trabajo bien y rápido, eran muy productivos y cualquier duda siempre estaban a la disposición."
good,"Overall, its a pleasant place to go to work. Only issue is company is always looking for ways to cut the cost leading to no job security. There is a lot of flexibility depending upon the department manager."
good,Tulsa Dental was a big company to work for but with a small company feel. I really got great dental training with this company. They really cared about their employees.
good,"Many are happy here. More are not. The managers/leaders are toxic, and they have promoted some really toxic people. It's too bad, because they keep losing the best performers for just this reason. Be careful. Also, forget about advancement. They lie about that, too."
good,"Visitação e acompanhamento a clientes, informação, assistência e vendas."
good,"Úma empresa de tradição e qualidade em seus produtos, na qual aprendi a trabalhar em equipe e priorizar sempre o bom senso e qualidade.A parte em que se tiamos dificuldades era chegar ate a gerencia para dar ideias e ate esclarecer alguma dúvida, mais não era impossivel mais sim díficil, quanto ao ambiente de trabalho agrádavel, havia pessoas sempre dispostas a ajudar, e foi uma boa empresa para minha formação profissional e pessoal."
good,Leading dental manufacturer and distributor with slightly above average market shares.
good,"Densply Sirona is not a bad place to work. It's easy work, you don't get dirty, and it's not a stressful job. My Major complaint is the fact that they don't pay enough. Some of the Unit leads do have picks and show favoritism, and for that reason they should not be in this position. You shouldn't hear your private comments out on the work floor when you made them quietly to your boss."
good,"Very detailed background checks, over all a good place to work, climate controlled, clean, relaxed environment, team oriented, good benefits, full time employees start off with 2 weeks vacation of scheduled leave & 1 week of un-scheduled leave."
good,Dentsply Sirona was decent. The days were busy and fast paced. I loved the hours and pace of the job. Very flexible with schedules and hours for employees. The job had advancement opportunities and management was very kind.
good,If you are a true salesman you will be fine working here. Top dogs get all the attention from the team leads. You can pretty much get away with anything if you are a top salesman.
good,"Co-Workers and Team leads, were great to work with. Company closed location on Long Island and will Keep Sarasota, FL office and main location. Customer Service department was great department."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my tenure at DENTSPLY.  My career knowledge in finance has continued to grow and my history has aided me in excelling at my job.
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, sintia me parte da equipe todos os dias, foi uma pena que a unidade de Petrópolis foi encerrada."
good,"Good company, but executives lacked the necessary understanding of international subsidiaries, peculiarities and needs. Very financially oriented. Results viewed by quarter and not long term."
good,Experience was great. I was able to do many different jobs to get a feel of how the company was ran and what was expected of you. What I learned there was invaluabe information of documentation procedures.
good,Dentsply Sirona is a leader in all dental products they sell.  Quality products and people make for a great experience.  The dental industry always looks to Dentsply for products and services
good,This job provided travel & good experience for me & how to start a business.  I learned a lot of skills that I used later on in my future jobs.
good,They allow me to work independently and they don't micro manage the employees.  They have a lax atmosphere to work in.  They make you feel that you contribute to viability of the company.
good,"in dentsply i got nice working environment. supportive seniors. got good salary and nice sales team nice product training."
good,Opportunity to resolve production issues with manufacturing line relocation. We used process management tools to impact production budget.
good,great company good work environment …. Management gave opportunities to advance based upon work effort and knowledge. Over all a great place to work .
good,"Hab dort kurzfristig in der Abfüllung gearbeitet und war sehr zufrieden. Mann hat seine Ruhe und alle Zeit der Welt. Wenn mal was daneben geht reisst dir niemand den Kopf ab."
good,"I had a fairly good experience there. I loved who I worked with, but I was also aware that it was very cutthroat and stressfully competitive in some places within the company. I think that if you pay attention to your peers intentions and just do your job, you'll be fine"
good,I've been with the company for over 10 years and the people are always pleasant to work with. I stared at an entry level management position  and moved up.
good,thirteen years here. Really very little complaints. Have worked in three divisions. Survived three mergers. Have had six direct mangers. Had the opportunity to sell a large bag.
good,"Career with Dentsply prior to merger may be somewhat different since, always demanding and challenging, most associates unhappy and culture of high turnover with exception of few long term associates."
good,"Trabalho na empresa DENTSPLY no setor de Almoxarifado, recebendo a cada dia mais experiência e aprendizado. A empresa proporciona um bom relacionamento interpessoal, o trabalho em equipe.."
good,"Um excelente local de trabalho, com pessoas que tinham muito o que acrescentar. Empresa grande, distribuída pelo Brasil, mas que tinha uma enorme vontade de sempre manter todos juntos."
good,"There is little turnover so it makes it harder to move up in this company.  With this being said, I want to advance my career further than what I am able to at this time."
good,Ten of us were hired to reverse the decrease in sales.  Through product development we added two new products but was not enough to turn around the declining sales.  Hence the mother corporation decided to downsize GAC and combine  with another DENTSPLY division.
good,"Bonne ambiance dans l'atelier "
good,"In this role, the representative calls on local dentists and endodontists instructing them on new technology and current theory and techniques associated with root canal therapy while promoting product solutions."
good,"14 years there, must have been doing something right. Monday through Thursday schedule with any overtime done on Friday and an occasional Saturday. Input valued by various departments."
good,Very fun and exciting. And to know that what I was helping produce material that will be used for dentist to use on patients. Management was awesome. Serious about becoming and global business and made all the employees that I know of feel important and know their job.
good,"My typical day includes setting appointments, doing demonstrations, and training with general dentists and specialists. I am responsible for selling our new root canal therapy technology and techniques to all general dentists and specialists. "
good,"A typical day for me would involve writing/reviewing standard testing method validations (TMVs) in accordance with ISO 13485 guidelines, initiating/investigating non-conforming material reports (NCMRs) and CA/PAs,  writing and reviewing standard operating procedures and standard testing methods.  I would perform a technical review of testing paperwork generated within the quality analytical laboratory.  I would prepare internal and external auditing paperwork as well as review device history records.  I enjoyed the friendships that I made at work.  The small amount of employees within the company made it easy to develop a family environment."
good,I worked on four machines. I made sure they ran efficiently. Inspected root canal parts to make sure specifications were correct.
good,"Very Stable company to work for, here I learned everything about the sales process and I have certainly grown as a manager and a professional overall. Company has good values. Excellent co-workers and work atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is not being able to advance to a more senior position with more pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is able to finish the assigned projects and most of all the sales process. Being able to help doctors to grow their practice providing them with solutions and the right equipment to do so, and closing the sale!"
good,"Firm ,but fair place to work. The 2nd shift leaves very little time for family life (11:30 a.m.-8:00 p.m.),but it's the job i have to do.overall good attitudes throughout and decent benefits."
good,"There is no typical day in what I do, everyday brings new challenges and surprises. I am glad I have the opportunity to be a part of the team. My immediate managers were great, whatever you wanted to learn, they never turned thier back on you, always willing to teach."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the employees as well as was able to work with the HRIS systems. I was a champion for the employees and made a difference as part of the DENTSPLY HR Team.
good,I loved working at Dentsply Sirona it was a very family oriented work place if you needed off for an appointment or family emergency they were very good about letting you off they even would allow you to make up your time if needed. the people I worked with always made you feel welcomed and part of a great team to work for from day one.
good,"a lot of changes in culture in front of it, as the merger comes together"
good,"Worked 6, 8 hour days/ nights. I worked 3rd shift, Sunday night through Friday night. The best part about working at DENTSPLY was the fact that they offered excellent benefits and the family oriented atmosphere. The hardest part was that we worked a lot of hours, which is a plus as well."
good,Overall it is a great place to work with great co-workers and good management team. Safety and work excellence is critical in all departments across the many divisions that make up DENTSPLY.
good,"An alright place to work for. Just like any other job you determine your success in the company. Easy for most,and harder for others. Mostly sitting down."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed all the people I worked with, and was always treated with respect, and I was fairly compensated for the work I did. The family atmosphere is eroding because of merging with other companies, however."
good,"Lots of teamwork. Very fast paced. Constantly running machinery, packaging, Making sure everything was correct or corrected. Was difficult in some areas but with enough training it gets better."
good,It was start of my career. work culture was good . had a great time to work in Dentsply. It was my first work experience and that for a multinational company. I learnt a lot there.
good,There were a lot of trade offs here. The management team for inside sales leaves a lot to be desired. There is a lot of calling in the job but I like to talk so I enjoyed that part.
good,"good place to work, the co-workers are nice and like to help each other. positive environment and the management are very friendly. i would refer it to anybody"
good,"Various activities in this job."

good,"American chemistry company with very good culture, 60 years in Brazil with 2 big factories. HQ IT personnel with great technical skills.
