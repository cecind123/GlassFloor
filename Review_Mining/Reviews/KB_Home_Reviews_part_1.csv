rating,review
bad,"KB isn't a good place to work. They inflate your earning potential. You have very little choice as to which community you work in. If you are in a poor performing community, you don't make enough money.  The management teams are horrible. They encourage you to report unethical practices, but when you do, you are told to mind your own business. The turnover rate for employees is huge. New hires are constantly coming in and the old hires are constantly leaving. I didn't meet one other employee that was happy at KB.  They staff too many sales people in each community."
bad,"Micromanaged"
bad,Not such a good company to work for unless management has changed significantly and the people at the top have begun to care more about their employees. Blame the victim mentality to protect their friends and keep their friends in their positions when they should be fired for being horrible people and bad at their jobs. Very political and internal workers are passive aggressive and at times unprofessional - they get nasty for no reason.
bad,Awful Company to work for.   Management is terrible.  RUN!  Would not recommend anyone to work for KB Home.  You would be in for a world of hurt if you did.
bad,Low quality work conditions and pay structures leave more to be desired
bad,"you work hard for sales and get no support from management, management makes decisions on personel feelings and not business related issues ."
bad,There are double standards for the organization.  Senior employees have low expectations all is pushed down to new employees.  Very petty and a lot of politics.  Poor working culture and relationships.  Small cubicles and very little camaraderie.
bad,"This is the shadiest company I have ever worked for.!!  Management wants only 1 thing> SALES.  They do not care if the home is right for the customer they just want the contract signed. I was told more than once ""Just get the check, tell the customer you will hold onto the check but enter the sale in the computer and submit the check anyway""  Disgusting way of doing business.  "
bad,"Hands down, the worse company I have ever worked for. Considering they have filtered through 30+ sales people in less than a year and cannot get qualified people now to work for them because of their horrific reputation in thge Austin area. They have a culture of encouraging lying, misrepresenting and falsify information to Corporate/Stock Holders to look like sales are better than what they are. They continually are being investigated by HR for stereotyping/racial comments in meetings. Senior management gossips about other co-workers continually. They prolong commission payments so that you remain in draw. Non rewarding, harsh environment. Classless group of people."
bad,"This is the worst company to work for. The company's 1st priority is the bottom line. The management makes no effort to retain quality employees, so people are leaving. No career advancement path is provided. Extremely heavy workload but management do not provide adequate resources, so there is a massive exit. Bad company culture."
bad,"mediocre and disappointing, unprofessional and mean-spirited"
bad,"This company is all about who you know. You can lie, cheat, and steal from the company and get away with it if your friends with the right people. They do not value honesty and integrity, much less people who work hard. Don’t expect to feel any value from management because they are too self absorbed to realize who quality employees are. And they are too big headed to put effort into creating more leaders for tomorrow. Wouldn’t recommend this company for anyone unless you are desperate for a stepping stone that will look ok on a resume. This starts from the top down. Employees are a reflection of their leaders. I quit To avoid being associated with their unethical standards, politics, and negative work culture."
bad,"I found I was being set-up to fail. Too much dishonesty, fabricating of numbers; and overall false impressions to homebuyers."
bad,"Upper management changed a couple of years ago. The new President and sales director came from from a completely different market (Orlando) so they did not understand Tampa or what we need to succeed on-site.  I was placed in community after community that was over priced, no traffic and with 3 sales counselors .  Over the past 2 years the Opportunities were provided only to “the boys” and the sales force was left with only 1 woman in the Tampa Bay Area when I left in the fall."
bad,Management uses job security pressure against its sales team members and uses same hard pressure towards customers. Did not own up to mistakes made that customers have to live with. Will place sales members at under performing communities as punishment.
bad,This company has a high turnover rate due to poor management.
bad,The company says that the sales counselors have full controle when in the field. They don't. They micro manage and their is zero work life balance. They play favorites and hold grudges.
bad,"KB corporate policy for even flow on construction of homes was not followed. Created log jamb of homes under construction and forced unrealistic procedures to correct situation. Unfortunately managements push created poor quality construction that superintendents had to present to buyers, and then maintain ongoing customer care."
bad,Company left South Carolina when the housing bust occurred in 2007 and 2008.  Company did not do a good job of managing this territory and consequently left because of this.
bad,The Tampa Division of KB Home is very mismanaged. They don't have automation that is critical to todays building practices. Scheduling software is a must. They don't have even flow production and created many bottle necks which sacrificed cycle time and vendors ability to schedule work effectively. They haven't hit production goals since re-opening the division in 2012. They don't see individual employee contributions.
bad,Good training.  Nice communities. management is not helpful. You will make many errors on the job and that is the only way you learn.
bad,"Lack of communication and organization, management does not listen or take in to consideration employees, you get promoted by who you know not what you know"
bad,"When I worked there, it was in the final years of the homebuilding boom of the last decade, so I don't feel it applies any more. At that time nobody really had a great handle what to do and how to keep up, so basically it was anything goes. KB is a good company at it's core and has great training and principles. It's just at the time I worked there, local management lost track of that (which is why they are no longer there)."
bad,The best part of my job is helping buyers make their selections and when I am actually performing my daily tasks and the job itself.  The ever changing policies and procedures on how to properly do our job is frustrating.  There are too many upper management types and not enough lower level associates that actually meet with the buyers.
bad,The company does not create enough business to meet the sales goals set for the Sales Agents. 90% of my business with the company was all self generated from my personal book of business.
bad,"Stressful environment with little loyalty"
good,"Being a yes man, lying and promising more that reality can achieve and blaming you for not achieving it, is how management runs the group.  Throwing your team under the bus, may make you look great, but you won't get you team to anything more."
good,"Sales people do not matter to management. If you have one bad month because you are in a closeout community, you get a target on your back and they force you out. You then lose all of your backlog.  Every thing is the sales person's fault because everyone else walks on water. Stay clear."
good,I worked for KB long ago before their name change. The boss there was difficult to work with. She didn't lay out expectations and KB had some challenging policies to deal with.
good,For the most part nice people to work with but management expects you to do far beyond your job description with little opportunity for advancement. It’s a do more with less environment. Lots of turnover.
good,"Work days varied, which was good. I focused heavily on analysis of market. Great co-workers and managers (for the most part). Enjoyed freedom to be pro-active and the fact that I wasn't micromanaged. However, the company is public and only cares about the bottom line."
good,"Very receptive to new ideas , very supportive.  Loved training provided.  Very fun people there.  I liked that they trusted the ideas of the sales counselor.  Always implement ed ideas.  And marketing was fantastic"
good,"The co-workers and local management were fun to work with. Management fed us well and provided team games to increase team camaraderie.  I did learn alot.  However, this is an extremely micro-managed company. We had difficulty keeping  builders and consequently closing on time.  You only have 3 paid holidays so very little time off."
good,"I was a temp for this company as an inside sales person or their new ""home buyers club"". What I interviewed for, was not the position they were really hiring for. I love the work and the people were largely very nice and professional. They really did SEEM to want to welcome you in and make you feel a part of their family. My immediate supervisor knew of some family challenges I was facing and needed to work close to home. It was great that they were willing to work with me. Some of my accomplishments weren't really acknowledged and I questioned whether it was being shared with the hiring managers. I was heart broken when the position didn't continue and I was told on the Friday before Thanksgiving the position ended with no warning or anythingat 7:15pm.Too late to find another position and apparently they all knew it was ending but me. I would've thought my 8 + sales in 4 weeks would've really showed a dedication to the job. Guess not. I got very little feed back from anyone. So still not sure if it was a personality thing or what. The toughest thing is not knowing and having to get back up and try to show what a great candidate you are for other positions when you have no answers. :("
good,I worked for KB HOME between 2007 and 2008 having initially started there as a temp and eventually being hired on due to my merit and hard work. The division I worked for (KB URBAN) was a great place to work however there were a lot of challenges to our division due to changes with the executive management. These changes led to a lot of uncertainty and several of our good managers leaving. We got hit really hard by the economic downturn in the real estate market and the division was eventually dissolved. Overall the positions were well-paying.
good,"Liked working for KB until there was not anywhere for me to sell, development came to an end and new opportunity for development months away.  Was often hard to make commission, no houses or lots to sell."
good,"Multiple management with different agendas. Not enough training "
good,"Team oriented, lots of work to do, never a dull moment.  Work life balance.  Manager was a little off but fun to be around.  Everyone has their job..."
good,to much to get done in one day. superintendents need more assistance. theres a lot of work put on the superintendent. I don't know what else to say.
good,"Productive & busy environment, long hours, great co-workers, coding & billing daily."
good,"KB Home is a good place to work, however, some elements of the culture can be greatly improved and the quality of the construction is below standard in many communities. Sales team works all but 2 annual holidays and work/life balance is lacking."
good,"It's an average sales job, with better than average training. Like all jobs though, if you aren't a favorite of the management you get the least desirable communities and don't have anyway of protecting yourself if anything goes wrong."
good,Good company but they worry too much about meeting quotas for their share holders instead of taking care of the employees.  The management does not support the employees the way they should
good,A production builder with a culture of get it done faster. Generally worked with people who had little or no construction skills at both the upper management and counter part level. Quality in workmanship was less important than getting it done faster and faster. Primarily built for investors at the peak of the construction boom. The majority of whom lost their investment in foreclosures.
good,"KB Home is my first place to work that is purely commission. I did great in sales and earned a high commission each month. That I find that there is a hug trade off in time. To earn that high paycheck you have to sacrifice your time...with family, friends and no holidays."
good,A great company that develops energy efficient new homes to buyers making their new homebuying experience exceptional. Present detailed information regarding the community and the floor plans available.
good,Productive and challenging work environment.  Great group of co-workers - fun and friendly environment.  Nice employee appreciation events and recognition.
good,"I have really enjoyed the opportunity KB home has given me in New Home sales.  I had no experience, they provided all the training needed to be successful."
good,"As a new home sales representative, I was responsible for helping determine if an individual or family was able to buy a home from establishing buying power, assisting in the construction specifications and details, overseeing the building alongside project management, and updating the customer of all facets along the way over a six-twelve month contract duration ensuring a closing."
good,"Great company to grow and learn from . However, poor management and leadership .Good benefits and culture. Very little  to none growth ability within the design field."
good,"We have good benefits, good pay, and a diverse work staff with managers of color.  Every quarter, however, we seem to be in the hot seat.  Hard work and long hours are frequently required.  All and all, its not a bad job at all and I'm grateful to have it.  Working at KB Home is a positive experience."
good,Enjoyed very much what I did at this company.  I am very people oriented and this job allowed me the opportunity to use these skills.  Very hard work but very rewarding.  Only down side was there was not a lot of work life balance.
good,"greet customers, answering phones, delivering inner office mail, setting appointments."
good,Overall good company. Some department managers not as cooperative or receptive as others but with time were slowly replaced. Okay with homeowners. Difficult to advance. Worrisome job security as jobs fluctuate with housing market.
good,"Crazy place to work, but had a great time. Management never failed to step in when needed. Other superintendents wouldn't hesitate to lend a hand either. CSR/Office staff were wonderful. The pay was just not enough for the stress."
good,"Typical workdays started with daily meeting with management and entire sales staff via conference call before opening the model home.  This is the time to update any new sales and go over current sales, construction and loan status and any customer concerns or questions."
good,"Leadership was very collaborative and encouraged a sense of teamwork across all departments.  As long as the economy is growing, this is a great company to work for."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the new potential buyers I met.  We worked hard and played hard.  I made a great, doing what I loved to do...selling."
good,"Develop land holdings from grading through Bond release. Completed 750 lots over 2.5 Year, including SWPP and OSHA compliance. Re-certified all pads on all projects and maintained LVVWD  water mitigation requirements."
good,Meet new people. Everyday is different. Hardest part of the job is all the stress. Rewarding to see people start their life in a new home. You get to be a part of peoples milestones.
good,"As a member of the KB Home team, I was able to learn and work with different departments to increase my knowledge base."
good,"Great place to work with fun new faces everyday excited about building a home."
good,KB Home has a great management team that looks to develop employees. They have a great commission and benefit package. Employees are valued and on-going training is encouraged and part of their culture.

good,"This job was a lot of fun helping new owners to close on there new home. I will arrive to work by 6:30am to set-up my calendar for home walks and customer appointments 3, 6, and 11 month service.

good,I learned a majority of microsoft office with my workload at this company.  The staff was organized and friendly.  Management was great to work with and maintained a high level of professionalism.
good,"Terrific company to work for or buy from. The training was amazing... they have a great way of walking the sales room following the story board on the walls to introduce a prospect to KB. The coaches were awesome... the broker was someone you wanted to succeed for. All in all it was an experience I am grateful for. Had the market not crashed so severely when lending practices changed, I would still be there... but a girls gotta eat and pay her bills."
good,Company was well ran and a great place to work. Everyone was very open and friendly to each other. Great summer internship for me.
good,"great stress free environment  working with professionals with the same goals I was fortunate to work with such a great team"

good,KB really values its employees with generous salaries and benefits.
good,I really enjoyed working here for 12 years. There's a lot of great people and fun place to work. Benefits are great.
good,It really depends on which department you want to work in and making sure that it fits the persons skill-set. It can be an great fit if the person is equally selective about the requirements and expectations.
good,Everyday was different...
good,"I have always wanted to work for a New Home Builder. I have learned a lot in the year and a half that I've been there. Great company, great management, and okay co-workers. The only thing I really do not enjoy is my compensation. I work super hard and I have made the company a very good profit, but I think I should be compensated what I'm really worth."
good,consisted of heavy call volume with upset homeowners. Coordinated warranty claims to customer service reps on the field
good,"There is no typical day at KB Home, which made work enjoyable.  Building homes for peoples' lives was great fulfillment. Always busy, but then we would stop and just have some laughs to equal out the stress of our jobs."

good,"A typical day was a very long day. Lots of follow up calls, lots of documentation on how your getting the next sale. Management team always providing new Promotional Incentives to drive traffic into the communities. Best part of the job is when you have a co-worker / partner to manage the community. To work together on the sales and communication. To build trust."
good,"A typical day at work at KB homes was always different. Either do trim outs, Punch work or customers services. Most of the supervisors are very nice and easy to work with. Twice a year they would hold bass competition, that way everyone could get together at a fun place. The hardest part of the job I would say would be breaking in a new supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job would be doing a different job everyday and not being monotonous."
good,"One of the best companies that I have ever worked for. I was able to grow and excel in what I love to do, which is assist customers with achieving the american dream of homeownership."
good,I loved working for this company. I had the Chance to meet a lot of great people and learn a lot of new things about construction. I learned something new every day that I was able to apply on a daily basis and help Homeowners educate themselves on their home and how it was built.
good,I understand why it has been the winner of the best company to work for in the world.
good,"I love KB Home! They gave a an incredible  opportunity to not only grow as a professional sales rep, but as a person. I made good money in some of the communities they had put me in, and I learned a lot about Home Building, Sales, and Realestate. But most importantly, they always made me feel supported in my sales journey! The only draw back for me, is the work life balance.."

good,"Great environment, dealing with prospective buyers all day & calling leads, you are your own boss here!"
good,Management is awesome. Culture is awesome. If you are good at your job the pay can be unreal. Only downside is if you get a high priced community or delayed grand opening.
good,KB Home is a nice place to work.  My manager was helpful as I was temping there and the office was professional.  Training was a bit strained because the person I was covering for was leaving on vacation out of the country and our time was limited.  I would work there again.
good,I only left due to my husband accepting a job in Phoenix.  Houston is an incredible division.  The team there has a high level of integrity and was one that I did not want to leave.
good,good team environment culture is changing for the better continue to improve products and value engineering at its finest always looking for improvement
good,"The only problem with KB Home was the instability of the job. Because it is a construction / housing market industry, you had to watch a lot of good people lose their jobs when the division closed."

KB home also is very active on becoming more energy efficient and helping the environment and leading the building industry.

good,Great opportunity to build a clientele.  A great experience for real estate sales and customer service.
good,"The KB Home environment was very exciting and challenging."

good,"I loved working for KB Home. Lots of room for advancement, continuous KB education, amazing benefits and great people to work for and with.  KB really cares about their employees. "
good,"Working in the KB Home Studio is a professional environement, extensive sales experience are required. My co-workers were amazing, there were roughly 12 designers that I worked with, one audited our paperwork and 1 studio manager. The hardest part about this job is your inabilitly to walk job sites to ensure designs and options are properly installed. The KB Home culture is by far one of the best I have ever worked for. When I started with KB I was fairly young and unfortunately did not realize that they were not the norm."
good,"KB Home is a great company to work for, they supply all the tools you need to perform your job and meet your set goals. Management and the entire leadership team are a pleasure to work with."
