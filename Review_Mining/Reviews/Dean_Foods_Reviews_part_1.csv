bad,"not A great place to work. Body gets abused long hours and you are only a number to management . Do yourself a favor and stay away. Very long hours and bad benefits, lying management  and very understaffed"
bad,Leadership team filled with very poor managers who had no respect for other employees. communication from leadership to management team on key business initiatives and direction was horrible. the worst company i have ever worked for
bad,"Run don’t walk far far away from this place.  They work you to death, then demand more.  Management sucks!   No team work!  Drivers get abused!   They don’t follow DOT regulations, unless they know someone is watching"
bad,Very negative working environment.  Management cannot make a consistent decision regarding how to handle customer service.  Work balance is unfairly distributed and managers have favorite employees.
bad,Not much to say it was stressful do not apply here it was a bad idea for me to do so here in Baton Rouge Louisiana horriable horriable  horriable horriable.
bad,"Management in the Boise office sucked! Always  wa ting more, wouldn't listen to any issues.. never had a manager not work with drivers to make a better environment at the work place"
bad,"You may want to get everything in writing that they promise you.  One day off per week Sunday.  Work Holidays, Management could care less about you, They do not appreciate the work you do for them."
bad,Not a good place to work . It’s all about milk don’t let you take off . Get wrote about any little thing .  Management Is very poor . Just always  on the line
bad,"Awful managers, even worse corporate management and a company that is driving them self out of business with unrealistic ideas of drop shipments, web orders, and edi distribution. Milk is not a dead horse, but is certainly becoming one due to inexperienced executives changing what worked. The sacrifice made by honest hard working blue collar laborers to be stabbed in the back by dean foods."
bad,I was working for deans foods Orange City for a year and a half its Very racist in that Plant its Black n White not one color your treated as a slave.
bad,"Managers ""never"" answer the phone! They don't want to listen to what drivers have to say. They have ""split"" days off. This way they force you to work 2 ""16"" hour days in 7 days! You never have enough time out off the job. You are tired all the time. Trailer floors have old stinky milk all over and smells! You clock out and 10 hours later ""on the nose"" you will be back at work!"
bad,Good ole boy managers. They've been there so long that they are stuck in time. Unsafe environment. No training at all. You work like a mule until you get hurt or quit. HR is incompetent. Run by a wanna be college dropout.
bad,"The place is run down and disgusting for a food plant. To advance your career you have to wait for someone to die or retire. Management makes many poor decisions and lie to the employees a lot. Always count the hours on your check they are fond of paying you lesser rates or for less hours than you were there. They have too many people with vacation time and not enough people to cover it. The equipment needs to be repaired or replaced but that is never a priority. The majority of management does not have basic computer skills. They need to ask how to respond to e-mails, they don't know about spell check, none of them know how to use excel despite most of the company running off of excel sheets. The whole place is a mess, do not expect raises, bonuses or promotions. Everybody tries to screw over everyone else and the Union just makes everything worse. They have lots of benefits for non union employees but they are just terrible it costs more to have their health insurance then it does to just pay for everything yourself."
bad,"Work hrs are constantly being changed without notice, recently work hours went from 8 hours daily to 12!  Company incentives have been taken away from some departments, but the company continues to offer incentives for other departments. Increase job production without the equipment or manpower to complete the job safely or on time!"
bad,Poor management bad company going  work in the middle of the night stay away will fire you for anything poor equipment dirty trucks no weekend's off. Don't do it you will be sorry.
bad,Poorly managed and unorganized. They want to put a bandaid on almost everything I’m a diesel mechanic for the company and they don’t keep parts stocked. Everyday is a fire drill 2 mechanics on over 100 pieces of equipment. On call every other week. Union is useless. Days are unpredictable and your day is not scheduled they always keep you past the time you are supposed to leave. Upper management is aware of these issues but don’t do anything about it. They say you will get formal training and don’t do it they just throw you in and expect to you to do things their way and if you don’t you get yelled at.
bad,Management forsake quality for production numbers. Standard procedures are not followed. The rules change depending on egos and attitudes.I could go on......
bad,"Did not receive promised compensation or bonuses. Stressful work environment, little to no teamwork. Poorly maintained machines expected to run at maximum speeds making jobs more stressful and less productive creating a hostile work environment."
bad,"Good luck to anyone who hires on as a mechanic. Management has zero knowledge into the actual work. Before leaving , I worked with one of the managers doing a fleet 'blitz' inspection as they call it. I had to show the manager how to do a very simple task of changing out a type 20 front brake chamber . Managers in these type positions need to have basic knowledge of truck maintenance/repairs and they simply DONT. If hired you will not be doing mechanic work. They farm most of the work out . You will watch the vendors they farm out the work to make the money. It is a terrible thing watching vendors do the work you were hired to do. Drivers constantly complaining. Such a disconnect at this place because as long as managers are 'reading' reports, emailing constantly, taking phone calls, its all they care about."
bad,"start day is load own truck delivery route normally 12 hr route put in order for following day get back unload truck only the bosses friends"
bad,"Worst place I ever worked to much favoritism if you wasn't friends with the BOSS you got the worst job possible,after years of working there the only ones to get anywhere was the bosses buddies"
bad,"Was promised X amount per hour, I started at 80%. Was told I could take a few tests to get more money, sounds good. It's more like 50 tests with practical hours, some of which ""have never been completed so we're not equipped to administer those tests"" so I can't get all the raises. The shifts are up for grabs every week so there's no set schedule. Worked for a few months, never received my safety orientation or any other training. No accountability. Almost once a week, someone was injured. I was fortunate that my old job took me back."
bad,OT galore. Decent yearly pay. No appreciation. No spare parts. All the experienced people have quit. No communication. You are just a replaceable machine at Dean - Lynn MA.
bad,They do not value punctuality or respect. Show up late to your interview and you'll probably get the job. Awful management.
bad,worst place stay away! Over worked seniority means nothing  Your just a number They change your hours and put you at the bottom of the latter was family owned they cared at one time until they sold out to corporate they have a point system they give like candy you better not make much money or there get gone
bad,Management has no clue and has accumulated a ton of stock options. CEO voted worst CEO of the year (no surprise there) and he's leaving the company - - what does that tell you - even the GC has left . . . . .
bad,Managment has set un realistic goals and is constantly intimidating you with termination. Everyone and everything is micro-managed
bad,"The management does not have a clue, all they are worried about is harrassing employees, and continuously having you violate state anf federal laws. I would recommend you working at McDonalds before working at this place !!! Pay is good if you work 60 hrs a week, but your harrassment and stress levels are through the roof !!"
bad,"It was at one time a great place to work...until current mgmt took over..Yhey are so disconnected from the  employees it is sad..Got no support from supervisors, trucks stay broken down more than they run and you feel like youre being  watched  all the time..I was let go due to so called policy violation but in actuality  it was because of  age and health status..They hide behind their policies and care nothing about people..It is no wonder people are being laid off...i for one am glad im out of tbere and would not recommend Braselton as a great place to work."
bad,"Good paying job, however hours are horrible you never know what time you're getting off of work. Management is clueless they blame employees for everything that goes wrong. Outdated machinery from 1970's. Equipment is always breaking down, gauges don't work, dirty work environment, management is unprofessional"
bad,Since Christmas 2016 the plant is getting worse! They changed plant manager and production manager and it's got worse. At least we felt like those two cared were trying and were intelligent...the morons now don't have a clue! Bad management team now (QA manager is like a hormonal teenaged girl ...whacko) HR Manager is literally the dumbest individual I've met in my life! Supervisors are good but managers are ridiculous!!!
bad,"I was employed with the company for 7+ years in that time I was isolated, berated, degraded, in a vile culture that seems to be supported from the top of the management chain. So much so that no one even HR can or will do anything to support or assist employees in dealing with harassment issues"
bad,"A lot overtime thrown on you without much early notice. They cut positions from the QA department but still expect the same amount of work done. In fact, more and more responsibilities are being added to the QA department every week. It's hard to go a day without going crazy going back and forth throughout the lab trying to do everything. Poor management decisions results in missing ingredients or supplies leading to lost time and money. Workplace motivation and morale is always low and the company is treading water."
bad,"Current employee (reiter dairy): 20yrs. DELIVERY DRVER/ WAREHOUSE LOADER. If you are single and no immediate family and just want to make money, this is the place to be. You will earn every penny and benefit.  Do not trust anyone, everyone there are only out for themselves. Average day as driver are 12 plus hours a day. Only drive average of 2 to 3 hours a day, you bust it the rest of the time. Big brother's constantly watching and will be used against you. Do not believe anything management says, if they are talking, their lying. New hires will be going to the hood to work 90% of the time. So do not think this is going to be easy. If I had to do over I would have figured another way to make a living. In the game to long. If you take this job, plan for an end game. Make some money, save some and run. There are better places to work."
bad,Management are liars from the top of the bods to the non actung Supervisor will do things then blame it on the employee will ask you to do something then say they did not
bad,My advice is to stay as far away from Dean Foods-Reiter Dairy as you possibly can. This place is the most toxic place I have ever been apart of. The upper management does absolutely nothing. If you need something they do not respond to e-mails or phone calls. They have run the great lakes region into the ground. There is extra marital affairs going on that everybody knows about that affects daily operations. Women in upper management come to work in mini skirts that barely cover themselves up. Whenever you would have an idea they would laugh at it. The upper management lets people go due to a budget cut via a phone call than in person. I believe that is a gutless move and shows no appreciation or class. I guess I have the last laugh now as the Great Lakes Region is a sinking ship.
bad,"The building is falling completely apart and is dangerous..you are at risk to be shocked working in certain areas where if it's raining or snowing the ceiling leaks profusely..who ever heard of having at least 5 buckets INSIDE an office!! At risk for electrical shock..already fried several electrical outlets..oh and they have tires in the back of the building where the Garage is holding a tarp down so the ceiling doesn't leak..in the winter the steps are straight ice..they never, ever clean a very important filter in the sanitation room so the milk/orange juice is at risk for extreme contamination..and management lies also..they say they care about you and your family but don't take off 4 days in a row if your child almost dies and is in intensive care for 7 days cause DEANS foods does not care about you or yours..they say you are fine with staying w your child in the hospital but then turns around and fires you!! Good luck finding a replacement As*holes!! See how long someone will work with and put up with your 3rd shift supervisor..worst work environment ever!! Even though the pay was great I'm Glad I'm outta there..no one should dread going to work daily!! #F-DeansFoods#Thankyouforvacationthissummer!!"
bad,"Someone must have done some serious psychological testing to assemble such an inept and utterly useless management team.  Company actually hates their employees.  New hires make $2-3/hr less than older employees since the company has two pay scales.  90 days to start receiving benefits including Holiday and funeral pay.  Little if any training, train yourself on the job.  Many of the management team were fired from other jobs as management.  that alone should tell you something."
bad,"Long hours, 6 days a week. Always going, time is money. out there by yourself with no support if something happens. Customers in Milwaukee could care less about you."
bad,They are very unorganized.  You rarely know what you're doing from week to week. Equipment is broken down alot.  Company doesn't work as a team. Everyone for themselves.  You have a camera watching you all the time.  They want your hands on the wheel the whole time your driving.  No drinks no food no hands free devices.  Work every weekend and holiday. Company can't keep anyone.... drivers are leaving for the first job they can find.
bad,this company is so in the dark about what goes on dock guys do drugs and drink on the job and steel stuff out of the trucks use to have good people working there on the dock but management ran them all out. They ran out two good hard workers on the dock that were honest and hard workers one left in july and the other in november 2017 never had a problem with my truck until they put a guy from night shift on days. i would hope they would try there best to get those two back.
bad,"Management are jerkers.deans food needs to go out of business.so someone who cares can buy it and run it right."
bad,The job didn't pay very well for the distance I had to drive Monday through Friday and I felt like it was a was of time. The people I worked with though were all nice and helpful
bad,Horrible upper management. No opportunity to advance unless it is good for them. A very uncomfortable situation daily. Upper management micro manages.
bad,"It's all about them any sickness, death  anything family oriented it's not the place to be half people divorced and lost so many accounts the pay not worth the headache life after leaving this place has been amazing"
bad,"They expect you to drive over the legal hours.  It is not a good place to work and management is not good.  The trucks were constantly unorganized with older milk behind newer milk.  They kept saying things would change, but there was no evidence anything was actually happening."
bad,coworkers are fun but all dean foods care about is money.  13 people left within the last 5 months due to poor management and overworkin.  dont work here if u have family
bad,"The company is too old. They haven't put any money to rebuild or keep maintenance of the company plant. "
bad,Very difficult place to be employed at as employees are undervalued and treated as expendable. One of the lower paying distribution companies in the area. Difficult environment as most of the employees are very unhappy.
bad,They lie and manipulate their drivers.  Sometimes work up to 20 hours a day.
bad,I quit do to unfair treatment then when I applied for a different position I was told I wasn't eligible for rehire because I abandoned my job yet I left at the same time as my coworker the company is constantly having to pay fines to the city and health department do to negligence basically they need to revamp there management
bad,"Management is not involved in day to day operations. They care more about the numbers than the quality of product. The senior employees are extremely rude and have no respect for new employees. The machines are outdated and never run for a full shift and the maintenance department are completely clueless. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone, keep looking."
bad,Very poor place to work. Management cared more about having meetings than fixing issues and taking care of employees.  They push and push rarely encourage employees.
bad,"Don’t accept an offer here if you’ve ever worked at an even remotely respectable publicly traded company. It’s not a great work culture, the field (the people running the day to day) are completely overburdened and continually trimmed down, the systems used were often out dated even in the 80s, the processes are poorly thought out and resources are scarcely, if ever, allocated to maintaining them in any sort of sustainable fashion."
bad,No life outside of work. Dean is a horrible company to work for. Since the stock is in the toilet it may get sold and that would be a blessing. Management is just puppets to relay all the BS rules of Dean. Drivers are micro managed beyond belief. Don't get caught eating a cracker or you'll get wrote up. Benefits are good though. Plenty other 65k jobs out there that you don't run in blizzards. Always under staffed so if you want to marry a truck and work every Saturday come here. Otherwise stay away
bad,If you want family time don't work here. You are over worked and giving more then one person can handle. Management lies to you and does not care how long your out.
bad,"the guys worked hard working a minimun of 55 -70 hour a week and were taking advantage of with very little management support ,half the time you could not reach them on a phone even in an emergency situation.employee turn over is huge."
bad,"Poor routing. Poor scheduling. Local leadership fails due to inept middle and upper management. Each new manager is worse (and higher paid) than the one that left. Morale is beyond repair. No opportunity for advancement.  Lack of training and safety programs. Just a lot of job justification and zero productivity. Seems like Dean’s hires all the pop and chip rejects at the upper levels. If you’re looking to drive at Sharpsville, you may want to look elsewhere."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. Worst management. The shifts are all night shift. When hired they said 4 ten hour days. You almost never have a ten hour work day. Average is twelve with some 16 hours or more. Very physical job. Management is clueless, they work you like a dog in a very hot, wet environment for very long hours. They constantly add job duties then chastise you for not getting all work done. Understaffed.Constantly change ways of doing things to increase amount of work and then blame employees when things dont work the way they hoped. Very unsafe work place. Lots of faulty equipment."
bad,"Work load continually being add to while the work force positions are eliminated.  Management is not there to help or train, their only job is to delegate and could care less if expectations are unrealistic,  they expect you to literally do a job in 15 mins that realistically if done right should take more than an hour so corners are constantly being cut."
bad,They only care about milk they don’t care if you go over driving limit they want you to deliver milk or die trying long hrs back breaking work manager call you more than wife and calls on weekends to make you run routes they don’t care about their drivers at all
bad,"A bunch of crybabies, it's like junior high, bunch of backstabbers and liars. Corporate are all snakes. You can't trust no one there. Just keep to yourself and do your job."
bad,"No matter how hard you work for the company or go beyond your job description,  you cannot get an individual raise based on performance. You can do three times as much work more efficiently,  and still make the same amount as the person next to you. Therefore the lack of motivation to strive to want to do more for the company."
bad,"putting out fire the first 5 hr. of the day, management didnt lead, if you ask question how to obtain smothing answer was find out for yourself. Managment at plant level didnt want anything to go up the ladder that was not all roses."
bad,"stay away. hours are long, they don't appreciate hard work but expect it. a typical work day last abt 15 hours. you are not trusted, they will always believe the customer over u. no job morale, no structure"
bad,"Local management was great! I never worked with so many caring, hard working people who give everything to contribute to success. Absolutely treated like family. I did learn a lot while I was there from many of them.  Now for the bad... from the Dean foods corporate level it seemed like it was all take take take, no money to fix equipment, cut costs any way you can. Beat to death with all sorts of brilliant initiatives people in regional or corporate management positions come up with, they get passed down to the local management and you are expected to work 24 hours a day to get it done even though it's meaningless stuff (Indeed wouldn't let me use the word I wanted to even though it was mild) that contributes nothing to quality products or customer service. I got the feeling that those individuals who were paid a heck of a lot more than I was have to justify their existence at the expense of all those who they are supposed to lead.  This is the reason Dean Foods is a terrible company to work for and I really feel bad for my friends that are stuck there, for now anyway.  Additionally, the location I worked at was a great place to work before, and for a short while after Dean Foods bought it, then it didn't take long to get progressively worse to unbearable in.the last few years."
bad,"My trainer, the person's whose job I was taking over (she found  another job) was too busy completing word searches to train me, The boss went on vacation the first day I began work. The supervisor and employees regularly eat in the laboratory, including in the plating room where bacteria is plated, incubated, and grown. "
bad,"Working for this company was nothing but a regret."
bad,Managements always changing routes very little free time overworked underpaid always changes happening nothing is consistent The right-hand never knows what the left hand is doing either in management never able to use your vacation and management gets mad at you if you call out and tries to make you come to work still due to being understaffed as well
bad,"A lot of turnover in the office.  Out of date office furnishings, equipment and technology.  Environment is friendly to hostile.  An experience I wish I would have skipped, for sure.  Once employees realize the circumstances of working there, they move on.  Pay is low and benefits are just ""fair""."
bad,"Was recruited by this company to work for them and after leaving my cake job to come here...I was not supplied with the tools to do my job which were supposed to be supplied by the company. I was not TRAINED WHATSOEVER despite begging MGMT to have me trained. How am I supposed to do my job if I don't know the route?! The mgr for Waterbury depot is incompetent and does not back his drivers up! At Dean foods/Garelick farms the driver is GUILTY til proven innocent in the event of issue w customers,which all route delivery drivers know happens from time to time..I was suspended without pay and given no explanation as to why even WHEN I TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING!!!!! Unbeleiveable that a company as large as this would allow their driver supervisors to do this to their employees! And as far as HOS laws go..this company pushes their drivers to the absolute breaking point every single day..despite the pay being good for the short time I was there...my paycheck was screwed up almost every single week...so if ya want to chase your money...come here...I just cant believe that a company that's this big treats their drivers this way...USE EM UP AND SPIT EM OUT!!!   WARNING : if you go to Waterbury depot to drive for these people....PREPARE TO BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Total disorganization and chaos with incompetent management!!! I have have never worked so hard in my life at route delivery as I have at this place..Just look at one of their trucks the next time ya see one and just look at how miserable the driver is...THIS COULD BE YOU!!"
bad,"The management sucks, the lie to make it seem like a great place, u never receive what u order, too much work for that chump change"
bad,No one cares just get the work done over work you like a slave then expect you to do more! No life all you do is work if you want a home life and time with your kids don’t work Here! You’ll be a walking zombie! Management talks to you reckless the overweight office manager who doesn’t have a Cdl but tells you how to do your job! Racism and the race card plays a lot there! So be careful! Wouldn’t recommend this job to no one
bad,Horrible management-top to bottom. Little to no concern for the employees or customers. Management will lie right to you and keep a straight face while doing it.
bad,Dean Foods is a good company but have been going through some financial challenges for several years.  I have been with the company for 12 years and the past 3 years have been the toughest.
bad,Got treated poorly. Called in on my days off because people kept leaving the job because of how they were treated. Always had to clean up after 3rd shift because they were lazy and the supervisors really didnt do anything about it.. they just had us clean it up.
bad,"Unless you're single young with no children do not apply to this job, unless you like to be lied to,you don't like communication, and you don't care what shift, whenever,or even what you to be driving on a day-to-day basis...."
bad,"company is very shaded, they want you to think that it is a good place to work until you are hired,  and they is when you fine out that you are on your own.  There is no training process, the is no comutcation ."
bad,"Management awful.  Company awful.  Will not be surprised if they go under in the next few years. Product, quality awful. No employee loyalty.  Bought out my previous company and ran them into the ground."
bad,"dean food is not an equal opportunity employer, management is very rude an unprofessional there is no organization and management doesnt know how to treat the employees they should be closed down they are not sanitary and dont strive to make it a better place"
bad,Worked there for about three months. Maintenance manager at the time was useless and had no useful Input to job. Worked third shift and they cleaned the lines at that time so there wasn't much to do. Very boring and speaking English was the minority there. The break room smelled of curry and bo. Most of the maintenance staff worked there for a long time and some felt threatened when someone new comes in so they try to make you look bad. When I started they just gave out raises of 10 cents per hour and handed you a newsletter stating that dean foods made 3.8 billion for the quarter. People were not happy. Not the worst place I worked but wouldn't make a career of it.
bad,"I worked 5 years for Berkeley Farms in Hayward California as a Class A Truck Driver. Berkeley Farms was the top milk company in Northern California for a long time. After Dean Foods bought the company in 1998 it started slowly declining. Now the company struggles to compete with every other milk company. Dean Foods/Berkeley Farms can not get their price down to win bids on new accounts or keep their existing accounts. Since i was there only 5 years i witnessed them lose their 2 biggest accounts (7/11 and Walmart) which caused a massive lay off, amongst other smaller accounts have left, and they're struggling to keep their other large accounts. And yes efficient employees do NOT get rewarded by the company, the worst employees who should be fired for safety violations etc but make themselves useful to management by snitching on everyone are the only people who get rewarded. This company lays off a lot and is struggling to compete with cheaper milk companies. You've been advised"
bad,Company will be lucky to be in business by 2021. Worst management that I have ever worked for. People in management that have no business being in their position.
bad,"Worst job in my life. 14 hr days, relief op off 5 hrs before you get off, management aware of issues & didn't care about fixing them. Literally no back up operator if someone called in. Never once got off on time, always some issue (palletizer down, no trucks, cooler backed up etc). The work wasn't bad but the atmosphere was very negative & employees just accept that it Isn't going to change because it pays good and they need the money"
bad,"Very bad managers that cant seem to do their jobs."
bad,"long hours work past hours that you can work within DOT MAX."
bad,They always Claim to be Looking for Help but the Blacklist they have is Expanding. Blacklist.. do not hire list. I Think They Prefer Illegals in the Facility. They also have Cameras inside the Trucks watching you...
bad,"no mission or executive leadership."
bad,"Condescending management, wet and cold environment, no rhyme or reason to maintenance policy. No training available,  there are  systems that have no schematics available.  Machinery is old and primarily not maintained well due to lack of budget supply to buy parts for inventory. Consumables are always depleted so many times we bought our own.  I could go on and on about this place."
bad,The management totally SUCK!! If you are looking for a company that stands with and for the employee then you might want to keep looking!! By far the most unorganized company I have ever seen to be a huge cooperation!! I can almost guarantee Dallas Texas have no idea how it is being ran or they would CLEAN HOUSE!!
bad,"My experience working in the Freezer Department."
bad,"Worked for the Schuylkill Haven plant. Management is a joke and no money is put into building. If you like working long hours on second/third shift and never seeing your family, friends and willing to give up all your hobbies this is the right place for you. Again management doesn't have a clue."
bad,I was working for deans through a temp agency and everything was good and then out of the blue they terminated my contract without any explanation as to why. I was doing great and wanted to get on full time but that didn't happen. They work you to the bone then drop you like an old shoe..
bad,no work life balance.  They will even tell you that the dairy comes before anything else in your life.  They act as if we are doctors working the ER.  It is milk people.
bad,"Very poor Manager I reported to my last 3 months.  Had no business being in his position.  Union plant which made it next to impossible to get anything done.  Upper management rarely supported you on any changes that needed to be made and my Manager had his ""favorite"" which he would say nothing to and she was the biggest problem child we had...in the whole company.  Plant Mgr had maybe the worst temper I ever saw and the employees were so lazy nobody in my position was going to look good or stay very long.  You could not count on the warehouse workers to carry out their tasks so you ended up trying to do everything and upper management didn't want to hear about it.  Specifically one person I managed as mentioned up above.  It was an absolute nightmare and the worst decision I ever made.  I stayed 5 months,  didn't sleep,  didn't eat.  was constantly woke up at 2 or 3 am to let me know we didn't have material for production that I was told we did the day before.  I went to work my last day and physically couldn't get out of my car.  I turned in my badge and phone and got out while I still had some sanity.  Previous to working there I had spent almost 20 years at another company and  was run much much better."
bad,"very fast past,no communication,poor maintenance on equipment,training is poor and unprofessional, you pay union dews for a union that doesn't back you or help when needed,no set break times you may go almost an entire shift with only one 15 min. break"
bad,The company was brought out by Dean Food and the management did not know how to run the company. The co-worker was great. There was a lot of mislead information from Dean Food. Dean Food did not want to hear from the employees.
bad,"The company has no room for growth and management is quick to pass judgment on an individual that will restrict them for promotions.  The pay is  great for certain individuals, the workload isn't distributed fairly and there has never been an African American in the Finance/Accounting department."
bad,The starting pay is good. You work anywhere from 45-55 hours a week. But ALL equipment sucks. From pallet Jack's to trucks. Company doesn't tell you anything
bad,"The work was similar to I've always done. The company software, computer systems and work areas were modern. Employee's were allowed (until I arrived) to take their laptops home. "
bad,As a loader a normal day I would sit around for the first 3 hours trying to look busy. Always waiting on pullers so I could load. Never knew what time I was getting out. U had to stay till work was done. Always worked 13-16 hr day. Orientation was rushed. My trainer was very unprofessional and rude. For example my trainer got upset with me for asking to many questions.  My supervisor was never to be found.  Not sure how this place is still in business or make any money. Very unsafe and rundown.
bad,"Dean Foods had great benefits and good pay."
bad,where do I start ? lots of times I wouldn't get breaks.   The job I was doing ( YARD JOCKEY) needed 2  there at all times during production and loading. I went a month and half with out getting a lunch. After I quit they added a second yard jockey. GO FIGURE ! Very Stressful place to work. Poor management... Supervisors are very mouthy is a good way to say it.
bad,If you have any type of criminal history even if it was 15 years ago and have the experience of a god they will offer you the job and then revoke it due to your background check!!! Minnesota needs to implement a policy with the equal rights division to hold these companies accountable for discriminating against someone who got a driving after revocation 10 years ago!!!!
bad,"The management there will turn an easy job into a hard one. They will lie to you,talk to you like a child and they will take advantage of you if you are a hard worker. They will ask for your opinion and do the exact opposite,they blame other people for their screw ups and they are extremely biased.A typical workday is always filled with confusion,lack of communication and leadership. Most of the time the shifts are ran by the employees,while the individuals ""in charge"" sits in the office.Avoid this place at all cost,its not worth the money."
bad,"Great pay and benefits. This company does not care about the employees though. It seems the only thing this company is concerned about is making money. Dean foods saves money by eliminating shifts and forcing people to work 16+ hours a day. Want a life? Want to be able to make plans outside of work? Then this is no the company for you! "
bad,"Rude employees and boss, as much work they make you do its not worth the pay. Dont train you correctly treat you horribly ....half the time they have you working with chemicals and other things you have no cmue about they just throw you out on the line and pretty much teach yourself"
bad,"A typical day at Dean Foods might be similar to going to a prison labor camp."
bad,"Poor management, Lay-offs and keep all the lazy employees, and mess up paychecks Bad place to work horrible Poor management, Lay-offs and keep all the"
bad,"Manager would ignore safety protocol,they would ignore employee complaint and had a very uncomfortable working environment.Oak farm has great benefits but poor Management and really didn't care about their workers at all, but I'm not going to say no more about this company it has failed it's employees nationwide."
bad,A dying giant in Dairy industry lacks leadership at Executive level to sustain any long term or future growth.  Poor leadership is becoming and excessive problem as most quality employees have left and gone elsewhere.
bad,"Supervision very unprofessional "
bad,This is the worst company you could work. In 2010- 01/2015  no raises. Management does not have a clue on how to schedule work hours. They don't care for employees.
bad,"The company is currently unstable and restructuring to compensate for the difficult times.  Entire departments are disappearing As the board prepares the company to be split for sale.  The opportunity to come on board will best present itself after the company is purchased or split."
bad,Cooler manager wants worker to have little to no time outside of the cooler when it's a lot of down time so there's time where work is not being down but they recommend you stay inside a 33 degree temperature
bad,"a very bad place to work for, low pay, worst management I have seen in my entire life so far, no respect for hourly paid employees, you never know what your boss comes up with, no security whatsoever, 90% workers don't speak English,I never seen company like this in my life, all rules are made on the spot, every set of rules can be changed on daily basis, whatever is written in the employee handbook does not count...don't expect to hear any truth from your bosses, all lies"
bad,This company is very unstable.  Union environment but no help from the union.  Management doesn't know how to run the trucks nor do they have the license to drive the truck.
bad,Everything about this place is just horrible. You have decent coworkers. Depending on where you work... Management does NOT care about the employees at all. They only care if the product is made or not.
bad,"Used to be a great company, customer service is what drove to growth. Now Customers are last on the list and they are cutting back to the bone and cannot deliver service and don't care."
bad,"Worked for a branch in east Texas. Management was new, and tried bullying employees. Poor communication between management and employees. Pay is decent, poor life/work balance."
bad,When I first went to work there I seem to b a decent place to work for some of the problem they seem to have was with the equipment. The reasons they had this problem was the fact that the mechanics the had were use to putting bandaids on all the trucks .There was a bad mixture of mechanics fortunately two were retireing which was good .The unfortunate thing was the mechanics that stayed were terrible the first shift guy was good the others were terrible .Then they hired new managers that did not have a clue .On top of that the relied on the day shift lead guy who was horrible himself they went from worst to bad quickly .Sad that a company of that magnitude would allow this kind of personal to continue in this manner and would fail to keep mechanics that know what they are doing and keep those that have no clue as to how to follow federal guide lines .
bad,"After filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they no longer value their employees.  Employees are working six days a week without a comp-day for salary employees."
bad,Place is turning into a micro management company I don’t like that they can do better with that I can do better somewhere else you think it’s cool to treat your workers it’s not
bad,"Company was ok to work for. Once enjoyed going to work, now it’s a burden. Paying continues to drop, however work the same if not more hours. Management pretends to care."
bad,Very physically demanding.  Long shifts on nights.  Work every Sunday and Holiday to load the trucks for the next day's delivery.  There's more to life than working yourself to an early grave or needing elbow or shoulder surgery from the job you're doing.
bad,Could be a good place to work. Middle and upper management consists of a bunch of good ol boys that were promoted due to their length of employment. Unfortunately when you fill a company with managers that are not capable of performing their duties the entire company suffers. The company lacks any training for these people to get better or learn how to be a manager. The snowball just gets bigger and bigger.
bad,"This job apparently forgets that we have lives and families outside of work. They force 16hr days upon the drivers and make getting a day off a 12step process, even when asked ahead of time. As a driver we are definitely guilty until proven innocent. The management has no clue as to what goes on in the system or the stores. Any time a member of management is asked a question their replies always begin with 'idk uhhh...'. "
bad,"I was asked to get my CDL but was given no assistance in this. I got my CDL permit in the required time but was unable to obtain my license because I was not given the proper training or allowed practice time for driving."
bad,The pay is not worth all the work plus the environment is too cold.  I would not recommend working here unless if you don't have many options because you will find out they ask a lot out of you.
bad,"The Quality Manager and Supervisor have the IQ of snot!  They're not very knowledgeable in their positions, over the last 10 years the quality team has not been what it was in the mid 2000's because of the poor decisions made when choosing individuals for leadership roles.  If you take Quality seriously do not apply here because all your concerns will be ignored."
bad,"Good place to work, but when it become the managers are very poor  supervisors don’t know anything about being a truck driver 1. Supervisors never  drove a truck and 2. They never done. A delivery so hey call you and they tried to tell you how to do your job  and they have no clue what they are talking about  all they know is to be behind a computer on the air conditioner, come on now  the company is been runed  by some dummies."
bad,"Management is poor. No communications between departments. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing 95 % of the time. Routes are bided on starting with the senior union driver on down so lower drivers get the routes no one wants to do! Vacation time works the same. Senior drivers get their choice of vacation weeks first, some up to five weeks and so on down the seniority list. Only two drivers on vacation per week. So lower drivers get choice of January thru March. Pay is above average but hours are ridiculous. Leave times are up to individual drivers but most leave out between 2 and 4 am daily. Newer tractors mostly automatics but are governed at 65 mph. Camera's in every truck supposedly for safety reasons and are activated when truck hits a pothole or brakes hard. Camera's record 8 seconds before and 4 seconds after instances. Reviews by management usually have nothing to do with safety but instead give them a chance to reprimand and in some cases terminate drivers. They do guarantee 40 hours per week but most drivers get between 40 - 60 per week. Trailers for the most part are all junk. secure tracks bent or missing off walls. Interior lights only working 25 % of the time, garbage and dried stale milk all over the floors, missing parts off of refrigeration units, etc. Forget about family time unless your a senior driver. Can and will be forced to work by management. New drivers will get a lot of hours but will have to work every weekend and holiday."
bad,Dean Foods has Slowly gotten worse over the years and is not an equal opportunity workplace. The salary is not worth the hours you work. The Benefits were Great. Management was the absolute worse. Dean Foods has not Evolved or Advanced. Temporary Service is the best way to work at this job in South Carolina.
bad,"Supervisors are in Lala land, they think they are better than the rest of employees, smoking, socializing while everyone is trying to figure out how to run production with broken equipment, and if the employees can’t do it supervisors think you’re not smart enough.So sad,"
bad,"As a Relief Driver, your responsibilities are to maintain routes when other drivers are on leave or injured. Possible travel to other branches including overnights. Typical work hours average 10 to 16 hours a day. Job duties require lifting upwards of 50lbs, kneeling, crouching, bending, reaching and climbing. Immediate management exhibited poor team work and poor consideration for employees. Not willing to adhere to safety and physical concerns. Management's expectations would require failure of DOT regulations. The job is very labor intensive with long hours. While management would reel in employees with high wages, the work required was not equivalent with those wages."
bad,Worked for them 21 years still there just waiting for the wheels to fall off .was  a good place to work when employed there had a great boss if you needed something he was there then they started forcing all the older ones out when he left it’s been down hill ever since poor younger management with no idea about the milk business but no regrets but don’t know how much longer I will be able to do this job with the constant text on my phone to do this do that hurry up
bad,"Management is terrible and much as you complain to the plant manager nothing is done, with new management the plant can prosper......................."
bad,I was a truck driver for dean foods and the pay is really not that great. I really didn't have any time for family because I was always at work. They will work you hard and take up all of your family time if you let them.
bad,"Plant manager threatens supervisors on a daily basis with local plant closer if KPI's are not met. Over the top micro-management, for example during all shifts the supervisor must text all those on the management team hourly updates via text and text when a machine goes down and when it comes up. I feel the supervisors are ""data"" collectors and not allowed to lead his/her team."
bad,"This is a union facility,which makes getting things done very difficult. Cooler supervisors work 90 hours a week. The new manager that was brought in from Nashville has an attitude. There are many games played by the management. For some reason the maintenance manager runs the cooler. All the hours and games played by management will make it near impossible to keep good people. Alot of theft but for some reason the offenders transfer to another department rather than getting terminated . Upper management talks a good game, but my advise is to run. The money is not worth dodging the rats in the case house. Have some great associates in the cooler, but its hard to keep them motivated when the place has been messed up for years."
bad,Dean Foods expects a lot out of their Route Sales Representatives.  Management often takes advantage of drivers simply because they can't seem to do their own job effectively and the drivers are left to clean up the mess and work the long hours to transport product last minute.  The best thing about working for Dean Foods is that they pay time and a half after 8 hours each day and there is a differential of $1.25 paid for every hour worked before 5 am.  The worst part is starting in the middle of the night and often working 14-15 hours each day until late afternoon.  I do enjoy the freedom of not being stuck in an office and to work at my own pace.
bad,"Route planning changes, Pay scale goes up/down-salary to hourly. The company does not deal with injured employees well, and has a terrible disability company."
bad,"There were many meetings throughout the day and expectations were off base because focus did not appear to be on the operation's floor, rather talking about changes that needed to be made. Senior management at Reiter Dairy was too busy micro managing to do an adequate job. Some departments were held to different standards than others. Some of the office politics got in the way of doing the best job for all involved, but management seemed scared to change the culture due to the non union atmosphere changing to a union one. A majority of the people were great to work with."
bad,"I have worked here for many yrs. In that time many horrible things have happened to me within the plant. Sexuall harassment , favoritism , harassment , assault by a supervisor, threaten , and many other things. The only OK part is the pay check. Most senior employees don't wanna work .There is no insensitive to work hard. All raises are the same. . People get high at work. I even had a supervisor throw my check under the desk and tell me to do things to his private to get it back. If you can deal with all that than i guess its a great job. Most employees are decent. Only brown noses get ahead. Now there selling out so we will see who our new owners are and how they treat people."
bad,"Dean Foods compensates its employees generously, but if your looking for an employer that possesses values and understands the importance of creating a positive work environment this is not the right company for you. You can read countless reviews online from current management that will describe Dean Foods as a GOOD-OLD-BOY outfit and unfortunately it is true. Everything from the lack of diversity in the workforce(poor HR leadership), to employess being written up and suspended for missing work because of spouses and children being hospitalized for illness. Advice... steer clear of Dean Foods."
bad,"Money good but you work for it. According to DOT regulation you can only work so many hours, however the pressure is on to complete the route, 13 or more stop, you touch product at least four times before releasing it."
bad,"One of the problems that I've  seen at Dean Foods since I've been there,  it is so complex, I've seen so much change in management.  It's like seasons, they come & go so often. They don't appreciate the employees that they do have. The supervisors seriously lack communication & people skills, that's why the turn over rate is so high.  I think corporate needs to step in & figure out a serious solution.   I think training needs to be reevaluated. With few sentences management is a problem in that company."
bad,I worked for dean foods for 17 years on second shift and spent a lot of time away from my family and giving my job my all but felt very unappreciated.
bad,Dean Foods chaotic environment provides an excellent opportunity to learn new skills.  High executive turnover and continual declining revenues creates low moral among the work force.
bad,"Always understaffed. Long days, too much expected, supervisors do not pitch in and help. Always waiting at stores to get checked in. No feed back, terrible communication."
bad,I liked the people but the management was not very family orentented. I could run any hoyer and nest in the cone room I was also the half gallon operator
bad,"I learned not to expect to much out of management. no one works together, and blame others for their mess ups. you can only depend on yourself. its dog eat dog there."
bad,"No management support. 0 communication from management who preaches communication. No work life balance. No concern with time off to REBOOT. My last vacation, 2 days in Thay called me back because Thay had no relief driver. Break down at 2 am they may call you at 8 am when the get to the office. Then ask you why you running late."
bad,"This company has been let go for too long. They break labor laws, FDA laws and do not care the least bit for the employees. I was there for 7 years. I worked very hard. As the shipping supervisor I tried to make changes. I lost so many good employees because of favoritism. I documented everything. Took it to the appropriate people and was basically told they did not want to know. No one there has a personal life. NO ONE. You got a wife or kids then you better think hatd before taking this position. At one point we lost another supervisor. I had no problem helping out but being a single father and only getting to see my daughter 18 days out of 56 took its tole. Lastly after 3 months of me covering another shift and my child virtually living with her grandparents so I could cover the shift I resigned. My wife passed away a few years earlier and no one cared that my child was being passed around for months just so they didn't have to hire anyone til after the budget renewed. I have not had a second thought. That was the single best decision I made."
bad,"Did not meet a lot of OSHA safety requirement, worker are over worked and under paid need more employees to work to keep company running properly."
bad,"Kiss your life goodbye. Supervisors and Managers are required to work on average 12 to 14 hours everyday. There are no clear expectations given and training is not provided. Training is promised but not provided, all training is self-taught and self-driven."
bad,"I was hired for 2nd shift  and they had ne work every shift but that, long days and they dont apprecuate or care about you being flexable. I felt used. All i wanted was to work the shift they hired me for and they didnt want to do it because other employees left"
bad,Working in a fast-paced environment has been enjoyable. Having friendly and helpful co-workers has also been enjoyable. I enjoy learning new things and working with this company for several years has allowed me to gain knowledge in several areas which will help me in the future.
bad,"High stress environment, no family time at all.. you're just a number.avg 13-14 hrs day 6 to 7 hrs sleep if you're lucky. ."
bad,"Worked for Dean Foods as a Merchandiser. During the year and a half I was there, ten to twelve other people came through this position. This is a part time job. No benefits, no pay increases, no security. They treat this job as just that. A job that is unimportant and the people easily replaceable. Management lets all responsibilities roll down the hill, and this job is at the bottom. The only plus with this job is the hours. You only work about 24 hours a week, on weekends. EVERY Saturday AND Sunday."
bad,This was a good company with good hard working employees for the most part. But the management there is the worst I have ever seen. They love to say we are a family all the while screwing u over. No rises not even the cost of living one they use to give. They took away the little $50.00 Christmas bonus also but u best believe the managers and supervisors get theirs. They just lost Walmart so now we are getting laid off. 38 good people but not one worthless management type. The same group that is actively running the company in the ground. You will neve get another raise or move up at the Braselton plant.
bad,"If you ever work in the homewood location it's very challenging. The upper Management dont care about you or your family, they are very biased. If you're not part of the click( group) of coat riders you're nothing.They dont promote within. Upper Management will get rid of you if they feel that you know more than them."
bad,"Great pay, good benefits. All the overtime you want, and sometime overtime you don't want. If you want to make good money, for fairly easy work. Hours are weird, rotation for weekends off needs some revision. Good job for someone young, or someone without kids/family."
bad,Management does not follow up or prevent issues that quickly lead to toxic environments which deteriorates the dynamics of a great team. A lot of things are done in reverse before the logical ways are implemented
bad,"During interview process was misled and told different things than what was happening with job. Was told this job would be weekends Monday through Friday weekends off, but was not true."
bad,management don't like to answer calls and will let your behind rott before they help you unless you threaten to leave truck in parking lot with keys in it
bad,"Hard work and  a high turnover at the entry level "
bad,"Bad management.Compensation is good,benefits are good.The vehicles provided to complete your job are very unsatisfactory,Managers not willing to help you when there is a problem"
bad,"This was the best job I ever had until it became over managed and micro-managed to death. They preach safety, but really it has little to do with safety and all about controlling the employees. Management fears for it's job security so expect them to make a name for themselves at your expense.. As a driver at Dean Foods you should expect, no phone usage whatsoever. If your phone so much as rings and they hear it on the Drive-Cam you'll be disciplined. No eating, no drinking, no smoking, no singing to the radio or you will be considered talking on the phone and written up accordingly. Overbearing-style control tactics toward the drivers. Comply or leave, with a powerless, broke, union to represent you. Furthermore, the company constantly threatens you with replacement by a non-union distributor and provides you as a driver with no job security encouragement whatsoever. So honestly, if it's about the money, you can make some money here. If you would like to be treated like a human being with rights than maybe this isn't the place for you. Thank You Dean Food management for making my 10 years of service with you a complete waste of my time. I didn't realize how bad I was being treated until I left this abusive relationship. Happy to be gone and learned a valuable life lesson in the process. At least I won't end up in the unemployment line like the rest of you when it's over!"
bad,"When you get interviewed the job sounds great. Then you start after being ""trained"" (mine lasted 3 days before I was on my own) and it's sink or swim. And either you're part of the popular people or you're not. There's no gray area. If you're looking for a good job in logistics my recommendation would be to look elsewhere."
bad,"Dean / Morningstar Foods, now Saputo Dairy Foods.  Awful place for advancement for a certain race.  No representation on the senior management or executive staff for the minority race.  If you are of the other race looking for advancement in your career, this is not the place for you - STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Good job,easy job provided you know what your doing.No communication takes place between shifts and the managers have by far seen better days in their careers And that's questionable . Very unorganized, I have never personally seen a department work so well against themselves and the MOST important upper management and decision making skills .the only perk to the job was free ice cream and yet  that was unclear everyone takes it no one fills out the order sheet for the 25 $allowance given to each employee and no one questions it yet if you get caught your fired. They fired employees in the past only to rehire them...they quit.the wild wild west ."
bad,"The pay is every other week"
bad,Great people to work with makes the day go by fast.  Need better training program to ensure success in company and employees
bad,"completing load-out departure times at a high fulfillment rate.  We have a lot of incoming purchase for resale items that has to be reshipped to our customers. Lots of times the product is not available when shipping, so once it arrives it has to be tail-loaded on already loaded trucks. Lots of accountability put on the warehouse, more than any other department.  Union environment has a very difficult contract in place which allows employees to call-out with out penalty!"
bad,The money is good as long as you dont mind working a lot of hours. The biggest problem is there is no communication between employees and management.  Positive outweighs negatives.
bad,Great benefits trucks overloaded management doesn't back you up long hours unappreciated they don't value family always on your case no bonuses. The pay could be a whole lot better considering the work you have to do benefits are pretty good
bad,"The cooler will work you 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You get a lot of overtime as hourly employee. Management gets screwed big time on hours with no overtime."
bad,"Could have had better management, romance in the office with manager and worker and no one addressed the situation not even the HR department,terrible."
bad,You are put into a position with very little training. Senior managers are very stuck on theirselves. Not very open to your input. You have to count on fellow workers to help you with your daily work schedule..
bad,"Ok job lots of hours not the best leaders. Dont give you time off, don't give you your breaks, don't care about there employee's. Poorly managed and not understanding"
bad,"They will tell you that dairy comes first even when you start, what that means is you will work every Saturday and there is no such thing as a holiday."
bad,"The company is not doing well and stock value is 10% of what it was in 2017.  Communication is poor and generally follow ""shoot first, figure out later"". Frustrating as company also seems regional so hard to get anything done. "
bad,"Need more drivers. 12-14 hours a day to much "
bad,"There were some great people who worked at Dean, however the huge transition of the industry forced them to make some bad decisions  regarding management layoffs."
bad,Dean Foods is a dairy conglomerate.  The focus is on reducing costs.  The department I belonged to had no area of growth or advancement.  Workplace culture was strong and was involved in the community.
bad,A lot coming down at our branch but upper management feel they need to lie about our future. We are kept in the dark about our future. Usually here rumors from our customers on what’s happening within Garelick Dairy
bad,Pay is finominal (highest paying entry level work in area) other than that not worth it. Management is alright but training employees is unheard of and constant understaffing makes the job long and grueling. So if you need money go for it but its not like most warehouse jobs.
bad,insurance is great and have teamster union. Management is the worst I ever had and don't care of their employees. If any one decides to work here make sure to pay the union because they will protect the employees because management here won't.
bad,"If you like going to work at 3am and working 14hrs a day then this is the job for you. They change ""rules"" weekly. I would not recommend this position for a family person."
bad,"Deans is a company that tries to provide activities for the employees."
bad,"Inserted data within the peopl-soft system."
bad,"easiest part of the day was unloading. once it was time for loading, never knew if there was enough product or if there was enough warehouse help to bring us the product. if there wasn't enough product then it was always some other department's fault. Bottom line is that this company is mismanaged from corporate down to shift lead level."
bad,When I was first hired they were competitive and great to work with. It is being run into the ground now. Stocks have nose dived and they are outsourcing what they can to India. Laid off many people and we had to train our replacements.
bad,"Company is a joke to work for, management is bipolar. One minute life is good, the next your getting written up for stupid reasons. Vehicles constantly breaking down along with trailers, lift gates and it takes a miracle to get anything repaired. Pay is best part of job. Turnover rate should be a warning to keep scrolling, there are better places to work in the area."
bad,I have just begun this role and am in training. My role today involves delivering milk to Arlington schools.
bad,"Great Co-workers, managment is very short-tempered and un-professional. Compensation and Benefits were great."
bad,A very unsafe place to work. They didnt care about you personally. It was all business too them. Their is alot of good people there that are very unhappy because that's the way the run the place. If you ever got hurt there..then they would push you away.
good,An ok place of employment could have better management and pay better attention to their employees. Need more raises. Needs better scanners and electric pallet jacks
good,Need job advancement. There is no way of advancing in the company. The work conditions of unloading and loading the products is heavy very strenuous on your body. The managers are never satisfied with their employees. There are no back up drivers in case of the employees being sick or having a death in the family. It's very very hard to miss one day if the employee has an emergency. And if the employee does have to miss work your route is delivered wrong and your truck will be over stocked and you will be talked down to by the management to the point of being harassing.
good,"Job has very poor management, no guarantee will have job in the future, pay is no longer competitive for the local market, most of the equipment is very out of date and should not be inservice"
good,Very poor communication between different departments. As the company has had declining sales they have eliminated many of the employee benefits they once gave.  A definite disconnect between corporate and the employees. They do not listen to the people doing the job.
good,"I am suspect that the company will be broken up and sold off. Sad, it was once a powerhouse company. They are spreading everyone so thin that all anyone can do is drive around. As Walmart starts its own dairy Dean foods will continue to spiral downwards."
good,"No promotional opportunity and complete zero work life balance."
good,"Ability to work independently to grow business, control pricing and secure business with independent restaurants, local chain restaurants, national chain operators."
good,They’ll tell you everything you want to hear when you first begin but it’s never the case. There’s a lot of nonsense that you have to deal with when dealing with customers such as Dollar General. Some of the managers can make life a living mess if you allow it. Co workers are great but the docks and loading process is horrible. Truck can be loaded in all sorts of ways that can really you off at the end of the day.
good,Overall Dean Foods is a good company.  They focus on $$ and not on employee's.  Moral is low in some areas because of the turn around.  People are laid off allot.
good,If you enjoy life you don’t want to work there.  Impossible to get a day off and you have to pick your vacation a year in advance and take it a week at a time.
good,No weekends be or holidays off no vacation for a year and a half lots of 12hour shifts some very bad mannerd people to work with double time Sunday tripple Time holidays
good,Dean Foods is an interesting place to work. There is a lot of dysfunction between the IT department and the rest of the company.  I am wanting something closer to home.
good,"The company overall is great, but management in some departments is what is hindering the company.  Quality and production is better than quantity and experience.   I learned that you can't please everyone."
good,Hope you're not married working for these folks. Overtime everyday and management don't care for there workers. You will sleep the entire weekend if you're even off at all.
good,"Plant location is closing.  I don't have much to say about this company, other than it has provided for me and my family for almost 30 years."
good,"Dean Foods is a co-packer for major grocery chains around the U.S., selling commodity (fluid milk). Dean grew by acquisition, and now its massive infrastructure of inefficient facilities threatens to sink this once promising company."
good,Management expects you to do miracles. Equipment is old and there's a lot of downtime.
good,"Enjoy working most of the time I had there , it’s a stressful job at time. but the management is not in the right position some of them , they want to make you feel be little at time because of the title they hold. Some locations are better than others"
good,It is my desire to refrain from commenting publicly about the employment at Deans Foods. My position is not a commonly held position in production so my experience does not compare with the average production employees at our plant.
good,"Loved my job and had no trouble with the job duties, however there was no teamwork with some of the supervisors, and instead of working with their employees they made it harder to complete the tasks and the department was very understaffed because of it, not to mention the work space, yard was too small to work in."
good,"Dean Foods is a large national dairy processor. Products include milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, orange juice, flavored milk, sour cream and yogurt. Dean Foods is headquartered in Dallas, TX."
good,Dean Foods is a very company to work for except for the Spartenburg SC plant. Employees are allowed to do and say what they want without any fear of loosing their jobs. This type of attitude greatly effects production at this plant.
good,"I loved my job until all part-timers were let go, or at least that was what I was told.  There are no helicopter bosses, which means they let you go solo after training which it is not hard to read labels and place Ice Cream where it belongs. There is no advancement unless you know someone."
good,"Work crazy hours, 1 pm to 12-1-2- in the morning, double standards every where in the plant; unless you are "" special "". Very little home time. Beware of the back stabbers."
good,This is a very demanding and time consuming position. It is also very fulfilling.
good,Low margin industry with an outdated product line. The company has many issues to face and will face Bankruptcy first. Whatever is left will become part of other struggling fluid milk companies.
good,"I was Informed it was a day shift after one week I was forced to work a split shift and working night shift every Sunday and every other Saturday day. I was led to believe I would be working all day shift hours being this is what I was told during the interview, only to be asked to go to night shift for a couple of weeks just in case I would have to fill in during the night shifts supervisor taking a day off or when he's on vacation. There were some, but very few differences in the two shifts, but this is how I was lured into a split shift with the bulk of my time on the night shift."
good,"Management lacks professionalism. There are no pay raises and lab does not get paid much and require the most qualifications. Also, there are little to no recognition for hardworking employees"
good,"Overall I enjoyed by Time at Dean Foods.  The change in the market for the product that Dean primarily sold was changing and they were not adapting as fast as the market.  Unfortunately they tried cost savings by moving IT to India, which really did not save the end user any time.  They are also closing all of the accounting centers, except the one in Dallas."
good,They are all about the bottom line for the board of directors. They don't care about the problems they create for their employees. They have little coverage for instances of illness. They just expect you to work sick!
good,"A typical day at work as a sales representative/Account Mgr. is more like being a firefighter. You wear several hats and can be very challenging but at the same time it can be gratifying as well. You need to be proactive, with the support of your team you can overcome any challenges that you face each day. It is enjoyable to meet current customers and new. The most enjoyable part of my job was to educate current and new costumers in the dairy business, present new items or programs."
good,"Poor upper managemnt.  Lacks quality leadership.   Bad upper management decc"
good,The company has been in a steady state of decline during my entire 13yr career.  Great products and great potential for this company if they could re-vamp with a new CEO.
good,"I like my job. Theres nothing hard about my job. Sometime you can fill the pressure from management. But, Dean Foods hiring practices could be different. Some of the people I have encountered has somewhat of a checkered background. This in my mind what create a culture in the work place. Overall its not a great job, but a good job."
good,"The work wasn’t always easy, definitely wasn’t slow. For the most part the people weren’t bad either. Some of the positions at dean’s weren’t glamorous & they weren’t always exciting to do ."
good,"Managing employees, ensuring that all processes and procedures are followed, while ensuring the items needed are received for daily production. There are many areas of this job that allow for growth and opportunity.  Working on cost savings for transportation and other material items not under contract was one of the most enjoyable and challenging tasks for this position."
good,"very fast paste, unorganized and poor management pretty much sums up the job great benefits pay i very good. the hours are long and you are for sure going to get overtime"
good,"Poor management structure, most of the management is new within the first year of this plant opening. Human Resources is a joke, hiring back people who shouldn't have been and discarding good employees who left due to poor management. Now since Management has changed and it seems for the better, the good people are discarded and not hired back. We will see now with new management if the plant goes on upward spiral, cause we have have been going downhill in the last few months and have lost accounts."
good,"Production employees not fairly compensated, and management was not qualified.  Too much politics."
good,If you like the food industry skip Dean Foods.  When they need a few extra bucks to meet their fiduciary responsibility  it will come from you. Customer service has been sacrificed for the bottom line. You will be asked to complete ethics tests regularly but those at the top of the organization flaunt their disregard regularly.  There is no process for advancement.   If you decide to take a job....get in with a plan to get out.  I take no pleasure in this post because i worked there a long time but this Company has no soul.
good,"Learning about the food/dairy business is very complex and indepth. Dairy is the number one regulated food in the world. This by far is the hardest part of the job, and with little training, learning the business was tedious and self driven."
good,I understand working together for 30+ years but when your coworkers (two of them) tell you that they are best friends with her you know your complaint isn't worth voicingl
good,To many share holders. They run the company. no job security. Someone has to retire in order to move up.
good,"Creamland offers many hours and overtime, however requests for any time off, personal or otherwise seem to be overlooked often. "
good,It is a descent company with benefits.      The company has been around for years so it provides some forms of employment security. The management team is a group of champions
good,"Great local management terrible Corporate Management. Great people who worked hard in a great team environment, but the Corporate team took the company down."
good,During the holiday season things get chaotic. From the dairy running out if product. Which in turns puts the warehouse behind. In turn putting the drivers behind the eight ball. Due to the split days off. You are literally at the plant everyday of the weekend. So no real off time. Management can be evasive in problems surface. So you are stuck with the bag. The pay is the only real perk.
good,"Legacy Deanfoods was very caring for its employees, unfortunately, it all started to change after Its acquisition by Suiza Foods and management was never the same. "
good,"If you enjoy never seeing your family and working 14 days 4 days a week then it's a great job. In the Cortez branch there is zero room for advancement. As a driver that is as high as one will get within the company, again from the Cortez location. Good luck ever retiring from there."
good,"It has its up’s and down’s but hey that’s with every job, especially a truck driving job. Things could be better. Equipment is somewhat ok, it’s a decent job."
good,Currently not a stable company. Many layoffs and plant closings. Good benefits. Employees are friendly. Management and company are not employee friendly.
good,Part time job while in school. Unable to advance. Management did not communicate well. I was there almost 2 yrs and never offered a full time or permanent position with benefits
good,No breaks want you by yourself  help one help every one and want you can you can take a 16min lunch and get up and keep moving or you fold behind  work
good,"Just need to understand the logistics and operations functional and align them with the Commercial teams. They got rid of the old school General Manager that made decisions, so it is noticeable that departments do not agree on key operating metrics ."
good,Warehouse works off of four employees. You have busy day & very few slow ones. No air or heat in warehouse. You make a nice amount yet you work a lot of hours.
good,"Make calls/receive to process orders/complaints.  Sorting out mail form the route bags.  Process appropriate paper work. Work with general office equipment."
good,The company doesn't focus on its employees.  They want their share holders to be happy and that is wrong.  The company would do better if they invest in their employees.
good,"load 7 box trucks daily with milk to be delivered out to each route for the next day, check cooler for debris do inventory of milk inside cooler park each truck after loading them plug them up to outlet so that cooler is keeping milk cold,kept loading dock cleanliness."
good,"Good pay and benefits, good co-workers(union). Stressful most of time due to management. Fast paced. Production numbers more important than safety and family."
good,Treated like nothing more than a number. It's your fault if you are late or if you had to call out regardless of what your reason is. Management does not treat it's employees as equal. Very competitive as far as pay goes though if you can overlook the reasons mentioned above.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that I work in a  fast paced environment.  I learn something new every day.  The hardest part of the job is getting everyone aligned to complete a task.
good,"It was work.  Lots of autonomy, lots of hours, lots of variation.  Everyone did their job and the focus for 6 months is production.  In the off season its a skeleton crew and you fix/change what you can."
good,"Not far from home, lack of work got sent home a few times due to no or little work. First time working only been there a few weeks nice big clean facility"
good,"this job had a lot of safety issues, management care more about production. decent job lets you work a lot hours. the pay os decent but it could be better. needs better management team."
good,The thing i like the most was dealing with a lot of customers and fixing any issues that came up on a daily bases the company lost a lot of business and thats why our pay rate was low
good,"In the last 3 months we have lost 2 key people on the operations side, we have had trouble producing product and we are exploring changing customer order times in the next few weeks. Customers are not happy and we are pushing them too far. Something needs to give and I don't see that happening any time soon."
good,Called on stores and put up product. Did resets and miscellaneous jobs.
good,Management is stuck in the past. Advancement can happen but takes a lot of work and persistence. Expect to be asked to do more with less on a continual basis. Atmosphere ranges from friendly and professional to dysfunctional and hostile.
good,"My typical day started before 7:00 each morning and ended at 6:00pm, except when I was on the road meeting with my staff. On those occasions (70% travel) I normally had 14 hour days. I was responsible to lead my staff (24) in meeting annual objectives, staying in compliance with government regulations, and supporting company on new business opportunities. I learned how to be a compassionate, direct and very organized leader. My co-workers who reported to me were absolutely the best. I was very fortunate to have such high character, dedicated employees. Hardest part of my job was the time away from family and meeting the increasing need to cut costs. My most enjoyable part of my job was mentoring young men and women and watching them progress through the company."
good,"Expect long hours at this plant, 16 hour shifts are not uncommon.  The guys that know more and want to help out can expect 18-20 hour days when break downs happen.  Overall I like the work.  We are union which has its pros and cons.  Expect whining from the guys that don’t want to do more than they have to (that’s everywhere though)   Show up, keep your head down, and don’t make friends and you’ll be just fine."
good,"Unfortunately, the company plan was to take this order entry department and make it into the customer service department, when myself and 10 others were hired. The training could have been done a little better. But I did learn another side of customer service which I had not learned previously and that being via the phone.So you had to quickly learn to multitask.  This center is closing at end of the year, so it is sad that things did not progress as well as they anticipated."
good,Job is fairly easy it’s the hours that will get to you. Especially in the summer. We work 16hours straight one day and when we asked to leave because orders were not finished management thru a fit. This was on multiple occasions.
good,"I worked at Dean Foods for 2 years and in that 2 years, we had 3 different plant managers, one was a really good guy and cared for the company but they screwed him so he left. We’ve had 3 different supervisors, 2 didn’t know what they were doing- the current supervisor knows what he’s doing and cares about his crew. "
good,It is a 24/7 operation and they want you to be on call anytime regardless of days off and vacations can be cancelled without notice.  No work life balance.
good,"I have been honored to form some of the closet relationships of my life during my years with the company. The people are dedicated to the job, the customer, and each other."
good,It's a great place to work it just has a lot of cons management is terrible the war between first shift and second shift it the worst I've ever seen you really have a total war there without 2nd shift there is no Mayfield
good,"with the company during the payroll consolidation. "
good,Great opportunity to learn and develop. Worked with some good managers. I was working with some professionals that taught me how the dairy business worked.
good,"If I can get 46 hours a week I love to stay and work but I need to go were I  can get some hours the pay is good though but need more hours I like the fact that I can work on the dock at night with no problem being bothered by no one just load my trucks"
good,Work/Life balance is way off.  Six to seven days per week at twelve hours per day.  Great money and good benefits but not for giving up your familly..
good,Very poor management. Cut throat and if you aren't one of the boys that suck up or have honesty and integrity you will have a hard time. Management will lie and make up stuff if you disagree with them or have an opinion.
good,"Not to bad of a place to work, had to work a lot of weekends, only 2 holidays off a year. Equipment was in bad shape.Free milk and drinks in the breakroom"
good,Oak Farms West was a fast paced production facility. The plant was old so constantly managing immediate facilities needs with respect to the packaging equipment. Good working group within the facilities department. Plant closed and property sold.
good,"Okay place to work, but very little communications with employees about the rules and regulations. No room for advancement and very little job advancement."
good,Very demanding atmosphere.  Changes done every day.  Learned new processes in the ice cream industry.  Management was very approachable.  Hardest part of the job was logistics.  I enjoyed working with the coworkers and manager.
good,the pay is good compared to many places but unless you been working there 15+ years you have no job security.  The Union contract works against new hires
good,I've worked here for 4 years and been promoted once.  It is not a bad company but we lack standardization across the board and training/educating employee is not a priority.
good,"Typical day is from a desk"
good,cash application
good,Company is going through restructuring. There is too much pressure on cost savings and not enough on retaining and developing talent.
good,"Truck drivers[2] provide an essential service to industrialized societies by transporting finished goods and raw materials over land, typically to and from manufacturing plants, retail and distribution centers. Truck drivers are also responsible for inspecting all their vehicles for mechanical items or issues relating to safe operation. Others, such as driver/sales workers, are also responsible for sales, completing additional services such as cleaning, preparation and entertaining (such as cooking and making hot drinks) and customer service."
good,"The hours are good. The pay was good. I started out as a truck unloader, and I did that job for eleven years. I enjoyed my job because it was different every day."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and the salary was competitive. Management was not supportive, though and there wasn't a good work-life balance. I always felt like I wasn't allowed to go to the doctor or other things when needed."
good,Work a lot of hours.and its a very fisical and mentally job and you will get your workout in this job.this job its good to get your experiences and go get another job that you don't work so many hours
good,In the process of bankruptcy therefore there is a tremendous amount of anxiety among the employees. The uncertainty has a negative affect on many of the workers.
good,Dilivery and reciving parisable products to local and out of town stores. Managing twenty associates in two different warehouses. Most enjoyable was my salary.
good,I don't have anything bad to say about the company.  You wanna work  they have it.  They are  by the book and they have all the time and work  you'll need
good,You think you are working with a solid company. You are told to run your department as if you own the company. All lies. Doing what is best for the company can get you fired.
good,Making the best out of a somewhat medium situation. If it was more professional it would be a great place to work. Management seems to be in a homeboy situation they all know each other.
good,Dean Foods was good in the past. Company shares are coming down every day. Letting go of people on a daily bases. Still good for contractors.Best of luck!!
good,Great place to work if you wanna make alot  of money and not sleep I am currently working here and I average 60 hrs a week with one day off for about 18 hrs but that's because we need driver's there's a lot of bull at this job but where isn't there right but you can make alot of money the work is easy it is the best job I have had in my 25 years of driving
good,"Always stayed busy. Very concerned to make sure safety stands were adhered to and followed. Handled goods in a distribution facility, loaded and unloaded freight, prepared orders for shipments. Experienced forklift operator for moving heavy loads of materials, also skilled with hydraulic lift."
good,Tough place to work. The dairy business is an interesting one. The company ebbs and flows...can't make up its mind about investing in brands for future growth vs cutting costs.
good,forklift operator staging products and materials best part of the job was making a place to put away product some days could get slow but the job getting done is the best reward
good,Management changes too consistent and continuous road blocks for advancement.  Unable to work on cost savings projects as tedious non effective micromanaging for items that are redundant or repeated every 6 months being required even though signed off from internal/external audit recently.
good,I spent 29 and a half years working for this company.  It was a good work environment for most of the time spent there.  It has been challenging the last couple of years.
good,A learning experience for many years. I was there over 29 years. The plant closed is the only reason for me leaving. I did various jobs and vacations relief (almost everything) over my 29 years. Enjoyed the friendships made and people I worked with. Standing on your feet for long hours with overtime up to twelve hours.
good,They have a lot of good workers but not the best managed place makes for a lot of forced overtime. They also have a very poor communication and organization program as well.
good,"Been with this company for 30+ years and they have always offered me opportunities within the organization.  In recent years however, due to poor management inn corporate, they look to be sliding toward bankruptcy or, at best, selling out.  I would have recommended this company to anyone prior to a few years ago."
good,"A typical day at work involved waiting for my truck to be loaded and inspected the truck before heading out to my perspective destinations. I had a good supervisor, but he is no longer with the company. Good management is important for efficiency and organization.  My co-workers were caring and friendly. The hardest part of my job was waiting to be loaded. I enjoy it when I am able to make deliveries on time."
good,It was a good accounting job and I had a great boss who was quite knowledgeable and was a great manager. I would have stayed longer if they had not outsourced the accounting function.
good,It was great. sometimes lacked direction from management. Seemed to not have clear company goal. Sometimes would send mixed message to employees. Tough first job
good,"Ok place to work  people are friendly supervisor are very easy going had to work most holidays and weekend unless it was your scheduled off day but we did get paid for the holidays  enjoyed working with coworkers, enjoyed when the company had cookout for the holidays or when problems would arise and everyone would go that extra mile to make sure everything was done before everyone left for the night.The hardest part of my job is having to say good bye to everyone because our business is closing down"
good,When  I started with Dean Foods in 1988 it was a pretty nice place to work.  When SUIEZA bought them out in 1990 things began to change.  It was no longer a family owned business.  It became  part of a large corporation.
good,"Over the course of my employment with dean foods, know matter how hard you worked or whatever you accomplished, it seemed like it was never really appreciated or even given a second thought, I loved working there, but that’s just my opinion."
good,I enjoyed my time at Dean Foods.  I was fortunate to work with many very talented people.  I was able to learn and to stretch my capabilities and interests.
good,"I get to work. load boxes in machine, imput in computer what i am running /gallons, Pints etct... stand most of the day,  i change settings several times a day depending on what we are running, work on forklift loading trucks, work a pallatizer"
good,"Company grew by acquiring local dairies around the country and has not been able to create a focus that pulls it all together.  New improvement programs every year that do not produce results.  Managed by silo, commercial, supply chain and logistics that work against each other for their own benefit.  Management to KPI's instead of for the bottom line."
good,"Very hard with daily challenges because of short shelf life product, short customer order time, poor employee attendance.  Management was good to me and pay was fair."
good,"Never had a problem with supervisor. Very long hours, very hard work. Benefits were good if you had time to use them. Left because they would never fix equipment or replace it and working weekends."
good,"mondays: business meetings, followed by typical day"
good,"Poor Management "
good,"Very fast paced company,  great benefits. Can be stressful but very rewarding. Management doesn't respect personal time and will contact you on days off."
good,"Expected more from this company after 11 years of service, a company that does not have your back welcome to corporate america.  If you see someone trying to take care of health have their back."
good,good overall company but not specifically at this location. Management needs to not be behind computer all day.benefits are good. good 401k match. milk is down but commodities are up.
good,"Work day 7-5"
good,Local company I worked for was exceptional. Was always given the opportunity to make decisions without any micro managing. We had a good team that worked together for many years and provided the corporate company with solid financial results
good,"A typical work day you are faced with many challenges aside from the management portion you also have to be a leader. If your energetic, willing to learn and able to multitask even when everything seems to be going wrong with the willingness to learn you will do good at Dean Foods. Quality and Safety is incorporated into all aspects of every job and you will work with some of the Dairy's most knowledgeable people in the industry. The business is always changing so you also must be on top and ahead at all times."
good,Good work life balance. Small team of R&D. Fast pace environment. Great weather location. Multiple brands to work with on any given day. Culture is different but getting better.
good,wake up at 12 am drive to work 1.30 am hook up check load drive to santa fe make delivery  live santa fe  drive to las vegas nm make delivery drive back to albuquerque  clock out time between 1and 3 pm 5 days a week
good,Had such a high turnover rate. Always worried about being laid off. Hired new people weekly. Not bad place to work has air and heat.
good,Enjoyable work place at times and a headache the rest of the time.  Certain creeds get away with everything and pointed finger when they were held responsible for their own screw ups.
good,"Fellow Employees makes it easier to work, other small factors at work can frustrate most people. Overall good place for those seeking better income than minimum wage. Certain departments require more attention to details than others. Interesting to see how dairy products are prepared, made and set prior to being shipped to customers leading to stores shelf."
good,"i liked the people i worked with we get so much ice cream  i didn,t like to train people"
good,Busy and loud place to work. People were OK. Always wet.Ten hour shift was OK.
good,"average work environment"
good,Good place to work at. budget cuts is the only reason i am still not there.
good,We are always busy which makes the shift go by fast. The people are fun and friendly which makes going to work fun.
good,Dean Foods became the largest dairy Co by being customer and employee friendly. After management changes involving Soft Drink exexs who were unfamilier with dairy operations.
good,Assist employees and supervisors in resolving employee relations issues. Recommend appropriate coaching or disciplinary actions and assist supervisor with drafting coaching and disciplinary documentation. Log and track employee relations issues
good,it was very productive easy place to work i learned a lot working at this company
good,Typical a good place to work.  Environment was a norm. On location cafeteria was convenience.  Parking was also convenience Year round.  I would recommend this company to others.
good,Dea foods a fair place to work. Managers / supervisors care about the employees and try their best to provide safe work environment. Produce quality milk products.
good,"Good company to work for, however they have continuous downsizing due to bad management decisions.  They don't learn from past mistakes or learn from things that aren't working.  Every 2 years they have a reorganization in hopes that will fix the issues."
good,A typical day at work was always a headache because you never knew what machines ran properly. Enjoyed my time because of the different job experiences I gained. Management did seem to know what was going on and communication between management was poor. Working long hours and forced overtime on most of my off days was the hardest part of the job. As vacation relief my job changed weekly so I never did the same job function day in and day out. That is what I loved most about the job.
good,"Depending on the area/group, work life balance varies. Some group allow for flex hours, but not applicable to all functions. Compensation is very competitive and bonus payout is generous when performance objectives have been met."
good,I enjoyed my customers and coworkers.  There is a disconnect between Corporate and Field Offices; job descriptions and actual work required to complete tasks are not one in the same.  Announcements from CEO of a bumpy future and layoffs across the country put job security in question.
good,"My manager helped tremendously to be open and fair to his employees. My peers were also very good to me."
good,"The pay and benefits are unquestionable, they're flat out great. But with this comes a quality of life that is subpar. I've learned that money isn't everything. with that said I would still like a job that is comparable in pay"
good,Great co workers great pay Managment team pretty much stunk. Had to go over their head to get stuff done. And even the higher ups were about as useless as well. Not organized what so ever 
good,I found my time at Dean Foods mired by a lack of quality leadership during my time at the Albany NY DC. The drivers at this particular DC were given too much leniency regarding lack of quality customer service.
good,"Very enjoyable and great organization to work for.  Wish I was still employed there.  Good people and very organized company.  My extreme large territory was the hardest part of the job thus that was the only reason I left.   I was hoping to work there until retirement.  Great quality products with great marketing research behind each one of them.  Good pay with good benefits.   I was not able to finish my goals that I wanted to because I left the company.  Single divorced father that the new large territory just wouldn't work to be overnight often.  However, I enjoyed the company and it's fellow employee's."
good,"Monday Thru Saturday average 9 to 10 hours per/day"
good,"Assigned demographic area, approx. 300 accounts.  Visit approx.35"
good,I worked at Deans for 26 years. The hardest part about the job was the demand for mass production.The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching production goals for the day.The health benefits were great.
good,Evart Michigan Liberty Dairy had been a main source of employment for the local area for over 100 years.  Dean Foods decided to close the plant in 2013.
good,"In my opinion this place has good people,but the management is very lacking and safety other than personal is almost non existant.I work as a maintenance mech,and in all my years working in other places theres been standards to live by.Safety was always no1 and here its almost non existant! To be honest im glad ive got coworkers that pride themselves on good safety values and we take care of ourselves but our supervisor does not care about improving the quality of the work enviorement . No followup on work between shifts and every day were left wondering what transpired between the shifts and work that was or was not done.There is tension between shifts and it does not help. Now like i said im glad to have a job and am very fortunate for my coworkers but this place needs vast improvement starting with management!"
good,"My immediate manager, and the entire HR team are a great group of associates who am I glad I have the opportunity to work with.  The Dairy business is very interesting, and I learn something everyday"
good,"It was a pleausure working for one of the oldest companies still operating in the center of New Orleans."
good,"I worked as a supervisor/ relief driver for Dean Foods. While we were under the Pet label I thoroughly enjoyed my work . I along with the others had support from management and they never questioned my ability as a route person and a women. I never had to ""prove "" myself.When the company realigned and put our baranch under Mayfield Dairies everything changed for the worse. We had no support from upper management and if you expressed a concern you were labled a trouble maker and your pinishment was a route cut, which meant moneycut.I had 2 new supervisors that came in and had to constantly prove I could handle my position both physically and mentally. I was asked to do things that they would never ask my counterpart to do. Time after time it was you are going to run this route, the biggest we had, by yourself because ""I want to see if you can"", along with numerous other things.  Overall I would not recommend the Mayfiled division to anyone but Dean Foods overall was good to work for."
good,"A typical day at work involved the troubleshooting of hardware and software users at the end user level. Perform troubleshooting of local and network printers via phone and remote access sessions. "
good,"I used to work at the Le Mars plant and overall it was a clean place, good pay and benefits. But they hire a bunch of people who cant read or do math and make mistakes. The lab lady at night will walk around and spy on people and report them to the boss. Alot of drama in the cooler with employees. Mangement will find any way to get rid of you if they dont like you. Promotions go the favorites and not those fully qualified."
good,Hours and days off are not very good for family. Compensation is was good. Started on floor moved up to management. Good group of plant management. Different culture in higher management.
good,right now going through some hardships will know the companys plan after Thursday overall its a nice place to work hope that the company will remain productive
good,It’s nice being able to work quick and get done early. When short guys have to do extra stuff which sucks if you haven’t made it in to Over time though. Slower you work less likely you’ll have to do extra things.
good,"I worked at the DFAAC - Fort Worth remote office.  Very casual here, able to wear jeans every day.  We were released early (2 pm) before  a holiday.  New management making some drastic cuts though, starting with break room accessories, plant shutdown, and continuing to announced lay-offs in 2019."
good,"I would come in and get all the paper work ready and order for the jobs."
good,"If you do not make a full year and they let you go. They make you reapply. If you make a year you just come back to work.The union charges retirement fees about. 400$ a month out of your check no choice. And money is lost to union if do not have 5years in program. I liked it there, union coworkers were great once they realized you were not a weasel. HR is slimy  like car and insurance salesmen without the personality. They pay well though."
good,"Dean's is a great place to work if you need money, there is always time to work and many opportunities to pick up extra hours. That being said you are a bit looked down upon if the time comes where you say no to the extra hours offered. The work is great but it is very endearing, This is what drove me away from continuing my work here."
good,"My typical began at around 8:00.  Being a creature of habit, I would log into my computer, get a cup of coffee and open my emails and check any phone messages .  Any emergencies were taken care first, and I would proceed with the rest. Any changes in meetings would be updated and communicated to my VP.  The rest of the day was spent putting out fires, reviewing emails, scheduling meetings, greeting vendors and any ad hoc requests. "
good,"My 24 years with Richfood/ Supervalu/ Dean Foods was an overall great experience, there was no room for mistakes for the position I held. I usually started the work day off and if a code date was wrong it could cost the company 100,000 dollars.  In my time there, I got an opportunity to be a part of the management team for almost 4 years, which was a life changing experience filled with personal growth. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of my job was when I saw our product at Walmart, which is the most technical company to produce for, it made me proud that I major part in that product."
good,"how to pack ice cream "
good,I loved my job I knew all the job in the plant and could perform all job if needed. was a good place to work would still be their if not for it closing.
good,"work of my truck deliver to 16-18 stops a day"
good,"Like any job there is it's up's and downs. If you enjoy overtime their is overtime. Great staff, gets very busy. No micromanaging. Benefits and pay need improving."
good,"The biggest asset working for Dean Foods is the ability to run a route like it would be your own. Great benefits, mostly the health insurance. The biggest liability is poor communication between management and those in the field."
good,"big company that acts like 3 different company's Sales, Commercial and cooler all have different goals and they don't tend to go hand in hand with each other resulting in big waste and increased cost with no fix in the near future."
good,"I was a Nester, which means I would inspected the ice cream. The place them in the boxes to be shipped out to the customers."
good,"The day started 12 hour rotating shift sometimes 12-16 hours. I enjoyed the working environment, my co-workers and management."
good,Worked in boise I'd the management was poor in my time in boise if you were not part of the good boys club you wont make it over dean foods is a excellent company to work for just stay away from Boise management should of came from out side of boise when they recently changed management it got worse people from corporate should look in to this boise really needs corporate HELP BAD
good,"great pay, off days aren't together, good insurance, union based job, usually starts around midnight and finish your rout around 11. management will try to guilt you into going back out because of poor scheduling sometimes"
good,Various mechanical problems. Out dated equipment. Very stressful
good,Working in the department (Benefits) that I did was extremely stressful. The company is lacking in the technology department making the job more stressful.
good,The work itself was pretty good.  My co workers nothing short of amazing and we made a great team.  The down side is they string you along for months and months. Middle management makes promises that upper management will not make good on. Horribly disappointing.  Just goes to show that even Fortune 500 companies have no problem running like a sweat shop.
good,Enjoyed my work and time there over the years. Made many friends. No room for advancement in manufacturing though. Under appreciated for hard work unfortunately. Finally had enough of factory work after 15+ years and was ready for a change.
good,deans was a good and safe place to work. there were to many company and shift changes while I worked there. the work environment and fellow workers was very good
good,"***Great Co-Workers*** I was surrounded by great co workers and immediate supervisors. Corporate as a whole was going through changes and it was a little rough during these changes, but I believe once they figure things out- - it will once again be a great place to work"
good,"Great place to work, but more company focused than employees.  not many issues aside from being asked to worked on requested time off, without a choice."
good,"I interned with Dean Foods back in the summer of 2016. The interview process was fairly straightforward, as well the description of the role. The culture was lacking in my few months there"
good,"Working for dean foods was an experience of  delivering goods in an efficient and polite manner, and made sure shelves were stocked or customer satisfaction."
good,the pay is the best part about the job..they start you out at a good pay but don't plan on getting any coverage! still wasn't hired full time after 1yr
good,Once again it was a typical warehouse job. Unload product and put it away. Pull orders for all  stores on the western slope. Stage said orders and load them.
good,great company to work for at local level had priorities at corporate level in wrong area.  I came to work and did my job with no micromanagement which was why I love it so much.  I can complete my job without interruptions
good,"DeanFoods is FoodService Company. So obviously Quality is the overall primary focus. But at least it's stressed in a easily understandable method. "
good,"Aggregation of regional dairies that operate in vastly different ways. Multiple disparate systems, lack of automation and reporting leads to running the business at such a high level that course correcting is a hope versus a fact based strategy."
good,Company was bought out by Bunge North America. I liked what i did and thought i did it well. Enjoyed my co-workers and got to work on time and got back form breaks on time.
good,"Always enjoyed the people i worked with. It was hard work, but i liked my schedule and majority of all my customers. No room for advancement though. Appreciative for the time i spent there."
good,Overall i enjoyed the company and my co-workers. Very easy job to do and pays well. But had to down size and did away with my position.
good,it a OK place to work if Ur single or u have Ur family started. on the other hand u didn't get much time to spend with your family
good,"Great pay and benefits, but you earn it.  Forced overtime is common in some departments.  This is a union dairy, expect to hear, ""I have seniority."""
good,"Customer Service,  administrative due  in and out going call general clerical work"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with. "
good,"Significant amount of ad hoc tasks, annual budget and monthly forecst responsibilities, daily interactions with cross-functional teams ( accounting, sales, distribution, manufacturing\conversion )"
good,"Americo was an awesome opportunity to get my feet in the IT field. It was my first experience in the roll of helpdesk agent. Management was great, I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who think they already know about computers."
good,"My job was to go over invoices, match up packing slips, etc. and then process them to send to our headquarters for payment. I also was liason for receiving and shipping with our clients and vendors. Because of proximity, I was backup for our receptionist/secretary as needed and with my previous experience, I was occasionally asked to help out payroll and HR with projects."
good,"management left you alone as long as you were doing your job. co-workers were not so helpful. there was not a hard job in there. you only got to learn a new job if you got that bid job, there was no cross training."
good,"The atmosphere on a daily basis can change on a dime.  You never fully know what to expect, and that can cause anxiety for someone who needs structure.  It is not a high stress working environment.  The jobs are all doable if you are willing to work.  The people at my location are phenomenal."
good,Always come to work on time feel ur best and look ur best and do a very good job at what you do.  You will be working with very skillful  And good people That's willing to help with anything you need.
good,A typical day there usually with us working short often and having to make up for the absence. I learned how to operate a forklift and an electric pallet jack. The benefits were good and our union was helpful.
good,"Worked for the Company for 3 Months.  I didn't intend to leave.  My starting pay was 14.46.  You start off as a Vault Stacker. The work is hard for the 1st Week but you get used to it."
good,"Not the best place to work but not the worst.It was a union shop. The employees are easy to get along with, but some supervisors are not.The plant manager was a very nice person and easy going."
good,Needs better work/life balance for employees. Off days can be scheduled a little better so employees can have at least consecutive off days. The pay is good and the benefits are too.
good,Pay/benefits very good. You have to pay for your own company car. Training could be better. They have cut back so much that everybody is overworked. People leave you alone but if you need something its tough to make contact.
good,"I like my job at Deans and I get along well with my co workers. The hours are long, but the pay is good. It's not my choice to leave Dean Foods, they are going out of business."
good,"Great place to work for the single person with no outside commitments or family obligations. For an entry level position, there is opportunity for advancement to a certain level. Once at that level it is hard to go any further due to the long standing employees that work there."
good,"It was a welcoming environment among the production workers, we were like family in there. There needs to be more incentives to motivate the employees."
good,"Pretty easy job, great pay and awesome benefits. Hard on family due to working overnights and rough on sleep schedule. No vacation days and no one to cover my shift for when something happens or comes up (like a wife surgery)."
good,"New challenges.  Learned a lot of distribution."
good,"Typical day at work is to deliver product in a professional way with a positive and an energetic way."
good,"A theme you will here regularly is;"
good,I do not care to write a summary as I worked contract.  As far as I could tell the company is a great place to work despite the difficult financial condition of the company.  Turnover in top management was difficult considering the transition of business processes.
good,"The pay was nice, however, with it being unionized, seniority and laziness is more protected than better workers. There is also very little to no transparency from upper and lower management."
good,I learned a lot about account ability . When you are responsible for something handle it yourself and don't depend on someone else. The hardest part of the job was getting in and out of account in a timely manner.
good,"The company has been going through several changes. Several department have been sent over to India depleting certain job opportunities within. "
good,"- Reviewing your paper work to figure out what's the best way to get what you need to get done within that day. Taking 5 minutes to review your paper work can save you 2 hours of wasted time."
good,"My time at Dean Foods was good. I'm leaving due to facility closing."
good,"Disconnect between decision makers and every day producers. Good people, stretched thin working 40 hours. Lower people required to work much more. Awareness of what is actually done to complete work is very low from higher ups."
good,"Thought I would have longevity with this company, not the case. Uncertain future. Great place to work, however. Above average salary, flexible scheduling, average benefits."
good,Company was decent.  I had a good GM and Sales Manager.  This division is not typical of most of Dean Foods.  I was not cultivating new business.  I was managing a large account.  We were one of the most profitable divisions in the company.  We are now dissolved as the account purchased their own dairy.
good,Day starts at 5 am at warehouse. load your truck with fresh product 45 min later  your off to first delivery depending on your route could be school or business.  You have certain number of drops per day. pick up empties or out of code products and make order for next day. Back to warehouse and unload empties and end day.
good,Dean Foods is a great company overall to work for with the benefits and confidence they are a strong company. Advancement within the company is almost impossible and all corporate positions have been moved to Dallas. Multiple company-wide conference calls and emails say they are working on this issue but have yet to make much progress.
good,Nice co-workers but management needs some work.  Decent pay and nice benefits.  Recommend working there but really no advancement available.  Learned a lot on the job.
good,"Great Company, but in a basic commodity market, they lack the data to make informed decisions, and operate in somewhat fractured silos.  Sales, Logistics, and operations are not always on the same page, and the structure to move forward is not in place.  Also, they are operating in a declining commodity market, and still act as if they are invincible in terms of margin expectations."
good,"Place could just use some fresh blood and new ideas "
good,"While I  enjoy assisting customers solve issues with delivery of their products, It is also the most difficult part of my job.  I consider a successful day is when I can satisfy a customer's needs and know that I represented Dean Foods in a professional manner."
good,"It is great company to work for, however, there is no room for growth."
good,"Going to work not worrying about being late. Can start any time I get there as long as the job is completed that day."
good,"It was a good place to work for, they took good care of the employees free ice cream clothing work boots and tool allowance"
good,I have enjoyed my time here at Country Fresh but the time has come in my life to find something more challenging. I have recently completed my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management and am looking for something that utilizes my assets more. The thing I will miss most about Country Fresh is the people I work with. How well we get along with one another is truly a testament to the teamwork that goes in within the organization.
good,The work was fast pace. Some of the co-workers were lazy. You could did a lot of your work on your own. the best part of the job was you get off early
good,"Morningstar Foods is a very good place to work. I learned a lot from the organization. I didn't have a degree,yet the things I learned over the past 12 years was quite rewarding. A daily routine consisted of posting lots of payments and dealing with issues as they developed. I dealt with not only my peers,but my manager and director as well. I learned how to be the support, and how to research transactions,in a timely manner,also to remain focused on the project at hand. I guess the hardest part of the job was at the end of the month. This was what we had worked for all month,closing the books. The most enjoyable was after month end, Reward time was always a plus. We would get together as a group with managers,and our Director for appreciation and gratitude."
good,Great place to work. Plenty of opportunity to move up. Upper management is great and willing to assist with any questions that you have. Fast paced environment.
good,"It has been some time since I've worked at Dean, almost 5yr  I was brought on as a consultant to repair a poorly deployed Nexus environment but ended up helping with other projects.  Despite being a consultant, I was integrated into the team almost immediately.  The culture was very collaborative and I have lasting relationships w/many of the staff to this day."
good,This company is in fact a good company to work for. They pay very well and care about there employees. Working in rough weather conditions was not my favorite thing to do but the job had to be done. Reliable work was my most favor part of working there. No rain outs or anything like that. You get to meet people at all the stores that you servive and develope relationships.
good,"Worked seasonal one season, then hired in, pay is good benefits better then previous jobs. Not a bad schedule Monday thru Thursday ; and opportunity for OT on fridays."
good,I retired from Deans and wouldn't return. Management has changed a great deal since my tenure and I don't think I would fit in. The location to my home was the best advantage.
good,Good place to work. Team mentality abounds. Lots of work overtime is voluntary and plenty if you want it. Good training and new employee protection program. Plenty of variety and learning opportunities.
good,"Nice place to work. Staff is helpful and happy. Always smiling and care about you. If you are lucky the end users will give you compliments and good words about your hard work, and they appreciate you giving them the attention to make their days as brightly as possible."
good,"Training my employees and manager how to work smarter, meeting sales and logistic demands along with operation partnership. Working with team with new tracking tools and productivity measures."
good,Dean is a very supportive place to work with a great CEO and executive team. Freedom to make decisions and the team trusts employees that have a good track record
good,"It is a great place to be if you are looking for steady growth in a slow growth industry.  Great people culture, very good balance with professional career and personal life."
good,"It is ok to work there, I've learn a lot of something there and have fun w/.the others, not really a problems w/.manegement, the hardest part is sometime involve into long day work overtime"
good,didnt like 2nd shift i am a early riser great place to work mannag was fair the only thing is that parts were slow in comeing that is all i have to say
good,Deans food company is a very nice place to work. Deans foods has a very friendly environment and the managment is wonderful. The work is very easy but sometimes fast paced. Deans is a wonderful place to work.
good,We worked an average of 65-70 house a week for Dean Foods so they personal life was a little difficult. The drivers were very helpful when needed and would help at any cost great workplace. Management was new to their roles so a lot was not known and there were some poor decisions made. Hardest part of the job was keeping others inventory down while they were out or on vacations. The money was good because we also got commission checks each month but we did loose our largest account in CVS which lead to downsizing. I learned new delivery areas to expand on my knowledge of the Mid Atlantic.
good,"Family based company. Job can be a stressful, very high paced, can be demanding, hours vary highly, demand based business."
good,"This is a union job. Work all holidays except Thanksgiving and Christmas. One personal day, no sick days. This is a fast paced job, because I work in a lab testing, changes often and customers request different testing, so this keeps things interesting."
good,"A task oriented business that provides you the tools and equipment to do your job and succeed. My typical day begins often times in the early morning hours. I punch in go to my assigned tractor and hook up to my assigned trailer and head off to my first delivery of the day. I will deliver all the stops on my trailer and return to the dairy where I unhook from my trailer, fill out the necessary paperwork, and go home.  My particular department affords me and entrusts in me my abilities to get the job done without any interference. My Co-workers are all friendly and very helping. The most enjoyable part of my job is, my independence. Sometimes when working for a large company, one tends to become just a number. I am looking for the opportunity to become part of a tight knit family environment, and to a company that really appreciates and is thankful for the contributions of its employees"
good,This was a very fast paced job.  A day started out with processing orders and organizing them by departure time.  As soon as that was done we would start filling orders by truck.  Each person would take a truck and not stop until it was filled with orders.  You would start at the top of the order and drive an electric pallet jack filling the milk orders along the way.  Pace was a huge factor so you usually had to think about what you had to pick next as you picked the current product.  Precision was key.  If you missed a product the customer would not receive it which not only hurt our business but theirs as well.  We would also have to check the quality of the product as we picked the items.  If there was a problem with the label or if a jug was leaking they had to be replaced before they were shipped out.  I learned a lot about being fast and precise.  Both were very key to customer satisfaction and if you couldn't do both then there was no point in showing up to work.  The most difficult part of the job was being fast while sliding heavy crates of milk (up to 190 pounds) onto your pallet while being precise.  Multi-tasking was a huge part of the job.  The coworkers were great.  Everyone had a good understanding of each other and worked together to get the job done day in and day out.  If we didn't get a long then we would of had a lot of problems.  If someone fell a little behind then everyone would get together to pick up the slack.  The coworkers were definitely the best part of the job.  You felt like you were really part of a team.  If someone called in sick and was replaced
good,Great customers and excellent product. Have learned a lot about sales and customer service.
good,"Great employee workforce.  The biggest challenge is simply due to the space that Deans operates in.  Dairy consumption is generally flat to declining and, as a result, the company is frequently subject to significant cost cutting and restructuring initiatives.  Job security is frequently uncertain."
good,I have learned several aspects related to distinct departments within the company.
good,"A typical day included answering phone calls from primary customers - Wal-Mart Dairy managers. Keying orders into ROS Rams (AS400). Processing dairy orders for production and shipping for Point of Delivery Customers. Management was relaxed and easy to work with as well as co -workers. Not necessarily the hardest part, but the most time consuming was processing customer credits and settling routes for reconciliation. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers on a daily basis. They were a wonderful group of people to work with and without the customer the business can not function."
good,This job was a good fit and the hours were not excessive. There is some freezer work involved in the plant. The only reason I left was I got another offer with better pay from another company.
good,I've enjoyed working with Dean Foods throughout my 14 years with the company.  Through hard work and successes I was given the opportunity to advance within the company.  Dean Food has a tremendous reputation in the market for delivering quality products and providing excellent service.
good,I had set days to work.I did all the ordering and stocking.I have a Boss that lets me do my job.The hardest part of is when have cuts on my orders and it makes my customers upset. I enjoy my job because i enjoy working with my customers.
good,"Great atmosphere, departments work well together, great benefits (medical, dental, 401K, sick time and vacation time. Too much micromanagement though."
good,"it’s pretty decently paced. a lot of micro managing happens here, and you have to be careful with your time, you get a point for everything, you’re not allowed to take time off unless you say you’re taking time off 2 days in advance. if your sick and have to go home, you get a point, if you have an emergency regardless of the situation you get a point. the people there are lovely, the work is fine, it’s just the managing. that sucks"
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with. Downside was 3 restructures in the 4 years I worked there which affected many talented people having their positions eliminated.
good,The job is very easy I love my position the pay is excellent and but the hours can sometimes be long the loads are very easy and the new management is very poor not good they don’t listen to the worker or take their advice
good,"I would go back in a heart beat, everyone cares about you, will help you anyway they can, if you give 100% this place will treat you well."
good,"Dairy company not compatable with the family life , the pay is good , Have to be willing to work over time on short notice when workers call in or leave early ."
good,Dean Foods offers Good Benefits. The management was great and HR seemed to care about the employee. Pay was good the hours were long. Management worked with me to curb the work load. Overall a great place to work. Experience was a good one for me.
good,"I’ve learned a lot working for Deans for 10 years now. Worked in 2 departments, Customer Service & Billing.  I’ve learned a lot of about the company and myself. Such as, how the company works, working with distributors and drivers. Everyone is very nice and welcoming. We are like a family. Some management needs some work."
good,Working for this company is okay. Better pay would be nice but the work is not hard so  i guess the pay is what it is. Some of the supervisors were good leaders and the others weren't.
good,Some good people I wish I could've retired from here I was very committed to my job and work with a smile on my face all day even after. A 18 hour shift 6 days A week.
good,Clean environment
good,Dean Foods is a company that has good pay and good benefits.  The hardest part of the job is the constant weight you lift during the duration of the workday.
good,"The department that I worked in was amazing, great people, great work. The job it self was stressful at times, but well worth it. Rewarding because you learn a lot about the international business of shipping food products to other countries."
good,"Very large company, involved in multiple food product lines and has good reputation in the dairy industry. Extensive ability to move up withing the company if one is a good employee"
good,Great people and overall company to work for. Plenty of opportunities to advance in this workplace. Management is well established and willing to and open to opinions.
good,"Day to day operations"
good,"There is some disorganization in the Senior Leadership, not always a consistent message and there are some silos as a result. But overall a good company to work for. Lots of tenure and they promote from within. If you are a performer you will be rewarded with opportunity."
good,Great pay and benefits I got to meet new people daily. This job was like owning your own business it was commissioned based so the more you sold the more you made.
good,The good would be the people. I would rather not talk about the bad;  They did help me raise a family.  I'm just sorry they are having hard times and I hope they can come back from this.
good,"Nice place to work for, everyone is very helpful. Learning new systems was always good and appreciated all the assistance they offered as I offered them."
good,"Work Life Balance environment"
good,"fast paced job pays ok for what you're doing early morning hours, customers can be difficult but management is helpful I would work there again plenty of overtime"
good,Dean's food is a good company to work for .but unfortunately the plant that I work at is going out of business. I'm a maintenance mechanic there the work experience was and is very good .
good,I learned a lot about how milk was made and processed. I enjoyed working for the company and interacting withe the people on my route. I appreciate the opportunity to have worked for that company.
good,Excellent people and nice place to work. Customer service needs improvement. Need to focus more on training and development of employees within the organization.
good,It was a good company to work for. I really dont have that strong of an opinion as it was so long ago. If they are offering a job you should take it if you need it.
good,"•	Providing release management by configuring Jenkins, chef as well as doing CI/CD for applications using these tools."
good,"Nice work environment with great pay."
good,Sometimes we work long hours but the pay is great. The hourly wage starting pay is higher than just about any warehouse in Springfield.  You gonna work for it but it’s well worth it
good,"Dean Foods is a union based company, with set guidelines and rules to follow.  I was hired with Deans as a Seasonal Worker the union contracted us for a 3 month period.  I enjoyed the fast pace learning of each department, the confidence to mico manage myself, problem solve and resolve any machine problems that would arise.  Seeing I was brought in for short term seasonal help, Deans was very short staffed as far as management or maintenance being of much assistance.  On the job training was short and brief.  This I found as a challenge to achieve the goals and deadlines of operations.  Using basic common sense was a must, as well as asking questions or for assistance if needed to problem solve. I worked many 12-16 hour day, mainly when working 2nd shift.  In the culture and milk industry, you have to stay until the orders of the day are complete.  This insured product delivery as scheduled, and without product waste.  (shelve time)"
good,"I had intended to retire at Dean Foods, but unfortunately there was a very extensive re-structure that ended up eliminating my position in the field and I would have had to relocate to be retained by the company."
good,Though my time there was an 12 month contract. I was treated as an employee and invited to all company functions.Also they had a great culture during my experience there...
good,"some area's our easy depending on what department you get put in."
good,Still the highest rated place to work for me as far as skilled co workers and top notch management. if the pay was better I might have never left. Would consider returning there.
good,Family friendly and fun place to work. benefits are amazing and I wasnt aware that the room for growth was so big. Den foods wants to grow their family.
good,We load and unload trucks.  The management was friendly to everyone. I enjoyed the fun co workers. I learned how to load and unload trucks and make use of some equipments.
good,Good company to work for.  Consistent route and work week is Monday through Friday.  No extra holidays off.  Responsible for delivery and pickup of excess product.  Some extra runs may be needed.
good,its hard to review a company that bought out your old company. Foremost dairy was bought out and dean foods spent over a million in the equipment. The previous employees were super lazy and ended up stealing a lot of product. the plant eventually shut down due to the employees and nothing dean foods could do about it.
good,i cleaned the facility of butter and made sure that the production was ready for the next week.  I learned how to operate machines and stack boxes on pallets
good,I don't want to write a review on this company. This company no longer exist. The company went out of business. I was very young when I began working there so at the time it was just a job.
good,I liked the job. I liked that they let you sample the ice cream. I was let go because there was no work and because a machine was broke and they couldn't get the part to fix it.
good,Just time to move on. Had the best job but time for a new field. I liked that I was able to do my job with out being micro managed. Supervision only came around if there was an issue. Which was almost never. I was allowed to take care of it myself and just inform them of the results.
good,"Solving complex business problems , working with cross functional teams , leading kaizen events , executive presentations,team building,travelling to different facilities across US"
good,Learned to manage staff and write policies.  Great Team Members.  8 - 5 job.  Approve payrolls for SOX Compliance for publicly traded company.
good,"After sending 17 years at Schepps Dairy, I can honestly say that I enjoyed my time there.  The management team was extremely competent and worked well with their assigned employees. The overall compensation package for the management / supervisory team was fair, however below the average for their positions in the industry."
good,"Human resources, wouldn't let further your knowledge within the company.  They needed better management and some departments."
good,Good company to work for.  I learned the milk business and I learnd there operations. I was able to work with great co-workers who help me understand how the company worked.
good,"An ok place to work. Really liked the people and the supervisors were the best. The work was repetative and once you got used to the process, it was a snap."
good,"PO Reconciliation"
good,"Early mornings, hard working days the most enjoyable part of the day is getting off going home."
good,"Family atmosphere among the workers, entertaining at times.  Productive workplace with each knowing and doing their jobs, easing the workload for others."
good,Great Company to work for.. hardest part of my job was seeing the plant Close..
good,Great place to work don`t like driving the late hours. They have a great pay . and lots of great poeple working at the dairy
good,"start on re-labling, re-stacking,re-palting,and order filling. Fixing broken,miss stacked product,over run labels on product. Inventory, staging,and placement of product.Porduct order filling on pallets,shrink rapping full order pallets,loading and unloading of products off trucks."
good,"Highly-motivated,and diverse industry.  Hardest part is long hour at month end closed, and the most enjoyable part is the company outings and holiday parties."
good,"While I was there, we worked 4 10 hour days.  This is good for work life balance.  The team has been there a long time and the turnover rate is minimal."
good,My boss gave me the opportunity to learn all I could while I worked here. I built servers as needed and also traveled to different sites to install the backup servers.
good,Great employees.  A positive learning environment where growth and development was encouraged. Allowed for independent working and very little micromanagement.
good,"A good place to work, good management, good work life balance, work in a cross functional team. Pay is good and you have a chance to become a full time employee if everything turn out to be fine."
good,Typical day at work consists of quality assurance of all product being produced by the plant as well as safety of all team members working in your area
good,"my weekly work schedule changes, there is no way to plan. Our management team is awesome. the start time on most routes are very early."
good,Nice place to work ; decent salary and good benefits; good environment; up to date equipment.
good,My experiment working at this company was well challenge and I learn a lot from my co-workers and management the short time I was there.  I would love to have the opportunity to apply again to this company if was available to me.
good,"A fast-paced environment, but great support given. Promotes from within and values employees, their tenure and their contributions. Probably allows some under-achievers to stay longer than they should. Although my position was eliminated after 13 years, I have nothing but glowing things to say about this company!"
good,"Loved working in Transportation, crew was awesome. Good pay better benefits.Management was cool really diverse workforce. Learned a lot about the dairy industry."
good,Experience in SAP Systems enhanced my retail experience its a billion dollar industry with plants all over the globe. Enjoyed the people and Management team on hand
good,"busy day, great crew to work with "
good,Much knowledge and experience over the course of the years with this company.  Management is great.  Teaching and learning with other team members is a plus
good,enjoy your job .and your employees learn your jobs so you can teach other learn more about the job enjoy with my family and freinds  on work safe onthe job
good,Its a pleasure working for Dean Foods.  I have learned very valuable skills and life lessons over my 22 years at the company. I have made life long friendships as well.
good,"The salary was great, and the hours were long for management.  Very demanding position, and challenging, overall.  I was able to grow with Dean Foods."

good,I think this was a great company to work for. They were very flexible and had good health benefits. I would recommend this company to others looking for route sales jobs.
good,"It is enjoyable place. Everybody help each other when someone is in need, Month end is usually busy the first 5 days of the month. Closing the warehouse sometimes is a stressful when some PO's are not properly closed at the plant. Work closely with the management team at the plant. They are all helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was able to talk to all management team .Work with the internal and external auditor."
good,Started as a temp and ended up getting hired on full time after two years. Always looked forward to going to work no matter how long the hours. Had a long enough lunch to leave the building and get some fresh air.
good,"I enjoy working with the people that I am currently around and taking calls from different personalities on a daily basis. The company itself does not value their employees. The customer service department is contracted through another company (Vertex). Yes, they have great benefits, but I have been with this company going on 3 years and have not had a raise going on 2 years. Actually, no one has! They lead you to believe there is room for advancement, but there is not. I am a people person therefore I love going in and helping my co-workers daily, but....I do not want to continue to down talk my current employer, but the time has come for me to find a company that appreciates their employees and values the dedication they have for the company."

good,"Well paid, but, under staffed, almost no time off that works out for family. The people are great. We are all in it together."
good,Install and maintain production and packaging equipment.
good,Great place to work but consolidation of business is occurring in industry. Which leads to uncertainty. The leadership however is really concerned about employees.

good,"This was a wonderful family owned company, with lots of caring employees which were helpful in advancement for all, most employees stood at Swiss for a long time. "
good,"I am a little unsure of our current stability.  When I came to work for Dean Foods our stock was trading in the $20 range, now it is in the $4-5 range.  There were 67 plants, now there are in the 50's.  Our first EHS conference had over 130 attendees, now less than 50 EHS professionals.  I am just not sure how stable the company is."
good,"I enjoy working the team and management, my experience has been great.  My days end with a positive note, I get appreciated by my supervisor."
good,Work with a lot of good people.  It's been a lot of fun.  It's too bad this plant had to close their doors.  I raised my three kids with Dean foods help.

good,"A great place to work but no real job security, unfortunately, poor performers are not accountable and the workers who excel have little motivation beyond their personal work ethic."
good,"this was a very good company to work for, I had always imagined I would retire from here, but Meijer decided to talk over the Ice Cream division and my job was dissolved"
good,Great company to work for I had a great time there.The company is moving to a new location that is about 65 miles one way from my house. So I'm looking for a job that is closer to home.

good,This was a great company to work for. I was proud to see Dean Foods products in every food store I visited. There was too much travel but with a geographically dispursed enterpirsie this is expected.
good,Fast pace production that requires your full attention but nevertheless good working practices. I like how well they focus on training with the machinery
good,going to work on a typical day it would start out slow  until we get all the machines up and running half gallons and gallons  take your counts the day was smooth untill you had to swich styles but over all it was enjoyable.. management was laid back  there day was pretty much over when my shift started but it was nice.the culture was mellow ..the hardest part of that job was cleaning up 2000 gallons of spilled milk.. the most enjoyable part of the job was working holidays that was triple time pay
good,Great place to work.  Lots of good people and experience in the organization. Gained many value added skills that have advanced my career going forward.
good,Learned so much working in the Tax Department at Dean Foods.  Best culture EVER.  Management tried to keep employees motivated.  Participated in events at Dallas Food Bank.
good,"I enjoyed very much the people I worked with. Each day began and ended in the same manner of cooperation from both management and other coworkers. My sadness in leaving was the lack of advancement opportunities. With raising a young family, the hours needed to make both a career and family run smoothly were not available. Had I been able to move to day shift I would have loved to continue on."
good,When Deans Foods took over Friendship Dairies the changes made to the plant & the work schedules improved greatly !! More jobs & better management.
good,Good place to start and work your way up great staff some people were honest and friendly and you work hard but you get paid for it so everything really balances it self out
good,Cost accounting for all production plant s is being consolidated into the Fort Worth shared services location. This allows for greater sharing and support between many cost accountants and area controllers. Monthly government reporting is being standardized and made more efficient.
good,"The culture is great compared to previous organizations.  It is family oriented-at least I’m my department-and everyone works to get the job done!"
good,Great salary and benefits!! Management was good as well!! I would recommend this place of employment. I highly recommend for salary and benefits as well as balance of worklife.

good,"I learned how to work in corporate america. "
good,"A typical day at work involves coming in meeting with previous shift Supervisor. Getting the passdown and getting my plan together for my shift. Finish up production and begin CIP and sanitation duties while finishing up production. Something I have learned in the Dairy business is working with PLC control systems. Not everyday is going to be the same. The culture at our facility was a team but felt more like a family. The hardest part of the job is walking away from it. I feel the most enjoyable part of the job is when People come to visit our facility from other plants or corporate is seeing them walk through our facility and compliment how it looks, or how the moral is."
good,"I went to my Supervisor with a concern. He told me he would get back to me in a couple days. 2 weeks later talked to him again about it and again was told give me 2 more days.After over a month, I resigned due to safety concerns."
good,"a very fun, place to work. stuff got done, and morale was high.. great management. "
good,"The factory is good to work in. Many coworkers have been at the site for many years. Almost all of the employees care about the business and our own results. Factory won Plant of the year for two years in a row and are on track for a third year. Very nice facility, well-maintained only 10 years old. Union environment with good relationship with managers. Management team is open, they listen and do a good job to address problems head-on. Good leaders who are fair and try to do the right thing. We have monthly town halls, employee round table meetings, improvement teams, celebrations when we hit or exceed targets. It's not all perfect but I'm excited about where we are and the future looks brighter than ever."

good,"Helps knowing what I'm going to run on a daily basis"
good,"Typical day would be steady with periods of fast paced days, depending on pay periods, month end closing, tec. Management was great, open door policy existed.

The most enjoyable part of working was the great people, benefits, and pay."

good,a typical day at work at dean foods is long hard work in a stressful environment. I worked in the cooler doing a variety of different jobs. I worked as both team member and individual. I had to keep up with the pace of my fellow employees in order to get our jobs done. the cooler is a cold and loud area which can be hard to work in at times.
good,The company was good to work for doubt have very many complaints  if any people are good and job is good and pay is fair i just couldn't relocate  at the time

good,"I worked for this company for a few months. thru an agency. coworkers were great worked with both shifts. great supervisors, I hope to go back soon."
good,"A typical day at this temporary position was to drive to four Walmart locations each weekday as needed. I would get to each store, and first check all of the displays that show our product, checking to see what products were missing or low. When I found what I needed to refill, I would grab the products from the back and stock them, as well as rotating them for the closest expiration date to the front, and eliminating the expired products. I would then rotate the other products that had not needed filling. "

good,"This was a fun place due to the teams I worked with and the various technologies we used.  One would think that a dairy company wouldn't do much with IT but without it, the various dairies and depots wouldn't be able to accomplish their activities.  My only regret is that they switched to different singular contract company so the staffing company I worked with lost the contract with Dean leaving me unable to continue working on the project."
good,pay and benefits are good. lots of overtime. very fast paced and challenging. it is a start up plant with its hurdles many that have overcome. cold working environment in some areas.
good,I am in management. I think all managers have given me a fair shot and let me give my opinion on issues we are having. My boss is willing to guide me and not make fun of any questions I have.
