bad,"i took this job in kennesaw ga trying to change my truck driving options so i interviewed knowing at the time it would be a 40,000 per year pay cut money isent everything!!! so that hired me from day one i was bullied call fat and was made and trained  to be Dummed  down like the rest of the clowncrew there was one other driver there that was good to me and tryed  to teach me ( he is way overqualified to be there) the manger/ old owner ? who knows who cares if he has money dude all luck because he is way to dumb to grow a company the dispatcher runs the place think about  dispatcher he‚Äôs a control freak he only controls people at work i heard he still lives with mommy lol üòÇ stay away not everyone is bad but the few that are made it miserable!! i got fired for meeting that only happed half of the time?? best thing that every happped to me now i‚Äôm back making 90k a year!"
bad,I worked there for a month when slow was sent home every time.. poor managment if u like your Saturdays dont go here. They use you in this place until you quit
bad,It's okay working here but there is favoritism for surtin employee's they don't care about nothing else but moving product and they write u up for anything
bad,"People need to be warned about this company. Never in my life have I worked for a more unprofessional & heartless company. They don‚Äôt train you for entry level jobs but expect you to be an expert after a few days of zero training. I would constantly hear the person training me mock me to the other coworkers without realizing I could hear everything. Management did nothing when I voiced my concerns about not being trained. I‚Äôm pretty certain the person ‚Äútraining‚Äù me intentionally sabotaged me to fail. Beacon doesn‚Äôt care about their employees, the turnover rate is astonishingly high, and it‚Äôs very clear why."
bad,"Would not work there, mangners do not communicate with their employees to help them to be better in customer service."
bad,"Every day was stressful and pushed to work faster by the manager and dispatch. In this place i learned that they don't care about the job nor do they care about your wellbeing. They push you to do unsafe work even though each Monday morning we have a safety meeting. Theres not a drop of equality what so ever and manager has select people to which he will give a raise to. But if you like this industry, better go to ABC."
bad,"I would not recommend. Need a new evaluation, place is a zoo. This place need better management. There is no good pros only bad. If you like hard work this for you."
bad,"No matter how desperate you are for a¬†job, or how annoyed you may be at your current job this is not your option."
bad,"The A/P department has an intelligent group of ladies, but the policies and procedures are highly unclear. The managers do not communicate. There is a lot of passive aggressive behaviours and practices."
bad,They will work you till 10pm at night while being there at 5:30 in the morning. Make you load roofs that aren't safe and don't follow osha standards. they dont pay you well.
bad,"0 room for growth, no support from management, a very unappreciated position, low  moral. Unrealistic deadlines with the workload, management not assuming accountability for their lack of support towards field worker's."
bad,People always fighting arguing no respect for each other or customers. Equipment is always breaking and not safe. Rules don‚Äôt apply to everyone. Management will not resolve issues
bad,"The company was doing really good until Beacon Roofing Supply bought it over. Beacon is a joke! Low salary and lack of care for their employees. They will let people go even though they need all the help they can get and by that, over work their employees all the way to the ground. They will not give a raise if any at all."
bad,"I worked their for 8 months and it's an butt kicker for back breaking work. Warehouse management is awful, no direction and no back bone. The work environment is awful with coworkers that are toxic in nature. The forklifts are not taken care of nor serviced very often and workers pound the snot out of them. There are only 4 forklifts and had 5 workers. The building itself is in poor shape. Don't waste your time."
bad,"Would not recommend to any ...they lie about local delivery....they have u doing all the deliverys that make no sense manger is dumb and does not know how to run company. Not a fun place to work to much stress, no communication at all ,  thier Is no dispatch to give you ur routes u have to figured it out on ur own , while off the clock , warehouse Forman is a joke , always high on the forklift bumping into things breaking stuff"
bad,"Overall.....i liked it there being a 5 year employee.  Until I got fired because..."" My name was on ""the list""  I liked it because I did my own thing, busted my butt and stayed away from drama...which there is plenty of in St.Paul #694."
bad,"The  new manager should be removed from the Vaughan company "
bad,Don't pay equally. Management doesn't tell the truth. Can't generate paperwork for loads correctly. Then you are responsible for overweights.  Poor computer system.
bad,"Poor management and no advancement unless you are ""in"" with the right people.  Managers very difficult to work with.  Constant Manger changes and high turnover."
bad,Terrible management.   Everyone eventually ends up fired from this employer.  They love firing employees from one end of the country to the other.  High turn over of staff.  Not employee friendly environment.  Hard labour work with no benefits or rewards at end of day   I would recommend to pass working for this company.  Lots of better places to work.
bad,"Management knew absolutely nothing about roofing or even trucks. Employees ran the place and got away with anything. The place was a joke. Everything is public. Get reprimanded in front of all employees, include all employees on personal matters. Illegal practices against private matters."
bad,"MANAGERS are bullies. They say on a daily basis that they don't micromanaged, but that's all they do. They take no advice. Constantly put so much work on you that there is absolutely NOWAY to succeed. Manager over ordered and had the warehouse full to capacity and used others as scape goats. Horrible place to work.  Spend most of there day together laughing, joking, and playing on their phones. The funny thing is they think people don't realize it."
bad,Stay away. management looks out for family members only. Be very careful who you voice complaints to. You may be talking to a relative of a family member in management! They will promote their family members even though not qualified for position!
bad,"Here is my overview of the Company in Dartmouth NS."
bad,"Product and clients are great.  Real problem with management and company culture.  Feels like Beacon prefers to hire people right out of college with no experience in the industry and train them for management positions...  Unless you fit in their narrowly defined ""leadership potential"" category - forget any advancement opportunities.  Management has unreasonable expectations of what can actually be accomplished during the day by a single person and feel like they get in the way more then help taking care of business."
bad,This company preaches safety safety safety but when it comes down to getting the job done safety goes right out the window. All the micromanagers are full of s*** and racist towards anyone who isn't irish they only hire women in the office because  they know they can get over on them.allied has the worst reputation in the building supply industry. You walk in this company as a manager / driver / salesman ops manager/ forklift operator for only one pay. Both branch and regional managers are terrible people and couldn't manage their way out of a paper bag. Honestly don't know how this Branch still makes money and could afford to stay open with all the stupid mistakes
bad,"The interview was extremely misleading. Promises were made regarding trajectory, day to day responsibilities, and work life balance that were blatantly false. At beacon, you will work 545-5 pm every day unless you are in corporate or upper management. DLPs priority is the front counter- not operations. You will basically work as a glorified cashier for 12 hour days. The only positive within this program is the pay and overtime. Other than that...The DLP program is over hyped.  Upper management uses this program as an ego booster. They do not look for innovation. They look for people that will fall in line and parrot their old fashioned business ideology. I have no respect for this program nor management"
bad,"I worked at Beacon Supply aka Best Distributing. Manager and friends run branch like high school. They dispatch drivers and know anything about truck driving or the layout of this valley. Deliveries are always late. Manager will also keep you down, no advancement. Manager doesn't want anyone to rise past them. They degrade drivers and warehouse personnel. Talk to them like children, the manager and their friends. Wouldn't recommend this company to anyone unless the current manager is removed."
bad,They don't value their employees. The manager will smile in your face and then will fire you without having enough respect to tell you to your face. You break your back for them and they throw you out like trash
bad,"Poor management 100%!! Worked my tail off for alright pay. Got along with co-workers and enjoyed the job duties. Got picked on and put in dangerous situations on jobs against safety guidelines and normally kept my mouth shut, but ‚ÄúHey, the job needs to be done!‚Äù Figured out no one really cared about me, at the job and manager used company money for his own. Lasted a good 4 months but management created a personal vendetta with me and I didn‚Äôt like it so I left with bills that I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to be able to pay off."
bad,I applied and got all these promises in which I never saw. Forklift drivers text and drive forklift at same time. You can't breathe without being told
bad,"This is actually not a bad company to work for if you are content with the job you were hired in to do. Most of my coworkers and lower positions of management were good people that I enjoyed working with. Equipment age and quality varies, but overall is not bad. Pay is generally adequate and fair for the market. PTO is fair. The medical plan is certainly not the best I have seen but it isn‚Äôt the worst, either. I honestly have just one gripe, but it is a big one. There will NEVER be a path for career growth and development for most positions. This company is notorious for its practice of pigeon-hole-ing its employees. Middle management will look you square in the eyes and tell you otherwise, but don‚Äôt let them fool you. Do your own research before you waste any of your own time here. This company does not and will not promote from within."
bad,"Pay is low, benefits are not that great, no incentivies, and brings back fired employees. Need I say more."
bad,"Can be a great place to work if management would listen to there employees about things. Management needs to know what is going on, because at times they have no clue what's going on. Change of management would make everyone happy and a better place to work."
bad,"Worked for them for 26-1/4 years, through a company they acquired.  Was a great company to work for prior to the Allied Building Products acquisition, then things slowly eroded over the last year and a half.  Poor management decisions, they don‚Äôt listen to employee concerns, and they put everything except their employees first.  A very negative and uninviting work environment."
bad,"Beacon was a better company before Allied. Allied was less corporate then Beacon, which caused all sorts of issues and conflicts. The corporate aspects were tedious at times, but look at the stock value. That tells the entire story."
bad,"The whole point of taking a local job was home life.  The problem is, the schedule is such a secret that you cannot plan a life with your family.  My first raise was significantly lower than promised, less than 1%.  "
bad,"No stock options for employees under 150Kish salary,"
bad,"Pay and benefits are decent. Medical was average. Managerment was poor and insufficient. You will have to work long hours and move heavy material by hand, with little to no help. But don't get hurt doing it. Because the manager will throw you under the bus for it. Everyone expect a few people are back stabbers, looking to due you over. You are expected to build, load , deliver, and unload your material. Witch takes time but to them you are still too slow. If an issue arises with a senior co-worker, the manager will side with that co-worker and transfer you with warning. Even if it's a longer commute, no room for advancement unless their want to advance you. Truck dispatching, can't even read a map, let alone get scheduling right. Most of the time you work without take a mandatory 30 min break, and get yelled out for doing so. But the scheduling doesn't let you take a break. I've made deliveries three times at separate times, too the same address in one day because of dispatch. You are a number to them that is all. If something happens to the truck or equipment it's your fault. And you have to deal with the repercussions from the DOT. They won't take responsibility for maintenance or equipment failure."
bad,constant infighting and complaints amongst coworkers good work fast paced just to keep to your self if you have an issue keep that to your self as well great warehouse guys and ops manager keep your head low and work
bad,Poor Management and hard to get paid from these guys. Lack of work available. On top of them not caring about their employees at all. They do everything half assed on top of it all.
bad,"This company boasts about how important its people are, but if your boss does not like you personally, he will be allowed to push you out the door, and HR will ignore your requests for help. Biggest waste of a year of my life to date."
bad,"The company is lacking in strong leadership, does not allow for empowerment, and micro manages everything. the key to any business is its people, Beacon will provide lip service yet in real time has no loyalty to anyone."
bad,"Some of the work environment is positive and most co-workers get a long well. For the sales numbers, most are unrealistic depending on the market conditions. Managers sometimes feel more like baby sitters than managers. The hardest part of the job is trying not to compete with ourselves (other locations). The one thing that I do enjoy about this job is the other mid-level employees."
good,Good job for people that have no kids or family managment takes complete advantage of worker's at time's working 14 to 15 hrs daily and appreciation from management or corporate
good,I took the job because I want to drive local but have kinda been doing everything but driving mostly just in the warehouse and have only been on the road when they need someone to drive 3 hours away because other drivers refuse
good,"Will collect and hold mistakes you make and use them as reasons why your not being advanced months later, instead of addressing the issues when they happen. Training is a joke. Shown bare minimum and expected to figure out best way for your self to do the jobs. Talk of advancement but haven‚Äôt seen any movement towards any of they."
good,"I was told this would be a temp to hire position and they did not hire me but kept stringing me along"
good,"I feel like Beacon would have been a great place to work, but I was hired by one person and then he was transferred to a new facility. So when I actually started, I was working for a new manager. She was unaware of the agreement in which the other manager and I had come to."
good,"Manager was out of control,  talked down to you . Very condescending and disrespectful. Had to leave company or possibly catch a case. Could only deal with his attitude for so long. Would not recommend job to anyone who has any self respect."
good,"I was started off at $16/hr with a Class A CDL. It took several months passed my ‚Äúprobation period‚Äù to have my review and request a raise. They were really understanding and helpful when my son was born and gave me adequate paid time off during the few days my son was in the NICU. It‚Äôs hard work, very laboring, hard on the body. But you‚Äôre sure to get strong and stay in shape. Early mornings, rain or shine, cold or hot, you‚Äôre working. Good safety equipment, but walking along rooftop on snow and ice just isn‚Äôt safe no matter what equipment you have. I wouldn‚Äôt say this was the worst place I‚Äôve worked at. I would have stayed had I been making more money. Winter time gets a little slower, summer time you‚Äôre working fast and long hours. Overall, a good experience."
good,Beacon Roofing Supply is a great company to work for. I believe if they continue on the upward swing that they are on they will not only surpassed the number one roofing company in the United States but they will remain on top beating ABC Supply buy a mile.
good,"Good company, but it's got seasonal hours... Roofing is construction so the weather effects hours, summer lots of OT winter 40 only, no exceptions."
good,"Hard to advance, promised a lot and it doesnt get fulfilled always working long hours dont have much time to spend with family and hard to get raises as well"
good,Load your truck and make sure you have everything you need for the morning time. The same for the afternoon's too.you never stop learning there. It was ok to with. Knowing everything in fast time. Learning new things though the time.
good,"As I started working with this company, the vision was all about people but with the new acquisition, it became a question of money money money and the people vision disappeared. Being an American based company, Canada was left in the dark and being recognized as a region and not a Country. They decided to manage key departments from the US which results in requiring the Canadian management team to absorb a lot more responsibilities added to an existing full plate. I tis sad to see the Canadian team struggle to make ends meet. However, I was fortunate to have worked with very competent people on the Canadian side."
good,"Often shorthanded, long hours, dirty work environment due to warehouse being old and not updated. Loved the people I worked with for the most part. Upper management blind to the fact that understaffing was the main reason many individuals did not want to stay. Assigned multiple tasks and not enough time to complete those tasks correctly and accurately."
good,"greta place to work at first however mgmt was poor. staff turn over was high, and as an employee i was promised many things like promotion and pay raise but it never happened"
good,"Great co-workers, a lot of knowledgeable people, a lot of development possibilities."
good,good place to work at liked working with the people there steady work ; friendly atmosphere clean safe environment . always have lots of work there. Easy to get along with the Boss
good,"Counter sales, special orders, taking orders over the phone."
good,"Fun place ,good structure,  safty culture ,hard work , hard advancemet , safety traning , content update on safety, hasmat traning, slow progress to advace"
good,Culture was friendly and relaxed.  Employees functioned in team format and willing to help others resolve issues and concerns.  Everyone worked together to achieve objectives.
good,"Depending on how many orders go out, myself and other warehouse employees come in around 5 A.M. We open the warehouse and load trucks with the mornings loads. Then around 6 A.M. drivers, roof loaders, office and some management come in. We stretch and make possible game plans for the day. We then usually start cleaning and organizing product. From 7 A.M. to 4 P.M. we have will calls, truck deliveries, transfers and have to build all the loads for the next day. We may have ten to twenty orders going out in the winter and up to fifty in the summer. We are usually driven to do more with no breaks and an optional lunch.I am usually to busy to take lunch. We work about 10 to 13 hours a day to accomplish everything needed."
good,"At the beginning not bad, a lot of hours and work and everything without leting us break any rules, laws and regulations and always everybody was getting treated good, I asked for a transfer and everything is totally different at this new branch and they dont care that much about employees breaking any rules or more."
good,"A typical day at work is producing about 200 boxes of downspout, load about 3 trailers (half). I learned a lot about the gutter business and roofing industry. Management is mediocre, shows some favoritism. The workplace culture is slow, hot in the summer, cold in the winter. The hardest part of the job is not having enough employees to effectively stay caught up, the most enjoyable part is the people I work with are down to earth."
good,"Early start, phone/counter, organize deliveries.  I've changed positions in this company over the 21 years I've worked here.  I've learned several areas of the business.  Management works along side employees.  Co-workers work as a team."
good,Its a good place to work if you are starting in the job industry. If you have a cdl licence class a or b its a good company to work at. If you are applying for a striker you need to be in good health condition because there is a lot of lifting walking etc. You will be working on 1story homes to 4 story apartments. Very physical job.
good,"This was a fast paced environment with taking customer order's and helping them load there trucks."
good,"Worked happily with this company for several years when it was Best Distributing. With corporate buyout by Beacon came many changes in way company functioned and operated including job titles, realignment and job loss. I learned a lot about time management during the workday while on this job and enjoyed working with almost everyone i encountered. The hardest part for me on this job was determining when to call it a day. I was used to getting a days work done in a day which this job just didn't allow. I got great satisfaction when i was able to complete a goal that i had looked at in the morning and thought would be hard to attain. Getting a call from one of the branches or from one of my peers thanking me for something i had helped them get done always made my day."
good,Beacon is a good company to work for. You will see some things that will concern you. If you do not have the ability to overcome adversity and power through you will have problems
good,"Would like to have made a career at Beacon. Unfortunately, consolidations of stores, delayed pricing of materials to the field, and questionable management decisions made for a turbulent culture."
good,"Management is good, and the culture is good. However, not very family friendly with work hours and expectations."
good,Great place to learn the roofing industry with meeting new customers on a daily basis. This company is focused on customer service and rewards valued employees with the opportunity for advancement.
good,A fast growing company with substantial resources focused on producing a sound customer service platform for it's customer base.  Many of the leadership team are excellent and focused on delivery of stated objectives.
good,"If you like working in the sun getting amazing cardio, this is the place for you. Manager is friendly and very easy to work with. It has good benefit packages."
good,Turn up the heat and set new sales records with little trickle down compensation to the men actually doing the hard work. It's hard to see a long term career when every day can be your last. Safety Bubble suits coming soon. I'm glad I left for more money and less work.
good,Beacon has grown by Acquisition of other companies. The corporate policies and procedures are not followed by all.  The Best division has does not follow Beacon Roofing Supply's hiring and promotion practices.
good,Enjoyed my time there. Nice people. Management needs to be more concerned with their employees and less about buying more companies.  The employees work hard and do not receive compensation for doing so. Company gave tiny raises and sometimes none at all.
good,"Here at beacon roofing supply i was hired as a forklift operator.The work environment was high pace and at times a bit stressful, but the make it work."
good,"Busiest in the morning time. Customers want to schedule delivery times for roofing loads. Only one truck for all of the deliveries in Kelowna. Usually dealing with the same customers which is good for establishing relationships. Most co-workers are easy to get a long with almost all of the time. Answering questions about roofing installation or materials. Getting to know the fluctuation of the market, and competitors pricing. Safety meetings weekly, and organizing yard and warehouse. Counting all material."
good,"Good opportunities for growth, lots of fun, so busy the day moves extremely quickly."
good,"Good people, superb work ethic, customer oriented. Though part of a large, publicly traded corporation, there is a sense of being in a smaller, locally owned business."
good,Good people to work with.  I came from manufacturing to distribution and it is very different.  More pressure and more micro-management in distribution.  Management is a little green and needs improvement.  It is all about the numbers and when you meet your numbers they want more.  Over all it is a good place to work.  The branch level works well and seems to be a family oriented work space.
good,Decent job.. it can be a little stressful  at times but otherwise its ok if you need a job. Its an umbrella job meaning theres different companies that sell corresponding products for building that are linked together under the beacon brand so that means you can switch locations if you dont like where your at.. honestly i think your succes depends on what type of person you are.. this stands true with most jobs.
good,"Beacon is an excellent place to work for, as long as the employee is willing to put in the long hours. While the hours might be long, the work is challenging, and the experience is very enticing."
good,I worked inside sales and also out in the warehouse for Beacon Roofing Supply. They have a great corporate base that is continually growing and getting better.
good,"Communicate with my staff and sales reps to insure the Credit Dept was aware of any issues, concerns, or completed tasks. I learned a different industry and enjoyed the challenge. Management was out of state and we communicated via phone calls."
good,"I enjoyed working for beacon because it was something very different from my other jobs, but i learned a lot working there. I would help costumers buy the best roofing material and i would make sure they left the store happy with their chooice."
good,I was part of a large lay off due to the company over extending itself.  They bought to many stores at once and did not predict the rainy spring this year. They were a great set of people to work for and I enjoyed my time there.
good,"When I started, there were a couple of dificult people there.  Once those people were gone, it got much more fun.  I like the people I work with.  It feels like a team now.  I like working hard and management recognizes my efforts and everyone's efforts.  Great place to work once the couple of negative guys were gone and not trying to cause problems for everyone else.  Great pay and time off."
good,its a good place to work I liked my job but I left to better my career by becoming a truck driver. the hard part is u just have to be willing to work and wanting to work for your family.
good,Everyone need a roof over their head.  This company provides the material. There are a multitude of installers nationwide that buy from this company.  Days are feast or famine.
good,Cant speak to all but the one in nashville The bosses were great. Coworkers were great. Good hours home nightly. Payed by the hour so you'll get overtime.
good,"Sold siding, windows, and roofing products wholesale to contractors.  Was responsible for day to day operations, purchasing and receiving, inventory management, and shipping and receiving."
good,"-Learn industry"
good,"Great compensation, Great pay, Terrible work/life balance... like most corporately ran companies.  Once they get you on salary, you are theirs."
good,Beaucoup d'avancement dans le service √† la client√®le.
good,It‚Äôs a great place to work if you don‚Äôt mind having people constantly arguing about what needs to be done. Working 12+hours with just one 30 min lunch. Nepotism is a huge problem at the one I work at. And if you don‚Äôt mind no having help lifting heavy items alone then yes beacon is a great company to work for. The company as a whole is great but as yard to yard it‚Äôs may very.
good,Awesome place to work. I really enjoy the people at Beacon and recommend it everyone. I have learned so much at Beacon. Everyone should apply at Beacon.
good,I enjoyed working a beacon the staff was cool the pay was great I was fun normally paced interesting jobs moderate work load never tiring always enthusiastic
good,"Beacon Roofing Supply is a an innovative company providing the latest in roofing supply materials. The IT Department is regionally located around the country. Management support is very good. Typical work includes handling Helpdesk support calls for end user account unlock and password resets, mainframe support, software and hardware troubleshooting and resolution. Due to having regional offices, all IT team members do not work in a central location. Work environment very family friendly."
good,"Ok. Long hours in summer, GET TAN.   Slow in winter. Atmosphere  is over all nice. Managers really care about employees.  Helpers arent helpers really"
good,"Great Place to work. Hours are not so good for people with families. Long hours during busy season, could be anywhere from 12-15 hours a day. They also like to run lean instead of hiring extra people."
good,"This is a great company to work for. Benefits, PTO, Guaranteed hours, Weekends off, stable. Some positions are demanding when it comes to physical labor."
good,"Enjoyed my years with Beacon and the team there. I was allowed to show my strengths and the management team constantly challenged me with new projects to work on. Once the challenges of these projects were corrected, I would train new employees to take over and then move on to new challenges from management."
good,"My experience at Beacon was great. Every day was a new chalenge. I had to support my team , I had to find a way to secure all sales, I was working with all insides and outsides sales representands to hight our sales and secur our risks, I was receiving and doing  many calls/ emails per days. I was making denounciations on all projects , making collection calland making final and partial wavers(quittances). I was meeting clients.  Working at Beacon was fun"
good,Enjoyed working at Beacon would have liked to continued working there. It was business choice to dissolve the consulting division which I was a part of.
good,Beacon roofing supply was a great company to work for. I can‚Äôt complain at all because honestly I‚Äôm it was one of the best jobs I ever had I would highly recommended this job.
good,"Great hours and the work will keep you physically fit. You will love the freedom and being your own pace setter. I loved it here. Give yourself a chance to learn the field, and you will"
good,Inqui√©tude sur la survie de la division du Qu√©bec ont regarde la diminution des heures et la comp√©tition avec sopr√©ma qui a changer la donne.
good,I have enjoyed my time here. I do wish there was there was more support in helping move up the chain. I feel like im ready to grow within the company and yet I keep getting told im not.
good,"Overseeing all accounting functions and dealt with Branch Manager issues at 17 locations.  Lots of analitcal reports, forecasting etc"
good,Great company to work for but pay can be better than what it is!!!!!!!!! Great management and stress free work place company great just the pay can be better!!!
good,Everyone I worked with had great personalities. Easy to work with and partnered up on every project. During site inspections site manager responded immediately to recommendations.
good,"Multiple opportunities to advance in career, great people to work with, excellent benefits,great set schedule, paid time off,  weekends and weekends off as well."
good,"My job was a Loader and swamper. Assisting the flatbed truck driver was my main job duty,  getting the order ready making sure the material was properly strap to the truck. Riding with the driver to the delivery spot.always checking the load and watching the road. Helping the driver when backing up.. Helping him with heavy machinery..pretty much his eyes on his blind side.  Then came  the fun part loading the materials on the roof we would use a conveyor to load the material, the driver would load while the swamper would stack on the roof sometimes vise versa depending on experience."
good,"The overall benefits at this company are great.  They pay for your life insurance, short/long term disability, and you get 3 floating holiday's a year on top of your normal vacation and sick days.  "
good,I recently applied and was a go in the branch office yet a new company Beacon who bought Quality denied me cause you need to be 10 years clear of a DUI. That‚Äôs absurd for any driving job. 3 years was able to get CDL now punished additionally is crazy
good,"I enjoyed working there im trying to reapply as of now.Very stable job good pay calm environment.The whole staff was positive friendly guys"
good,Man this job is awesome great pay great people and also you are helping the community build houses for the area great pay and you will get rewarded with the hard work you put in
good,"It was hard work and a consistent work environment. Making sure every customers order were correct to the tee."
good,"Very large, very competitive Corporation. Always expanding and acquiring smaller, related companies. They offer job stability, good wages, and great benefits for hard working people."
good,Fun and outgoing. Family environment. Great employees. Gym on site. Warehouse clean and proficient. Easy to make sales. Oppirtunities for advancement.
good,Beacon is the best company to work for. It's challenging. I love to compete & i have worked for numerous roofing distribution companies in the past. ABC supply being one of them. ABC is the largest roofing distribution in the nation & Beacon is # 2. I worked for ABC from 1991-2006 & Beacon is by far the best company to work for. I would like to eventually manage my own Branch at Beacon. I would start loading roofs & work my way up again if that's what it's going to take to get my foot in the door.
good,Beacon is an excellent company to work for. They are extremely busy and every day is completely different. I have gained a vast amount of training in the roofing industry.

good,"A typical day at this job was just stocking the semi truck to do deliveries to construction sites and unloading and stocking the shingles on the roofs. All the co workers were helpful and easy to work with. The hardest part was working under any weather condition, especially the rain."
