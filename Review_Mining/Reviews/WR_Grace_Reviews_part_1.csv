rating,review
bad,Good pay terrible manager and supervisor s . Cut throat culture with employees stepping on each other for benefits. Management doesn't care about employees only job orders. Treated like a slave
bad,This company is a joke and very incompetent. I will never use this company to try to find employment ever again!!! This place wasted my time and gave up several other job opportunities to work for them!
bad,"Poor management skills, they often break labor laws. Operators are exposed to deadly chemicals the pay does not reflect that.  Poor pay, treated poorly.  Avoid working here unless you absolutely have to."
bad,"Trust no one, cut throat environment.  Management is promoted because they have been there a long time not for skills and leadership qualities. Site is old and run down.  Needs a major facelift.  Dirty and dangerous."
bad,"Good compensation and the schedule of work is on a day shift."
bad,"1.  Weak management that disciplines everything instead of working with employees to earn trust."
bad,"A lot of politics, micro management, lack of training. Decent benefits, nice work-space, holidays/time off, unethical treatment of employees."
bad,"As an operator work a minimum of 48 hours in a week, for most of the year. Typically due to working 6 days in addition to forced overtime to cover other shifts. The management is terrible and do not take operator knowledge into consideration and there is a major lack of respect between management and the operators in the plant. Hostile work environment that includes bullying by supervisors and peers."
bad,Get rid of management and the company will run smooth. Fire all the workers on 1st shift and work will actually get done.
bad,salary and benefits were great
bad,"Overall poor leadership at the company. Office morale is low and senior leadership/HR have no desire to survey employee engagement. Company is driven by financials and Wall Street more than any company in my past. There is great potential with many great employees and opportunities for improvement, but people are ground down by long hours and minimal appreciation."
bad,"Wow were to begin, first off they don't have a proper way of training personal they give you a couple of days with a worker and then leave you by your self to learn the rest then if you don't do your work right the foreman yells at you for not doing your job right. Also you have to eat by the equipment to continue production which is covered with powder that comes off the equipment last thing also all the equipment leaks or has something wrong with it."
bad,Management is jealous of the prosperity of the workforce and doesn't care about anything other than getting their bonuses. I am frequently force to perform services I do not get compensated for. There is absolutely no communications between management and employees. Managers may know how to manage but have no knowledge of how to lead!
bad,Management has old school mentality.  Suggestions to get management to the current culture is shot down. Went to upper management for support but nothing happened.
bad,"working long hours alone in a warehouse full of chemicals.Feel and got hurt several times,but noone there to help me.No unch time since you worked alone in the warehouse"
bad,"long standing company with good values and management "
bad,"The Shift work is tough on the body, you will be forced to work long shifts and your off days. if you have something to do that day, management has an oh well attitude. The union is a joke and controlled by the company. "
bad,"Stressful, lack of adequate training, poor management, do more with less culture, poor work/life balance. High turn over rate. Management will throw you under the bus rather than advocate for you."
bad,"Pay is very good. Went to see my sleep apnea doctor,told  him  my schedule in FCC ADD and the doctor told me that my schedule is the most INHUMANE schedule that he has ever heard of.End of story."
bad,Testeing of products. limited growth. hardest part of the job is when almost all projects get given to one person even though other lab technician have less or nothing on their plate
bad,business has completely changes and has been whittled down to a shell of it's former self.  They are now named different companies and were broken up to different companies.
good,I didn't like the environment.  Difficulty getting there with the red line constantly late. No real training on software from management.  No room to advance.
good,"Clima aziendale negativo, instabilità lavorativa. Realtà americana che tipicamente accentra le proprie ideologie su se stessa. Poca attenzione verso i propri collaboratori, sia dal punto di vista dell'ascolto che del confronto. Certamente un colosso nel settore delle costruzioni, più negli USA che nel resto del mondo"
good,"I am an advocate of process and controlling outcomes, but at a point, it just goes too far, but chemical engineers are quite happy. However, this approach stifles employee creativity and keeps an organization from being the best it can be."
good,"Just like any job, higher management doesn't know what a person actually does in a day until that person is gone.  Advances the people who have no clue on what to do and demote the ones who are the heartbeat of the company.  Morale kept getting worse as time went on."
good,"Grace will give great knowledge for persons just starting out in manufacturing. It is difficult to excel or get promotions. Benefits are good but the bonus structure is not. The best part of this plant is the people and how long everyone has worked here, it's like having another family."
good,"Productive but old school management. The money is good but taking the chemicals into your lungs day after day is not healthy,"
good,l like my job here. I had the opportunity to do both mecanical engineering and manufacturing engineering duties. The most fun part of the job was that I worked with R&D so I worked with a new product from the design aspect all the way into production. My coworkerds were fun we had a lot of comradre.
good,W.R. Grace was once a real force to reckon with but for more than a decade they can get their head above water with all the lawsuits and bankruptcy.  Employees are paranoid.
good,"Work is always a challenge, sometimes some management members make it so tedious, every day you will learn something new the union is useless"
good,"I am no longer working there.  It was a decent paying job that allowed me to work without supervision and also work as a team with others."
good,"Good company, but badly managed. Company filed fro bankruptcy and laid off hundreds of employees. Management structure was multi level which kept anything practical from advancing or taking place."
good,Oversaw the daily maintenance requirements. Repaired and/or replace equipment as need to ensure 100% effectiveness. not much room for advancement. The workplace culture was good but poor when management would not ask for inputs.
good,"At this company, me and several of my coworkers are cross-trained in various areas, so we are constantly busy performing multiple tasks.  I learned various aspects of quality control procedures and became familiar with laboratory techniques, including analytical testing of chemical standards and chromatography products.  There is very little supervision or contact with management, except during meetings or when something crucial needs to be addressed.  Though the co-workers may seem introverted at times, they are easy to get along with and provide assistance when needed.  The hardest and least desirable part of the job is trying to keep up with the workload during busy periods, especially now that the company has less employees than it once did several years ago.  The enjoyable part of the job are the outreach activities where the employees take some of their time to do charitable activities for some organizations around the local community."
good,"A typical work day at W.R. Grace is non-stop work.  This offered a fast pace environment, but often short term accomplishments were blurred by the firefighting.  This company is striving to improve and is a great place to work for the dedicated employee."
good,"This was a great learning opportunity for me.  I enjoyed the lab team and the dedication that had for the company.  "
good,A small office and warehouse to work in.the job schedule was not consistent. There was to much downtime.The drivers of the tanker trucks were good people.
good,Worked with non-scientific community in labs. No opportunities for advancement. Did not reward education.
good,"good pay, flexible working hours. depending on which business and which group you are working for. a great room to improve document management. A lot of senior scientists. Management varies from group to group depending on managers."
good,It was rollercoaster ride. Winters and summers you are outside with PPE on. Some days were better than others. Supervisor could done better job. Being up close with different dangerous chemicals was not fun. Safety was a big deal and I learned a lot
good,This employer was a very stressful place to work.  Always changing payroll systems. We had 3 payroll systems in 3 years. The most enjoyable part of the job was the closeness of the other employees in the department.  Also dealing with the employees of the company
good,"I like working for Securitas because it gave me an inside view on how security work is. Where I work, we ride around and make sure the plant is secure and we enter in chemical trucks."
good,Challenging Environment cost savings focused data integrity driven six sigma productivity with excellent benefits package and chance for advancement
good,Interesting products were made by WR Grace. I liked the size of the company. It was hard to find other opportunities within the company. The cafeteria is good.
good,There was not much advancement at the workplace but job work/life balance wasn't bad.
good,"A typical work day involves a large amount of multi-tasking in acquiring samples from the production line and running analyses on these samples back in the lab. These results are then used to determine if the product is within the specifications provided by our customers. If they are not, it is the PC technician's responsibility to to dictate changes that must be made to the process in order to produce a good product. In addition, there may be re-sampling testing that must be completed as well as stocking of the lab. All data collected as well as changes made to the process must also be documented in a computer database. The PC works in close conjunction with the operators, packers, and foreman of the plant and must be able to communicate effectively to them as well as analysts and supervisors. The most difficult part of the job is time management, as there is a very large amount of work to be done in a very constricted time frame. The most enjoyable part of the job is the varied interactions with people on the production team. Everyone has a different job to do and it is exciting to see how we all come together to make a great product for our consumers."
good,Most departments are very stable.  Global work environment where you will work with people from all over the world.  Most people are friendly and helpful.  Company that is slow to change.
good,Those who enjoy the culture stay for years. People stay for decades. Columbia location has a gym and onsite cafeteria. Both are top notch.
good,"Good - "
good,12 hour shift rotating days and nights (2-2-3). Job itself is actually good and operator brethren work well together. Middle management and higher have very poor communication issues and additudes towards wage roll personel.
good,"the Company has changed a lot, and  had major lay offs, and  was also sold, and  people for  bosses changed with the business needs. It would have been nice to have been part of the  new business since the  sale and  restructure of the company"
good,Grace had good compensation and benefits. They good products with a good leading position is many of their markets Management was stagnant. There was little movement between plants and little chance for advancement.
good,"W.R. Grace has a good work life balance and allows workers to get a variety of professional experiences. However, it doesn't have a lot of layers, so it is sometimes difficult to advance professionally."
good,Had to be able to lift 75lbs at any time. Learned to be multi-tasker. Co-workers were fun and easy going. Best part of this job was getting to go home after 12 hrs.
good," no added value and no proper management discussion ,"
good,"There are many places to work in the area, and one should really try to find the best fit. The people that one works with are the best part of any job. Great people will alway drive good processes and product. That may not always be the case where one works."
good,Great place to work if you want to stay in the industrial chemistry field. They have lots of instrumentation and the people are nice for the most part. Just do your job well and communicate effectively when anything goes wrong with a product. Let the manager know asap so that things don't get out of hand.
good,"W.R. Grace is a chemical company, but has many great opportunities within the entire company. As the facilities manager, I was given many responsibilities, but always had someone there to help me out."
good,"I was only employed there temporarily. The place had a large campus, so I got good exercise running errands. There may have been the possibility of becoming hired permanently, but no definite window was given, although it would have been a good introduction to the world of purchasing and logistics."
good,"Employees are hard working and caring about the business.  Not only did I have reports who directly or indirectly reported to me, but I had many friends there also.  A great deal of teamwork was used."
good,Know two days are the same its always something different and sometime challenging. One of the most important things is  safety and  attention to detail

good,It's a challenge and fun to work under diversified cultures across Asia while keep One company strategy.
good,Great company who is on the move.  We work hard and have a great team atmosphere.  Very collaborative and the company is eager to hear fresh innovative ideas.  Wish the work/life balance was a little more balanced. Great benefits.
good,I think that this place is a nice place to work.  At times the workload for 1 person can be overwhelming.  Yu must be very multi-tasked and able to handle several projects at once.
good,"It is a growing company, with a good supporting cast.  There is limited growth due to WR Grace headquarters being located in Cambridge, Massachusetts."
good,W.R Grace is a pretty good company all around.  W.R Grace has great benefit program and the match on the 401K is awesome.  The safety within W.R Grace is nottooken for granted within the plants.

good,Grace strives to be a premier specialty chemical and materials company. We provide innovative technologies and value-added products and services around the world to enhance the quality of life.
good,"Grace is a large company. Individual jobs, and management climate can vary with location. Overall...professional, paid well, demanded performance. Depended upon location, opportunities to advance. Some Grace companies are very old school, old product line. Some divisions are high tech, with new product lines. I found the Polyfibron Division, Lexington, Mass location to be a great place to work, but I had to travel too much which eventually led to my leaving. My first manager was super. My second boss was arrogant pompous narcissistic jerk with visions of god hood. Really bad."
good,"I was a consultant/temporary worker for about 6 months.  I worked in the technology depart, my responsibilities was testing a new email system.  I learned a lot and improved my technical writing skills"
good,The company is a very driven.  Ability to learn different aspects of other individuals jobs. I would recommend the company to those who are looking for that type of environment.
good,They tend to practice what they preach.  When they say that safety is first they mean it and I really appreciated it.  The are not always opportunities to advance but they tend to invest in their employees by furthering education within your field.
good,"Work as trainee  for almost six month is a big opportunities be as a part of team members that supportive and knowledgeable. Everyday is a new challenge and a solid foundation for learning. The colleagues and  director of the company is very friendly, personable and has an open door policy for all team players. The owner knows all the employees who assist in carrying out the mission statement."
good,It is a good place to work for.  There was a gym on site for employees.  The benefits offered by the company were very good (401K matching 6% + pension).
good,Great place to work and afforded many opportunities for advancement. Had flexible work schedule and location.  A very aggressive approach to MD&A activity.
good,"As an employee not at corporate headquarters it may seem difficult to be part of the GRACE culture with a feeling of not being ""engaged"".  I question some policies as being short sighted and the long term vision not being shared with front line employees."
good,me gusto lo mas dificil es el desarrollo de nuevos proyectos a resistencia a cambio
good,"WR Grace provided its employees with opportunities for professional growth.  In addition, the firm actively developed its employees to obtain more responsibilities."

good,Numerous opportunities over last few years to expand my responsibilies and to take advantage of career advancement under good team of leaders.
good,I worked in a start up sales and marketing campaign for a product that had great potential but because of the economy and the company being in a chapter 11 status a second company layoff occured and unfortunately my job was comprmised. But I did feel we had an excellent sales / technical and scientific management team in place when I was there..
good,"Great opportunities for personal advancement. Work/Life balance very important to company. Leadership was open to listening to employees.  Many employees had worked at the location for over 20 years, turnover was very low."
good,I was able to get a lot of relavent work experience while attending Graduate School in the area.  A little chaotic at the time I was working there.  The company was in the process of splitting.
good,The company was ran efficiently and productively throughout the year. There was very few complaints regarding management and  the moral throughout the company.
good,"My overall experience with Grace has been very positive. The job is challenging and engaging, and there are daily opportunities to learn and expand your skill set. The company often offers excellent training and enrichment options, but those training sessions are often located at central locations such as the company headquarters in Columbia, MD or in Chattanooga, TN. This sometimes makes it difficult for those seeking such training, as plant locations are worldwide and it may be difficult to travel so far on short notice."
good,It was a very challenging experience. I have applied the different techniques in method and time standardization thought in the university.
good,"Company well defined, many locations around the world. Pay is average not much incentive in R&D at technician level. Good job to start out of college."
good,"Having a nice team worker"
good,"Working at Grace's research center is an ever changing challenge, no two days are the same. The stimulating atmosphere requires an individual to be flexible and learn many skills. It never gets boring. Over my years at Grace I've grown through countless stretch objectives. These objectives were set by my managers as well as myself. The research center is a fun place to work with top notch scientist and technicians."

Good communication with co-wrkers. Keeping insert repaired to meet production demands. Improving mold availabity.
good,I worked at W. R. Grace during my senior year at Howard University. Though the drive was long it was well worth it. Being able to work for such a large and old company going through so many changes helped me refine my skills.
good,In general - W R Grace is a good company No bad experience In most part fun to work Flex hours etc. Free environment Since Edison was a small site not much interaction with upper management

good,"Very busy roll. Phoning customers to chase outstanding and late payment."
good,"I learned how to become a young professional while at W R Grace. I was mentored by the best to use unique combinations of business management and laboratory technical skills in the workplace. The culture was fast paced but fun. I learned to adapt quickly by combining innovative technology with solid business principles daily. The hardest part of the job was not to take anything personal. It forced me to become a skilled analyst with strong organizational and communication abilities. I can work with anyone and use proven leadership qualities to reach deadlines.I grown to be an effective manager with skills necessary to direct, train, and motivate staff to fullest potential."
good,The management was typically populated with longtime people who were not educated diploma wise to be in the position being held. This allowed for poor advancement of the folks who were educated because the managers did not understand their degrees of the people they were in charge of.

Grace corporation was efficient, effective, and humane!  The hardest part of the job, besides the travel (the audit team tended to ""live out of our suitcases"") was in trying to persuade management that certain procedures should be done differently than the way that they were being done.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the analytical work and the interviewing of personnel. The audit teams that I worked with were a great group of people.  When I was promoted to Pension Analyst, I missed the interpersonal contact involved in Internal Audit."

good,"Working from home gives you the flexibility in your schedule. They supply a company car, cell phone and laptop. Must be a self-starter and highly motivated to work independently. Fun part is helping others and developing long term relationships. The long sales cycles make the position more about account maintenance than new sales growth."

good,"I checked in boxes,loaded trucks , ran the fork lift and cleaned the warehouse."
good,WR Grace was a great company to work for they gave you a great opportunity to advance in the company. There wages were fair and health and retirement was fair. If I could I would work for them again. The worker and management was great. The hardest part of the job was to keep people from other companys that came to grace to be safe. The most enjoyable part was working with good people and management
